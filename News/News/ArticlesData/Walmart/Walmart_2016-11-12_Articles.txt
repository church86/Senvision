MUMBAI: The Indian unit of the world's largest retailer, Walmart Stores, posted a 7% rise in revenue and narrowed losses in consumer goods market that saw decade low sales growth. Walmart India posted sales of Rs 3,996.8 crore for fifteen months ended March 2016 compared to Rs 2,991 crore during twelve months ended December 2014. While sales grew 34%, the company grew 7% on annualised basis. Losses declined from Rs 232.2 crore to Rs 140.4 crore in the same period. The company opened one store after a gap of more than two years to take its store count to 21. The new store opened in Agra was also its first after becoming a fully-owned subsidiary of Walmart Stores Inc. "We are excited with this continuous progress and our contribution to the Indian economy through job creation, supporting 'Make in India' through local sourcing, supporting women entrepreneurs, small and medium enterprises, start-up entrepreneurs and farmers," said Krish Iyer, CEO of Walmart India, where more than 95% of goods sold are locally sourced. "Through our growing footprint in the country, we will continue to grow our business profitably while contributing to the growth & prosperity of the nation." About three years ago, Walmart agreed to buy Bharti's 50% in their wholesale business that operated Best Price Modern Wholesale stores and terminated franchise and supply agreements related to almost 200 EasyDay retail stores. With the joint venture getting dissolved, Walmart now sells goods only to traders, institutions and kiranas. The termination of supply agreement with EasyDay stores affected overall sales a year ago, when its revenue dipped 32%. Most wholesale operators are bullish on expansion - rival Metro AG, which had not been able to capitalise on its first-mover advantage, wants to double wholesale stores in the country to 50 by 2020. While latest performance isn't available, Metro Cash & Carry India incurred a loss of Rs 142 crore on a turnover of Rs 3,439.9 crore for 2013-14. Walmart too announced it would add 50 stores in the next 4-5 years in India after store expansion was put on hold until August 2015 amid an ongoing internal probe to check if its local unit had violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. While organised wholesalers that sell merchandise to local kirana stores, hotels and catering firms operate in 12 states; Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra contribute half the sales. Soft drinks (12%) dominate the channel in terms of value within the CPG space, followed by toilet soaps (9%) and washing powder (8%), according to a Nielsen report last year. With at least four players, Walmart, Metro, Bookers and Reliance —operating 92 cash and carry stores, nearly 2.6% of traditional trade in all consumer product goods (CPG) moves through organised wholesale. The Rs 6,800 crore market has been growing at 13%, faster than modern trade, albeit on a lower base. In 2015-16, sales growth of consumer goods slowed the most in about a decade, suggesting that Indians cut spending — especially on discretionary products — due to high inflation and a sluggish economy.

Smucker stocks are all set for big moves over the next few trading days. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Nov 13, 2016 at 12:00PM Stocks rose by a wide margin last week, despite a surprising result in the U.S. presidential election that originally sent markets plunging. By the end of the week the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) had gained over 5% to reach a new record high. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) added 4% to bring its year-to-date gain to 6%. ^DJI data by YCharts. In the week ahead, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) shareholders are likely to see big moves in their investments tied to fresh earnings reports. Wal-Mart's customer traffic Wal-Mart posts its earnings results before the market opens on Thursday morning. The world's biggest retailer is outperforming the market so far this year on evidence that its sales growth rebound is gaining steam. At its last quarterly check-in, Wal-Mart beat management's forecast for comparable-store sales gains as it enjoyed its seventh consecutive quarter of increasing customer traffic. That improvement, plus decent results on the e-commerce side, helped sales tick slightly higher despite an almost 3-percentage-point headwind from currency changes. Image source: Wal-Mart. Consensus estimates call for similarly weak growth this quarter, with revenue rising 1% to $119 billion. Profits should decline to $0.96 per share from $0.99 per share a year ago as the company continues to invest in improving the shopping experience through initiatives like higher employee wages and cleaner store designs. Management will be happy to take that minor profit decline so long as it produces higher shopper satisfaction heading into the all-important holiday shopping season. Cisco's profit margin Networking giant Cisco will announce earnings numbers after the market closes on Wednesday. And, with the stock up 15% so far this year, expectations are high heading into the report. Investors have good reasons to be bullish -- especially on profits. While sales haven't budged over the last 12 months, Cisco produced 21% higher earnings over that time as cost cuts flowed directly down to the bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. The company's diverse portfolio also showed its strength recently, as declines in the service provider video and NGN routing areas were completely offset by gains in other places like switching and collaboration. CEO Chuck Robbins and his team forecast that sales will tick up by 1% this quarter as non-GAAP gross margin weighs in at about 64%, or just ahead of last quarter's 63% mark. Investors can expect management to highlight the fastest-growing areas of its networking business on Wednesday in addition to its hefty cash generation. Cisco delivered nearly $9 billion to shareholders in the last fiscal year, mostly through dividends, and that figure should rise by a healthy margin in fiscal 2017 -- assuming Cisco can navigate its biggest growth challenges. Smucker's pet food sales J.M. Smucker, the company behind consumer food brands such as Jif peanut butter and Crisco vegetable oil, hopes to get back to its winning ways with results this week. The stock has pulled far back from the record high it reached just before its late-August earnings report revealed worrying growth trends. Smucker's big push into the pet food market has been a challenge so far, for example, as the segment suffered lower volume. Its coffee business also slowed down from its awesome growth pace thanks to falling costs that track the declines in coffee bean prices. As a result of those and other challenges, executives lowered their full-year sales growth target and now see revenue declining slightly for the 2017 fiscal year rather than holding steady. Investors will likely get an update on that projection this week. They'll also find out whether Smucker's still believes it will produce $1 billion of free cash flow and as much as $7.75 per share of adjusted earnings in fiscal 2017.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Black Friday Not Dying Because Of 4K TV Deals Posted: Nov 13 2016, 4:41am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 13 2016, 8:13am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links. Photo Credit: Getty Images   The Black Friday sales event is aging, but it doesn't get old and it is far from dead. When the first signs of the Holiday season appear, reports appear that say that Black Friday is dead. It is an annual tradition to trash Black Friday before it is showing its face. The argument is that consumers can get deals all year round because of online shopping. This is just not true as demonstrated impressively this year by the Black Friday deals on 4K TVs. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals Black Friday 2016 advertise 4K TV deals including a  $199.99 for a 49-inch 4K Smart TV, $249.99 for a 50-inch 4K Smart TV and $298 for a 55-inch 4K Smart TV. Last year the lowest priced 4K TV in Black Friday ads was a $399.99 55-inch Element 4K Smart TV. All bargain doorbuster TV deals below $300 have been on 1080p TVs. When this year was a 49-inch Toshiba 4K Ultra HD Smart TV on sale for under $200? Right. never. This Best Buy Black Friday doorbuster deal will be very hard to get, as well as the other two mentioned 4K TV doorbuster deals announced by Target and Walmart. These three standout Black Friday 2016 deals are though by far not the only Black Friday 4K TV deals. The deals are across the whole range of 4K TVs beginning with bargain 4K TVs, mid-range 4K TVs, HDR 4K TV and high-end OLED 4K TVs. Find deals in the list of 4K TVs advertised by Target, Walmart and Best Buy for Black Friday. There are already many HDR 4K TVs on sale now in early Black Friday sales. On Saturday, the Sam's Club 1-Day Black Friday sale sold out the advertised 4K TV deals before noon. The demand for 4K TVs is already high 10 days before Thanksgiving, when most Black Friday sales begin. The Consumer Technology Association estimates that consumers will buy 4.5 million 4K TVs during the Holiday season. Black Friday offers again big deals, but not all are easy to get and deal hunters need to put the work in. The Sam's Club sale yesterday was easy to shop, as long as shoppers either stayed up late or got up early in the morning. On Thanksgiving Day, sleeping in is not an option to score the best Black Friday deals that will be on sale online. To get the in-store only Black Friday 2016 doorbuster, deal hunters need to invest hours lining up at stores before the doors open for the Black Friday sale. Ideally they are organized in family and friends teams to be able to score all the deals they want. Deal hunting on Black Friday was never easy, but it pays off.  In past years, Walmart made it easy to purchase select doorbuster deals with the 1-Hour Guarantee promotion. This year Walmart is not offering this short cut to doorbuster deals. Walmart shoppers need to line-up early enough to score a wristband for the doorbuster deal of their choice. Best Buy has the same wristband system for its doorbuster deals including the $199.99 4K TV doorbuster. The best chance to score doorbuster deals online that are advertised as in-store only is on Amazon. The giant online retailer has in the past matched the most popular doorbuster deals of Best Buy, Target and Walmart with similar online deals.

Tucked in the back of the store, the desk was often hidden by a huge line of shoppers with carts full of stuff – especially around the holidays. For a long time, layaway was seen as a smart way to save up the money for Christmas gifts. If you didn’t have the cash to shop early, layaway let you select items when you were ready then pay for your gifts over several weeks or months. Most stores asked you to put a deposit down equivalent to a certain percentage of your basket, say 10%. That way, you had some “skin in the game” and were less likely to leave your layaway to rot. Once your layaway was stashed away in the back of the store, you would stop in to make monthly payments whenever you could. Eventually, you would pay down your bill and take your items home. And boy, those were the days. Of course, layaway still exists; it’s just a lot less prevalent and not always offered year-round. At Walmart, for example, layaway season starts in September and ends in mid-December. Other stores like Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory, Toys ‘R Us, and Kmart still offer some type of layaway plan for customers at least part of the year. Why We Choose Credit Card Debt Over Layaway Still, it’s not nearly as common to hear of a family member or friend who uses layaway in 2016. Nope, today’s shoppers are more likely to charge their purchases to a credit card and worry about how they’ll pay later. Why the seismic shift in how we shop? In my opinion, it’s all about instant gratification. Where layaway forced you to save up for what you wanted and make payments all along, credit cards allow the opposite. With a credit card, you can have what you want now, and then worry about how you’ll pay. You don’t have to wait, nor do you have to save up a dime. You just walk in the store and take what you want, then pass the buck to the “future you.” Unfortunately, the “buy now, pay later” mentality has become the American way. A recent analysis from Value Penguin shows average credit card debt for households who carry a balance rang in at $16,048 while average consumer debt across all households was $5,700. Meanwhile, households with the lowest net worth (zero or negative) reported an average of $10,308 in credit card debt. These huge debts we carry aren’t the exception; they have become the norm. In 2016, it’s perfectly normal to finance everything you buy – and not just your home. These days, you’re almost expected to finance your car, your clothing, and even your smartphone. Unfortunately, we pay for the privilege of borrowing dearly – and not only in interest payments, but in the stress debt adds to our lives. Why I Miss Layaway Is layaway a complicated way to pay for your holiday gifts? Yes. But was it a smart way? I certainly think so. For starters, layaway forces you to understand exactly how much you’re spending on the holidays. And since layaway orders had to be paid off before you could take your stuff home, you were forced to spend within your means. Second, layaway didn’t let you enjoy your purchases right away. Instead, you had to endure the arduous task of paying your entire bill off first. In that respect, it forced you to delay gratification and the joy that comes with buying something new. Lastly, using layaway forced you to plan. To successfully use layaway to fund Christmas, you had to shop for your holiday purchases months ahead and make sure you could afford to pay your gifts off before the holidays hit. This represents a huge difference from the way people shop for the holidays now. I mean, why save money ahead of time when you can shop last minute and charge everything to your credit card, whether you can actually pay for it or not? Related: How Much Could You Save for the Holidays if You Started Saving Now? How to Create a Last-Minute Layaway Plan I didn’t use layaway this year, and I’m not entirely sure any of the stores in my area offer it anyway. Still, I cobbled together my own holiday layaway plan in the form of a targeted savings account I opened this past summer. And ever since then, I’ve stashed away a few hundred bucks per month to reach the $800 I wanted to save before December 1st hit. While it’s definitely nearing crunch time for holiday shopping and saving, here’s how you can do the same: Figure out how much you should spend on the holidays. The National Retail Federation reports that the average consumer will spend more than $900 on holiday gifts this year. Hopefully, you can spend a lot less. To figure out where you stand, create a list of people you need to buy for and assign each a dollar amount. Tally up your list to figure out a grand total for your holiday shopping list. Look for ways to save. If your list is bigger than you can reasonably afford, finding ways to save is your best move. Determine whether you can opt out of any specific gift exchanges and ask family members if you can skip gifts this year. Also consider making some homemade gifts instead of buying everything at the store. Start setting money aside every week. Even though you don’t have a lot of time, you can still save up a reasonable amount before the holidays if you start right now. Start saving as much as you can weekly or on paydays. Plan to shop right before the holidays – or shop as you find the best deals. As you get your last-minute layaway plan underway, you can decide how to move forward. The way I see it, you can either a) wait until you have as much money as you’ll be able to save before you shop, or b) scour ads for the best prices and “shop as you go.” With Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and plenty of other huge sales coming up, it might make sense to take advantage of the best deals as you find them. Do the best you can, but don’t be too hard on yourself. It sucks when you can’t afford to buy for everyone on your list, but it’s not the end of the world. A handwritten card can tell the people you love how you feel without costing much at all, and most people don’t really expect a gift anyway. If someone is disappointed this year, they’ll just have to get over it. When it comes to your financial health, you have to put yourself first – holidays or not. The Bottom Line Layaway might be fading away, but that doesn’t mean we can’t learn something from it. While it isn’t the easiest – or more convenient – way to shop for the holidays, layaway did help people stay out of debt. If you want to avoid debt this year, the time to start saving is now. Stash away as much money as you can weekly or on payday. You might have to make a few cuts to your holiday budget, but you still have time to do the best you can. While buying less may not be ideal, it’s a whole lot better than starting a brand new year with a pile of credit card debt.

All that bonding can really build up an appetite — and your grocery bill. Family gatherings can be stressful even if you don't have to plan for, purchase and cook a big holiday meal. On average, American families spend more than $50 on a single Thanksgiving meal for 10, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s 30th annual informal price survey. That's more than twice as much as they spent in 1987. Oh, plus the cost of turkey is up, and the canned pumpkin supply is short — two facts that could put additional stress on this year’s food budgets. Luckily, holiday hosts have cost-saving options if they visit the right stores. Here are some of the best holiday dinner deals that won't land you in the poorhouse. 1. Walmart Grocery items account for 56 percent of Walmart’s sales, so it's not surprising that the superstore consistently runs discounts on many items — including holiday dinner ingredients. Right now, you can get 50 cents off a Hungry Jack Mashed Potato product of any size. Walmart also price matches competitors — even online stores — so if you find a great holiday dinner deal somewhere else, you can ask for the same price. Not every Walmart store honors in-store price matching, though. In fact, the company recently cancelled in-store matching for 800 stores. So, you should ask the manager of your local store before you spend time comparison shopping. 2. Target Target is another large retailer that has jumped into the grocery game. The prices aren’t as low as Walmart or Aldi, but the store often runs deals on popular holiday meal items, such as turkey, stuffing, potatoes and canned goods. See: The Worst Things to Buy at Walmart and Target Coupon expert and author Jill Nystul uses Target Cartwheel digital coupons and gift card promos to score ultra-low prices on groceries — she purchased an entire Thanksgiving dinner for six to eight people for $24.32. Right now, if you choose the home delivery option for a Target online purchase, you can get a $5 to $200 gift card back, depending on what you buy. There are also coupons for $4 off Seattle’s Best Coffee, $2 off Stouffer’s Slow Cooker Starters, $1 off Finlandia Creamy Gourmet Cheese and $1.50 off Knudsen Sour Cream or Cottage Cheese. 3. Aldi Aldi’s prices are low enough to rival even consumer-favorite Trader Joe’s as one of the best cheap grocery stores. The retailer keeps costs down by offering mostly generic, in-house brands and limited sizes and varieties. Recently, Aldi featured holiday meal deals such as Appleton Farms Ham for 89 cents a pound, smoked turkey for $1.99 a pound, russet potatoes for 15 cents a pound, Brussels sprouts for $1.29 a pound and yellow onions for 69 cents a pound. Aldi can also be a source of hard-to-find items, as the holiday season heats up. “There’s a national canned pumpkin shortage right now, so I went to Albertsons to stock up, but they were out of small cans," said San Diego food blogger Michelle Sybert. "Aldi had them for under a dollar — just 89 cents per can.” 4. Sprouts Sprouts Farmers Market is one of the cheapest national grocery chains — especially for produce and meat. You won’t find many name-brand items, but there are often great deals on bulk-bin products, such as spices, nuts, dried fruits and grains. Customers love to shop there on “Double Ad Wednesday” because sale prices for both the current week and previous week are still valid. Recent deals include house-made sausage for $2.99 a pound, grass-fed beef for $5 a pound and thick-cut bacon and seafood at low prices. 5. Trader Joe’s You’re not going to find whole turkeys, but if you love pumpkin-flavored foods during the holidays, Trader Joe’s is the place to be. The retailer offers a 30-ounce pumpkin cheesecake for $6.99, a gluten-free pumpkin bread mix for $3.99 and low prices on whole pumpkins. Money-saving expert Kate Hamernik gets whole pumpkins at her local Trader Joe’s and makes her own pumpkin pie mix. “I bought several pumpkins at Trader Joe’s just last week for about $3 a piece," she said. "I put it in the crock pot and use it in all kinds of recipes — it’s so much cheaper than canned pumpkin.” 6. WinCo WinCo is another small grocer that’s giving the big guys a run for their money. In fact, a Time Money article listed it as one of America’s cheapest supermarkets in the West. Last holiday season, the company promised to beat any nearby competitor’s price on Thanksgiving turkeys — as long as minimum purchase requirements were met. The store isn’t running any holiday meal savings online yet, but you can still score deals early, such as $1 off Hormel bacon toppings and $1 off Pepto-Bismol, for the holiday dinner recovery. WinCo also takes manufacturer coupons, and you can combine those with sales and rebate app promos, like those from Ibotta, for even more savings this holiday season. 7. Boston Market Boston Market is known for its home-style cooking, so it’s a popular place for holiday fare. This year, for $13.49 a person, you can get the Boston Market Premium Buffet, which comes with an entrée of your choice, three sides, cornbread, cranberry walnut relish and an assortment of pies to make your holiday dinner complete. There is also a Deluxe Buffet option for $11.49 per person, which comes with an entrée, two sides, cornbread and pies. You can even create your own buffet starting at $10.29 a person. There is a 10-person minimum to order — and the food comes cold — so give yourself extra time to heat things up at home.

This summer they stood together, attending a wedding only made possible by the extraordinary aftermath of the crime and the filming of a documentary about it. Sean Clifton chats with Julie Bouvier at his son's wedding this August.  (Patrick Doyle / For the Toronto Star)   By Alex BallingallNews Sat., Nov. 12, 2016 Sixteen years after Sean Clifton tried to kill Julie Bouvier, he sat fidgeting on a hotel room couch, waiting for her knock on the door. The hands that drove a knife six times into Julie’s body now pawed at a plastic water bottle. His mind, once clouded with schizophrenic delusions, now buzzed for the words to tell her he’s sorry. The almost-killer hunched forward in his best suit and tie, his face pinched into the wounded look he wears so often, with something timid, something bashful, behind his eyes. A sound boom hovered above his head, but Clifton didn’t seem to notice. He also wasn’t preoccupied with the tripod-mounted camera that was trained on his face. I observed from the kitchen, out of the shot, as Clifton looked at the man who directed the scene from a green plastic chair: an Emmy Award-winning documentarian named John Kastner. “You’re the boss,” Kastner told him. “Say whatever it is, from your heart.” Clifton, 48, blinked and said “OK” in a cadence that evoked Eeyore, the glum donkey from Winnie the Pooh. Article Continued Below Kastner smiled at him. “Not to worry,” his voice chimed. “Que sera, sera.” ▶ Sean Clifton talks about his nerves before meeting the woman he stabbed. It would be the climactic scene of Kastner’s second movie about Clifton. The first, 2013’s NCR: Not Criminally Responsible, centred on his random attack of Julie at a Walmart in Cornwall, Ont., in October 1999. Clifton was found “not criminally responsible” for the stabbing, because of mental illness, and was held at an institution in Brockville until 2008, when he was released under supervision in the community. Julie and her parents also featured prominently in the first movie; it showed how they managed to understand and forgive Clifton, and even came to support him in his recovery. But while her parents met Clifton during the first doc, it wasn’t until now — for the sequel — that Julie was ready to see him. He had yearned to say sorry since the early months of his treatment, when guilt first pierced the fog in his mind. On this sunny August afternoon in downtown Ottawa, as Julie approached and steeled herself to hear her stabber’s apology in front of Kastner’s cameras, Clifton finally had his chance to repent. It was the climax of the story, yes, but as Kastner breathlessly explained while I observed the making of the documentary this summer, there was so much more to tell. Primarily, there was Jon McMahon, who sat a couch cushion away from Clifton and cracked his second Heineken of the afternoon. He was responsible for the sequel’s title: Not Criminally Responsible: Wedding Secrets. One secret was that McMahon is Clifton’s long-lost son, a shaggy-haired 31-year-old who decided to meet his biological dad after he saw the first doc. Another was that the decision to reconnect spawned an unlikely romance for McMahon: he was now engaged to someone with an intimate connection to both docs, and they would get married in three weeks beneath a gnarled tree in an Ottawa park, with the Bouvier family in attendance alongside Clifton — one big, happy NCR family. But first Clifton had to apologize. You could say the sum of his whole life was with him in the hotel room that day: the suffering and illness that led to violence; his years of treatment to get better; his confusion at the good that somehow grew from his horrible deed. All of it hung above this moment when he could say sorry, be forgiven, and maybe even forgive himself. I heard Kastner gently repeat to Clifton, “From the heart.” And Clifton, like Eeyore: “From the heart.” Three knocks on the hotel room door. Documentary maker John Kastner, left, chats with Clifton at the wedding. Kastner began filiming his first doc about the case years ago and just wrapped up the unexpected sequel.   (Patrick Doyle/FOR THE TORONTO STAR)   There’s a bridge in Cornwall that spans the tumbling mass of the St. Lawrence River. Clifton’s mother, Sheila, went there once when he was a little boy, and threatened to jump. He wasn’t with her but remembers the story because she told him she wanted to die. Fireworks crackled in the sky outside the Ottawa hotel as Clifton told me this story, the night before he was slated to apologize to Julie. He wore a green and blue striped T-shirt tucked into jeans that hugged his portly frame, with socks and Birkenstocks, and mirrored aviators that covered his eyes. His goatee and ponytail made him look a bit like the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons, but with no whiff of smugness or condescension. It was easy to forget this was a man that tried to kill a stranger. Clifton was born in Cornwall in 1968, the youngest of four brothers by about a decade. He said his mother was institutionalized for mental illness before he was born, but he didn’t learn that she stayed at the health centre in Brockville until Kastner’s associate producer, Nicole Rogers, dug up the information in her research for the film. His parents were very strict when he was a kid. “There was no acting mad,” he said. “It was just: yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir. And that’s the way it went with them until the day they died.” (Clifton said his parents died a year apart in the mid-1990s.) When he was 12, Clifton was sent to a children’s psych clinic in Kingston to be treated for depression. He stayed there five days a week over nine months. After the treatment was finished, when he was 13, Clifton’s parents enlisted him in the Army Cadets. He stood out for the meticulous care of his boots and uniform, but when he was sent to a leadership training course at the Canadian Forces base in Trenton, he flubbed the test that called for teaching younger cadets how to salute. He said he was too nervous to try. Later, in high school, Clifton met Dawne Mullin, a local girl who turned out to be the only girlfriend he’s ever had. She’s also the mother of Jon McMahon, who was born in 1985, when Clifton was 17. He can’t remember if he held his son back then, but he has an image in his mind of baby Jon-to-be sleeping in a crib behind the nursery’s glass window. He and Mullin decided it was best to give him up for adoption. “Just like Moses,” Clifton said, “just had to send him adrift for a while.” The next few years were the “high point” of Clifton’s life. He backpacked Europe and North Africa, taught English in Hong Kong, and enrolled in some college courses back in Cornwall. His big dream was to one day land a white-collar job. “How wonderful it would be,” he said, “to be leaning on a counter with a cup of coffee in my hand, having a normal conversation with somebody.” But he was his mother’s son. In Hong Kong, he found himself flirting with suicide on the subway platform. He even went up on the bridge in Cornwall, but just like Sheila, he didn’t jump. In time, Clifton said he was “crippled” by his mind. He developed tics and patterns that he needed to fulfil, a symptom of intensifying obsessive compulsive disorder. He couldn’t bear cracks in the sidewalk, and took to tiptoeing around town with his head bent forward, straight down like an ambling Quasimodo. And before leaving a room with a clock, he’d have to watch the second hand spin for several minutes. He was also convinced of a war, where the forces of his hometown conspired against him, and he stood alone on his own side of an unbreachable chasm. He called it “Cornwall versus Hippie.” Julie Bouvier was a 22-year-old pharmacy worker, engaged to be married, at the time of the stabbing.   (GEOFF GEORGE photo)   Julie’s father Andy Bouvier owned a furniture store on Cornwall’s Montreal Rd. back then. There were windows at the front, and Andy sometimes recognized Clifton for his distinctive gait as he passed outside. “He’d do the thing with his toes,” Andy said, recalling the careful way Clifton shuffled around. “He was known to everyone in town for walking like that.” On Thursday, Oct. 7, 1999, at the apex of his afflictions with depression, schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder, Clifton committed the seminal act of his life. He tried to kill Julie Bouvier. Around dinnertime, after a failed attempt to check into hospital, Clifton sauntered into the town’s Walmart and shoplifted a knife. Kastner’s first documentary detailed how Clifton fixated on the need to attack “the prettiest girl” he could find. Julie pulled into the parking lot. She was 22, a pharmacy worker who was engaged and excited to start a family. Clifton charged her as she approached the storefront doors. Wild-eyed and shouting, he repeatedly plunged the knife into her body. The blade missed Julie’s frantic heart by half an inch. Another strike passed close to her spine. Clifton cried out as Julie fell — “Die, bitch!” according to one account printed in the Guardian — and then stood trancelike above her as she bled at the Walmart’s threshold. He didn’t move until police came to arrest him. The Bouviers got the call around 7 p.m. Julie’s parents arrived at the hospital as she was being wheeled into surgery. They leaned over the gurney and her mom, Noella, whispered in her ear. “Everything will be fine.” She couldn’t tell if Julie was conscious. It took months, but Julie recovered. The following July, she got married as planned, and later had three children, just like she wanted. But Clifton still stalked her memory, a spectre that haunted her parents, too. Months after the attack, Julie went to the court hearing that eventually ruled Clifton was “NCR” for trying to kill her. “I didn’t know how close he’d be,” she remembered. “I said I’d never step foot in a courtroom again.” From then on, Andy took it upon himself to keep tabs on Clifton, who was sent 100 kilometres up the St. Lawrence River to the Brockville Mental Health Centre. Even on the night of the attack, when Julie was at the hospital, Andy asked her fiancé to drive him to the Walmart. There was police tape and blood on the ground. “If I had gotten my hands on him that night,” Andy said, “I probably would have killed him.” While he was institutionalized, Clifton had to attend annual hearings before the Ontario Review Board, a panel that follows each NCR patient’s progress and condition, and decides whether to soften the rules of confinement or proceed with eventual release. Andy attended each of Clifton’s hearings. He remembers once when Clifton stood up and claimed he was being treated unfairly. Andy was sitting directly behind him, and noticed that his own hand was clenched in a white-knuckle fist. “I didn’t understand mental illness at the time,” he said. “I was there for the protection of my family and to make sure he didn’t get out.” The Bouviers were Catholic, but about eight years ago, while still anguished by the stabbing, Noella and Andy tried a church for born-again Christians. They took a course there called “New Beginnings.” When it was finished they took it again, and then encouraged Julie to come to the new church, which she did a few times. The family also started researching schizophrenia and other mental illnesses to try to understand Clifton. In time, as Noella and Andy grew with their new faith and Julie focused on her young family, the Bouviers relinquished some of the ill will toward Clifton. “It showed us how to confront our emotions,” Noella said of her research and religion. “And believe me,” she added, “we had bitterness, resentment, anger, total un-forgiveness toward Sean.” Clifton was released from the institution around this time and allowed to live in Brockville under close supervision. Staff from the centre made sure he took his daily mélange of anti-psychotics, anti-depressants and pills for blood pressure and epilepsy. As he gained further control over his delusions, tics and paralyzing need to follow patterns, he moved into a home with other outpatients. Sean Clifton and his son, Jon McMahon, wait for the arrival of Julie Bouvier while filming a documentary in Ottawa in August. Clifton stabbed Bouvier in a random attack In 1999.  (Patrick Doyle/FOR THE TORONTO STAR)   Three years later, in 2011, Andy caught wind that there was a filmmaker that wanted to make a movie that featured his daughter’s stabber. By then he had accepted that Clifton’s release was inevitable, but he wasn’t entirely comfortable with it. He was lobbying his local MP for a bill to make it illegal for NCR patients not to take their medication. Andy went to see Kastner in Brockville. They spoke for a long time, and by the end of their conversation, Andy had agreed to appear in the movie himself. He went home and spoke with Noella, who jumped on board, too. And by the time filming had started, Julie decided to take part. Kastner called it a “classic two-hander” — Clifton struggling to recover, and the Bouviers grabbling with their anger. He decided to make an entire movie about it, and through the process of filming with Kastner, Julie and her parents agreed to extend their forgiveness to Clifton, though Julie was still unable to meet him. When the movie came out in 2013, it garnered a lot of attention from mental health advocates, lawyers and the media, with interviews touching on the delicate balance between the urge to see a perpetrator punished and the need for people with mental illness to receive proper treatment. “He’s a man who’s ahead of his time,” Andy said of Kastner. “People who wouldn’t probably seek help for mental illness — today they would. And it’s thanks to people like John Kastner.” In the years since, Andy and Noella have become advocates for people with mental illness, and were happy to hear that Clifton received an absolute discharge from the Ontario Review Board last year, meaning he is no longer under supervision and lives on his own in Brockville. Andy was even appointed to the board last March, and now participates in shepherding NCR patients back into society as functioning, independent people. Julie, meanwhile, broke her vow never to set foot in a courtroom again. With the trauma of her attack softened by her blooming empathy for Clifton, she goes there every day: she works as a court reporter in Cornwall. Sean Clifton with his son Jon McMahon and Jon's wife, Nicole Rogers.  (Patrick Doyle/FOR THE TORONTO STAR)   The Summer Olympics flickered without sound on the television behind the camera operator’s back. Jon McMahon stared at the screen, like a man concussed, sharing the couch with Sean Clifton: father and son, side by side, grasping for things to say to the cameras in the minutes before Clifton would meet Julie and apologize. McMahon turned to his dad and asked how he felt. “It’s not coming easy,” Clifton stammered. “I’m just going to say sorry … How do you make small talk with somebody you tried to kill?” McMahon grinned and raised his Heineken. “Here’s to a stab-free life?” Laughter subsided, and one of the film crew yelled out a 10-minute warning. The Bouviers were almost here. During a break, McMahon stood up, withdrew a pack of smokes and went out to the hotel room balcony. I followed him and shut the sliding door as he sparked a lighter and took his first drag. “Sometimes the conversation doesn’t flow,” he said. “I’m always worried about, how’s my tone? How’s this going to sound?” We both looked back into the room, where Kastner gesticulated and the film crew prepared to watch McMahon’s biological father, a man he didn’t meet until he was almost 30, apologize to a woman for stabbing her six times. McMahon’s lips curled into a smirk. “It’s a little weird,” he said. Growing up in Chesterville, a small town south of Ottawa, McMahon always knew he was adopted. So was his big sister. It was just a fact in his head. He found out about Clifton in his early 20s, after his biological mother messaged him on Facebook. He said he felt no inclination to meet Clifton, though he did connect with his mother, Dawne Mullin. He was fearful of how his adoptive parents would react. And there was the stark reality that this guy, his father, tried to kill somebody. His biology took on a new, sinister hue. “I was obviously concerned. Scared I guess, right?” McMahon said. “I became hyper-vigilant of my own thoughts… Is it just going to take this one thing and then I’m just going to snap?” Years passed, and then he heard about Kastner’s movie. One night, he watched it online with a buddy. His father’s face, before just a smudge in his mind’s eye, crystallized into Clifton’s face. And the thrust of Kastner’s film, the sympathetic portrayal of Clifton’s guilt and efforts to stay medicated, stirred in McMahon the desire to meet his biological dad. He had no idea what was coming. That night, after the movie, he emailed Kastner and told him he was Clifton’s son. He said maybe he could help Julie’s lingering unease with Clifton by coming forward, to underscore his humanity, that this guy was once in love and had a child. He also asked if Kastner thought Clifton could handle a reunion. Kastner showed the email to his associate producer, Nicole Rogers. The vivacious and keenly organized filmmaker from small-town Alberta had worked with Kastner on several movies in Toronto, and he trusted her deeply. “The letter was so moving,” recalled Rogers, now 29. “We couldn’t help but thinking, who is this guy? He’s so thoughtful.” Kastner invited McMahon to come meet the Bouviers at a screening of the movie at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Hospital on May 16, 2013. Rogers didn’t plan to go until she learned McMahon would be there. The letter had piqued her curiosity. She booked a train ticket at her own expense, found a room at a local hostel, and went straight to the screening. “His was the only back to me when I came in,” Rogers said. Then he turned around. In a note she later shared with Kastner, Rogers described seeing his blue eyes, just like Clifton’s, and his “sun-kissed wavy hair.” “Our eyes met,” she wrote, “and in those milliseconds I experienced the closest thing I can think of to describing love at first sight… This man I had just met, Jon McMahon, had come into my life like a ray of sunshine and I didn’t want to let go.” This wasn’t lost on McMahon. He felt the same grip when he met Rogers: he was immediately attracted to the young woman with blond hair who exudes warmth with an easy laugh and a ready smile. When McMahon told me the story of how he met Clifton for the first time, weeks later at a food court in Ottawa, it was like a footnote to his feelings for Rogers. He asked Clifton if she had a boyfriend. “I was enthralled,” McMahon said. “It was unlike any other experience I’ve had.” They started emailing and agreed to meet again. Then again. And again. Over time, she was able to help him understand his father, his illnesses and his dread and self-disgust with the knowledge of what he did. Rogers dropped her new life in Toronto’s documentary film world to move to Ottawa and be with McMahon, a part-time personal support worker who also goes to goes to university. Last spring, after they were engaged, McMahon and Rogers went for a bike ride. They pedalled into a lush park, and came upon a wooden bridge that crested a glassy stream dotted with lily pads and algae. On the other side of the bridge, a gnarled tree with a trunk like a golf cart stood on the muddy shore. Its thick limbs twisted in a leafy canopy above a clearing. This was where they would marry. But first there was a movie to shoot. This past August, in that hotel room in downtown Ottawa, Rogers stood in the kitchen, producer and film subject, with a microphone on her blouse and instructions from Kastner to bring snacks and champagne after Clifton apologized to Julie. A text message arrived. The Bouviers were downstairs. Kastner bounded across the room and said to McMahon, “They’re going to knock and you’re going to answer it. And don’t look at the camera! You’re going to answer it and que sera, sera!” Rogers whispered in the kitchen. “My heart’s pounding,” she said. “This is why I’m glad we’re doing this before the wedding!” Sean Clifton makes a toast with his son Jon McMahon, left, Jon's fiancee and documentary associate producer Nicole Rogers, second from left, Julie Bouvier, second from right, Julie's mother, Noella Bouvier, and Julie's father, Andy Bouvier, in Ottawa this summer.   (Patrick Doyle/FOR THE TORONTO STAR)   Three knocks on the hotel room door. Apprehension walloped around the suite as McMahon stood and strode to the hallway, a camera guy stutter-stepping in his wake. He pulled open the door and someone, I think Andy Bouvier, said: “Good to see you.” “Good to see you,” McMahon replied. I strained to listen, pen poised. Here they come … CUT! Kastner stopped the action and McMahon returned to the couch. John Westheuser, one of the principal camera operators, called through the door. “Count to 10, then knock!” A few seconds passed in silence. Three knocks on the hotel room door. Again. McMahon answered it and the greeting was repeated — “Good to see you.” “Good to see you, too.” The Bouviers entered, and Julie drifted toward the couch in a white blouse with an air of serenity. When I heard her speak, I wrote in my notebook: “sweetest, gentlest voice.” He didn’t hesitate. Clifton: Julie, there’s something I wanted to say for 16 years now, and that’s that I’m sorry for what I did to you that day in the Walmart parking lot. Julie: Tha-thank you very much for your apology. Clifton: I know I can’t make it all go away or make it like it never happened or anything like that. But I’m sorry. Julie: Sean, I know that I was there at the wrong place, the wrong time and you were very ill and I completely understand. And I’ve never held that against you. Clifton: Thank you. Julie: I’m very, very happy.” It took 66 seconds. Once the apology was out of the way, the intensity of the moment gave way to the warmth of a neighbourly, almost familial visit. McMahon chatted with Noella and Julie, Clifton and Andy talked about fishing bass near Cornwall, and Rogers waltzed in with tall glasses of champagne. Cameras rolled and Kastner smiled at the scene, soaking the moment. “Well,” Clifton said, “I’d like to make a toast. Here’s to Julie. May you live long and prosper.” Glasses clinked and Clifton, for the first time in his 48 years, took a sip of champagne. He told me later it was like an explosion in his mouth. It just went poof. Jon McMahon marries Nicole Rogers on Aug. 25, under a gnarled tree in Ottawa. Rogers was moved by the young man who emailed documentary maker John Kastner after watching his movie about his father.   (Patrick Doyle/FOR THE TORONTO STAR)   Elegant string music wafted from a speaker plugged into an iPad, as mosquitoes flitted in the August heat, landing on congregants in the clearing under the gnarly tree. Nicole Rogers floated across the wooden bridge and entered the clearing, radiant in a white dress with French braids in her hair. The crowd parted and she walked straight to McMahon, who stood under the canopy of branches and leaves, copiously perspiring in a grey, three-piece suit. Julie Bouvier stepped forward and snapped a photo on her phone. Andy and Noella were there, too, along with Kastner and his crew, documenting the denouement of their sequel. Before the ceremony, I drove to the park with Sean Clifton and a couple of the crew members. He said he could never imagine a day like this. “I never dared look this far in the future,” he said. “It wasn’t even a dream.” He stood at the back of the crowd in the clearing, somewhat stiff in his suit and aviators. Up at the altar, McMahon sweated and Rogers held his hands and they promised to love each other and share the journey of life together. ▶ Sean Clifton talks about his relationship with son Jon and his emotions looking back on how his life has changed. Later, there was a reception at a fashionable restaurant on Elgin St., where Kastner’s cameras crowded around a table near the window that had places for Clifton and the Bouviers. The newlyweds came over to chat with Andy and Noella, and Clifton stood up to hug his son. It was hard to hear what Clifton told him, but the microphone picked it up. “I love you.” Speeches were delivered, toasts were made and waves of laughter and happy conversation swelled through the room. In the midst of the action, Clifton poked at his food and stared at the tablecloth, his face blank — like he was alone in the togetherness. After dessert, Kastner brought him into a side room, where he sat in a chair beneath a stage light for a wedding night interview. When they were about to wrap up, Clifton woodenly declared he wanted to discuss “how all the people in that dining room are there because I violently attacked somebody.” Kastner, leaning forward, asked him to elaborate. “John, honestly — I don’t see much positive that came out of this disaster. I almost murdered somebody, and maybe we’d be better off if I hadn’t done it,” he said. “I’m sure we would be better off.” “But the fact is,” Kastner offered, “there would be no marriage tonight …” Clifton bristled. “Well,” he said, “I can’t really excuse myself because my son found a nice wife and some things have gone right.” The director was taken aback. After a few seconds, he said “cut” and Clifton left without fanfare in a cab to his hotel. Kastner said he’d never heard him talk with such pessimism about the wedding. He’d been proud and upbeat in other interviews. Everyone clearly wanted a happy ending, Kastner maybe most of all. But the only one to expressly deny it that night was Sean Clifton. He looked around the room, at his son and Rogers and the Bouviers, and he saw a tragedy narrowly averted. In his moment of redemption, was there really any closure at all? Earlier that day, I asked him about this; whether good that unfurls from the consequences of a horrible act can make it less bad. “I don’t know,” Clifton replied. “I’ll probably think about that for a long time.” Then his eyes softened and took on that wounded look. “I don’t think it does,” he said.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     How To Find NES Classic, Hatchimals, Pokemon Go Plus And New Nintendo 3DS On Black Friday Posted: Nov 12 2016, 3:45am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 12 2016, 11:20am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The most challenging Holiday gifts to buy this year have crystalized. Here is how to succeed buying them. Update: NES Classic now on sale by resellers on Amazon starting at $189. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals We have not seen anything like this in years. This Holiday season shoppers are faced with more gifts than ever that are hard to find due to high demand und extreme low supply. At the center of the shortage fiasco is Nintendo. The Japanese video game maker is not able to satisfy demand for the Pokemon Go Plus since months and has angered many fans yesterday with the bodged launch of the Nintendo NES Classic Edition console. Add to the misery the upcoming $99 New Nintendo 3DS Black Friday edition, which will likely cause fist fights in the Walmart Black Friday sale. Nintendo is joined by toy maker Spin Master. The company landed a surprise hit with the Hatchimals Eggs. Who knew that we are ready for a Furby again. It is still early and there are ways to buy the aforementioned hard to find holiday gifts at regular or sales prices. I have personally engaged in hunting down the released items in online shops like Hatchimals and NES, and it is very difficult. As soon as a NES or Hatchimals shows up in stock at a retailer, they are gone in seconds. Find below the best practices and links to have a fighting chance on buying a Nintendo NES mini, Hatchimals Egg, Pokemon Go Plus or New Nintendo 3DS. How to Buy Hatchimals Walmart is the only store that has advertised a Hatchimals Black Friday deal. Walmart will offer the $48.88 Hatchimals deal it is also already offering now in the Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale beginning on Thanksgiving Day. As reported, I managed to buy a Hatchimals in the Walmart online store for $48.88 last week. Read how I have succeeded in scoring the $48.88 Hatchimals deal. To get the $48.88 Hatchimals deal on Black Friday is likely going to be messy, depending how many Hatchimals Eggs Walmart is hoarding for the Walmart Black Friday sale in stores. Even if Walmart stores would have a whole transport container full of Hatchimals, they crowd would clean it out within a minute. Our recommendation is to try to find a Hatchimals in stock online before Thanksgiving. Prospectors have driven the prices of Hatchimals up to around $150 on the Amazon Marketplace. The MSRP of Hatchimals is $59.99. Read on to Find out more ways to find Hachimals. How to Buy Nintendo NES Classic The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. Right now all stores are sold out of the retro 80s TV gaming console. Even NES accessories are hard to come by. The in-stock notification on the Nintendo NES Classic Edition page on amazon.com is too slow for ultra-high demand items like the NES Classic. You need to use real-time stock tracker tools. Read our NES Classic buyer's guide to find out how. Resellers have started on the Amazon marketplace to offer the NES Classic starting at $189 plus $12 shipping. Other deals for the NES Classic on the Amazon marketplace are $250 and up.  The deals on Amazon's marketplace are more reasonable than on eBay. On eBay prices of the NES Classic are going crazy, some listing ask $13,000 for the $59.99 NES. I assume these sellers hope that Kanye West just absolutely wants a NES Classic now. The lowest offers are around $300 on ebay.com. These outragous prices might be the reason Amazon does not allow NES resellers yet on its marketplace. How to Buy Pokemon Go Plus The Pokemon Go Plus is the most frustrating to find as there is just no new inventory coming in. The $34.99 Pokemon Go accessory has been spotted in stock at amazon.com for 1 minute once last week. All other online stores that carry the Pokemon Go Plus had no stock. Nintendo initially promised new stock for end of October. That did not materialize. Resellers offer the Pokemon Go Plus for $100 on Amazon's Market Place. How to Buy $99 New Nintendo 3DS Nintendo announced a new special edition of the New Nintendo 3DS console for Black Friday 2016 for $99.99. The hand-held console does not come with a game at this lowest price in history of the 3DS. The $99 3DS will go on sale on Thanksgiving Day at Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, GameStop and more. The $99 New Nintendo 3DS will sell out as one of the first Black Friday items on Thanksgiving Day. The 3DS is a perfect Holiday gift for kids and at $99 a bargain. So far only Walmart is listing the $99 Nintendo 3DS online. Check if Amazon.com has started to list the new 3DS deal. The first big Black Friday 2016 Sale is underway on Saturday at Sam's Club.

 Walmart is kicking off Black Friday immediately — but there's a catch Hayley Peterson Nov. 10, 2016, 12:01 AM 65,405 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart is kicking off its Black Friday deals this week. AP Walmart just kicked off some of its Black Friday deals more than two weeks before the shopping holiday. But there's a small catch: the deals are available only to users of Walmart's app for now. The discounts available through the app include a Hitachi 65-inch 4K Ultra HDTV for $599 ($400 savings), an Xbox One S 500 GB Minecraft console with a bonus controller for $279 ($20 savings), and an Acer 15.6-inch Core i5 laptop for $299 ($150 savings). The rest of Walmart's Black Friday deals will become available to all customers online at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on Thanksgiving Day, the company said. The in-store event featuring "doorbuster" deals like $230 off a $628 Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV will kick off at 6 p.m. that day, which is in line with what the company did last year. Some industry experts have said the significance of Black Friday is diminishing as an increasing number of retailers start offering holiday discounts days and weeks before the shopping day. But Walmart's chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said Black Friday remained the biggest shopping event of the year. "We think it's still the biggest event in retail that customers get really excited about," he said Wednesday in a call with reporters. An employee adjusting a large ribbon on a television display at Walmart in preparation for Black Friday in Los Angeles in 2014. REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn In preparation for this year's demand, the retailer has increased its Black Friday merchandise by 50% on Walmart.com over last year. "I said it before and I will say it again: We will win the season on price — on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday, and every day before and after," Bratspies said. "That means delivering the Black Friday deals we're known for in stores, online, and on our app. And, we've secured significant availability of these items. We pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price and then only has a few available." Here's Walmart's top Black Friday deals that will be available in stores and online on Thanksgiving, according to the company: 11 Televisions including 4K Ultra HDTVs, such as a Phillips 55-inch Smart 4KTV for $298 (special buy) and a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV for $398 ($230 savings).

The Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad has just leaked, and we are back to tell you what you’ll want to watch for when it comes to mobiles. The Best Buy Black Friday ad was beastly, and the folks at Wallyworld are coming in at a close second at 30+ pages. The Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad is full of tech, toys and other wares which means there is a little something for everyone. We’re going to start with the mobile phone deals, of which there are plenty. That said, we would be remiss if we didn’t mention those 4K 50-inch TVs for $300 bucks. Good luck… Black Friday Apple deals usually aren’t all that great, let’s just be honest. This year things have improved a bit as the Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad has the iPhone 5s for $99 through Straight Talk while the 32GB iPad mini 2 rears its head again at $199. There are some Apple accessories and a $250 gift card offer through AT&T and Verizon on the new iPhone, but that’s about it. With Android, the choices are vast as usual. You can get the same gift card deal on a wide variety of Samsung branded handsets or opt for Straight Talk. They have the Galaxy Luna, Galaxy S6, and the Samsung Galaxy Sky up for grabs. AT&T has the Huawei Ascend XT on a prepaid plan for $49 and Big Red has the $49 Galaxy J3. Nothing crazy, but there are more deal hiding in the Black Friday ad. There are several deals with slates as well during the Walmart Black Friday sale. You can grab a 7-inch RCA tablet for $29 or the Samsung Tab E 7 lite for $49. Just don’t expect the world from those slates. The Lenovo Tab 3 10.1 is quite a bit better though, and is listed for only $99. Accessories include the Fitbit Flex 2 for $69, the Alta for $99 and the Fitbit Charge 2 for $129. The usual offers on media streamers, headphones and various other mobile goodies are present as well. Black Friday 2016 may not kick off for several more weeks, but that will not stop the onslaught of deals from coming. The Walmart ad is one of around a dozen we’ve seen this week, and we expect more to drop over the weekend. Rest assured, we will keep you in the loop on all the mobile Black Friday deals as we come across them.

Arkansas Blog Archives | RSS « Chris Christie will join Donald Tru…  |  Asa Hutchinson: "It's up to Arkansa… » Saturday, February 27, 2016 The Donald Trump show in Bentonville Posted By David Ramsey on Sat, Feb 27, 2016 at 12:08 PM Donald Trump, an insult comic with possibly fascist leanings who is the current GOP frontrunner for president, is holding a rally in Bentonville today. You can watch the livestream here. UPDATE: Trump (with an assist from Chris Christie) lobbed lots of insults at Rubio. They said he was a little guy with a little mouth and big ears who sweats a lot and never shows up to work. "I'm a strong guy," Trump said, explaining that he almost had to catch the tiny, fresh-mouthed Rubio because he thought he would faint. And so on.  "We gotta win Arkansas," Trump said. "Maybe I'll start shopping permanently at Walmart if we win Arkansas."  Trump barely talked about policy, other than to say that he wanted to change libel laws so that he could be more aggressive in suing the media if they dared to write mean stuff about him. Also this: "We should have a new Air Force One, it's very old." And you may have heard — he wants to build a wall along the Mexican border and make Mexico pay for it. Trump was much more interested in talking about the minutia of his personal finances and various pieces of pending litigation. On and on, like a drunk uncle over-sharing. Trump said that he might ask the judge handling the fraud case regarding his scam school, Trump University, to recuse himself. Trump mentioned the judge's ethnicity twice ("he's Hispanic, which is fine"). Later, Trump asked if there were any Hispanics in the crowd. Pointing, he said: "There's a Hispanic. In Arkansas, we have about three [Hispanics]. And that's okay." My real-time responses in the liveblog below (after the jump), including my confused conclusions about what Trump's fans want and the cult of personality that he projects.  LIVEBLOG:   The Trump plane has arrived. The cult of personality vibe of seeing his name in giant letters on a plane is, well, here you go:  click to enlarge Trump and Christie have arrived. Only half an hour late.  Christie says, "We need Arkansas to be big and strong for Donald Trump." Christie says that Rubio "doesn't work at all." Slams him for never showing up for Senate committee meetings. "Hey Marco, show up for work," he says. He says that Rubio has missed 80 percent of committee meetings. Does anyone care about this line of attack? I doubt it.  Christie to Rubio: "Unlike the U.S. Senate, president of the United States is not a no-show job, so you're not qualified." Missing senate meetings is kind of a meh attack, but I think the idea is to keep peddling the argument that Rubio is a lightweight who isn't ready. That might work with some older GOP based voters on the fence and Christie is a good surrogate to give some substantive heft to Trump's insult routine.  Christie on the debates: "When the pressure is on, Donald Trump fought like a man." By contrast, "You saw what happened to Rubio. He melted." Trump is a manly man and Rubio is a girly girl. This is the strategy that I guess works to rally the GOP base. So there you go. What a country.  Trump says politicians are "all talk, no action." He calls Rubio a "lightweight" — "little mouth on him, bing bing bing bing."  Trump: "I borrowed a tiny amount of money — I borrowed a million dollars." Trump talks about polls, a lot. He complains that we're losing and that companies are moving to Ireland ("Ireland!"). He says unemployment isn't 5 percent, like those weirdo statisticians at the Department of Labor say. Really, it's 25 percent.  "I will address little Rubio," he says. "This guy has a fresh mouth, he's a nasty guy." Trump says Rubio is an even bigger liar than Cruz.  Trump and Christie are obsessed with the debate in which Rubio awkwardly repeated himself. They've said various versions of the word meltdown a dozen times.  Trump's fascistic instincts: He says that when he's president, he's going to change libel laws so that he can more easily sue the media for stories they write about him. "We're going to open up the libel laws so we can sue the media and get damages. It'll be amazing how honest they become."  Trump says he's never seen a human being sweat so much as Rubio. "Thank God he has such big ears to catch all that sweat," he says. Trump says that Rubio was so sweaty and nervous, he thought he was going to faint. "I'm a pretty strong guy, I got ready to grab him," Trump says. "I thought he was going to go down."  Trump says that Rubio sweats so much it looks like he's just coming out of a swimming pool and Rubio puts on so much makeup it's like he's "putting it on with a trowel." These are stale jokes from yesterday.  Trump says that the reason that he's beating Rubio by 20 points in Florida is because Florida voters "can't stand the guy."  "We gotta win Arkansas," Trump says. "Maybe I'll start shopping permanently at Walmart if we win Arkansas." Trump's core message: "Politicians are never going to get you to the promised land."  He notes that he got into Wharton because he's so smart. He says he'll say crazy stuff as president. "They'll say it's unpresidential but I don't care," he says.  Trump is so much more comfortable talking about his finances and pending litigation than he is about policy or even politics. He loves talking about the micro-details, like, the statute of limitations on some legal fight over real estate or the labor market in Palm Springs or some sleazebag trying to shake him down over a casino deal or whatever. He just told a very convoluted story about some lawsuit he's fighting — honestly, I didn't follow the details — and said "this is more interesting than talking about trade." He's like a drunk uncle over-sharing. Trump just said he was before a judge "who's Hispanic, which is fine."  Later: "There's a Hispanic. In Arkansas, we have about three [Hispanics]. And that's okay."  Trump says "little Rubio" got a sweetheart deal on selling his house to a lobbyist.  "I'm so non-litigious, it's amazing," he says. Very little policy in this speech but at the end, Trump runs through a list: build a wall in Mexico, repeal and replace Obamacare, protect the Second Amendment, some incoherent stuff about trade. And change libel laws so he can shut mean journalists up. Plus this: "We should have a new Air Force One, it's very old."  Ted Cruz? He's a Canadian, Trump says. On the other hand, Trump says he likes General MacArthur and General Patton. Trump says "waterboarding is great, but we have to go stronger." Here is why I can never really understand what's going on in the GOP primaries, why I can never quite relate: So much of this stuff is about expressions of masculinity that have such a sad, sad, sad, sad "protest too much" feel to them that it's hard for me to take it seriously. If someone constantly talks about how tough and manly he is and how everyone else is not tough and manly enough, it's hard not to laugh. Because it's laughable. That's uncharitable, I know, but it's funny! My understanding of this Trump rally is that the wild fear and the deep crisis of masculinity runs so deeply for a subset of the GOP base that Trump's strongman routine registers not as a joke, not as a depressing late-night Vegas act, not as an overwritten SNL routine, not as creeping crypto-fascism — but as virile salvation.  click to enlarge Tweet Instapaper Share Favorite Saving… Comments (45) Email   Sort Oldest to Newest Newest to Oldest Most Liked Comments (45) Showing 1-45 of 45 Add a comment   Subscribe to this thread: By Email Subscribing… With RSS Showing 1-45 of 45 Comment Add a comment Subscribe to this thread More by David Ramsey Democrats' last stand in NE Arkansas Nate Looney vs. Rep.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Search on for family of man killed after electrical shock Sunday Nov 13, 2016 at 11:46 AM Nov 13, 2016 at 5:16 PM Staff Reports VICTORVILLE — A man who was shocked and suffered severe burns near a defunct Wal-Mart last month in an alleged effort to steal wiring has died. On Sunday, authorities were seeking his next of kin. Eric Hester, 33, died three days after he was found Oct. 11 in the wee hours of the morning by a Southern California Edison employee who was responding to a notification that a transformer was down in the 15000 block of Bear Valley Road. The SCE worker called authorities after finding Hester lying near the transformer. Hester was breathing and appeared to be in severe pain, having suffered burns to more than half his body, according to San Bernardino County Sheriff's officials. "Evidence at the scene indicated that Hester had broken into the transformer case in an attempt to steal wiring," the sheriff-coroner's office recapped Sunday. "Hester began cutting the wires when he received an electrical shock, causing the severe burns. The damage to the transformer caused a major power outage to a very large portion of the community." Hester, who was apparently a transient, was taken to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton where he died from his injuries Oct. 14. The sheriff-coroner's office is seeking the public's assistance in locating Hester's next of kin. He is described as black, 5-foot-10-inches tall and weighing 240 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. Anyone with information about his family or next of kin is urged to call 909-387-2978.

Patricia Pautke went into the store to browse the Halloween selection last week, but as she was leaving, she was stopped by a store employee. “He said ‘Ma’am are you pregnant?’ and I said ‘Yes I am,’ and he said ‘You did not look pregnant five minutes ago,’” Pautke told KOB. “He said, ‘I’m going to need you to lift up your shirt right now and prove to me that you don’t have anything under your shirt.’” Pautke said at the front of the store, in front of other employees and customers, she lifted up her shirt. She said only when she proved she wasn’t hiding anything did employee told her to have a good day. “I couldn’t believe this happened to me,” Pautke said. “I’ve never heard of this happening before and how humiliated and embarrassed I was that they didn’t even take me into a room.” Pautke was able to speak with the manager, who apologized after watching the surveillance video, but she still filed a report with the Santa Fe Police Department. “You can’t just apologize and make this experience go away. You know, I’ve thought about it daily since it happened, and it’s just really traumatized me,” she said. Walmart’s Senior manager of Corporate Communications Leslee Wright released a statement regarding the incident. “We’re sorry for the experience Ms. Pautke had in our store,” the release said. “We take this seriously and are looking into it. We will take action as appropriate.” As for Pautke, she doesn’t plan on returning to that Walmart location because she doesn’t want to have a chance of interacting with that employee again.

While shoppers have had their fun over the past week browsing circulars from Walmart, Best Buy, and Target, ads from a few very important retailers are still missing. Since Black Friday is now less than two weeks away, this coming week should see the remainder of the ads for the most important stores come out. You can see a full selection of the latest 2016 Black Friday ads at BestBlackFriday.com, and Amazon, Macy’s, and eBay should be added to the list within the next few days.

Amazon’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date Amazon.ca Kicks off the Holiday Season with the Launch of its Black Friday Deals Store https://t.co/gykXMm14s4 pic.twitter.com/G8C7e01N7A — Grocery Alerts (@groceryalerts) November 5, 2016 Amazon has not released an actual Black Friday circular in a few years, and it is unlikely that they will for 2016. Their strategy is to put out an official press release a little over a week before Thanksgiving. In 2015, the press release, as seen on Amazon’s website, came out on November 18, which was eight days before Thanksgiving. This press release acts as an ad because it lists most of their major doorbusters. Regardless, they always have a few surprises on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. This is done on purpose, as Amazon waits for all of their competitors to release their ads first. As the Inquisitr reported, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy’s circulars were all released within eight hours of each other earlier this week, so Amazon has had plenty of time to review prices that the competition is offering. Assuming they follow the same pattern as last year, their press release should come out on November 16, which is eight days before Thanksgiving. They will probably begin their “Countdown to Black Friday Sale” on November 18, which is a full week of holiday deals. Of course, you should wait until Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday for the best doorbusters. Since Amazon does not offer free shipping with no minimum order size, it is important to know their terms. Prime members can enjoy free two-day shipping on all orders, but non-Prime members must spend at least $49 in order to qualify for free shipping. Compared to the competition, Amazon’s shipping policy is extremely mediocre. Best Buy and Target are both offering free shipping with no minimum size on every order, so keep that in mind for small orders. Macy’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Macy’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. Black Friday in NYC- Departs 24 Nov 3NTS 4* Four Points at Sheraton. Macys Shopping tour+ more included. Call now on 01-8822500 to book pic.twitter.com/8HPgXWZYqT — Garda Travel Club (@GardaTravelClub) November 1, 2016 From 2012 to 2015, Macy’s released their ad in October three out of the four years, so it is a surprise that they are holding out this year. Regardless, most of the ads from their competitors are now out, so it is likely that Macy’s releases their ad towards the early parts of next week. As the screenshot from their 2015 Black Friday ad shows, Macy’s opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving. For 2016, they will open at 5 p.m., which has already brought them significant backlash. Macy’s spokeswoman Holly Thomas told Fortune the reason to open earlier. “In response to significant, ongoing customer interest in shopping on Thanksgiving, both at Macy’s and at many other retailers, we will be opening our full-line department stores at 5pm on Thanksgiving Day.” Whether the Macy’s ad is leaked or they release it themselves remains to be seen, but it should be out by Wednesday. Otherwise, this year would mark the latest that it has been released in years. eBay’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what eBay’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. How to find the best eBay Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals #ebay #checkoutebay https://t.co/g5FyONegiE pic.twitter.com/PSuTpyl8OP — CheckoutEbay (@CheckoutEbay) November 14, 2016 Typically thought of as more of a player on Cyber Monday, eBay has had one of the stronger Black Friday sales in recent years. With everything online, the typical process of waiting outside for long hours on Thanksgiving and Black Friday is avoided. Their Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday ads were released last year on November 14, which is around the same time they usually come out. For 2016, expect them towards the middle of next week. eBay GM of Deals Jesse Kiefer recently provided BestBlackFriday.com with insight into their upcoming holiday sale. “Cost-conscious shoppers should do their homework to find the best deals throughout the holiday season, especially for big-ticket items such as TVs, laptops, and gaming consoles. And, they should look at more than just the price. Most items featured on eBay’s Deals pages ship for free, include 30-day returns, and offer the opportunity to purchase a 1, 2, or 3-year warranty at a cost that is much lower than what a buyer warrantee typically costs at big box retailers.” Additionally, Kiefer noted that eBay’s sale will start on Thanksgiving. “Specific to great Black Friday deals, eBay will be launching hundreds of new deals starting at midnight (11/24). New deals will post every two hours throughout the night and all day on Black Friday.” [Featured Image by Mario Tama/Getty Images] Now Read This: Black Friday 2016 Target, Toys R Us & Walgreens Sales Deals Include HDTVs, Xbox One & PS4 Games, Pet Supplies & More Share 2 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Phillip Dengler Comments LATEST HEADLINES WWE News: Daniel Bryan Confirms These Two ‘Raw’ Superstars Want To Move To ‘SmackDown LIVE’ ‘Below Deck’ Nico Asking For Donations After Brother’s Death Bill O’Reilly Implies That Megyn Kelly’s Book ‘Settle For More’ Makes Fox News Look Bad [Video] Stop Telling Hillary Clinton’s Supporters To ‘Get Over It’ And ‘Accept The Election Results’ — Anti-Trump Protests To Continue [Opinion] ‘Game Of Thrones’ Season 6 DVD/Blu-ray: Deleted Scenes Reveal Tense Aftermath of Jon Snow’s Demise & More Washington Redskins Vs.

What happens when a rare beetle comes back from the dead Associated Press | MIAMI (AP) — A tiny beetle thought to have vanished from the planet decades ago and rediscovered in a patch of pine rockland near Zoo Miami became the latest disappearing insect added to the nation's endangered species list Nov. 4. First discovered in the 1930s near Barry University when much of South Florida was covered with pristine pineland, the Miami tiger beetle appeared to have been lost as development across the region wiped out their forest habitat. In a 2006 field guide, entomologists concluded the feisty little beetle was almost certainly gone. But in 2007, a butterfly collector stumbled across several near the zoo, a rare Lazarus moment that has since helped reignite efforts to save the last isolated tracts of pineland. One of those tracts where the beetle was found, among the largest remaining pine rockland forests outside of Everglades National Park, is being targeted for a Walmart shopping center. "That particular type of landscaping is vanishing and once it's gone, you can't get it back," U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesman Ken Warren said Nov. 4. "What it comes down to is the people of Florida are going to have to make difficult choices about what's important." Federal wildlife managers are now considering designating critical habitat for the Miami tiger beetle, which would map out boundaries and measures to further protect the pineland, which must be maintained with regular fires that replicate South Florida's natural wildfire season. A decision is expected by next Fall, Warren said. While the beetle won't stop Palm Beach County developer Peter Cummings from building the 88-acre strip mall, apartments and parking — since he unveiled plans, two butterflies found in rockland have also been listed — the protection means he will now have to also accommodate the beetle. A spokesman for Cummings said Nov. 4 he is continuing to work with federal officials, who are reviewing a proposed conservation plan. The Center for Biological Diversity, which sued the federal agency in 2011 to speed up a backlog of species waiting to be reviewed, applauded the listing, which the organization considered among the nation's most urgent. But they also worry about delaying protections for the beetle's habitat. "The politics of who may be wanting to develop on that habitat should not come into play," said Jaclyn Lopez, an attorney and Florida director for the Center. "The leading cause of species extinction is habitat loss and that's why it's so important to protect habitat." Miami-Dade County has also proposed building a Disney-style theme park on adjacent rockland, but backed off those plans as criticism mounted over the Walmart. Earlier this year, architect Bernard Zyskovich said the county had put the project on hold until wildlife managers completed their study. As for the tiger beettle, when collector Frank Young first discovered it in 1934, entomologists initially presumed it was a cousin of other local beetles. When the distinction was drawn years later, and Young reported the exact location of the find near Barry University, it was too late. Collectors returned, but were no longer able to find any. In a 2006 field guide, entomologists concluded the beetle was probably lost, wiped out by development and collection over the decades — the tiger beetle with its iridescent green armor was among the most prized finds. When the butterfly collector came across a small population in South Miami-Dade, entomologists considered it at high risk because of the continued pressure on its nearly vanished habitat. A second small population of Miami tiger beetles, aggressive ant-eating insects about the size of a fingernail, was found last year about three miles away in another small chunk of pine rockland. In an updated 2015 "Field Guide to the Tiger Beetles of North America and Canada," noted entomologist Barry Knisely and his colleagues reported the Miami species was "arguably the rarest and most endangered of the U.S. tiger beetles." Among entomologists, that's a grim pronouncement. But for South Florida, it also meant that so little of the pine rockland remained that even the tiny beetle was having trouble finding a place to roam. "We have roughly two percent of pine rockland remaining and what remains is highly fragmented," said Emily Bauer, the lead biologist for the Fish and Wildlife Service. "We have just two populations and they're thought to be really small and isolated from each other." ___ Information from: The Miami Herald, http://www.herald.com © 2016 The Associated Press.

Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon announced Sultemeier's departure during the company's Veterans Day celebration Friday but did not discuss a specific date. Sultemeier has been with Wal-Mart since 1989. "The word that kept coming to my mind is character. Chris has character," McMillon said during the Veterans Day event. "You've been a really important part of this company and we appreciate your service." Prior to his current position, Sultemeier was senior vice president of transportation services and also held various logistics and merchandising roles in both Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam's Club throughout his career. He was promoted to executive vice president of logistics in 2012 and is currently responsible for all distribution and fulfillment centers as well as domestic and global ocean transportation functions, according to his biography on the retailer's corporate website. Sultemeier was a captain in the U.S. Army before joining Wal-Mart. He is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and has a degree in mechanical engineering. -- Robbie Neiswanger Trucking group meets with Trump team American Trucking Associations President and CEO Chris Spear said in a release that the group had "already begun meeting with President-elect Donald Trump's transition team" to discuss regulatory issues facing the trucking industry. In his campaign's plan for his first 100 days in office, Trump had promised "$1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years" that he called "revenue neutral." Shannon Newton, president of the Arkansas Trucking Association, said the industry is "cautiously optimistic about the opportunity to work with President-elect Trump to address some of our industry's challenges." She highlighted "investing in our nation's infrastructure, strengthening our economy, reforming the tax code and limiting government overreach" as "areas of our mutual concern." -- Emma N. Hurt Airlines encounter brief computer glitch DALLAS -- Airlines are dealing with another computer glitch that is disrupting flight schedules heading into the weekend. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines confirmed that a technology glitch briefly interrupted their operations Friday, and other carriers may also have been involved. The problems seemed to have been fixed by midday, and airlines reported that flights had resumed. The airlines blamed their difficulties on a breakdown in systems operated by Sabre Corp., a Texas company that provides software and other technology services to airlines and hotels. A Sabre spokesman said the systems were running again by early Friday afternoon. She said she did not know the cause of the breakdown. -- The Associated Press Grubhub CEO recants anti-Trump email CHICAGO -- The co-founder of food delivery service Grubhub sent an email to all his employees suggesting that supporters of President-elect Donald Trump should resign, then issued a statement saying he welcomes all employees, regardless of their political beliefs. CEO Matt Maloney's email Wednesday said he rejects Trump's "nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics" and that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign "because you have no place here." In a tweet Thursday that was later deleted, Maloney said, "Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees -- even those who voted for Trump." Maloney later issued a statement saying his email advocated for inclusion and tolerance and that Grubhub doesn't discriminate based on political beliefs. Chicago-based Grubhub connects online customers with takeout restaurants in the U.S. and London. -- The Associated Press 3 arrested in U.K. insider trading probe Three employees from major banks have been arrested in an insider-trading investigation that could become the U.K.'s biggest case related to the crime, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is working with the National Crime Agency, which is assisting with covert surveillance, the people said, who didn't want to be identified because the investigation is private. The arrests of the workers, whose identities haven't been disclosed, were carried out in recent months and more are planned, according to the people. An insider-trading probe was made public last week in a report by the government on the so-called Panama Papers scandal. The briefing said that a task force, set up to investigate leaked documents from a Panama law firm, had "identified a number of leads relevant to a major insider-trading operation" led by the Financial Conduct Authority and supported by the National Crime Agency. Officials at the regulator declined to comment and a spokesman for the crime agency declined to immediately comment. The news of the arrests comes six months after the Financial Conduct Authority concluded a major trial in an insider-trading case dubbed Operation Tabernula. -- Bloomberg News Brazil files protest of U.S. steel tariffs GENEVA -- Brazil has filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization against the U.S. over duties imposed on Brazilian steel products. A WTO announcement Friday on the filing comes amid questions about how the U.S. will interact with the Geneva-based trade body after President-elect Donald Trump's January inauguration. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo tweeted Wednesday that the WTO "stands ready to work with the new administration." Brazil claims the U.S. violated WTO subsidy rules by imposing higher tariffs over the past year on Brazilian cold- and hot-rolled steel flat products in response to alleged improper Brazilian government subsidies. Brazil's request for "dispute consultations" centers partly on allegations that a U.S. investigation into Brazilian steel products was based on insufficient evidence. The WTO said further information was expected in coming days. -- The Associated Press Business on 11/12/2016 Print Headline: Business news in brief Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Business Retailers say election made public too distra...

McMillon updated the retailer's progress in its goal of hiring at least 250,000 veterans by 2020 during a Veterans Day ceremony Friday at the company's home office. About 19,000 of those veterans hired as part of the Veterans Welcome Home program have been promoted within the past three years, the update said.

With a military background, you have those skill sets." The Walmart Foundation also announced Friday that it has awarded a $5 million grant to the Institute for Veterans and Military Families for its AmericaServes program, which offers veterans the tools needed for transitioning back to civilian life. The funding is in addition to last year's $1 million grant. -- Robbie Neiswanger Still on rise, index ends day at 347.22 The Arkansas Index, a price-weighted index that tracks the largest public companies based in the state, continued its climb, rising 5.51 to 347.22 Friday.

(KSN) – It was a horrific crash Friday morning where the only one who survived was the driver of a semi truck. It started with the report of three people shoplifting about 11-hundred dollars worth of items from the Newton Walmart. Police “spotted” one of the two suspect vehicles heading for Hutchinson. Newton police say the car was stolen and, the chase reached speeds of more than a hundred miles an hour. 24 miles down the road, the car swerved to miss stop sticks on the highway and crashed into the front of a semi. The two suspects, 27-year-old Wendell Lue Hicks, III and his passenger, 48-year-old Lee Francis Billinger were pronounced dead at the scene. KSN sat down with Newton Police Chief Eric Murphy Friday afternoon to talk about their vehicle pursuit policy. Murphy says they have about 10 to 15 factors they take into account before deciding whether or not to pursue a vehicle. “One is the nature of the crime, another would be whether we know who the individuals are that are trying to elude us,” said Murphy. Murphy says other factors include the amount of traffic in the area, the location of the pursuit and the overall general safety of the public. KSN asked, who is responsible for making the call to engage in a pursuit? “It’s kind of a judgement call on the officer based on the information that he has as to whether, what level of crime it is,” said Murphy. Murphy says any member of their command staff has the power to call off a pursuit at any time, if they feel the danger is too high to the public. The chief adds there is no set time limit for how long they pursue a vehicle. KSN asked Murphy, with the suspects vehicle reaching speeds of up to 115 miles per hour, would there have been a point in time under their per policy, to stop the pursuit? “Had we went into a heavily populated area like the city of Hutchinson, we would have probably looked at terminating the pursuit,” said Murphy. Murphy says for simple thefts, like shoplifting, they usually don’t pursue vehicles. KSN asked him to explain, under their policy, why they did in this case? “They attempted to steal 11-hundred dollars of property from Walmart, they were also driving a vehicle they had put stolen tags on and so this just wasn’t a regular shoplifting,” said Murphy. Murphy says his staff will be reviewing the incident today to make sure the policies they have in place for vehicle pursuits were followed correctly. He says they review the policy on a one to two year basis, making sure they are utilizing the best practices. The Newton police chase policy limits the number of units they send in a pursuit. They have to make sure some officers remain in the city, to deal with local emergencies. Two newton officers were part of today’s pursuit, which is within policy.

(KSN photo / Chris Arnold) HUTCHINSON, Kan. (KSNW) — A shoplifting at a Newton Walmart led to a police chase Friday afternoon that ended in the death of two men. Police said three individuals attempted to pay for merchandise in a self-checkout lane with fraudulent credit cards which were declined. They got away with items worth approximately $600. Newton Police Chief Eric Murphy told KSN an officer caught up with a red Pontiac reportedly involved in the report heading west on Highway 50 with two men inside. He called in the license plate and found that the car was reported stolen. Officers then attempted to stop the car and it took off at a high rate of speed. Speeds during the chase reached 110 to 115 mph. As the car approached the Haven / Buhler road east of Hutchinson stop sticks were deployed to try to stop the car. The driver of the car swerved to avoid them and lost control, striking a tractor-trailer that was stopped at the intersection. Lee Billinger. (Courtesy Kansas Dept. of Corrections) Chief Murphy told KSN that the two men in the car were most likely killed upon impact. The driver of the vehicle was identified by the Kansas Highway Patrol as 27-year-old Wendell Lue Hicks, III.  His passenger was identified as 48-year-old Lee Francis Billinger. Both men were from Hutchinson. Wendell Lue Hicks, III. (Courtesy Kansas Dept. of Corrections) The driver of the semi was taken to the hospital as a precaution but is expected to be okay. Murphy said two vehicles were involved in the reported shopliftings in Newton and the other vehicle, a Ford Taurus, was found unoccupied in Hutchinson. Police say a woman involved in the Walmart theft was suspected of driving that car. So far she has not been found. The Kansas Highway Patrol is on the scene working the car crash and will be giving the Newton Police Department information regarding the occupants KHP and KDOT are working to detour traffic at the intersection. The intersection will be closed until the investigation is complete.

Advisor Insights Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In The Week Ahead: November 14-18, 2016 (TGT, WMT) By Aaron Hankin | November 13, 2016 — 3:21 PM EST In the early morning hours of November 9th after the election had been called for Donald Trump, markets around the world fell. At one point the Dow Jones Futures were down by 800 points. The initial sell-off in stocks and flight to quality dwindled and sentiment turned with all major indices closing higher on Wednesday. The final days of the week saw divergence in the equity markets with the Dow Jones Industrial Average making an all-time high led by infrastructure firms, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lagged as the outlook for tech companies under a Trump government fell. It's a busy week ahead in the U.S. where the transition from the administration of President Obama to President-elect Donald Trump continues, Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks, and a handful of U.S. economic numbers are released. The earnings calendar is winding down but some large retailers will report third-quarter earnings this coming week. They include Target Corp. (TGT), The Home Depot Inc. (HD), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Best Buy Co Inc. (BBY). Election fallout On Thursday, Trump will meet with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in New York. Throughout Trump's campaign, he has repeatedly said he will withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, something that Obama signed with Japan and 10 other countries in 2016. Trump will likely extend an olive branch to Abe as he looks for a close ally in Asia as the tensions with both China and North Korea continue to escalate. Other presidential issues that may arise this week include Trump's plan for Obamacare, the make-up of his cabinet and clarification regarding his stance on Dodd-Frank. (See also: Trump Vows to 'Dismantle' Dodd-Frank.) Yellen Janet Yellen is due to testify to the Senate’s Joint Economic Committee on Thursday. The ongoing rate hike debate continues to keep markets on edge. Prior to the election, the probability of a December rate hike was 82 percent, which was cut in half when Trump won the election. However, ensuing calm in financial markets has seen the probability go back to 80 percent, accord to the CME FedWatch data. Yellen is not expected to be quizzed on the election, but the Trump victory has cast a shadow over her future at the Federal Reserve beyond 2018, when her term is up. (See also: December Rate Hike Remains Intact After Trump Win.) With the fallout from the election continuing, economic data has taken a back seat. However, we will get more indication of the state of the U.S. economy with the October retail sales report released on Tuesday, and the latest inflation numbers on Thursday. Retail sales are expected to have grown 0.6 percent in the month on October and inflation is expected to have ticked up to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent in the prior month. Offshore In Europe, there is a slew of economic data out this coming week. In the U.K., retail sales, inflation, unemployment and industrial production will be released throughout the week. Along with the full data calendar, Bank of England governor, Mark Carney is due to speak to Parliament’s Treasury Committee where he will likely field questions on his decision to extend his term at the BoE for a further year as the U.K. transitions through Brexit. Elsewhere, German and eurozone GDP will be closely watched after the EUR took a dive last week, making an 8-month low of 1.1830 against the U.S. dollar.

Although Nintendo has announced, via Twitter, the company plans to provide a “steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year,” it’s like the Pokémon GO Plus launch and amiibo hunting all over again. If you’re trying to figure out how to find a NES Classic Edition near you, this handy buyer’s guide is outfitted with all the tips and tricks to help you get one. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. 2/3 — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) November 11, 2016 NES Classic Edition at Best Buy Best Buy is selling the mini console in their stores and online. A dedicated product page on their website can be used to check the online availability; but, as of this writing, the product is sold out online and the page does not display the option to search local inventory as it typically does for products sold at their stores. You can try asking an associate at guest services or in the gaming department if they can check the local availability using the SKU number of 5389100. Savvy shoppers can also use the latest version of the Best Buy mobile app as a workaround to check for inventory at their local stores. Simply search for “NES Classic” within the app, and both the online store inventory and specified local inventory will be displayed in two separate tabs. Change your preferred store location to check inventory at the stores in your area an hour or two before stores open, so you can be one of the first in line if a store location is showing they’ve got some in. The Nintendo Entertainment system is now being sold as a handheld mini-console that comes with 30 pre-installed classic games. [Photo by Nintendo] NES Classic Edition at Target Asking an associate to perform a quick stock check might be the best bet at Target stores, as the console seems to be completely removed from both their mobile app and online store. It has a Store Item Number (DPCI) of 207-29-0180. NES Classic Edition at Toys “R” Us Toys “R” Us seems to be taking a similar approach to Target, as their website no longer lists the item online either. Asking politely in-store when it’s not busy may point you in the right direction. The console has an “R” Web Number of 099263 and and SKU of A24B3213. NES Classic Edition at Walmart Walmart just added a new “search my store” feature to their mobile app, which could potentially be helpful if you find yourself passing through on a routine shopping visit. To find out when the product has been restocked online, they offer an in-stock alert service that sends out an email to share the good news. The NES Classic Edition is also being bundled with an additional controller at some retailers. [Photo by Nintendo] NES Classic Edition at GameStop GameStop is offering several bundles in addition to the standalone console, which means there are a few more options to keep track of in their online store. There’s a bundle with one extra controller that costs about the same as buying the console and additional controller separately, a bundle that includes the mini console and the hardcover Playing with Power book, and another bundle that adds on both the book and extra controller. The “ultimate” bundle comes with all of the above, plus a backpack shaped like the NES. Although the website says the small console is being sold “online only,” there are reports of it being sold in stores as well. Your best bet with this retailer is to call or walk into your local store to inquire about local product inventory. If you strike out in your area, you can also ask if they are taking down a list of customers to call when shipments come in, but your mileage may vary by store. We're out of stock on the NES Classic Edition. We will let you know when we get more in stock. — Amazon Video Games (@amazongames) November 11, 2016 NES Classic Edition at Amazon If you’re not following Amazon.com’s official video game Twitter account, now might be the time to consider doing so. The online retailer alerts shoppers of when major products will be going on sale via their @amazongames account, and a recent tweet confirms they will be informing the masses of the next restock. In the meantime, get prepared for the moment of legend by making sure your account information is all up-to-date, so you can log in and check out as quickly as possible. The #NESClassicEdition is now on sale at #NintendoNYC! pic.twitter.com/npN5YnKNpj — Nintendo NY (@NintendoNYC) November 11, 2016 Nintendo World Store and Other Retailers Residents of New York were treated to a midnight launch party for the mini Nintendo Entertainment System at the one-of-a-kind Nintendo New York store (formally the Nintendo World Store). After selling out at the launch event, additional units were made available on the following Saturday, but also quickly sold out. On the bright side, the Nintendo New York store has been updating their social media accounts to notify fans about the restocks, so they can plan accordingly. As far as other shops go, Newegg.com was briefly selling the NES Classic but has since taken down its page for the item. The same goes for electronics retailer Fry’s Electronics. Micro Center has kept their product page up, along with the tool that allows you to search in-store inventory for all their locations nationwide. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qAGVilt3Rls?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> [Featured Image by Nintendo] Now Watch This: Company Recreates Real life Space Invaders Game Now Read This: ‘Final Fantasy XV’ Spoilers: Conan O’Brien Pans ‘FFXV’ While Elijah Wood Plays The Game On Clueless Gamer [Video] Share 113 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Asma M Tags: how to find a NES Classic Edition, how to get a NES Classic Edition, NES Classic Edition, nintendo Comments LATEST HEADLINES Steven Brian Pennell: Blue Fiber Serial Killer of Delaware Profiled On Investigation Discovery’s ‘Grave Secrets’ ‘Final Fantasy XV’ Spoilers: Conan O’Brien Pans ‘FFXV’ While Elijah Wood Plays The Game On Clueless Gamer [Video] Carolina Panthers Vs.

Conroy’s Party Shop, for the second straight year, hosted a Thanksgiving-themed celebration on Sunday to thank their customers for their support. “The owner just wanted to show customer appreciation — just to show that he appreciates his customers,” said Victoria Allen, event organizer. “It is because of the customers that he is allowed to put this on.” That “thank you” came in the form of free haircuts, thanksgiving dinners and a massive turkey giveaway. “We purchased them from Walmart,” Allen said. “We had 150 and we’re giving them away. No strings attached. We’re asking that it’s one per family.” Conroy’s customers said they are impressed and grateful. “Its fantastic,” community member Annette Alexander said. “I’m glad he contributed to the neighborhood and gave back to everybody who contributes to his store.” Over on the northside of Youngstown, a similar event is in the works. The Youngstown RedZone is hosting a free community Thanksgiving dinner on Nov. 19. And their event, just like Conroy’s, is all about giving back. “WFocus this event totally on the community, said Brandon Perry, co-owner of the RedZone. “They provided the donations we need to make this event possible.” Perry said that it’s important to have a business that invests in the community. “If you need help, you can just knock on the door or ring the doorbell,” he said. “We will answer and provide you what you need. We’re not just going to take from you and not provide you something back. That’s our thing — we’re trying to give something in return.” And that in the spirit of thanksgiving, there is nothing more important than coming together. “To come together is just so powerful,” Perry said. “It’s very important that we show unity — no matter your race, gender or any of that. We just want to show everyone that we can get together and make something happen.” The RedZone is still accepting any and all food donations for their Thanksgiving Dinner.

Police: Surveillance video helps ID teen burglary suspects Associated Press | NEWARK, Del. (AP) — New Castle County police say surveillance photos posted to social media helped them identify two teenage burglary suspects. Police are looking for 18-year-old Kyle Mace and 18-year-old Hunter Foltz in the burglary of a Newark-area home on Thursday. They were identified with the help of images from surveillance videos taken at a Wal-Mart in Wilmington where police say stolen credit cards were used. Police say two women who were also shown in the surveillance images have cooperated with investigators. Police say the teens are also suspected in the theft of a car, and they're believed to be responsible for thefts from several other vehicles in the communities of North Star and Jarrell Farms. They've been charged in warrants with several counts of burglary, theft and conspiracy. © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

We examine the shareholder's recipe for change. Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Nov 13, 2016 at 3:02PM Ninety-six seconds of sales genius. Video source: The YouTube channel of "Ginsuguy." Perhaps you're old enough to remember the famous "Ginsu Knife" TV ad, which launched the modern infomercial. If not, you've undoubtedly heard some version of its signature phrase -- "Wait, there's much, much more!" -- which has morphed into a contemporary shorthand for signaling any over-the-top sales pitch. The "Ginsu" moniker was actually a rebranding of a high-quality knife manufactured in Arkansas, which had previously been known by the unimaginative name "Quikut." The kitschy spot, which first aired in the late 1970s, has become a case study in persuasion: A Japanese chef is shown using a Ginsu to slice through frozen spinach, saw a beer can in two, and chip away at wood blocks, while demonstrating how the blade always remains razor sharp after such imaginative punishments.  I was reminded of this commercial after reading about the angst of one of Whole Foods Market, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:WFM) largest shareholders, as reported by Bloomberg News earlier this month. The shareholder, as yet unnamed, is said to have held meetings with activist investors to effect major change at the natural foods grocer, which could include a replacement of current management and/or exploring a sale of the company. Such news shouldn't completely surprise anyone. Whole Foods has struggled to reverse a comparable-store-sales decline that's now roughly two years old. Company stock, stuck in a thick paste of investor skepticism given rising competition, has lost roughly half its value since February 2015. What does this institutional shareholder, who prefers anonymity and would have others do its heavy lifting, want specifically? According to the obligatory "people familiar with the matter," who were present at discussions but also with to remain anonymous: "The investor cited Whole Foods' poor inventory and vendor management, high costs, and failure to make the most of its unique appeal to millennial shoppers among the key issues." Aimed at an aggressive hedge fund activist or two, these points form a seductive sales pitch. The identified issues lend themselves to wide-scale changes, which, if enacted by a capable agitator, aim to send shareholder value on a sharp upward tack.  Of course, knowing that change needs to happen doesn't ensure that you'll be able to put your index finger on the correct problems. In this case, the complaints relayed to Bloomberg don't appear to be connected with the company's current reality.  And selling the business, or ridding Whole Foods of executives who built an industry-leading value proposition, makes for an extremely sharp knife to wield. Let's take a look at these grievances. Inventory is a strength, not a shortcoming, of Whole Foods Market Grocers work incessantly to avoid shrink (wastage), and also to move inventory faster. Cycling inventory through a company quickly has tangible benefits, including the reduction of inventory holding costs, and a faster conversion of products for sale into cash. Whole Foods' management team realizes that opportunities exist to reduce shrink, especially in perishables such as fruit and vegetables. It's also dedicated to moving packaged goods out of back areas and on to store shelves more quickly. In the spring of 2016, executives disclosed an initiative to set up standard operating procedures to optimize inventory handling across all of Whole Foods' stores. Individual locations have previously enjoyed autonomy in this area. Yet everything's relative: One company's benchmarks for improvement may well prove out of reach for another in the same sector. Believe it or not, inventory management is one of the unsung, signatory achievements of Whole Foods Market. You can see this in a calculation that seeks to measure a combination of inventory efficiency and profitability: the "Turn/Earn" index. This is found by multiplying the number of times a company replenishes its aggregate inventory annually (inventory turnover) by gross margin. I've compared Whole Foods to a broad range of competitors: Grocer Inventory Turnover Gross Margin Turn / Earn Index (Rounded) Whole Foods Market 30.92 34.41 1,064 Casey's General Stores 35.41 22.66 802 Sprouts Farmers Market 23.31 29.27 682 Kroger 18.53 22.16 411 Weis Markets 12.27 27.35 336 Natural Grocers 9.38 29.15 273 Wal-Mart Stores 10.76 25.13 270 Supervalu 17.36 14.74 256 Index calculated by author based on Ycharts data. Note that gross margin percentages are converted to whole numbers to arrive at an index value. You'll observe that the organic-foods pioneer has the second fastest inventory turnover in the group, and the highest gross margin. Whole Foods has many issues to work on, but inventory management really isn't one of them. The company's indexed measurement of efficiency and profitability is 33% higher than that of its nearest competitor, and its score is simply out of reach of the rest of the peers in the table. This has more than a little to do with the fact that Whole Foods is extremely good at converting the same meats, dairy, and greens it sells on shelves and counters into prepared foods and hot bar items, incurring relatively little waste, which customers then buy at an even higher margin.  Vendor management, also cited by the anonymous investor, is a key part of the company's brand proposition. Whole Foods cultivates its vendors within extremely long-lasting relationships, pushing them to improve scores on its various sustainability rating scales, an important process in the eye of its socially conscious customers. Sure, the company could see some efficiency improvements in this area. Yet overall, without extremely well-managed relationships within its supply chain, Whole Foods simply wouldn't be able to achieve its breakneck inventory turnover of nearly 31 times annually. As for the high costs mentioned in the Bloomberg article, these are concentrated in Whole Foods' sales, general, and administrative expenses. It's a valid area of improvement that management has only recently addressed in a dedicated manner. I've discussed results of initial cost-cutting in an analysis of the company's Nov. 9 quarterly report, which you can read here. Whole Foods doesn't have a unique opportunity with millennials The anonymous shareholder is also correct to point out that Whole Foods has a millennial problem. But so does nearly every other grocer in the business. A recent article by Derek Thompson of The Atlantic -- "Why Do Millennials Hate Groceries?" -- suggests that millennials, and their elders for that matter, are booking fewer visits to grocery stores because they're eating a higher percentage of their meals at restaurants.  To this insight we should add the well-documented tight-fistedness of this demographic. Many millennials came of age and formed thrifty habits during the Great Recession, which means that dollar stores and discount chains grab a disproportionate share of their shopping budget. Accordingly, several marketing research reports over the past three years have indicated that millennials' grocer of choice isn't Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, or some other forward, hip chain. Rather, it's the ubiquitous and cheap Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Wal-Mart's own data tends to support this research. In March 2016, Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies told analysts at an industry conference that fully one-third of U.S. millennials between 20 and 35 had shopped at a Wal-Mart in the past month. While it may be counterintuitive to realize, millennials, who do tend to favor sustainably sourced, natural and organic products, and share affinity with the Whole Foods brand, don't inherently present any "unique opportunities" to the company as a shopping consortium. To state so reveals a lack of understanding that this demographic is currently price-driven over any other single shopping consideration. There is one characteristic grocers and shareholders understand and probably agree upon regarding this group: Millennials use technology to shop to a much higher extent than older generations. The following graphic, from the Food Marketing Institute's 2016 U.S. Grocery Shopping Trends report, demonstrates how much more actively millennials exhibit technology-centric purchase behaviors versus any other group: Image source: Hartman Group / FMI.org. Whole Foods' attempt to appeal to these digital natives' purchasing habits while offering lower prices has of course materialized in its "365 By Whole Foods" concept. With a handful of these tech-savvy, discount-friendly stores in operation, and 19 in its development pipeline, the company is actually pretty actively courting the youngest U.S. shoppers, while taking care to avoid cannibalization of its core business. A dubious course of action? To be clear, Whole Foods' central issues remain its market positioning against new competition, maintenance of pricing power, and top-line growth. None of these can be righted overnight, though each is currently being addressed. And none of these problems is likely to be solved by an activist investor who chooses to attack inventory or costs, or get rid of the same management team that's built what remains one of the most profitable grocery operations in the industry.  Selling the business doesn't seem a viable option at present to me, either. I'm not sure any single competitor big enough to buy Whole Foods -- of which there are but a handful -- has a better solution to the company's core problems. This imbues a fairly large potential transaction with risk.  Forcing constructive change in an enterprise shouldn't be frowned upon. But attempting to push questionable initiatives out of frustration may end up destroying more value than it creates. And it's worth noting that the company, as of the last two quarters, is showing concrete signs of a reversal of its comps trend decline. Activists, are you listening to a persuasive sales pitch and being asked to wield an extremely sharp knife? Be careful what you saw through.

The home center's role is not one you would might have expected from this acquisition. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Nov 13, 2016 at 4:06PM When coatings giant Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) wanted to buy Mexican paint retailer Comex a few years ago, antitrust regulators south of the border feared that the size and reach of the combined company would hurt competition, and they killed the merger. Now Sherwin-Williams' newest attempt at buying a rival is also said to be criticized by regulators, but this time, they're apparently waiting to see what big-box do-it-yourself retailer Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) thinks about the acquisition. Sherwin-Williams is the leading pro paint specialist, which is looking to have a greater global presence by buying industry rival Valspar. Image source: Getty Images. Cover the world The paint specialist announced back in March that it wanted to buy rival Valspar (NYSE:VAL) in a deal valued at $11 billion, including debt, in a bid to expand its geographic reach. Where Sherwin-Williams generates some 84% of its revenues from domestic markets, Valspar derived 46% of its $4.4 billion in annual revenues last year from international markets. That was also part of the rationale behind the Comex bid, but antitrust regulators blocked the deal.  The Valspar deal also faces some antitrust hurdles. First, Sherwin-Williams sells most of its paint through its branded retail stores, and then mostly to professionals, but in a deal with HGTV two years ago, it began selling paint in Lowe's DIY centers, which gave it greater access to the consumer markets. That came just as Valspar began losing sales at Lowe's, and in its fiscal 2016 third quarter that ended July 31, it said that $39 million, or 40% of the $96 million drop in sales it has experienced year to date, has come from adjusting its product line at the DIY center, a reset that's been going on for well over a year now. The problem for Valspar's merger with Sherwin-Williams, then, is that it will combine Lowe's two paint sellers into one, and according to the New York Post late last month, the Federal Trade Commission has not yet heard from the retailer how it feels about the deal. Image source: Getty Images. A narrow palette to choose from Although about 60% of all paint purchased in the U.S. is bought by professionals, Lowe's and rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD) are among the biggest retailers to the consumer market, along with mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart, an outlet Sherwin-Williams lost in 2010 when Akzo Nobel, which made Dutch Boy brand paints, beat out the coatings specialist, a loss of about $250 million worth of revenue at the time.   PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) ended up buying Akzo's North American coatings business in 2013, and that put its Glidden brand in place at Wal-Mart, but also at Home Depot, and the Akzo acquisition gave it access to the home center's professional paint business, too. There are a lot of moving parts in the coatings industry and, as is apparent, there has been a bit of consolidation underway. Both Sherwin-Williams and Valspar did expect there would be some resistance from regulators to their merger as the deal between them said they'd be willing to divest assets worth up to $650 million of Valspar's 2015 revenue. Image source: Flickr via Scott Lewis. However, the deal also said that if Sherwin-Williams was required to divest assets that accounted for more than that, the offer price would fall from $113 per share to $105 per share. Further, if divestitures of more than $1.5 billion were required, Sherwin-Williams would have the right to back out of the deal completely. A closer look Back in May, the FTC extended its review of the merger and wanted more information, sending a second request for information, a not-unheard-of circumstance and one that's by no means a deal-killer. Last year, for example, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) was asked for more information regarding its merger with Miller that was ultimately approved, albeit with more asset sales demanded and greater restrictions imposed. That could happen here as well, which may change the color of the agreement between Sherwin-Williams and Valspar. What they may not have counted on, though, was Lowe's being the linchpin to the deal, as the Post story says if the retailer objects to the merger because they would gain too much pricing power, it might cause antitrust regulators to spike the union. While Sherwin-Williams and Valspar say there's nothing to the story, you can bet they'd see red if the FTC blacks out the merger.

Black Friday Free Shipping Information When you know you're going home to a doorstep full of #AmazonPrime boxes… #MondayMotivation pic.twitter.com/hyBkOhvxM1 — Amazon (@amazon) November 7, 2016 With more doorbusters available on Thanksgiving and Black Friday than ever, it is important that you avoid paying shipping charges. In many instances, retailers will have a minimum order size that you have to meet in order to qualify for free shipping. This usually ranges from $35 to $75, and it completely depends on the store in question. Since most small orders will not meet the minimum, paying shipping charges could eat up most of the discount that you receive on Black Friday. For that reason, it is recommended that you do not pay shipping charges on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, or Cyber Monday. Here are the free shipping terms for a few of the more popular stores. Amazon – Minimum Order Size of $49 or a Prime membership, which requires an annual fee of $99. Best Buy – No Minimum Order Size. Kohl’s – Minimum Order Size of $75, which is one of the higher totals. Target – No Minimum Order Size. Toys R Us – Minimum Order Size of $19. Walmart – $50 Minimum Order Size or a ShippingPass membership, which requires an annual fee of $49. Best Buy and Target have the best policies, with Kohl’s having the worst. Amazon and Walmart are looking to push their shipping programs, so they are not offering free shipping with no minimum order size this year.

The National Retail Federation says consumers plan to spend an average of $935.58 during the holiday shopping season - the second highest level on record. Whether that is a little or a lot for you, we have some expert tips on how to find a comfortable spending level and stick to it this year: ASSESS FILE - In this Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016, file photo, Choisette Hargon, of Paterson, N.J., shops for toys ahead of Christmas at Wal-Mart in Teterboro, N.J. It¿s easy to get caught up in the excitement of holiday shopping, but it¿s not always as easy to foot the bill. The National Retail Federation says consumers plan to spend an average of $935.58 during the holiday shopping season, which is the second highest level on record. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) Be honest with yourself about your financial situation before you begin. If you are already struggling to pay bills or carrying debt, you probably shouldn't take on more. Avoid extreme measures to pay for the holidays. A recent survey of more than 1,000 parents by T. Rowe Price found that while the bulk save for the holidays throughout the year, about a quarter have at some point pulled money from their retirement account, emergency fund or taken a payday loan to cover holiday spending. Not sure where you stand? The National Foundation for Credit Counseling has a website that can help you assess your financial well-being before you start to buy at www.MyHolidayCheckUp.org . TALK Start by saying "no" to some of the more costly holiday traditions that might bust the budget, said Bruce McClary of NFCC. It can be hard to challenge those expectations, but it will be even harder to dig yourself out of a financial hole. Parents have a particularly hard time when it comes to their kids, said Marty Allenbaugh, a financial planner at T. Rowe Price. He said that parents sometimes find it easier to get everything on a child's wish list rather than have a more challenging conversation about wants and needs. This is a big mistake as these talks can help them develop a better understanding about money. That doesn't mean you have to be a scrooge though. "It's OK to splurge a little, but just don't go overboard at the expense of your own well-being," Allenbaugh said. BUDGET Set and stick to a holiday spending budget. The first part is easy: figure out how much you want to spend and keep track of your expenses as you go. The second part is harder: sticking to this once you are in the store or online and get excited about the deals. To combat this, Heather Battison of TransUnion suggests writing your budget and shopping list out and carrying it with you or putting it on your smartphone as a reminder. BE SAVVY Credit cards are one of the most popular ways to pay for holiday gifts and that's fine, unless you cannot pay it off immediately. Think twice before accepting the offer for a store card at checkout, as those often have very high interest rates. They also have low spending limits, which can increase your utilization rate — the amount of available credit that you use. And that can hurt your credit score.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Cyber Monday 2016 Deals Forced To Change Posted: Nov 13 2016, 10:43am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 13 2016, 10:45am CST, in News | Cyber Monday   This story may contain affiliate links. Photo Credit: Getty Images   Advertised Black Friday 2016 deals leave no room for Cyber Monday deals this year. New kind of Cyber Monday deals expected. Site-wide discounts? Besides Amazon, Microsoft and a few other big retailer, all Black Friday 2016 ads have been divulged. What is striking is the amount of deals on high-end consumer electronics. Don't Miss: Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Deals The Black Friday ads of Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others are full with deals on 4K TVs and mid-range to high-end laptops. Advertised deals for Black Friday also include Apple products including iMac, Macbook, iPhone, iPad Air, iPad mini and iPad Pro. There is nothing really left for Cyber Monday, besides a variation of the deals on the same type of products. In the past years, retailers offered predominantly deals on higher end products on Cyber Monday. The Cyber Monday deals also lacked the low ball doorbuster offers that are a main stable for Black Friday. See the Cyber Monday deals from last year. Maybe we will see more radical Cyber Monday deals as offered last year by Target. The Target Cyber Monday deal was a 15% site-wide discount. Best Buy seems to have the biggest issue this year, making Cyber Monday deals stand out. Last year's Cyber Monday deals are pretty much part of this year's Best Buy Black Friday deals. A site-wide discount on everything on bestbuy.com would turn heads. The Cyber Monday 2016 ads and deals are expected to be released in the days ahead of Black Friday. It will be very interesting to see how Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, Target and others solve the problem and keep Cyber Monday relevant. The online sales on Thanksgiving Day grow every year. The the overall online sales on Thanksgiving Day reached $1.73 billion, up 25% from last year. Cyber Monday set a new record in 2015 with $2.98 billion, but the sales volume only grow 12%. Thanksgiving Day is only a about a Billion behind and with the quality and hype around 4K TVs, the Thanksgiving Day online sales will set a new recording closing in on Cyber Monday. Cyber Monday 2016 is on November 28. Many retailers will kick off Cyber Monday sales events right after Black Friday ends.

A: Your basis also splits 2-for-1. Imagine that you bought 100 shares of Acme Explosives Co. (ticker: KBOOM) for $50 each, paying a $10 commission. Your cost basis is $5,010 — or $50.10 per share. After the split, you have 200 shares and your basis is still $5,010, or $25.05 per share. Always add the purchase commission to your cost basis and subtract the sale commission from your proceeds — you’ll save a few tax dollars that way. If you’re paying much more than $10 per trade in commissions, you might want to find a less expensive brokerage.

Q: What is a stock’s “multiple”? A: A “multiple” usually reflects a stock’s price being compared to something. The most common multiple is arguably the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, arrived at by dividing a stock’s current price by its earnings per share. Imagine Sisyphus Transport Corp. (ticker: UPDWN), a company trading at $60 per share. If it earned $3 per share over the past year, its P/E is 20 (60 divided by 3). You can refer to it as trading at an earnings multiple of 20. If you read analyses of various companies, you’ll see references to price-to-sales multiples, book-value multiples, cash-flow multiples and more. It’s instructive to compare a company’s multiples with those of its peers, to see whether its stock appears to be undervalued or overvalued. Target, for example, recently sported a P/E of 12.4, while Wal-Mart’s was 14.7. That suggests Target is the better bargain. Out of commission Dear Fool: I’ve had some bad results in my investing, but the most annoying mistake I made happened when I first started. I bought one share of stock in each of four companies. That was all the money I had at the time. Years later, the stocks were way down, and I no longer wanted to even own them. Making matters worse, the commission fees of buying and selling one share amounted to more than the cost of the share. I really want to yell at anyone who recommends buying just one share of stock in order to get into investing. The Fool responds: It’s important to pay attention to the commission fees you pay. These days plenty of good brokerages charge $7 or $10 or less per trade, but commissions of $25 or more haven’t been that uncommon in years past. If you buy $100 worth of stock and pay a $25 commission, you’re forking over 25 percent of the value of your investment just in commissions. We suggest paying no more than 2 percent, so if you’re paying $10 per trade, you’ll want your investment to be worth at least $500. High quality and growth If you’ve been assuming that The Priceline Group (Nasdaq: PCLN) is just another “me too” travel site, you’re wrong. It actually runs a collection of industry-leading enterprises such as Kayak.com, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable.com — and its crown jewel is Booking.com. Booking.com is the leading player in online travel in Europe. As the European hotel market is fragmented, many hotels are run by individual owners who lack the expertise and scale to market their hotel to online travelers. Thus, they’ve happily signed on to Booking.com’s platform to help fill rooms. This is a win-win relationship, and since Booking.com was the first mover in Europe, it has built a massive network of properties. That makes it the go-to site for millions of travelers who want the biggest selection of hotels, which in turn attracts more properties. That powerful network effect helps keep competitors at bay. Booking.com’s success is a big reason that Priceline Group’s profits have grown so quickly. Over the last five years, profits have compounded at more than 20 percent annually. Better yet, analysts are currently projecting more than 16 percent growth annually over the next five years. Priceline’s forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio near 18 might not seem “cheap,” but it seems a fair price to pay for a wonderful business that’s poised for prosperity.

To find out why one corner of our country voted as it did, Senior Correspondent Ted Koppel traveled deep into the heart of Trump Country: McDowell County, West Virginia, echoes to the sound of “used to be’s.” There used to be a hundred thousand people in the county.  Used to be.  Back when the coal mines ran three shifts a day. That’s another used to be. Automation cut back the work force.  Machines replaced men. That was already an issue back in 1960, when John F. Kennedy was campaigning here: Coal Miner: “What are your plans for the situation existing in the coal mines in West Virginia?” Kennedy:  “I think there are at least four or five things the government can do.  First is the area redevelopment bill.” JFK carried the county, and the state. Folks here used to be staunch Democrats. Used to be. “Well, I graduated from high school over here in 1973 and it was bustling then,” said Sheriff Martin West. “The streets were full, the businesses were here, and then I got laid off in ‘82. That’s when the bottom went out.” McDowell County today, says Sheriff West, is in desperate straits. “This county was one of the most prosperous in the state at one time,” he told Koppel. “These were the billion-dollar coalfields, and they were just enjoying the richness of it. And now we’re on the bottom and we’re being totally neglected.” Most of the mines are closed now, and the county’s down to fewer than 19,000 residents -- too many of those on welfare and food stamps. Unemployment is more than double the national rate. And there is the property that “used to be” a Walmart.  So, when the voters went to the polls last Tuesday … Trump: “You look at our miners; Hillary Clinton wants to put all of the miners out of business.” “I’d say 90-percent of West Virginia will vote for Donald Trump,” said one voter. “Ain’t gonna say he’s a savior.  If we do have a chance, he could possibly help us out.” McDowell County was, unambiguously, Trump country.  In McDowell County, West Virginia - where coal country voters are in desperate straits - Donald Trump bested Hillary Clinton by a four-to-one margin. CBS News Donald Trump swept West Virginia, and trounced Hillary Clinton in McDowell County by almost four to one (4,614 votes to 1,429). Koppel asked, “You really think things are going to change?” “I think that he can help us, yeah,” replied Sheriff West. He used to work in the mines. Then he spent seven years at a processing plant where they cleaned and sorted the coal that fired the furnaces at U.S. Steel. It’s shut down now. “They put all these regulations onto us from Washington, and the mines is trying to operate,” said Sheriff West. “The people is counting on that in order to feed their family, to pay their bills and obey the regulations that we have. But they keep putting more regulations upon us.” The Sterling Drive-In, established in 1945, is one of the only places left that hasn’t shut down. It’s a good place to talk. Ted Koppel with some Trump and Clinton supporters, at the Sterling Drive-In diner in Welch, West Virginia. CBS News Koppel asked a group of residents, “I want you folks to tell me why it is that people down here in McDowell County were so much smarter than everybody in New York, Washington and Los Angeles, and Chicago. What did you know that we didn’t know?” “Really, to me, Donald Trump is probably the only way this county, and let alone state, is gonna survive,” said Brandon Burks, a correctional officer at Stephens Correctional Center. “I mean, we’ve always been a coal county.” Koppel asked, “Is Donald Trump going to be able to make a difference? Is the coal industry ever gonna come back?” Ed Evans, a science teacher who was recently elected to the Western House of Delegates, said, “It’s not gonna come back to where it was.  I don’t think we’ll see [that] level, but I think we’ll see some return of coal.” Eddie Asbury is President of Southern Minerals Coal Company, which has seven coal mines, three of which are shut down. “It’s not a United States market or state market or a county market, it’s a world market. We gotta compete in the world, in the world.” “And you think Donald Trump’s gonna be able to do that?” Koppel asked. “I do believe he will. And I’ll be honest with you, I’ve been Democrat all my life. All my life.” Leroy Johnson used to work in one of Eddie Asbury’s mines. But when it comes to politics they part ways. “I voted for Hillary because she was more experienced and she was talking about more of the policies that we need, and the things that we need to work on,” he said. “Donald wasn’t talking that. He was just throwing words out there, giving people what they wanted to hear. And I didn’t think that was right.” Kristin Mitchem, an unemployed single mother of three young children, did not vote. “Why the hell not?” Koppel asked. “I felt that this was the most ridiculous election I’ve ever witnessed in my life,” Mitchem said. “I know I’m young, but they went about it the most childish way I think someone ever could. Through the whole election I never heard either party talk about the lower class. I’m lower class. They’re worried about middle class and higher class.” “You were born here?” “I was born and raised here.” “So you know a lot of people your own age?” “I do, I do.” “Is there a lot of desperation?” “There truly is. I would never have imagined in my life that I would be in this kind of position,” Mitchem replied. “I don’t wanna leave my home. But I feel as if I’m being forced out of my home because there’s nothing here anymore.” Delores Johnson, Leroy’s wife of nearly four decades, and the President of the McDowell County Chamber of Commerce, nodded her head. Koppel asked, “You see a lot of this?” “Yes. And I agree with what she’s saying. It’s sad.” “The nuclear family in McDowell County is really broken down,” said Evans. “We have somewhere in the high 40 percent of kids that do not live with their natural mothers and fathers. Most of them will go off to find jobs in other places. They’ll mail money back to grandma who takes care, or Uncle Bill, who takes care of the kids.” “What’s coming out of this community to me is that a lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they felt, ‘What the hell? What have we got to lose?’” said Koppel. “Do you buy that?” Asbury replied, “I do.” Evans added, “We have nowhere to go but up.” There’s a little disagreement about when McDowell County held its first Veterans Day Parade -- either 1918 or 1919 -- but it’s one of the oldest in the country. This last Veteran’s Day, Friday, was picture-perfect. The parade came down McDowell Street and you could barely notice all the shutdown stores. There was a flavor of what it must have been like.  Not everyone, but most people, seemed ready to give their President-elect a real chance. “The voters of McDowell County gave Donald Trump a four-to-one margin of victory, I think ‘cause he said he’s going to bring the coal industry back,” said Koppel. “You think he can do it?” “I think he can do anything he said he could do,” one woman said. “He’s that good.” With the kids chanting their thanks to the veterans, and the high school bands, and the crowds lining either side of the street, you almost had a feeling of how it used to be. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Even so, it’s been impossible for most shoppers not to notice that retailers have rolled out loads of early season deals. Amazon launched the first of its pre-Black Friday sales on Nov. 1, while stores like Best Buy and Target have already promised free no-minimum shipping on all purchases throughout the season, in addition to a range of early discounts and promotions. Many of Walmart’s Black Friday deals are live in stores and online right now as well. Your e-mail in-box is probably brimming with special offers from retailers right about now too. Marketing research indicates that consumers are more likely to open and read promotional retailer e-mails in the two weeks after Halloween than they are later in the holiday shopping season. Why? Apparently, because by December—which is unsurprisingly the peak month of the year for retailer emails—shoppers are swimming in so many promotions that they’re easier to delete. In any event, we are entering the peak season for retailer emails and deals. Perhaps among the most eye-catching of discounts is the simplest one: the flat percentage discount that applies to all of a store’s merchandise. There are plenty of these offers available right now. Through Nov. 17, Old Navy is offering 30% off sitewide, and 50% off winter apparel (use the code WARM at checkout). Dockers has 40% off the purchase of any two items, or 50% off orders of three items (code: FROSTY50). Crocs and J.C. Penney were promoting 30% across-the-board discounts for Veterans Day, while Gap and Banana Republic have been hosting 40% off everything sales. Read Next: Everything You Need to Know About the 2016 Holiday Shopping Season They may seem like pretty good sales. But they speak to how inflated regular prices are at America’s stores, revealing a business model in which insanely high markups mean that no one should ever pay full price—and that you’re probably paying too much even with discounts of 20% or 30% off. More importantly, if you want to pay the least for gifts or treating yourself during the holiday season, you should probably resist all of the deals on the table now. Why? If history is any guide, much more substantial discounts are on the horizon. For example, the flat 30% off promotion at J.C. Penney is paltry compared to the retailer’s average discount of 68% on Black Friday last year. What’s more, retailers are all but guaranteed to repeat the kinds of huge sitewide discounts they’ve offered on Black Fridays and Cyber Mondays in the past. It’s become standard protocol for stores like the ones mentioned above to discount all purchases by 40%, 50%, or even 60% during the long Thanksgiving-Cyber Monday weekend. What’s more, during the weeks in between Cyber Monday and Christmas, there is a history of these exact same kinds of discounts popping up over and over, often with free shipping thrown in to sweeten the deal. So by all means feel free to ignore the deals being breathlessly promoted by retailers right now. The discounts that will be available in the weeks ahead will certainly be just as good—and, odds are, much deeper markdowns will appear periodically on peak sales days like Cyber Monday. Read Next: Stores Realize It’s Dumb to Open Earlier and Earlier on Thanksgiving Perhaps, though, you may not want to ignore the current sales entirely. Instead, consider them a baseline that can be used to compare with the inevitable sales down the line. Create a list of items you want to buy and note their current prices. This way, you can quickly identify the truly outstanding deals in the coming weeks and pounce on them with confidence that you’re getting a bargain.

Pay hikes appeal to working-class voters who lifted Republican Donald Trump to a decisive win in the U.S. presidential race, and also to liberals who voted for Hillary Clinton, worker advocates said. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.42 +0.93 +1.32% Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG ▼ 400.00 -14.18 -3.42% Jack In The Box Inc JACK ▲ 100.95 +0.16 +0.16% Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc RRGB ▼ 53.55 -0.30 -0.56% "This could be a uniting issue," said Saru Jayaraman, co-director of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and director of the Food Labor Research Center at University of California, Berkeley. Voters in Arizona, Colorado and Maine voted to raise their minimum wages to $12 by 2020. Washington State agreed to take the minimum wage to $13.50 in the same time span. Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, which has supported minimum wage campaigns across the United States, said any near-term federal action was unlikely under Trump but activists were considering a minimum wage campaign in New Jersey. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie vetoed a $15 per hour minimum wage bill this year, calling it a "radical increase." Christie, a stalwart Trump supporter, could have a place in the new administration. "For the next four years ballot initiatives are going to be the only way forward for us to be able to raise the minimum wage for working Americans and their families," Schleifer said. The United Food & Commercial Workers International Union President Marc Perrone said stakeholders of the minimum wage movement, including different labor unions and worker groups, are also looking at Pennslyvania, New Mexico, Massachusetts and Rhode Island for state ballot initiatives. "By January, February next year we are going to start to research so we can prep for the next election cycle." Perrone said selection of states will ultimately depend on what the electorate in each state wants.© REUTERS/Jim Young Demonstrators gather for a protest calling for a $15-an-hour nationwide minimum wage in downtown Chicago Restaurants and retailers are most exposed to minimum wage hikes, as the two largest U.S. employers of low-wage workers. Stephen Anderson, restaurant analyst at Maxim Group, said the latest state minimum wage increases will affect Chipotle Mexican Grill, Jack in the Box and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers the most. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest retailer and private sector employer in the United States, raised its minimum wage for store workers to $10 per hour in 2016. Its rival Target Corp also raised floor wages to $10 an hour. Anderson said the added cost of wage increases might be offset significantly by business-friendly policies championed by Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. These could include changes to the "Obamacare" healthcare law and a rollback of new rules broadening overtime eligibility. Trump also will have the opportunity to weaken regulations and change the makeup of the National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB is considering, for instance, whether McDonald's Corp is liable for labor law violations by franchisees, and could be required to bargain with workers who unionize. Dan Schlademan, co-director of OUR Walmart, a worker group seeking higher wages and better benefits at Walmart, said: "The bigger concern here for us is what happens with the labor board and the Department of Labor, where Republican control can change important things for workers and make them detrimental." Trump has said he would support a $10 federal minimum wage, adding it should be left up to the states to lead on the issue. The new Washington and Arizona laws also require employers to provide paid sick leave. Maine's successful initiative also would increase base pay for tipped workers. California and New York already passed laws to raise state minimum wages to $15 per hour over time. The results on the minimum wage ballot initiatives show voters are angry and demanding change, said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. "Voters in red, purple and blue states across the country decisively backed raises to the minimum wage, delivering badly needed raises for 2.3 million workers," she said.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     NASA Will Launch Fleet Of Microsatellites To Track Typhoons And Hurricanes Posted: Nov 13 2016, 5:50am CST | by Hira Bashir, Updated: Nov 13 2016, 5:53am CST, in News | Latest Science News   An artist's impression of one of the eight small satellites deployed in space over a hurricane. Credit: NASA   The first complete orbital mission will track the formation and intensity of tropical systems and help improve hurricane forecasts NASA is set to launch its first hurricane-tracking mission into the space. The mission, named Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), consists of eight low-cost, microsatellite observatories that will orbit close to the Earth and monitor tropical systems, which will ultimately help improve weather predications and storm forecast.  Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals The mission is scheduled to launch on December 12 from Cape Carnival Air Force Station in Florida. “This is a first-of-its-kind mission,” said Thomas Zurbuchen from NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “As a constellation of eight spacecraft, CYGNSS will do what a single craft can't in terms of measuring surface wind speeds inside hurricanes and tropical cyclones at high time resolution, to improve our ability to understand and predict how these deadly storms develop.” Previous instruments that were sent into the space had lacked the ability to accurately measure surface winds in the inner cores of the hurricanes as their signals break down in the areas of heavy perception.  CYGNSS mission, however, uses new type of GPS technology that can penetrate through heavy rain and can track the mechanisms of rapidly evolving cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons. Therefore, it is expected to provide more accurate information about wind speeds in and around the tropical systems including regions beneath the eyewall, which are not possible to measure from space with existing instruments.  “Today, we can’t see what’s happening under the rain,” said Chris Ruf, principal investigator for CYGNSS mission. “We can measure the wind outside of the storm cell with present systems. But there’s a gap in our knowledge of cyclone processes in the critical eyewall region of the storm – a gap that will be filled by the CYGNSS data. The models try to predict what is happening under the rain, but they are much less accurate without continuous experimental validation.” The CYGNSS satellites are designed to continuously monitor surface winds over the oceans across Earth's tropical hurricane-belt. Each of the small satellite is capable of observing changes in storms within a second and the ability to track rapid changes in hurricane intensity is critical to accurate hurricane forecasts. The CYGNSS microsatellite observatories are developed and tested by the Southwest Research Institute in Texas and they will begin operations in 2017 Atlantic hurricane season.

Here's a summary of the changes: • In the prepared-foods section, the sandwich counter was removed. Premade sandwiches can be found at the deli. • New to the prepared-foods department: a taqueria, an all-day breakfast bar, and Smoke and Fire, meat and vegetables grilled over wood. • The coffee bar, previously to the right of the entrance, has been moved next to the juice bar. Shoppers can preorder coffee or smoothies by texting 714-916-5449. • The gelato bar and communal seating area have moved. Gelato is sold at the coffee and juice bar. The seating shifted to in front of the cash registers. • Though poke bowls have always been available at the seafood counter, the store plans to add a build-your-own option. • The seafood department has added a larger selection of frozen, prepackaged foods from fish filets to marinated catfish. • Bulk buying was added for spices and teas. • In the heart of the store, aisles have been realigned so they all run parallel for easier shopping cart flow. Open coolers have been replaced with refrigerated doors in various departments such as dairy to improve energy efficiency. • In the meat department, Costco-style value meat packs are available for shoppers who don't have time to order directly from the butcher. • The large craft beer section is arranged like a boutique liquor store with selections organized by beer styles. • Remodeled bathrooms. Source: Whole Foods Market When Whole Foods Market opened a megastore in Tustin in 2007, it boasted premium services from a seafood-grilling center to wine and tea bars. But after surviving a Great Recession that forever changed consumer buying habits, the Orange County store is unveiling a major overhaul to meet consumer demand for chef-driven dining, value, convenience and personalization. The remodeled store, the biggest overhaul since it opened, features easier-to-navigate aisles, a wider selection of takeout foods, order-ahead coffee service, meat value packs, expanded selection of craft beers, a self-serve pizza station and more express checkout lanes. Yet the centerpiece of the year-old makeover has little to do with shopping for GMO-free crackers or organic hemp nut ice cream. In fact, no shopping cart is required. The 60,000-square-foot market, a key anchor at the District shopping center, has added two dining venues: gourmet sandwich chain Mendocino Farms and the Hangar Bar. “We love to turn people on to new foods and new retail experiences,” local marketing executive Marci Frumkin said. DINING DESTINATOINS The changes come as Whole Foods, often nicknamed “Whole Paycheck” for its premium prices, has scrambled to fend off rivals from all fronts. Traditional supermarkets like Ralphs and discounters such as Wal-Mart have ramped up organic private labels over the years. Online retailers like Amazon Fresh are also coming on strong in the $69 billion natural and organic foods market. Grocery and restaurant industries are also competing with a surge in meal-kit delivery programs. Whole Foods has responded, in part, by adding in-store restaurants. Of the Texas-based chain’s 464 stores, 180 have bars or tap rooms, including stores in Laguna Niguel, Newport Beach and Brea. Adding popular branded food chains like Mendocino Farms is the latest iteration of that dining strategy. “It’s an experiment. Whole Foods continues to break boundaries,” said Mario Del Pero, co-founder of Mendocino Farms. On Wednesday, a remodeled store in El Segundo unveiled a Kogi restaurant; it also recently added a bar. The Kogi eatery is popular Los Angeles chef Roy Choi’s second food venue inside a Whole Foods. Last year, the food truck pioneer opened Chego at a downtown Los Angeles store. ARE RESTAURANTS THE RIGHT MOVE? The Mendocino Farms at the Tustin store is the first of several expected to open inside select Whole Foods Markets. The fast-casual concept, which has locations in Orange and Los Angeles counties, is known for creating specialty sandwiches with locally sourced ingredients. The sandwich shop opens Thursday, sharing a 140-seat dining area with Hangar Bar, named after the Tustin blimp hangars. While Mendocino sells sandwiches, salads and stews, the Hangar Bar offers a gastropub-style menu with comfort foods, as well as vegan and vegetarian dishes. Some items include grass-fed beef burgers, fish and chips, sushi rolls, jackfruit crab cakes and cauliflower nachos. Del Pero said the goal of a restaurant within a market is to give time-pressed consumers a variety of eating options – smoked meats, vegan dishes, burgers, all-day breakfast, salads, sushi, pizza and sandwiches. Recently, Emil Davis, 25, and a friend took advantage of the choices. He dined on a house burger, fries and a pint of grapefruit Sculpin IPA at the Hangar Bar, while his friend drank a cold-pressed juice from the store. Davis, who shops and eats at Whole Foods frequently, said he’s happy to see more dining options. “I’ve been waiting for this for a long time,” he said. Industry watcher Brian Todd, president of the Food Institute, said adding restaurants makes sense if Whole Foods is trying to attract Gen Y shoppers, who spend about 44 percent of their food dollars dining out, according to a Food Institute analysis of government data. That’s almost $300 more annually than baby boomers, he said. “And those millennials also like their craft brews, perhaps explaining why Whole Foods and other supermarkets are adding tap rooms and specialty brews where customers can bring their growlers when picking up their dinners, or even a snack,” Todd said. Still, grocery analyst Burt P. Flickinger questioned the bar program. “It just seems really ill-advised,” he said. “It’s an expensive initiative when they have so much more to fix.” Flickinger, managing director of retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group in New York, recently visited a few taverns and bars inside Whole Foods stores in Texas, Chicago and Orange County. Each time, the stores had very few customers with baseball playoffs on TV, including the Back Bay Tavern at the Whole Foods at Fashion Island. Whole Foods declined to offer sales data on its bars. According to regulatory filings, store shoppers enjoy the chain’s ready-to-eat foods. Prepared foods and bakery accounted for 19 percent, or $3 billion, of the chain’s total sales in 2015. “We find that our customers appreciate being able to come to one place to do everything,” marketing executive Frumkin said. SHIFTING OF SPACE While Flickinger said the Whole Foods dining experiment is a waste of “productive space,” Tustin store leader Chris Cintula said very few grocery services have been eliminated by adding the two restaurants. During a store tour last week, Cintula said departments are now better organized – and in many cases, offer more products. The craft beer aisle, for example, has doubled to 800 types of beers – ranging from 22-ounce bombers from local breweries to obscure brands. The Whole Body department has added more makeup and facial care products. Pet supplies also have increased. Customization and convenience have played a large role in the new layout. Aisles have be realigned so they are parallel, making it easier to navigate. (Some departments were previously boxed in, causing traffic jams). Checkout lanes are no longer stacked with two registers. The Food Institute’s Todd said the changes are a smart move “as time-starved consumers look for ways to provide meals for their families and themselves as quickly and easily as possible.” Changes throughout the chain appear to be helping the bottom line. On Nov. 2, Whole Foods reported fourth-quarter sales increased to a record $3.5 billion. However, same-store sales decreased 2.6 percent, which marked the fifth straight quarter of declines. As for the the next Mendocino Farms inside a Whole Foods, Del Pero said it’s too soon to speculate where it will go. “We’re absolutely going to study it and see how it goes.” Contact the writer: nluna@ocregister.com Related Links Entree classics as sandwiches?

SCHWARTZ < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 6NEXT SLIDE > Paul Roell, a team leader at Carrier, supported Donald Trump. © Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times INDIANAPOLIS — By the time the Chicago Cubs won the World Series for the first time in 108 years this month, Paul Roell was already asleep. He did not stay up to see Barack Obama win the presidency in 2008, or watch in 2000 as the margin of votes separating George W. Bush and Al Gore in Florida shrank to the vanishing point. Quotes in the article United Technologies Corp UTX ▼ 107.68 -0.18 -0.17% Rexnord Corp RXN ▲ 20.67 +0.16 +0.78% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.42 +0.93 +1.32% After all, he has to clock in daily at 5:30 a.m. at the soon-to-be-shuttered Carrier factory here, where he has worked 17 years. But shortly before 3 a.m. Wednesday, when the networks projected that Donald J. Trump would be the next president of the United States, Mr. Roell was wide awake. His wife, Stephanie, was up, too, and they exchanged high fives in the wee hours. In fact, Mr. Roell was so keyed up, he did not sleep at all that night and headed straight to the plant before sunrise, bleary-eyed but euphoric. “I don’t watch sports, but this was my World Series,” he said. It is precisely this level of enthusiasm, from Mr. Roell and millions of like-minded Americans, that pollsters and the campaign of Hillary Clinton did not appreciate, even though it was vividly on display in February after a video went viral showing furious Carrier workers here learning from management that their jobs would be going abroad. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter Carrier’s decision to move the factory to Monterrey, Mexico, will eliminate 1,400 jobs by 2019. Mr. Trump quickly made the factory Exhibit A in his argument against the trade policies of Republicans and Democrats alike. He cited Carrier again and again on the campaign trail, threatening to phone executives at the company and its parent, United Technologies, and to hit them with 35 percent tariffs on any furnaces and air-conditioners they imported from Mexico. To the cheers of his supporters, he predicted at rallies that Carrier would call him up as president and say, “Sir, we’ve decided to stay in the United States.” Now his supporters expect action. “If he doesn’t pass that tariff, I will vote the other way next time,” warned Nicole Hargrove, who has worked at Carrier for a decade and a half and is not certain what she will do if and when her job goes to Mexico. Carrier isn’t changing its plans. On Friday in a written statement, the company said, “We are making every effort to ease the transition for our Carrier colleagues in Indiana.” The company pointed out that it will finance four-year retraining and educational programs for employees and provide financial help. For Mr. Trump, now comes the hard part. In interviews in recent days and in March, Trump voters here made clear that if he does not follow through on his promises, they are prepared to turn on him, just as they are seemingly punishing Democrats today for not delivering the hope and change voters sought from President Obama after he won as an outsider in 2008. And while Mr. Roell is a conservative, Mr. Trump’s tough talk about Carrier, the economy and the future of American manufacturing jobs also appealed to moderates like Darrell Presley, a steelworker in rural Crawfordsville, Ind., who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008. “He was for change, and said he would take care of the middle class, but he didn’t live up to those expectations,” Mr. Presley said. “I feel like the American people are at the point where they’ve had it, and this was the last chance.” Last Tuesday, blue-collar workers across the industrial heartland hearkened to Mr. Trump’s call, putting states never thought to be in serious play, like Wisconsin and Michigan, in his win column. As president, however, Mr. Trump will face a tough balance. Tariffs and trade wars stand to hurt American workers who make products that are exported to Mexico or China. Few voters will be happy paying more for imported goods. And regardless of who is in the Oval Office, manufacturers are seeing relentless pressure, from investors and rival companies, to automate, replacing workers with machines that do not break down or require health benefits and pension plans. Wall Street hedge fund managers are demanding steadily rising earnings from Carrier’s parent, United Technologies, even as growth remains sluggish worldwide. The Carrier plant here is plenty profitable. But moving to Monterrey, where workers earn in a day what they make here in an hour, will increase profits faster. Mr. Roell, who earns about $55,000 a year with overtime as a team leader making furnaces, has few illusions about the gulf separating him from Mr. Trump, or the global headwinds that American factory workers face. “His father was a millionaire, he’s a billionaire,” Mr. Roell said, sitting at Sully’s Bar & Grill on Thursday night opposite the factory with fellow Carrier workers. “His son Barron’s allowance is probably more than my salary.” Nor does he underestimate the profound economic threat to the 1,400 workers at the factory, where layoffs are expected to begin next summer and continue in waves until it closes in 2019. Mr. Roell was promoted to team leader in March. The mood in the factory has worsened since. Senior engineers travel from Indianapolis to Monterrey to supervise the shifting of production lines to Carrier’s factory there, workers and union officials said. Mexican engineers, in turn, have been coming here, measuring and assessing the machines they will operate south of the border, unless, of course, Mr. Trump can deliver on his promise. “It’s demoralizing when you see them taking pictures,” Mr. Roell said. “It’s like you are getting divorced but you are still living with your wife and her new boyfriend is coming over.” A Drought of Good Jobs For workers like Mr. Roell, 36, who started at Carrier just weeks after receiving his high school diploma and never returned to school, the problem is not a shortage of jobs in the area. Instead, it is a drought of jobs that pay anywhere near the $23.83 an hour he makes at Carrier, let alone enough to give him a toehold in the middle class. When he drives to work each day before dawn, Mr. Roell passes warehouse after warehouse of giants like Walmart and Kohl’s with “Help Wanted” signs outside promising jobs within. The problem is that they typically pay $13 to $15 an hour. “I guess I could work two full-time shifts a day,” he joked. The situation confronting Mr. Roell and other blue-collar Carrier workers is not simply one anecdote from the region some people call the Rust Belt. It is part of a broad predicament for non-college-educated workers borne out by Census Bureau data. And it explains why even in Indiana, a state with a lower rate of unemployment than the national average, and a strong rebound from the recession in many ways, the economic and political frustration is palpable. Since 2010, the private sector in Indiana has added roughly 300,000 jobs, bringing the unemployment rate from a high of 10.9 percent in January 2010 (nearly a percentage point above the national average) to 4.5 percent now (nearly half a percentage point below the national unemployment rate). But nearly all that growth occurred in the service sector — hotel and food-service jobs, or health care technicians, or workers in the warehouses Mr. Roell drives past — which added more than 220,000 positions for a total of 1.9 million today. While manufacturers added 85,569 jobs since the sector bottomed out at 434,919 in January 2010, factory employment in Indiana over all remains significantly below where it was before the Great Recession. And service jobs do not come close to paying what manufacturing jobs do. According to the Census Bureau, the typical service sector position in Indiana paid $39,338 in 2015, compared with $59,029 for a manufacturing position. The cross-generational drop-off can be stark, and it scars families. Within Local 1999 of the United Steelworkers union, which includes workers at Carrier and other local industrial employers, members typically start at $17 an hour, according to Chuck Jones, Local 1999’s president. For comparison, his 21-year-old granddaughter Haley Duncan is about to finish college and take a job in health care that pays $14.50 an hour. Ms. Duncan and her older brother, Drake, were tempted by factory work. But Mr. Jones and their parents told them to forget it and stay in school because, while manufacturing might pay more, its future is becoming more precarious. The Rexnord bearing factory here — where Mr. Jones started working fresh out of high school in 1969 and where his stepson works now — last month said it might follow Carrier to Mexico and eliminate at least 300 jobs. Can Mr. Trump, with his promises to bring these jobs back and his calls to retaliate against chief executives if they do not listen, stem the tide? Broader economic trends suggest Mr. Trump will face an uphill struggle even if he does follow through on his threat to pressure Carrier’s executives or hit the company with steep tariffs. What is more, while the bully pulpit of the president is something corporate chieftains fear, Rexnord’s plan to pull up stakes even after the Carrier situation suggests businesses will not bow to the threat of bad P.R. And even if Congress and the White House agree on a plan to increase manufacturing, tax credits for research and new investments, for example, or financing apprenticeships as European countries do, automation will continue to claim jobs. “I’m pretty skeptical Trump’s policies will reverse this process,” said John Van Reenen, a professor of economics at M.I.T. who studies how technology and innovation affect profits and wages at companies. “These are fundamental forces that have more to do with technology than trade.” In particular, he said, across developed economies more national income is going to capital, that is, owners and shareholders, rather than labor. “We’ve seen this in many countries with different political systems,” he said. “It’s a winner-take-all world.” Even Robin Maynard, a Carrier team leader who enthusiastically backed Mr. Trump, acknowledges that even a phone call from the Oval Office to the company’s executive suite might not be enough to save his job. “Hopefully, he can do something for us,” Mr. Maynard said. “But I think it’s out of the C.E.O’s hands. It’s in the hands of the shareholders.” In this age of 401(k) investment plans and individual retirement accounts, these shareholders are, in a real sense, all of us. But for the Carrier workers in Indianapolis and millions of other blue-collar workers, no matter how they voted, nuances like that do not matter so much now. Just the hope that Mr. Trump will try to reverse the long decline in their neighborhoods, their living standards and even their longevity is an emotional balm. “He doesn’t like blacks. He doesn’t like Hispanics. He doesn’t like disabled people,” said Jennifer Shanklin-Hawkins, who, like roughly half the Carrier factory workers, is African-American. “He’s not presidential material. But my husband and I weren’t mad or upset when he won. I know blacks who voted for him, and I want to give him a chance.” Diversity and Distrust Some blue-collar neighborhoods that supported Mr. Trump have been portrayed as monocultures, the opposite of supposedly more diverse, cosmopolitan cities that favored Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate. That caricature does not hold up here. At least half of the workers on Carrier’s assembly line are women. And dozens of Burmese immigrants have gone to work at the factory in recent years, part of an influx of nearly 15,000 refugees from Myanmar into Indianapolis since 2001. “It can be hard to communicate, but they work very hard,” Mr. Maynard said. “They don’t complain, and I love their work ethic.” And the neighborhoods around Carrier’s factory are considerably more diverse than many wealthy New York and San Francisco suburbs, where Democrats dominate. Down the road from the Carrier factory, past the railroad tracks and a few patches of farmland that remain in Indianapolis, the tidy neighborhood of split-level and ranch houses where Cecil Link Jr. lives has changed in recent years. A worker at a plastics factory nearby, Mr. Link noted that a Hispanic family recently moved in next door, and he said he was pleased that blacks and whites now socialize in ways almost unimaginable decades ago. “It pains me to see this country divided by race,” Mr. Link said. Nevertheless, he voted for Mr. Trump. The last time he voted in a presidential election was 1992, when he cast his ballot for Bill Clinton. But this time, he said, he registered explicitly to vote for Mr. Trump. “I was tired of corruption and lies in Washington,” he said. “I just wanted a nonpolitician like Trump.” Mr. Presley, the 59-year-old white Crawfordsville steelworker who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and Mr. Trump in 2016, was even more emphatic that racial resentment or ethnic bigotry was not behind his support for Mr. Trump. “I grew up on the West Side of Indianapolis in a racist environment,” he said. “But I went to a high school that was 57 percent black, and I played football with a lot of black guys and we became close friends. I learned not to be racist.” Instead of bias, what animates these voters, whatever their race or political orientation, is a profound distrust and resentment of wealthier, educated Americans, a group they say lacks a connection to them and does not care about their economic situation. And to them, Mrs. Clinton seemed at least as elite as Mr. Trump, if not more so. “I just couldn’t bring myself to vote for him, but both candidates are evil,” said Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins, who reluctantly voted for Mrs. Clinton, but has never forgiven her for her remarks about “superpredators” in the 1990s, or the mandatory prison sentencing guidelines Mr. Clinton signed into law as president. “Hillary hasn’t sweated a day in her life, unless it was losing a tough case as a lawyer,” Mr. Maynard said. “We wanted to take America in a different direction. I’m just hoping Trump will do what he says.” Can the Democratic Party recapture these voters if Mr. Trump does not deliver? Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, among the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, contends it can, if Democrats follow his lead in appealing to working-class concerns and opposing free trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact with Asian nations that President Obama supported. Of course these, too, are Mr. Trump’s positions. Mr. Presley readily acknowledges that Mr. Trump is a billionaire with an Ivy League education. “But he gets that the country is in bad shape.” Mr. Presley said. “Sure, he made some mistakes and sometimes he went a little overboard, but the guys I work with related to it. If we spoke in public, we’d make mistakes too.” To them, it’s not only the country that’s in bad shape. So are the institutions that once provided structure to working-class life in America. Many Carrier workers are regular churchgoers, but Ms. Hargrove said she was deeply troubled by how priests abused children, or how the police shot suspects even though their arms were raised in the air. “Things are chaotic,” she said. The distrust is evident even within the Steelworkers union, another institution that once provided a support system for workers. Mr. Roell is leery of area leaders like Mr. Jones of Local 1999, who had battles of his own with the union’s top officials over their support for Mrs. Clinton. A fierce supporter of Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton’s rival for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Jones and Local 1999 did not make an endorsement in the general election. “I held my nose and voted for her,” he said between drags on a Marlboro at the local’s union hall. “I didn’t trust her a bit. I told people she would flip on trade deals after she was elected.” “I’m as left-wing as you can find, and I thought Trump was full of it,” he said. “But everybody is tired of the same old politicians. It could have been Captain Kangaroo and he might have won.” As for the candidate who did win, Mr. Trump, the union leader said he was waiting for him to make that phone call to Carrier. “He’s got time. He doesn’t take the oath of office until Jan. 20,” Mr. Jones said. “Trump made Carrier the poster child and said he would hold Carrier accountable. Well, we’re going to hold him to it.” Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from The New York Times United Offers Cheaper Airfare, but It’ll Cost You a Carry-On The New York Times The Coal Industry Isn’t Coming Back The New York Times What’s Organic?

Many of the nation’s major mall operators and the big retailers that anchor them, such as Toys R Us, J.C. Penney, and Macy’s, are sticking with what they want to be a new tradition, kicking off the holiday shopping season on Thanksgiving Day. Others, including the Mall of America, the nation’s largest shopping mall, are closing for Thanksgiving this year after being open for the past several years. Some retailers that are closing cite respect for the holiday, but in truth the cost of being open may be more than the return. “Once you let the genie out of the bottle, it’s hard,” said Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, a mall operator that is closing 72 of its malls for the day. “More retailers are coming to their senses and realizing it is a family holiday and from a business point of view, it’s not making much business sense.” Stores being open on Thanksgiving started in earnest in 2011 and took a punch out of sales on Black Friday, which had usually launched the shopping season. Many places like Macy’s, Target and J.C. Penney have been opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving as they try to outdo others to get first dibs on customers who could easily buy online. But the move has been controversial, as many workers have voiced complaints that stores are putting profits over workers’ time to be with their families. Some 89 of the 145 properties that Chattanooga, Tennessee-based CBL owns or has interest in opened at 6 p.m. on the holiday last year. While dozens of those will be closed this year, the department stores, movie theaters, restaurants and retailers with exterior entrances have the option to open on Thanksgiving. Other retailers including Office Depot and consumer electronics chain hhgregg Inc. plan to be closed after being open for the past several years. Plenty of retailers, particularly high-end stores like Nordstrom or those like T.J. Maxx that offer discounts every day, never opened on Thanksgiving and have collected goodwill because of that. In reality, analysts say, it’s all about stealing share in a market that isn’t growing that much. For department stores, the competition is fierce. Last year, J.C. Penney opened at 3 p.m. for the first time, three hours earlier than its rivals Kohl’s and Macy’s. That may have hurt Macy’s, which had a weak holiday season and aims to reverse a sales slump. This year, Macy’s decided to open an hour earlier at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. Penney is sticking to 3 p.m., while Kohl’s will be opening again at 6 p.m. Most Sears stores will be open on Thanksgiving for the fourth year in a row, starting at 6 p.m. — the same as a year ago. Best Buy, the nation’s largest consumer electronics chain, suffered over Thanksgiving weekend in 2012 because it didn’t open until midnight, while stores like Wal-Mart and Target began their sales earlier in the evening. Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy have not announced their plans for this Thanksgiving weekend. But all indications are they’ll start the doorbuster sales on the holiday. For many big retailers, covering expenses like paying employees holiday pay is not that costly, said Joel Bines, a managing director at retail consulting group AlixPartners. But for small stores or those with specialized merchandise, it may make more sense to close. AlixPartners also found for that some retailers who did open on Thanksgiving were simply pulling Friday sales a day earlier and their profit margins took a hit. Bob Riesbeck, president and CEO of hhgregg, says business on Thanksgiving actually declined over the previous two years when it opened at 4 p.m. CBL’s Lebovitz says when he surveyed stores in the company’s malls this year before deciding to close, the reaction was “overwhelmingly positive,” particularly with the specialty stores. The big anchors plan to stay open. Last year, the reaction was different. Most of the specialty stores wanted to be open. “They didn’t have enough data” to make the decision,” he said. Andy Mantis, executive vice president of NPD Group Checkout Tracking, says stores should open on both Thanksgiving and Black Friday to maximize their sales. The company, which analyzes receipt data to understand consumer behavior, found that the share of buyers who shopped on both days declined, while the number who shopped only on Thanksgiving Day or on Black Friday increased. Mantis believes specialty retailers, especially those near big stores like Macy’s that are open, should think again about whether to stay closed. “It is a heavy promotion time,” Mantis said. “People are buying, and they’re not always willing to go to multiple stores.” Doug Hanneman Follow Doug Hanneman Close Get email notifications on Doug Hanneman daily!

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Doctors Grow New Ear On Man’s Arm For Transplant Posted: Nov 13 2016, 2:58am CST | by Hira Bashir, Updated: Nov 13 2016, 3:03am CST, in News | Latest Science News   Credit: China Daily   Once fully grown, the ear will be attached to patient's head, who lost his ear in a car accident Chinese doctors have successfully grown an ear on Man’s arm in a breakthrough surgery. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock The doctors took pieces of rib cartilage, carved them into the shape of an ear and inserted it on one of the arms of the patient. The ear will be removed from the arm and attached to the patient’s head once fully grown. The patient, only identified as Ji, has lost his right ear in a car accident a year ago. Ji sustained serious injuries in the right side of his face including losing his ear and had to undergo numerous surgical operations to restore his facial skin and cheeks. But patient Ji, who is in his 30s, was frustrated about his torn off ear and wants to get it back.  Guo Shuzhong, an expert in reconstructive surgery, devised a three-step surgical plan for the patient.  Artificial ear grown on patient's arm to replace ear lost in traffic accident in China's Xi'an pic.twitter.com/RLaNcXxExm— CCTVNEWS (@cctvnews) November 9, 2016 In the first phase, doctors inserted a skin expander in the patient’s right arm and regularly injected water to expand the skin. In the second phase, which was successfully done on Tuesday, doctors took pieces of cartilage from the patient’s chest and buried them under the expanded skin. The third phase will be transplanting new ear onto patient’s head, which may take three to four months before the organ is fully grown, China Daily reports. Doctor Guo Shuzhong also carried out the first facial transplant operation in China in 2006 when a disfigured man was given a new cheek, upper lip, nose and an eyebrow. Guo reveal that the most difficult part of the latest surgery was the carving as ear has dozens of anatomical structures and is considered to be a complicated component of our body. The reconstructive surgery was performed at the affiliated hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University in Xi'an, Shaanxi province.

View Profile Image: Getty/Westend61 Print Is there a not-totally-rude way to tell friends and family what my kid wants? Share Tweet Pin Share Tumble Combined comments & shares on social media Welcome back to Parental Advisory, where I answer all of your social media and IRL parenting etiquette questions. This week, let's talk about birthday parties and gift requests. Question: Is there any reasonable, sane way to request certain gifts for your kid's birthday? My husband and I are both teachers so we have some notion of the kinds of things we want or don't want our kid to play with (basically anything that will wind him up like a crazy person) and we live in a tiny apartment so we don't want to house a lot of random things after a birthday or holiday. However, we don't want to dictate what people who love our son give him for his birthday. Is getting what you get just part of life? Or is there anything we can say or do to guide gift giving? Also, is saying "no gifts please" pretentious or a relief for the gift giver? Part of the issue here is that I'm not really sure how to transmit that kind of information in a non-tacky way. If we said no gifts, it would be a simple single line on the invite. If we had more specific requests about gifts, I'm not sure I would ever have the chutzpah to actually detail that anywhere — I'd just hope people reach out and ask. What are your thoughts? — A reader Answer: Children's gifts are a touchy subject for many parents. Some parents don't want their kids to play with toys made of toxic or disposable materials. Others wish their in-laws understood that a giant bag of crap from Walmart isn't going to be "extra-appreciated" just because there's twice as much stuff. Kids today already have a lot of stuff. And parents, too, are in the regular routine of purchasing new, better, shinier or even just "updated to legal code" items for their kids (such as car seats, strollers, etc.). One minute you're a mom buying her child the latest and greatest toy, crib or travel essential, and the next it's being widely recalled due to some kid getting her pinky stuck in it. More: The coolest subscription boxes for kids who love getting mail Parents have long felt a societal, commercial pressure to lavish their kids with mountains of distractions. We see this play out on birthdays as well as on holidays like Christmas and Easter, which have become synonymous with "give your kid an entire store's worth of stuff day." Black Friday has turned parents into crazed, bull-stomping maniacs. Everyone is encouraged to own as much stuff as possible, and some parents take pride in showing off their children's semi-annual bounties on social media. They stack up their kids' presents to create gift walls and share photos online to "say thank you" to those who purchased them, but really they're just #humblebragging about how much stuff their kids got. This combines to either make parents feel like they need to keep up with the Joneses and shower their kids with more stuff, or feel like they want to give up all material possessions and go live as monks in the woods for the next 18 years. Image: STFU Parents Hence, I understand the impulse to try to control what or how much kids get for their birthday, Christmas and so on. It's not that parents don't appreciate their friends' and relatives' efforts or intentions; they just don't want to have to grit their teeth, over and over again, as their kid opens yet another useless toy that makes a bunch of noise and will probably break in a week. The desire to avoid owning too much kid stuff makes perfect sense. Unfortunately, though, my answer to this question is that "getting what you get is just part of life." While it's possible that parents will one day be able to request that friends and family donate to an education fund in lieu of tangible gifts — just as couples do with honeymoon funds when they forgo a traditional registry — that day is not today. Today, it's impolite to tell people what to buy or avoid for your kids, and it's even impolite to institute a "no gifts" policy because it might hurt someone's feelings and be taken the wrong way. Those in-laws who spend $50 on a haul of cheap toys are not going to understand and sympathize with someone who lives in a tiny apartment and doesn't want their kid to have more annoying gadgets, stuffed animals or plastic garbage. They might even get offended. And honestly, it might make some people feel kind of weird not to bring a gift to a child's birthday party. Sure, guests are there to celebrate the kid, but most children's birthday parties don't feel complete without a modest pile of presents sitting near the cake. As much as it pains me to say it, I don't think parents should formally ask party invitees to consider any special gift-related requests, and no convenient Amazon or Toys "R" Us wish list will change my mind on this subject — for now. More: 15 gifts for kids that won't make their parents hate you That being said, there are a few upsides to keep in mind. For starters, it's always fine to return or donate unwanted items, just as thousands of parents have done before. This might seem like a pain in the ass, but if you get your kid involved in the donation process and use it as an opportunity to explain that we don't need all the things we think we want, it could become a nice tradition. Maybe your child is too young to learn these lessons today, but soon enough, he will understand and hopefully enjoy the act of giving as much as he does receiving. You can also let friends or family know your thoughts when they do ask you what to buy for him, and inevitably some people will. It's a good idea to prepare a wish list in advance for those people, so you're able to quickly reply when they ask (or just tell them that they don't need to bring a gift at all!). Certain people, like very close friends and family, probably won't be offended if you decide to reach out to them individually, but keep it casual so they don't worry about doing something "wrong." Lastly, you're welcome to skip my advice altogether, do whatever you want and just see what happens at this birthday party to help inform your decision-making process for future birthday parties. It's entirely possible that people would love to be told not to bring gifts — you could even be starting a new trend! Just be careful when making specific requests like "he hates the color green, please no clothes unless they're hand-sewn, no T-shirts with giraffes or elephants (not his favorite animals), no robots (he hates them) and no trucks (he loves them but we're trying to vary his interests)," because that's the shit people hate. Similarly, try not to outline exactly what you (or you son) would like people to gift because that leaves little room for joy on the side of the gift-giver. If every gift has to be artisanal, organic and eco-friendly, just suggest some stores or Etsy pages that sell what you're seeking. Demands and parties don't tend to pair well together. Image: STFU Parents Regardless of how you choose to approach the situation, know that you're not alone in feeling this way, and remember to feel lucky that you know so many people who might want to give your son a gift for his birthday. Even if you don't always love watching/helping your kid open a bunch of unnecessary gifts that will take up space and/or drive you crazy and/or wind up in a landfill, they'll make his whole day, and eventually, should you choose to donate them, they'll make some other kid's day too.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Area rancher attends sustainability summit Saturday Nov 12, 2016 at 10:00 AM A Southeastern Colorado rancher is getting a unique opportunity to represent the cow-calf industry at an agricultural sustainability summit this week held far beyond the state’s borders. By Candace Krebs Contributing Writer A Southeastern Colorado rancher is getting a unique opportunity to represent the cow-calf industry at an agricultural sustainability summit this week held far beyond the state’s borders. Steve Wooten, who runs 300 cows on the Beatty Canyon Ranch near Kim, was scheduled to appear in conversation Wednesday with the senior director of global supply chain management for McDonald's during a packed two-day conference of lectures and moderated panel discussions. “I don’t think we’ll surprise each other too much, but you never know,” he said prior to the event. “When you share your story, you never know who might be hearing it for the first time or isn’t aware of what it takes to get something done. There are elements of their business where we as ranchers probably have very little awareness.” The Sustainable Ag Summit held in Atlanta, Georgia, was hosted by the dairy industry in partnership with multiple crop and livestock alliances and included many international companies that buy, sell and process agricultural commodities, such as Wal-Mart and General Mills. While the concept of sustainability is challenging on many levels and is vigorously opposed by some producer groups, Wooten said cattle producers need a mechanism to demonstrate what they are doing right. “I think we need to take a critical analysis of each segment of our industry and share that collectively, regardless of where we are at in the system,” he said. “We need a way to say: Here’s where our strengths are, here’s our weaknesses and let’s fix them.” When the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Beef was first organized a year and a half ago in Denver, Wooten attended the meeting and quickly signed up as a member. He said it made sense to him to have a seat at the table and try to influence the process in a way that would help keep ranchers on the land. “People are part of the four main legs of sustainability, as we define it, and we need viable economies and people on working landscapes to get this done,” he said. The U.S. beef roundtable spent the past year identifying sustainability indicators and metrics that could be used to evaluate progress in those areas, Wooten said. “We’re turning that over to a verification working group that will look at the key elements and decide how to measure the progress we are making,” he explained. Looking for and making small improvements is something cattlemen do every day, he said. He gave the example of dust clouds that often obscure roadways next to feedlots. “Feedlots are so important to our rural communities, but we do have an air quality problem associated with that. Do we have some tools in place we can use to reduce that issue? That’s just a small example of what we’re working on,” he said. “It’s not going to be a regulatory mechanism, it’s industry driven, and that’s the whole point of this.” Wooten pointed out that taking a proactive approach to public concerns had already been successful in the conservation arena. He cited private and civil interests working together on measurable outcomes in helping to keep the lesser prairie chicken and the sage grouse from being placed on the federal endangered species list. “We all know this works better than a regulatory approach,” he said. “When you have everybody from the cow-calf producer to the biggest retailers in the world all sitting together at the same table and sharing the projects they’re working on, it’s hard for a regulatory body to come in and run over everybody.” The two-day Atlanta conference was billed as the first time crop and livestock agriculture came together in the same venue with large merchandizers, processors and retailers to share sustainability efforts that are happening all across the food supply chain. “Beef is not the only industry going through a sustainability analysis, many of the others are doing the same thing,” Wooten said. “There’s no reason to re-invent the wheel each time.” The big player on the crop production side is Field to Market, an alliance of hundreds of members that includes numerous commodity organizations, crop protection companies, recreational and wildlife groups and universities like Colorado State. Participants at the summit this past week also included sustainable investment companies, specialty crop producers and distributors, federal agencies like the Natural Resources Conservation Service and nongovernmental organizations like the Nature Conservancy.

Tips for getting deals for the Black Friday weekend Associated Press 4 days ago By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO, AP Retail Writer Click to expand Replay Video 48.7 million Americans to travel this Thanksgiving AAA says 48.7 million Americans will be traveling this Thanksgiving. CNBC Facebook, Google enact new policies to fight fake news Two of the world’s biggest internet companies, Google and Facebook, are taking new steps to fight the rising tide of fake news.

Amid the clutter of deals clamoring for attention, smart and careful shoppers can come out ahead. Many stores are increasing their inventory so as not to frustrate shoppers. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is increasing the number of products for online orders by 50 percent for the holiday kickoff compared to a year ago. "Start researching and planning," says Benjamin Glaser, features editor with DealNews.com, a deal comparison website. Click ahead for four ways to get the most out of Black Friday weekend — and beyond. 1. Study up © Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg      Make a comprehensive list of what you plan to buy, research what those items usually sell for at full price and on sale, and figure out how much you want to spend. Also check out store fliers from previous years online, since many retailers repeat the same deals at the same price. Eighty percent of the products and 43 percent of the prices highlighted on the front pages of the 2015 and 2014 Black Friday fliers of Best Buy, Macy's, Target, Kohl's, Walmart and J.C. Penney were the same, says Market Track LLC, a price tracking firm. Make sure to note at what times different stores plan to start their Black Friday deals — both online and at the store. For example, J.C. Penney is making its deals available on its website on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving for the first time. It will open its doors on Thanksgiving at 3 p.m., the same time as last year. Kohl's offered last Thursday a subset of the Black Friday deals that will be available for Thanksgiving, when it opens its doors at 6 p.m. For the first time, it will offer "doorbusters" online starting on Thanksgiving while supplies last. In the past, doorbusters were only at the store. Wal-Mart and Target will again start their sales at their stores at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, the same as last year. Best Buy will open its doors at 5 p.m., also the same. And they'll all offer their deals earlier that day online. Wal-Mart's will begin at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving, earlier than last year. Target says that starting this Wednesday through this Thursday, its Black Friday early access sale will allow customers to shop a selection of Black Friday deals on its website; new this year, shoppers can get them in all stores via its Cartwheel savings app. 2. Look at the whole season © The Associated Press     Retailers have been starting to spread their offers out, with some starting well before Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart and Amazon.com both kicked off holiday deals on thousands of items. Still, there's a good chance you can get a better deal on Thanksgiving for certain items. DealNews.com says 38 percent of the specials pushed on the holiday were what the site considered top deals, compared to only 31 percent for Black Friday. But not every deal is the best on Thanksgiving. DealNews.com says it's likely better to buy cameras, TVs, tablets and major appliances on Thanksgiving, and tools on Black Friday. On the Monday after Thanksgiving, known as Cyber Monday, is also a good day for shoppers to get deep discounts on clothing and laptops. Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track, says that Monday is also a good time to buy laptops, small appliances and toys and games, based on an analysis of more than 1,400 listings across Amazon, Best Buy, Kmart, Sears, Target and Wal-Mart. "It's to the shoppers' benefit to do their homework to ensure they are getting the best deal," Gregorski said. 3. Use apps and rewards © Walmart     Strategize how to leverage the store rewards points you already have or holiday bonus offers. Look for the apps that work well for you. For example, Flipp recreates the traditional print fliers experience so you don't have to sift through all the weekly store fliers  — and not just on Black Friday. DealNews Black Friday keeps track of specials throughout the holiday season too. Plenty of retailer apps offer customers special discounts. Customers who use the Staples app will have gotten a sneak peek of the Black Friday deals, which started Sunday, and will be able to see the latest specials throughout the season. And Wal-Mart is making its Black Friday circular available starting this Thursday through its app. 4. Think past the holidays © Ron Antonelli/Bloomberg     If you don't need items by the holiday — or aren't seeing some friends and relatives until afterward, shoppers might do better waiting to buy toys and clothing like sweaters and coats until the end of the season. That lets them take advantage of clearance sales, says Glaser. For clothing, discounts are on average of 40 percent over the Thanksgiving weekend, but at the end of the season, they go to 70 percent.

Word that a Jimmy John’s was opening in Payson began in the summer of 2015 when a coming-soon sign was posted on a fence by an empty lot south of Walmart. Those plans never came to fruition reportedly due to issues with roadway improvements. On Tuesday, Election Day, the Payson Jimmy John’s finally opened its doors in the former location of Cousins Subs, 303 E. Highway 260. More than half a dozen workers were busy making subs Tuesday as word quickly spread around town. Jimmy John’s claims to fame include its French bread, made daily and usually less than four hours old; and its speedy delivery. Manager Zach Knight said bread makers are in by 5 a.m. While the store officially opens at 11 a.m., they usually unlock the doors much earlier, sometimes at 8 or 9 a.m., or whenever the bread is ready. The store also begins taking orders as early as 9:30 a.m. Delivery costs $1 per sub. The delivery area includes most of Payson, from Payson High School east to Tyler Parkway and Airport Road south to Green Valley Parkway. Knight said they keep the delivery area tight so they can offer “freaky fast” delivery. The store is looking to hire a few more delivery drivers. Menu items include $4.99, eight-inch sub sandwiches, $6.49 giant club sandwiches and $3.59 slims. To order, call 928-474-2221 or visit www.jimmyjohns.com. Jimmy John’s is open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday.

The country mice got their cheese. The town mice are afraid for their children's futures. Steelworker Glen Bailey and his wife are looking forward to how Trump will help their pocketbooks. Courtesy of Glen Bailey "It's gonna be a good Christmas," said 44-year-old Indiana steel worker Glen Bailey. He's already planning on taking his wife on their first cruise, thanks to his candidate winning. His company gives out stock bonuses during the holidays. Shares jumped 28 percent the day after Trump was elected. Exit polls show that while Hillary Clinton won 59 percent of large cities, Trump won 62 percent of small city or rural areas. Where consumers lived determined how the election broke and how they felt their own bottom line would be impacted. Gary Burtless, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said it would "ding consumer pocketbooks" if Trump succeeds in building a tariff wall against Mexico and China — or a physical wall to keep out immigrants — leading to higher prices and fewer shoppers.

If we slap 40 percent tariffs on them, we'll pay more," said Burtless. "If we have a smaller number of immigrants, that will also boost the prices of goods and services that U.S. consumers buy," by making it harder to supply cheap labor, he told NBC News. But in Trump country, the mood is jubilant. Galvanized steelworkers Bailey didn't vote for the President-elect's social rhetoric, as "some things you think but don't say," but rather the manufacturing boost. He hopes Trump will stop "gangster" Chinese from dumping cheap poor quality steel on the market, cut his taxes, and repeal Obamacare; but he also acknowledged the challenges Trump faces in enacting his vision. "Mr. Trump will have to deliver on his promises," said Bailey. "If he doesn't, he's going to be remembered as a dumpster fire." Hopeful farmers On his way to pick strawberries and castrate some pigs, Brandon Whitt, 37, said he hoped Trump will help him hand down his Tennessee family farm to the ninth generation. Brandon Whitt with Mary, his 2nd eldest of four children. He hopes Trump will open up more opportunities for farmers like himself. Courtesy of Brandon Whitt "We need those American-made products," he said. He's hoping for relief on the death tax and a curbing of EPA regulations so that his 2,400-acre farm can afford to keep raising hogs and growing soybeans, wheat, and small grains he sells locally and on the global market. But Whitt didn't vote for Trump. Refusing to choose between the "lesser of two evils" he "voted with his heart" and wrote in John Kasich. Still he said he is "extremely pleased" with the final election results. "I saw a rural America, blue-collar, hat-wearing Americans that get out and work with their hands that stood up and expressed themselves," said Whitt. "We gathered in churches and communities all across the countryside and we voted for what we thought provided a better opportunity for our families and our country as a whole." He hopes for more available and affordable loans for farmers, competitive trade deals, and closer ties between the urban and agricultural worlds. "I walked into an 8th grade job fair last Friday and one of the first questions I got was from a girl who asked why I didn't wear overalls," said Whitt. "There's a huge disconnect." Disappointed mothers Bridging the gap between farmers and cities isn't as much a priority for Kimberly Coerr, a 47-year-old single mother and marketing professional from Maclean, Virginia whose ex-husband is a Marine Corps officer. She said she's worried about her 401(k), and for her three boys, ages 11, 12 and 16. Single mother Kimberly Coerr said she's less worried about kitchen table issue and more about about explaining Trump's behavior to her kids who think he's "funny." Courtesy of Kimberly Coerr "I do worry he's going to be a destabilizing factor for the economy," she said of Trump. "That means working longer than I would want to for my retirement age, or not being as secure." While she won't turn down a tax cut, she says she knows that tax cuts generally benefit the wealthy and powerful. And she's not excited about the talk of deregulating the banks or rolling back consumer protections. Trump has promised to repeal the Dodd-Frank act put into place after the 2008 financial crisis. The act prohibits commercial banks from making investments bets with their own deposits, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and other regulatory reform to prevent banks from imploding so destructively. "Released from restrictions they can put us in another case where banks can run rampant and fail and hurt us all over again," said Coerr.

Caregiver Dianne Louis fears for her family's wages and immigration status. BA Photography / Courtesy Dianne Louis Dianne Louis, a 49-year-old nanny, arrived in Brooklyn, New York, from the Caribbean 26 years ago with a grant and aspirations to be a model. But when she got here the agencies were asking for too much money up front to get started. So she gave up and started working in childcare. Now she's worried about being deported. Though she pays taxes, she says she's not "fully" documented and one of her sons is enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Passed by Obama, It allows certain children who entered the country before they were 16 and before 2010 to get a 2-year work permit and be exempt from deportation. Trump has promised to roll back the policy. And while the president-elect's immigration rhetoric has largely focused on Hispanics and Muslims, Louis said she's not waiting around for Trump to get to immigrants like her sons, who are in school but who contribute to the household income with part-time jobs. "I will not let them deport him," said Louis. "We are already thinking ahead... we gotta ship our stuff, gotta buy airline tickets..."

So their plan is to give Trump a year and, "if things are terrible just quit and go back home." In a couple of years when her boys are old enough to be on their own, "they could move back," she said, and the next generation could give the American Dream another shot. "That's what's going to have to be done."

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Donald Trump's Climate Change Cynic Takes On The EPA Transition Posted: Nov 12 2016, 3:22am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images Trump has a Main Man who will Do Away with Obama’s Environmental Achievements   It looks like Donald Trump has a main man who will do away with Obama’s environmental achievements. Donald Trump and the EPA don’t exactly see eye to eye. He has openly shown his hatred of this agency. Trump even went so far as to say that this organization had fallen to levels of disgrace during President Obama’s eight years in office. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock Trump calls what Obama worked so hard to achieve as a load of useless regulations. He wants to roll back the whole environmental plan and make America great again. Oil, coal and gas will once again have their heyday thanks to Trump. The main man who will carry out Trump’s power agenda is Myron Ebell. This individual has been a long-term opponent of what he terms is the over-doing of the environmental spiel. Global warming is just another word to him for big government and so both ought to be done away with. Ebell wants to open up lands for logging purposes and wants to dig deeper for oil and gas. Also coal will be mined in an intensive manner if he and Trump have their way. Ebell also wants the United States to reject the Paris Agreement on climate change, according to NYTimes. This man has for many years been active in the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). This is a conservative group that receives funding from ExxonMobil. Another agency which has funded CEI is Donors Trust. This agency is supported by Koch Industries. Ebell by the way is not a scientist. This means that much of what he operates on is mere hearsay. He is against any talk regarding environmental protection. Also he wants the USA to go full steam ahead into hyper-industrialization instead of energy rationing. Thus he cuts a fine figure for a president like Trump. Trump has called global warming a hoax, according to WashingtonPost. Ebell refused to be interviewed recently and is keeping the whole matter regarding his role among Trump’s cronies hushed up. Yet he will surely play a crucial role since he fits the bill. The top priorities of both Trump and Ebell match each other down to the last details. Trump wants energy independence for the United States. The new POTUS will even carry the mission of greater fossil fuel usage to offshore areas. While Trump has said that he will see to it that the beauty of some of our natural wilderness regions are conserved, how he plans on carrying this out with Ebell on board is a mystery wrapped in an enigma.

The NES Classic Edition is a mini-fied version of the original Nintendo Entertainment System, only it does not use cartridges and comes with 30 classic NES games pre-installed. The NES surrounded many of our childhood years and the item is already showing much popularity. The item went on sale today at Best Buy, Game Stop, and Target stores in the US (with more retailers like Walmart coming soon), as well as Amazon online. The item is already sold out at the retailers mentioned above. Many have seen people waiting at the store before it opened to ensure they get their hands on it. Likewise, there is no stock left on Amazon and the device is completely sold out online. The Amazon page for the NES Classic went live at around 5PM EST this afternoon, in mere minutes the item became sold out on Amazon and the items page crashed under the immense demand of thousands of fans trying to get their hands on one. Thats a huge deal since Amazons resources are pretty capable of handling immense amounts of traffic. As of 6:45PM EST on Nov 11, the page still isn't back up Nintendo of America has tweeted about the items overwhelming demand and has ensured fans that there will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. 1/3 Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) November 11, 2016 There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. 2/3 Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) November 11, 2016 Please contact your local retailers to check availability. A selection of participating retailers can be found @ https://t.co/rMbd6Wacpi 3/3 Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) November 11, 2016 There are already listings on eBay with ridiculous asking prices in the thousands of dollars. Auctions are reaching upwards of $600 for an item that otherwise costs $60. The demand is real with the NES Classic and Nintendo will be making a lot of money this Holiday season.

Riggio complained along with other retailers that the volatile campaign was a massive distraction that kept Americans from shopping. Barnes & Noble, the world's biggest bookstore chain, said it saw the biggest impact on weeknights, when the three major cable TV networks provided a steady diet of talking heads weighing the strengths and weaknesses of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. "We expect a bounce-back," Riggio said in an interview after Trump's unexpected victory. "The preoccupation with the election was hurting sales." VIDEOS TOP JOBS Retail executives are notorious for coming up with excuses for weak sales, from the weather to a fluctuating holiday calendar, and analysts were skeptical of their claims. But in the months leading up to Election Day, Riggio was joined by a chorus of fellow CEOs that included Gap Inc.'s Art Peck, Signet Jewelers Ltd.'s Mark Light, Yum! Brands Inc.'s Greg Creed and Todd Penegor from Wendy's Co. On Thursday, Kohl's Corp. CEO Kevin Mansell joined the fray, saying on an earnings call that the election had been a distraction and that the "certainty" of the outcome would be good for the all-important holiday season. Niccolo Ricci, CEO of Stefano Ricci, a closely held Italian luxury-menswear company, said wealthy people often turn cautious during an election year. That proved to be true in New York, where sales fell during the past few months, according to the company. Ricci said he expects consumer sentiment to improve in the next few weeks. In an effort to get U.S. consumers to turn their attention to Christmas spending, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Best Buy Co. on Thursday announced their store hours for the Black Friday shopping weekend two weeks away. They will open on Thanksgiving day again, as will department stores like Macy's Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. Companies are eager to get their marketing plans back on track. Target held off on running its holiday ads on network TV during the campaign. Instead, the retailer moved them to lifestyle channels like HGTV and the Food Network, where they were less likely to appear alongside negative campaign commercials. With the election over, Target, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Co. on Thursday announced their store hours for the Black Friday shopping weekend. They will open on Thanksgiving day again, as will department stores like Macy's Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. As the election fades, the question of what a Trump presidency might mean for retailers, brands and restaurants remains. The president-elect campaigned on limiting international trade, including by slapping tariffs on goods from China and Mexico. That could increase costs for retailers because they mostly sell foreign-made products, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. "We have to wait and see how these policies unfold," Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren said in an interview. "There's a lot of things that are said in the election process, and then you actually get into office." On the campaign trail, Trump also talked about cutting regulations and corporate taxes, platforms now more likely to pass after Republicans maintained control of both chambers of Congress. "These could be very positive for business and our consumer, and ultimately very positive for Macy's," Lundgren said. Riggio, who founded Barnes & Noble, declined to say for whom he voted, but the 75-year-old entrepreneur said he's seen a lot of presidents come and go and that none has had a profound long-term effect on the bookseller's financial performance. He does, however, expect sales to pick up as the election moves further into the background. "You won't turn a switch and see the whole retail business coming back, but it hit a bottom and it's starting to turn up," Riggio said. "People are going to get on with their lives."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Police: Multiple stabbings at Mountain View High School, suspect in custody Rolly: Utah girl shunned by some in Mormon ward.

IPhone sales are soaring in China, Russia and India. Editorial: China’s high tech will be a challenge to U.S. World-Herald editorial Nov 12, 2016 BLOOMBERG NEWS Apple’s store in Wangfujing, China, is the largest in Asia. IPhone sales are soaring in China, Russia and India. Beijing-based journalist Michael Schuman put his finger this week on a key point regarding China’s global economic position. Schuman wrote: “Instead of acting as the workshop of the world, churning out cheap stuff for Walmart Stores Inc., China intends to create its own national champions to compete with, and even supplant, America’s. Chinese leaders want U.S. consumers to buy Chinese smartphones using Chinese operating systems, instead of Chinese consumers buying those made by Apple Inc.” That’s where the next stage of global competition will take place. Maintaining our competitiveness will depend above all on private industry’s ongoing embrace of innovation and creativity.

Shaun King, social justice writer While the US is no stranger to hate crimes, Trump’s win has made the brash, brasher. We have reproduced disturbing accounts of some victims, being chronicled by Shaun King, senior justice writer for newspaper NY Daily News, on Twitter. Some of the accounts have been edited for clarity and space. We’ve retained the racial slurs, despite being nauseated by them, to expose the intolerance. I’m a nurse at a cardiology office and I put a portable heart monitor on an Iranian Muslim woman, who has been a citizen since 1986. They have wires that connect to a black box the size of a cellphone. She asked me if I had a letter or something she could have so that people wouldn’t think it was a bomb and kill her. She said she is more terrified to live here now than when she was a refugee in Iran. A group of students gathered in the hallway to make a “wall” and did not allow students they felt were of Hispanic descent into their classes and lockers. I am at Walmart. A woman came up to me and pulled my hijab off and said, “This is not allowed anymore. So go hang yourself with it.” Noticed a group of 5th graders chanting. “Build a wall!” Clearly, they were parroting hatred they heard at home. Muslim students of NYU Tandon School of Engineering found ‘Trump’ scrawled on the door of their prayer room I was on the back of the bus and this group of girls gets on. They look around and look at me and said, “Aren’t you people supposed to be sitting in the back of the bus?” I looked around and saw that there were mainly black and Hispanic people sitting in the middle of the bus. I ask this girl to repeat herself and she says, “Aren’t you supposed to be sitting in the back of the bus now? Like Trump is president!” As I’m stopped at a gas station this morning, a group of guys yell over: “Time to get out of this country, Apu!” “Hey Nigger. Pick that up. Keep my streets clean.” At first I wasn’t sure what I heard. Then he repeated it, while his friends egged him on, beckoning me to pick up the ketchup-stained Burger King cup rolling near my feet. I was at a liquor store to get cigs. And a group of white guys ask me if I can speak English. When I chuckled and ignored them, they followed me and said chinks should get out of the country while we still can because a more “pure America is finally going to come back”. When the clerk asked them to leave, they started laughing and called him bin Laden, and said they’d come back to burn him on a cross. Today, I was harassed by an older white man who presumed I was Mexican. “I can’t wait till Trump asks us to rape your people and send you back over to the biggest damn wall we’re going to build. Go back to hell, wet back!” After saying all of that, he threw the water in his cup in my face, gave me the middle finger, and ran off. I’ve never been terrified of being a woman and a minority until today. While pumping gas, I had a vehicle pull up beside me. Out jump four males, all of whom are Caucasian. They proceed to talk about the election and how they are glad that they don’t have to deal with niggers much longer. I just kept quiet. Until one walked over to me and said, “How scared are you, you black bitch. I should just kill you right now, you’re just a waste of air!” I kept my head down. He then proceeds to say, “What, are you deaf or something, you nigger?” Then another guy steps out and shows me his firearm. He says, “Your lucky there’s witnesses. Or else, I’d shoot you right here.” A slur in a toilet in a high school in central Florida, threatening African-American students Tags: Bigotry warned Donald Trump regime Mumbai Related Stories Republicans protest at Donanld Trump's convention International News | 19-Jul-2016 Sikhs raise USD 400k to fight bigotry in the US International News | 27-Feb-2016 Muslim family celebrates Janmashtami in Kanpur People News | 07-Sep-2015 Attack bigotry, not freedom of expression Columnists News | 14-Jan-2015 The bigotry brigade Columnists News | 23-Apr-2014 PHOTO VIDEO Photos: Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani's dinner date in Bandra Birthday special: Sania Mirza's most glamourous Instagram pictures Photos: Alia Bhatt performs live with a rock band in Mumbai Inside Photos!

(KSNW) – It was a horrific crash Friday morning where the only one who survived was the driver of a semi truck. It started with the report of three people shoplifting about $1,100 worth of items from the Newton Walmart. Police spotted one of the two suspect vehicles heading for Hutchinson. Newton police say the car was stolen, and the chase reached speeds of more than a 100 mph. Twenty four miles down the road, the car swerved to miss stop sticks on the highway and crashed into the front of a semi. The two suspects, 27-year-old Wendell Lue Hicks III and his passenger 48-year-old Lee Francis Billinger, were pronounced dead at the scene. KSN sat down with Newton Police Chief Eric Murphy Friday afternoon to talk about their vehicle pursuit policy. Murphy says they have about 10 to 15 factors they take into account before deciding whether or not to pursue a vehicle. “One is the nature of the crime, another would be whether we know who the individuals are that are trying to elude us,” said Murphy. Murphy says other factors include the amount of traffic in the area, the location of the pursuit and the overall general safety of the public. KSN asked, who is responsible for making the call to engage in a pursuit? “It’s kind of a judgement call on the officer based on the information that he has as to whether, what level of crime it is,” said Murphy. Murphy says any member of their command staff has the power to call off a pursuit at any time, if they feel the danger is too high to the public. The chief adds there is no set time limit for how long they pursue a vehicle. KSN asked Murphy, with the suspects vehicle reaching speeds of up to 115 miles per hour, would there have been a point in time under their per policy, to stop the pursuit? “Had we went into a heavily populated area like the city of Hutchinson, we would have probably looked at terminating the pursuit,” said Murphy. Murphy says for simple thefts, like shoplifting, they usually don’t pursue vehicles. KSN asked him to explain, under their policy, why they did in this case? “They attempted to steal $1,100 of property from Walmart, they were also driving a vehicle they had put stolen tags on and so this just wasn’t a regular shoplifting,” said Murphy. Murphy says his staff will be reviewing the incident today to make sure the policies they have in place for vehicle pursuits were followed correctly. He says they review the policy on a one to two year basis, making sure they are utilizing the best practices. The Newton police chase policy limits the number of units they send in a pursuit. They have to make sure some officers remain in the city to deal with local emergencies. Two Newton officers were part of Friday’s pursuit, which is within policy.

Done Editing Tags 53 Comments Share this article 79 79 79 In the search for bright spots in Tuesday’s horrible elections, we can look to Massachusetts, where voters resoundingly rejected the attempt to gut the state’s public schools. Though—or even because—Massachusetts has the best public schools in the nation, massive amounts of money flowed into the state from the likes of the Walmart Waltons, pushing a ballot measure that would have lifted an existing cap on the number of new charter schools allowed to open in the state in a year. That would have siphoned millions of dollars from public schools, even threatening bond ratings for Boston and three other cities. Voters were not having it. Make that: Voters were really not having it. Question 2 was defeated by a 24-point margin, 62 percent to 38 percent. And the map shows just how widespread that opposition was: Of course, charter backers and their unlimited bank accounts are not necessarily deterred by a loss—Washington state voters rejected charter schools three times before the big money finally won out. But the size of their loss in Massachusetts should give the privatizers pause. And the fight to defeat this measure should be an example for future fights elsewhere. 53 Comments Share this article 79 79 79 53 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

'The difference between genius and stupidity is genius has its limits.' - Albert Einstein Home Articles Authors Email Groups Search About Us HOME / Articles / Mike Shedlock / Make Inflation Great Again! Is Trump the 'Inflatio... Make Inflation Great Again! Is Trump the 'Inflation President'? Spotlight on Bonds, Oil, Gold, Attitudes By: Mike Shedlock | Fri, Nov 11, 2016 Share Print Email A near-universal consensus has formed that Donald Trump is the "inflation president". The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, New York Times, Financial Times, Money, and Fortune all say so. I cannot find a mainstream or even a minorstream publication that begs to differ. Bloomberg goes so far as to say "Trump is about to make inflation great again." Are interest rates headed to the moon? Inflation Role Call The Financial Times says Prepare for a Reversal of Monetary Rule Under President Trump. "Historians may come to see 2016 as an economic policy inflection point. Mr Trump is deeply protectionist, reluctant to reform benefits such as Social Security and favours an extensive infrastructure programme. If implemented in full, which seems unlikely, these bold pledges would add $10tn to the public debt in the next decade." Bloomberg reports Investors Are Betting That Trump Will Be the Inflation President. "Trump is about to make inflation great again." The New York Times says The Market Is Betting Trump Will Bring Higher Inflation and Interest Rates. "When the government pours hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure when there is mass unemployment, it can help put those people back to work and turn it into higher economic output without creating inflation. But when nearly all the people who want a job already have one, that spending just bids up the pay of people already working, eventually resulting in higher prices more broadly." Money reports What President Trump Means for Interest Rates -- and Janet Yellen's Job. "A massive increase in fiscal spending to rebuild roads, bridges, and airports, combined with vast deficit-spending in the form of a tax cut, may lead to more money swirling around an already relatively health economy. If you include Trump's threat to impose a new tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods, the cost of goods that Americans buy at Wal-Mart and Costco could rise by about 3%, according Moody's Analytics" The Wall Street Journal reports Donald Trump's Win Fuels Bets on Inflation. "Investors appear enthused by rising inflation expectations, partly because Mr. Trump's election and the shifting makeup of Congress, if nothing else, mean a sharp change from a period in which central banks struggled to spur inflation." Fortune says This Is the Most Important Market Reaction to Donald Trump's Victory. "Forget stocks. The one market reaction that really counts this morning is in the bond market, and its message is: economic reflation is on the way." Bond Market Reaction Curve Watchers' Anonymous provides the following charts. For all the hyperbole, interest rates are barely above December of last year, with yield on 5-year and 10-year bonds actually lower. Crude Not Signaling Inflation If crude is signaling anything, it sure isn't inflation. Gold Gold is down about $140 from the August 1, high. Some say gold does well in inflation. That's an easily disproved notion as gold fell from $850 to $250 from 1980 to 2000 with inflation every step of the way. Gold is more of a reflection on whether or not central banks have things under control. Gold fell from over $1900 to about $1100 when ECB president Mario Draghi made his famous speech: "We will do whatever it takes to save the Euro, and believe me it will be enough." Early this year, people starting seriously doubting whether central banks do indeed have things under control. Here's a hint: they don't. But perception is reality. The spike candle three days during the election was panic that Trump would win followed by realization things would not be so bad after all. In short, gold says little other than there is temporary renewed faith the economy is OK and the Fed is in control. Questions Still Abound Is the economy OK? Is the Fed in Control? Will Donald Trump label China a currency manipulator? Enact huge tariffs? Earlier today, the Financial Times reported EU Set to Impose Punitive Anti-Dumping Tariffs on Imports. Given that was Trump's election mandate as well, it's a reasonable bet he will do the same. Such a move will force prices up. But please look beyond the price hikes. Global Trade War Possibilities Global trade wars loom. And no one wins trade wars. The already high US dollar is at nosebleed levels bound to hurt exports. Tariffs will cost jobs, not protect them. Infrastructure jobs will benefit, provided Republicans hold their noses about bigger and bigger deficits. But those shovel-ready jobs will be slower and fewer than most think. In the end, money will be wasted, as it always is. Will the Fed Hike? Let's assume for a second the Fed hikes and prices rise. Hiking rates due to an artificial and arbitrary stimulus like tariffs may not be a smart thing to do. Rather than looking at prices in a vacuum, one should also look at why prices are rising. Tariffs, like supply shocks due to weather, etc., are not a good reason to hike. Please note that my position does not imply the Fed should not hike. I actually do not know what the Fed should do. Neither does anyone else, including the Fed. We are in this mess because of inane Fed policy and we would be better off if the market set rates, not an arbitrary panel of wizards who have gotten everything wrong at every major juncture, blowing three bubbles in 16 years. Is Trump the "Inflation President"? No one can say for sure, certainly not me. But I do know that history suggests that universal agreement on economic matters is nearly always wrong. The last time The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, New York Times, Financial Times, Money, and Fortune all agreed on something was four days ago. They all thought Hillary would win. They all thought stocks would sink. Now they all tell us inflation is a sure thing! People are sucking in that news like orange slurpies on a 102 degree day. Go figure.     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

It’s toast. At least in the day-after-Thanksgiving and busting-down-the-doors sense. It’s no longer the biggest shopping day of the year and the idea of focusing on one day of in-store shopping is as decrepit as the notion of single-channel shopping itself. There is a new Black Friday (of course there is) and it’s not so much a day, but a state of mind. Consumers shop when they want, where they care to and on the devices they prefer to use. And naturally, retailers are responding. Amazon started its Black Friday sales days ago. Walmart’s online Black Friday is up and running. Target’s, too. Santas in Florida, Arizona, and no doubt elsewhere, are already sitting in malls that have kicked off the now nearly-three-months-long holiday season. And why not? A survey conducted for BloomReach by Survata shows that 42 percent of shoppers start their holiday shopping by Labor Day weekend. More than 6 in 10 say they’ll start by Black Friday at the latest. Adobe says nearly a third of consumers started their holiday shopping before November this year, an increase of 5 percent from last year. But I’m a traditionalist and even if I rarely set foot in a store on Black Friday, I like having the milestone, the marker, that says the holiday shopping season has begun. And so, I’m declaring a new symbolic kickoff. Call it Onyx Friday, a multichannel, mega-start to holiday shopping. The day? November 11. Yes, today. It’s not an arbitrary choice. I have data. In fact, BloomReach data shows that Nov. 11 last year matched Thanksgiving and came within striking distance of Black Friday in online buying. And I have what’s known as thick data — or anecdotal evidence —  to back it up. Call the data/anecdotal evidence combo the sign of a tipping point: Nov. 11 is now a day of voluminous online shopping and holiday hullabaloo in malls that says, when it comes to holiday shopping, we’re all in. First, consider the Santa invasions. A quick internet search finds that shopping centers in Sacramento, Novi, Michigan, and Concord will kick off Santa-mania today. Yes, the jolly old elf will be taking his throne 11 days after Halloween to start the yule madness. “Actually, it’s three or four days later than we normally open it,” says Kim Trupiano, marketing and partnership director of Sunvalley Shopping Center in Concord. She says that the mall’s marketers wanted to wait to kick into the holiday spirit this year until the distraction of the presidential election had passed. But Nov. 11 made sense for other reasons, too. “Friday not only happens to be a great day to kick things off, but it’s a federal holiday,” she says, referring to Veterans Day. “A lot of city offices are closed and the kids are out of school. And we wanted to stay away from the election because we know people are going to be so consumed by that.” Associating no-holds-barred shopping with Veterans Day, a solemn day on which we honor our military veterans, is no doubt disconcerting for some. But Trupiano, whose husband is a Gulf War veteran, says the shopping center incorporates recognition for veterans into the day through discounts and the like. “It’s a big family day. The kids are off. The parents may be off,” she says. “I think it’s going to be a win-win that day.” It’s also a great day for many to kick off online shopping, according to BloomReach data. Last year, we declared Veterans Day the new Black Friday based on data that showed that the day not only had a high number of online orders, but also a high number of shoppers intent on buying. In fact, data from a subset of BloomReach customers indicated that the number of online purchases on Veterans Day last year was virtually the same as those on Thanksgiving Day, another day emerging as a heavy shopping day. And online orders on Veterans Day 2015 fell only 15 percent short of the number on Black Friday. Nearly as important as the number of online orders was the way shoppers behaved on Veterans Day. Last year, my BloomReach colleagues and I designed a proxy for consumer intent. The idea was to see how focused shoppers were on actually buying on a given day, as opposed to browsing. We looked at the ratio of the number of products viewed to the number of purchases. The thinking: The fewer products a shopper looked at before buying, the more focused that shopper was on buying an item on that particular shopping excursion. The red line in the graphic above represents the average number of products consumers looked at in November 2015 before placing an order — or converting, to use the industry term. The blue line represents the number of products viewed on a given day. Dips below the red line represent high-intent-to-buy days. Those above? Low-intent-to-buy. You can see that Veterans Day, Nov. 11, is far and away the day with highest intent to buy. As I said last year: It’s still a little early to declare this new Black Friday a trend based on data. And Nov. 11 also happens to be Singles Day, a huge shopping day in China. The effect on U.S. retailers is hard to discern. All that aside, based on the data, plus anecdotal evidence, it’s hard to argue that the holiday shopping season is not creeping earlier and earlier. No doubt, says Sunvalley’s Trupiano. And for a very good reason, she adds, thinking back to the early days of stores opening up on Thanksgiving Day. “I think if we had gotten any sense that that first Thanksgiving opening was a bust, we might not have done it the next year,” she says. “The last thing you want to do is have all the lights on and have the center open, if people aren’t going to be here. It was so robust that first Thanksgiving. We were like, ‘I guess this was a good idea.’” So, happy Onyx Friday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 5.6% for the week while the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) and Nasdaq (NYSEARCA:QQQ) both added 3.8%.  The Russell 2000 (NYSEARCA:IWM) led the way higher with an impressive 10% gain for the week. Not surprisingly, VIX (NYSEARCA:VXX) the S&P 500 Volatility Index, also known as the “fear index,” plunged dramatically as shown in the chart below. Long VIX ETFs like VXX, TVIX and UVXY were all crushed on the week while XIV, the inverse VIX ETF, rallied hard. While Mr. Trump’s election was initially viewed as a negative, with the Dow futures down some 800 points on election night, the markets have now seemingly decided that Republicans in all three branches of government will be a good thing as tax cuts and infrastructure spending are widely anticipated. For the week, the Federal Reserve took a back seat to the election, but most market analysts expect a gradual rate hike process starting with the meeting in December. Earnings season has also been a positive as earnings growth apparently has returned and outlooks for profits now look positive and could be further boosted by Mr. Trump’s plans to cut corporate tax rates. The upcoming week will have lots of earnings reports including big names like Cisco, Home Depot, Agilent Technologies, Lowes, Applied Materials, BestBuy, GAP and Wal-Mart, among many others. Last week’s economic reports were overshadowed by the election, but November consumer sentiment was notably higher compared to last month’s reading. The upcoming week has a big day on Tuesday with October retail sales and the November empire state index. Wednesday brings October producer prices, November home builder’s index and October industrial production. Thursday has weekly unemployment, October consumer prices and November Philadelphia Fed Friday wraps up the week October leading indicators. VIX Trader Update: VIX Trader remains bullish on equities and bearish on VIX. Current positions include VelocityShares Inverse VIX (NYSEARCA:XIV) and numerous option credit spreads including bear call spreads on iPath Short Term Futures (NYSEARCA:VXX) and bull put spreads on S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA:SPY) A number of options positions are coming to expiration this Friday and new positions will be added this week. (Positions may change at any time.) The last word: Mr. Trump’s surprise win has also surprised global financial markets. The prospect of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and rising corporate profits appears to be paving the way for higher stock prices and lower VIX prices ahead.     Filed Under: News, Trading Gods Blog Back to top ▴ Return to Trading Gods Blog Disclaimer: The content included herein is for educational and informational purposes only, and readers agree to TradingGods.net Disclaimer, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy before accessing or using this or any other publication by TradingGods.net or Ridgeline Media Group, LLC.

Following Alibaba Group’s announcement of a 32 per cent growth in gross merchandise volume to a record 120 billion yuan (US$17.6 billion) for its 24-hour 11.11 promotion last Friday, online shopping rival JD.com on Saturday reported that its total transaction volume increased 59 per cent year on year that same day and 60 per cent over its longer promotions from November 1 to 11, without disclosing figures. Nasdaq-listed JD.com also took the opportunity of launching what is likely to be the world’s first commercial drone delivery programme for e-commerce in rural locations outside of Beijing, as well as those in the provinces of Jiangsu, Shaanxi and Sichuan. JD has a fleet of more than 30 custom-built drones in operation, which can transport and deliver packages weighing between five to 15 kilos and cover distances as far as 50 kilometres. Its service has been launched ahead of the planned Amazon Prime Air unmanned aerial delivery system that Amazon.com chief executive Jeff Bezos first revealed in 2013. That plan has remained in the testing stage as Amazon tries to comply with US Federal Aviation Administration rules. JD spokesman Josh Gartner told the South China Morning Post, which is owned by Alibaba, that the company has obtained government permission for its drone delivery programme, and now plans to regularly operate in more than 100 routes across the mainland by the first half of next year. “I don’t think anyone else is doing this [drone delivery service],” Gartner said. Beijing-based JD is China’s second largest online retail services provider by sales. It directly sells products from its own inventory, like Amazon, and operates online marketplaces where major brands and retailers sell their merchandise. Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings, which runs mobile messaging service WeChat and social network QQ, bought a 15 per cent stake in JD.com for US$214.7 million in 2014. American retail titan Wal-Mart Stores last month increased its holding in JD to 10.8 per cent, up from 5.9 per cent, according to a United States regulatory filing. According to JD, its research and logistics innovation laboratory, JDX, developed its drone programme for rural China to make the delivery of goods from warehouses to customers quicker, cheaper and more efficient. The programme works by dispatching orders from regional delivery stations to JD’s network of dedicated “village promoters”, who distribute orders directly to customers. JD currently has more than 300,000 village promoters across the country. “E-commerce is bringing goods to consumers in a more convenient and cost-effective way, and is a very meaningful channel to increase domestic consumption,” Jessie Qian, partner-in-charge for consumer markets at consultancy KPMG China, said in a report on Friday. JD said its drones are controlled by a proprietary system, connected to its logistics network, that allows the devices to take off automatically and follow a pre-determined route to a village and the designated drop-off points where JD’s local village promoter pick up goods.

The racist, sexist, immigrant-bashing, woman-molesting Trump would be the next CEO of the United States and commander-in-chief of U.S. imperialism. In deep shock and disbelief, tens of millions asked, how could this happen? In Muslim, Latino, African American and immigrant families there was raw fear. Soon mass protests began, with many chanting “Not My President” (as if Democrat Clinton, a certified warmonger, would have been?). At the same time, racist incidents multiplied. It is urgently necessary to fight back, but the question is how? The answer depends on understanding what happened, and why. Trump certainly mobilized the hard-core racist vote, and better-off middle class voters. But what put him over the top was the vote of residents of dying small towns and white workers in the Rust Belt, who have seen their jobs destroyed and cities devastated. The fact is that with their economic policies, the Democrats pushed millions of workers into the arms of Trump. What is urgently needed is to break from the Democrats, Republicans and all capitalist parties and build a class-struggle workers party. Such a party would fight for a program of mass workers action against the deportations, for workers defense guards against racist attacks, and to oppose the imperialist war drive in a struggle leading to workers revolution.   November 2016 Post-Traumatic Election Shock To Defeat Trump … And the Democrats Fight for Workers Revolution Internationalist Group protests Trump and the Democrats, Los Angeles, November 9.  (Internationalist photo) NOVEMBER 10 – The effect of Tuesday’s election was a thunderbolt in the night sky. After all the media happy talk, even into the early evening, that Democrat Hillary Clinton was a shoo-in – the first woman president following the first black president – suddenly it was clear that Republican Donald Trump was elected. The racist, sexist, immigrant-bashing, woman-molesting Trump would be the next CEO of the United States and commander-in-chief of U.S. imperialism. By the next morning tens of millions were asking, in deep shock and disbelief, how could this happen? And in Muslim, Latino, African American and immigrant families there was raw fear. So what is to be done? The big business media are all praising the “orderly peaceful transfer of power.” President Barack Obama says of Trump, “We are all now rooting for his success.” In her concession speech, Clinton said, “We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.” That tells the billionaire bully he can walk all over opposition. We say hell no! Those who are targets of the victorious race-haters and labor-haters must fight them down the line, or else we will pay “big league.” The Democrats hand over the reins of power “graciously” because they and the Republicans all represent the same capitalist class against us, the workers and oppressed.  For many the election result was like a horror film, a scene out of The Night of the Living Dead. The message: Be afraid, be very afraid. In school Wednesday, Latino students fearfully asked their teachers: what will happen to me, will my parents be deported? Immigrants rights activists reported a torrent of phoned death threats. Groups of racists yelled “time to get out of this country” at random Middle Easterners. Muslim women feared to wear the hijab, the Islamic head scarf. A prominent African American spokesman, former Obama advisor Van Jones proclaimed it was the #Whitelash, recalling the racist backlash against the civil rights movement. Soon protests began: thousands of young people across the country have been marching. The most common slogan was “Not My President,” along with “Dump Trump” and “Racist, sexist, anti-gay, Donald Trump go away.” But Trump is the victor in the bourgeois elections – always rigged to ensure the selection of a defender of capital – and he isn’t going away because thousands or tens of thousands chant it. The slogans showed a yearning for Clinton (sometimes explicit, like numerous signs in New York, “Still Stronger Together”). And they expressed patriotic liberal democratic illusions – the idea that this is “our country” when in fact it belongs to the capitalists. So the issue is posed: it is urgently necessary to fight back, but how? With right-wing Republicans in control of all three branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial) – from the White House to both houses of Congress, the Supreme Court and most state houses – even staid Democratic politicians and pundits are talking about electoral “disaster,” “apocalypse” and “resistance.” But here there is a fundamental class difference: for working people and the oppressed it is necessary to oppose all parties of capital, to dump both the Democrats and The Donald. So in order to resist, we must first understand what happened, and why. Ask yourself: would there be this traumatic shock, would there be these mass protests if the Democrat had been elected? Of course not, because for many of those marching, even if they didn’t vote for her, Hillary Clinton was in some way a “lesser evil” than the consummately evil Donald Trump. Not so. As the Internationalist Group said on our website, it was “the ‘choice’ between the candidate most likely to set off a racist pogrom (Donald Trump for the Republicans) and the candidate most likely to start World War III (the Russia-phobic Democrat Hillary Clinton).” So why was Trump elected? Liberal commentators portray it as simply the victory of rampant racism, particularly of white workers. No one could miss Trump’s blatantly racist appeals, and the 50% of voters who voted for him at the very least went along with that. The Ku Klux Klan and various Nazi outfits enthusiastically backed him. But the hard-core racist vote is much smaller – maybe a quarter of the electorate – and has been violently attacking Obama since 2008. Trump also won the votes of better-off middle class sectors (the average Trump voter had a family income of $72,000), as the Republicans generally do. But what put Trump over the top were the others, residents of rural towns whose youth are leaving because they have no future there, and workers who have seen their industries decimated and their cities devastated. The rage against Washington comes from victims of the 2008 crash and continuing economic depression thrown into permanent unemployment or reduced to part-time jobs at Walmart wages. This revolt by small town America and Rust Belt workers is against “free-trade” policies of both Democrats and Republicans. They are not all racists: in fact, millions of them, 12% of all Trump voters, also voted for Barack Obama. They are victims of capitalism. To the high-flying “neo-liberal” elite, these are “forgotten people,” the residents of “fly-over” country between Wall Street and Hollywood whose money men finance Clinton and Obama Democrats. The arrogant policy wonks of Bill Clinton Inc. see those who voted for Trump as the “losers” in the globalization of “modern” capitalism, while the “winners” are the Silicon Valley venture capitalists. Having lost their jobs, their homes repossessed by the banks, makes them easy prey for demagogues selling the fool’s gold of anti-immigrant racism. The fact is that the Democrats pushed millions of workers into the arms of Trump. The Democratic politicians won’t and can’t admit this, writing off white blue-collar workers as racist, because it is their policies that are responsible. Liberal pundits like Thomas Friedman who pushed these policies are thrown into despair: “I am in anguish, frightened for my country and for our unity. And for the first time, I feel homeless in America” (New York Times, 9 November). Pseudo-radical leftists who spout theories of “white skin privilege” likewise seek to make white workers responsible for black oppression, when it is this racist capitalist system that profits from dividing white against black workers. While the “neo-liberal” liberals are in despair, various reformists and liberal “progressives” are arguing that the problem is that Hillary Clinton was the wrong Democratic candidate. They say it should have been Democratic Party “socialist” Bernie Sanders, who posed as a “friend of labor” and in early opinion polls did far better against Trump than friend of Wall Street Clinton. But Sanders (who fulsomely supported Clinton) didn’t have a very different economic program because “neo-liberalism” is not a policy it is the current phase of decaying capitalism, in which driving down wages is dictated by the same falling rate of profit that set off the 2008 crash. Various reformist left groups pushed Green Party candidate Jill Stein, whose eco-capitalist program offered nothing to workers, spelling calamity for steel and coal workers in the name of supposedly fighting climate change. Others put forward their own candidates with a laundry list of illusory demands on the capitalist state (see “Left Green Dream of People-Friendly Capitalism,” The Internationalist No. 45, September-October 2016). The Internationalist Group uniquely fought in the unions to break with the Democrats, Republicans and all capitalist parties and build a class-struggle workers party. This program, supported by the Painters union in Portland, Oregon is what could offer a real answer to Trump demagogy. It should be fought for in the labor movement throughout the country. But now we are going to face the attacks of the triumphant Trump forces, which pose an ominous threat to oppressed sectors in particular. To fight the impending attacks, it is necessary to put forward a program to mobilize the power of the workers movement. If the new regime seeks to reinstitute raids in the urban centers, there should be workers mobilizations to prevent deportations, including blocking them by flooding the area with defenders of immigrant rights. As violent racist and outright fascist forces are emboldened by Trump’s victory, Muslims and Middle Eastern immigrants in particular may be singled out for attack. Class-conscious militants should begin the work now of building workers defense guards, based on the mass organizations of the working class and oppressed, to counter this threat. Police killings of African Americans and Latinos should be met with massive labor mobilizations against police terror, such as that led by the ILWU dock workers in Oakland, California on May Day 2015 (and the example of the Labor Against Racist Police Murder contingent in Portland that same day). Education workers should prepare to stop any attempt to seize undocumented students and their families. If a school should shut down, and be backed by others, in response to the seizure of an immigrant family, it would send shock waves across the country. And Marxists not only defend the right of free speech and assembly, we stand for the right of black self-defense against racist attacks, in opposition to liberal gun control advocates. In the present atmosphere, African Americans and others would be well-advised to prepare to exercise their Second Amendment rights. All of these practical steps for resistance against racist reaction on the march can only be a partial answer and point to the ultimate solution: workers revolution. Whether a Donald Trump or a Hillary Clinton (or Barack Obama) is in the Oval Office, the capitalist system will inevitably continue to generate racism, poverty and war. We denounced Clinton’s policies in Syria and Ukraine for threatening military confrontation and even full-scale war with Russia. Trump is making nice with Putin, but at the same time threatening trade war and worse against China. As Trotskyists, we emphatically defend the Chinese deformed workers state against imperialist attack. The upset election of Donald Trump has shocked many opponents of racism, sexism and anti-immigrant chauvinism to the core. It has dealt a body blow to the Clintonite Democratic Party. It has not only thrown the capitalist political establishment into disarray, it has led many to question the whole political structure (including the Electoral College, a bastion of the slavocracy up to the Civil War, due to which Trump can lose the popular vote but still end up president). But what this shock to the body politic poses is not a phony “political revolution” like Bernie Sanders and his acolytes preached, but full-blown international socialist revolution. That is the answer to Trump … and to Clinton, the Democrats and all the bosses’ parties and politicians!■ To contact the Internationalist Group and the League for the Fourth International, send e-mail to: internationalistgroup@msn.com Return to THE INTERNATIONALIST GROUP Home Page http://www.internationalist.org/ Add Your Comments §We Remember Palestine, Promotion of Nazi Ukraine, Endless War by Oppose Tweedledee & Tweedledum Sunday Nov 13th, 2016 6:29 PM From: http://www.globalresearch.ca/to-the-anti-trump-protesters/5556731 To the Anti-Trump Protesters by Anthony Freda, 11/13/16 To the protestors: My friends and I missed you when we were protesting the bombing of hospitals and illegal wars. We missed you at Occupy Peace and the other anti-war rallies we attended and helped organize over the last 8 years. I have not seen you working to expose the destruction of our civil liberties or the illegal spying on citizens that Obama promised to stop. I doubt very much that you have donated to or volunteered to work for anti-war and pro-liberty groups who are fighting to stop senseless wars before they start and restore our basic freedoms. (Like I have) It’s been lonely out there. I guess you have just been very busy in the last 8 years. ********************************************** This writer, who has experienced over 60 years of protests in San Francisco, is outraged that we had to wait 8 years to see a demonstration against a fascist warmonger, the Republican illegally made president-elect, Donald Trump, a lifelong Democrat who gave thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party and the Clinton Foundation, only recently a Republican to be the staged adversary of Clinton since the Democrats are the twin parties of war and fascism, or to borrow a phrase from Alice in Wonderland, Tweedledee & Tweedledum. Since people finally have woken from an 8 year slumber, here is what you did not bother to protest: We remember Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia, Afghanistan, Syria, installation of Nazi Ukraine where they worship a proud Nazi, the late Stepan Bandera and have named a street after him, drone killings, targeted assassination lists, praise of US war crimes in Vietnam, provided skin-melting white phosphorus to Saudi Arabia to aid in killing 10,000 people in Yemen (same chemical used for same purpose by USA during American War against Vietnam), use of white phosphorus in Iraq by American troops illegally there, all bombings and massacres in the US and Europe, all staged INSIDE JOBS by definition as was the 9/11 Inside Job staged by the previous CIA family member, Bush, as is Obama, from 2009 to 2017, accelerated destruction of Civil Liberties (See “The Obama Legacy Part V: Waging War on Civil Liberties,” 8/2/16, by Danny Haiphong at http://www.blackagendareport.com/obama_legacy_civil_liberties), the refusal to compensate CIA torture victims or prosecute any officials responsible for their crimes (See : “Former CIA Detainees Describe Previously Unknown Torture Tactic: A Makeshift Electric Chair” by Alex Emmons, 10/3/16 https://theintercept.com/2016/10/03/former-cia-detainees-describe-previously-unknown-torture-tactic-a-makeshift-electric-chair/) We remember the refusal to abolish the federal death penalty, the refusal to legalize all drugs to remove them from the street as they will have no market value and end the prison pipeline, the refusal to free Leonard Peltier, Sundiata Acoli, Aafia Siddiqui and all other political prisoners; the refusal to completely close Guantanamo Concentration Camp and Guantanamo Military Base and all federal maximum security prison-concentration camps and the refusal to demand that all state governors abolish the death penalty, free Mumia Abu-Jamal and all other political prisoners, the refusal to free all prisoners over age 50 and abolish maximum security prison-concentration camps and transform all prisons, federal and state, into high schools providing a high school diploma and job training for decent paying jobs, changing all sentences to a maximum of 5 years (Democrat Barack Obama); We remember Palestine being destroyed by Israel (Truman through Obama, Democrats and Republicans together, 100%) DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WE KNOW WHICH SIDE YOU ARE ON! http://www.globalresearch.ca/to-the-anti-t...

Melanie Eversley of USA Today wrote on Saturday (11/12/2016) there indeed has been a spike in the number of reports of such incidents, according to representatives for two organizations that track such occurrences. A representative for one group, in fact, said the rise appears to be even worse that what was took place immediately after the terror attacks in 2001. "Since the election, we've seen a big uptick in incidents of vandalism, threats, intimidation spurred by the rhetoric surrounding Mr. Trump's election," Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., told USA TODAY. "The white supremacists out there are celebrating his victory and many are feeling their oats," Cohen said. On Friday (11/10) a Muslim woman was forced to remove her hijab after a man threatened to set her on fire with a lighter near the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor police said the man approached the victim and demanded for her to remove her hijab, or he would set her on fire. The woman complied and was able to leave the area. Witnesses say the man is a white male, 20-30 years old, average height, athletic build, had bad body odor and was thought to be intoxicated. Less than 48 hours since Donald Trump became the president-elect, reports of Islamophobia are already on the rise, according to Think Progress. Attacks on Muslim Americans were already high before Trump clinched enough electoral college delegates to win the presidency on Tuesday night, with hate-group experts attributing the uptick to his candidacy. But the situation appears to have worsened since his win. Here are just a few examples of Muslim Americans reporting instances of harassment and assault this week. At New York University, Muslim students reportedly awoke to discover that the door to their prayer room had been defaced with the word "Trump!" - Advertisement - Wednesday morning at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Muslim students found "Trump" scrawled on the door of their prayer room, realizing that our campus is not immune to the bigotry that grips America. We awoke on November 9th to a chilling wakeup call. And as we open our eyes and start to move and organize in the face of these new realities, we ask for your support. At San Jose State University, a campus-wide alert sent to students reported that a woman had her hijab forcibly removed by a "fair-skinned male" with such force that it "caused the victim to lose her balance and choked her." According to campus police, a student at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, was beaten, robbed, and had her hijab ripped off by two men, one of whom wore a white "TRUMP" hat. The suspects reportedly beat the woman with "something metal." A Muslim woman in Albuquerque, New Mexico, claimed on Twitter that a Trump supporter tried to pull off her hijab at her university. She said school officials are now investigating the incident. A Muslim woman reported that a woman verbally and physically attacked her at a Walmart, tugging at her hijab while saying that such headwear "is not allowed anymore." She then reportedly suggested the woman hang herself. The USA Today report said: The incidents, some that bring up memories of the Jim Crow era, continued into Friday. - Advertisement - "In Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania issued a statement saying it was working to find the source of racist messages sent to black freshmen, and in Syracuse, N.Y., a group of pickup trucks - one draped with the Confederate flag - drove through an anti-Trump rally. In Columbus, Ohio, a man banged on the car window while a Muslim woman was driving, her children and elderly parents with her, and told her, "C--t, you don't belong in this country," according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, based in Washington. "All those were added to the list of incidents that included black children being told to get to the back of a bus and Latino children being taunted about the wall that Trump promised to build between Mexico and the United States. "The SPLC, which tracks hate crimes, says it has logged more than 200 complaints since the election, and while it could not provide a figure for the average number of complaints it takes in each day, Cohen assured that the number is much larger than what is typical. Anti-black and anti-immigrant incidents are generating the highest numbers followed by anti-Muslim incidents, Cohen said. Part of the reason it is happening is that hate-group leaders are encouraging members to intimidate people, according to Cohen."

Aldi breaks ground in Lehigh Acres ANNABELLE TOMETICH , ATOMETICH@NEWS-PRESS.COM 1:55 p.m. EST November 13, 2016 Discount grocery chain Aldi is coming to Cape Coral.

Aldi is coming to Lee County. The low-cost grocery chain, ubiquitous in its home country of Germany, has broken ground in Lehigh Acres. "We anticipate that the upcoming Aldi store location in Lehigh Acres will open this winter," said Chris Hewitt, vice president for Aldi Royal Palm Beach. "We’re looking forward to serving the community and will share more details regarding the Grand Opening once available." THE NEWS-PRESS Whole Foods will offer Fort Myers experience Aldi has more than 1,500 stores across 34 states, including 90 in Florida. The chain is known for its no-frills approach, showcasing merchandise in its cardboard packaging, charging for bags, and requiring customers to bag their own groceries. Aldi sells meat, dairy and perishable goods, but has no deli or bakery departments. It offers mainly its own private-label brands. That means no Betty Crocker or Nabisco, just similar, Aldi's-branded alternatives. Discount grocery chain Aldi plans to open its first Lee County store this winter in Lehigh Acres.  (Photo: Special to The News-Press) "The stores are small and easier to navigate," Jeff Williams, Aldi's director of real estate said while outlining the store's plans to a Lehigh review board last fall. "Anything you need on a normal trip to the grocery store you are going to find it at Aldi." Such cost-saving methods keep Aldi's prices extremely low, about 30 percent cheaper than Wal-Mart for produce and packaged goods according to a 2015 report by Business Insider. The nearest Aldi is at 1391 Tamiami Trail, Port Charlotte. Collier County's first Aldi is scheduled to open this fall in a 17,651-square-foot building near Costco and Dick's Sporting Goods on Naples Boulevard, which runs between Pine Ridge and Airport Pulling roads in North Naples. Representatives for Aldi have been tight-lipped on the Lehigh location, offering few details other than a general time frame for opening. ALDI, a grocery chain that started in Germany, is looking to build a store on the First Christian Church property.  (Photo: Don Ruane/special to the News-star) According to a report from November 2015, the new store will be at 2803 Lee Blvd., on the old First Christian Church site. But an Aldi publicist declined to confirm this.

Bridgeport greenhouse serves community for 30 years Associated Press | BRIDGEPORT, W.Va. (AP) — David Freed started Freed's Greenhouse over 30 years ago, and he has been able to remain in business while other mom- and-pop greenhouses have gone by the wayside. Situated on his family's farm and encompassing over 40,000 square feet, Freed's business has multiple greenhouses where he grows and sells a wide variety of vegetable plants, flowers, mulches, fertilizers, herbs and trees. "I have about 12 greenhouses, since it's easier to grow certain plants when they're isolated from each other," Freed said. Freed said he learned the greenhouse business as a young man. "I learned how to raise vegetables and plants when I went to work at the Jehovah's Witness farm in Newburgh, New York," Freed said. "I was assigned to the garden there. After that, I moved home and started a greenhouse." During the store's busy season from about April through July 4, Freed employs 48 employees, some of whom are part-time and some full-time. During the remainder of the year, he has six employees, he said. Throughout the decades, Freed's Greenhouse has managed to stay afloat and do well, Freed said. "Most of the time, we've been going steady over the last 30 years," he said. "We've grown the business from nothing to what it is today. We started out with 1,000 square feet and now have over 40,000 square feet." "We've held a steady business," said Jennifer Bierbaum, Freed's daughter and the greenhouse's store manager. "A lot of people who had small businesses like ours have died and their family sold the business. Or the owners retired and their kids tried to make it work for a while, and then sold them. We survived the recent recession by cutting payroll. "I've been working here my whole life," she said. "I do the book work, order plants, make up the planting schedule, make the combination basket formulas and help out with watering and cleaning, and whatever else my father needs," Bierbaum said. "My husband also works here, doing maintenance." "There are fewer greenhouses around now because places like Lowe's, Walmart and Home Depot started selling plants about 15 years ago," Freed said. "The big box stores haven't hurt our business because I have a much larger selection than they do and because of the quality of my plants. The big box stores don't have people who water and fertilize the plants like we do with our plants. "We also stay afloat with repeat customers," Freed said. "We get older families with their kids and when the kids grow up, they become our customers too. There are also new people moving into the area all the time, which is good for business." Freed's Greenhouse is located at 4536 Benedum Drive in Bridgeport. The phone number is (304) 592-0897. The business is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. During its busy season, the store stays open on Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m.-8 p.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m.-6 p.m. © 2016 The Associated Press.

Donald Trump’s promises trigger fears of a trade war that would damage Washington’s economy By John Webster johnwe@spokesman.com(509) 459-5421 Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Related topics China reportedly pumping brakes on U.S. deal-making after Trump win If President Donald Trump keeps the promises of candidate Donald Trump, he could trigger a trade war with China, dissolve tariff-reduction deals around the Pacific Rim, and inflict a “disastrous” blow to the economy of trade-dependent Washington state. So says Democrat Gary Locke, the Chinese-American trade expert who served eight years as Washington state governor, two years as U.S. secretary of commerce and three years as U.S. ambassador to China. But out in Eastern Washington’s crop-growing country, which voted strongly in favor of Trump, farmers feel optimistic that they can persuade the new president to govern differently than he campaigned. John Stuhlmiller, CEO of the conservative Washington state Farm Bureau, said it is true that China has a history of the retaliation Locke predicts – a retaliation that “would be terrible for our economy, absolutely.” But the need to avoid a trade war is why, Stuhlmiller said, “I would submit there is room for movement from rhetoric to reality.” Stuhlmiller said Trump’s policy advisers already have told the Farm Bureau that Trump will repeal the Obama administration’s Clean Water Act rules concerning runoff – rules that many farmers consider damaging and excessive. The president-elect’s responsiveness to farmers on that issue makes farmers optimistic that Trump will respond favorably to farmers’ concerns regarding foreign trade, Stuhlmiller said. Bigger even than agriculture is Boeing. It sells jets, made in Washington, around the world. In 2015, Washington made and exported $86.3 billion worth of merchandise. More than half – $51 billion – was civilian aircraft. The largest market for Washington state products? China, at $20.7 billion in purchases during 2014. Those purchases include Boeing jets, fresh Wenatchee cherries that fly to China by the planeload, Yakima Valley hops for the brewers of Asian beer, and frozen french fries made in Moses Lake from local potatoes and devoured by the ton at China’s more than 2,200 McDonald’s restaurants. Other buyers of Washington state exports include Canada at $9.3 billion in purchases, Japan at $7.4 billion, and Mexico at $2.7 billion. The manufacture and shipping of these export products account for 1 in 3 of Washington state’s jobs, according to the state Department of Commerce. Those jobs are in Boeing’s factories, Eastern Washington’s family wheat farms, Columbia Valley’s wineries, Central Washington’s orchards and the thriving Port of Moses Lake, where more than 2,500 workers assemble semiconductors for Intel, carbon-fiber body panels for BMW’s electric cars, Genie construction lifts and more. Those jobs, said Locke, are what is at stake – along with the U.S. trade deficit, which gets better when Washington’s exports improve and worse when they decline. What is it, exactly, that candidate Trump said to provoke these Washington state concerns? He promised repeatedly to impose a 45 percent tariff on goods made in China and sold to the United States. He also said he would scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama administration trade pact involving 12 Pacific Rim countries; the deal awaits final approval in Congress, where leaders last week were calling it dead. China is not a party to the TPP, but many other Washington state trading partners are would-be members. He said he would renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he lambasted as a job-killing deal that gutted American manufacturing since its passage in the 1990s. Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, explained in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that the 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports would be a “strategic negotiating strategy to stop China … from cheating on international trade deals.” China, Navarro wrote, “has been waging an undeclared trade war on the U.S. since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. The casualties are obvious: More than 50,000 American factories shuttered.” Meanwhile, Navarro wrote, “the unfair trade advantages China reaps from lax environmental and health and safety regulations are written in blood: More than 60,000 Chinese workers perished in workplace accidents in 2014 and up to a half-million people die prematurely because of China’s horrific air pollution.” Robert Hamilton, senior trade policy adviser in the Washington state Department of Commerce, said if Trump imposes an across-the-board 45 percent tariff on Chinese products, it “would be a blatant violation of WTO rules. Does he intend to pull out of the WTO? He hasn’t said so, so it is unclear how he would proceed against China, Washington’s largest export market,” Hamilton said. Further, Hamilton said, “I understand President-elect Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, but he has provided no details about what he would propose. Moreover, Canada and Mexico will be at the table, too, and they will not just give concessions to the United States.” According to former Gov. Locke, if Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, “China will reciprocate and put a similar tax on goods from Washington – whether it’s wheat, hops or Boeing airplanes. That will force Chinese buyers to buy from Brazil or Chile or Australia in terms of agricultural products and from Europe in terms of airplanes.” “They don’t have to buy from Boeing,” Locke added. The market for passenger jets is competitive; Airbus eagerly would sell to China if retaliatory Chinese taxes and tariffs made Boeing’s U.S.-made jets uncompetitive in price. If retaliatory trade policies block Washington state companies from selling to China, “it means layoffs” for Washington workers, Locke said. “It could be quite disastrous for jobs in the state of Washington,” he said. In addition, Trump’s threatened tariff on Chinese products would raise the price of the merchandise Americans buy at stores like Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Macy’s, Locke said. “That will be taken out of the pockets of American workers.” Primary provisions of the TPP, Locke said, are agreements to lower tariffs currently imposed by U.S. trading partners, and to bind those countries to improve the treatment of their own workers and cut down on the use of hazardous agricultural chemicals. In return for those agreements, nations in the TPP secure the mutual benefits of freer trade, Locke said. If other countries “can make things without health and human safety standards, it puts American companies at a disadvantage,” Locke said, because U.S. producers do invest in higher standards of health and safety. “That’s what TPP is trying to address, is level the playing field” so U.S. products have a fair shot in the competition for foreign buyers. Regarding the TPP, the Farm Bureau agreed: In its meetings with the new Trump administration, Stuhlmiller said, “Ag is going to be saying ‘Please support it.’ ” Under terms of the TPP, stringent U.S. environmental standards “would be a base for others to have to attain to. Others would have to pay more to produce crops, and that gives us an advantage; our products must become more cost-competitive,” Stuhlmiller said. “Where we excel is we have the world’s safest and best food supply. It goes at a premium,” Stuhlmiller said. This premium quality has contributed to the worldwide success of Washington’s big-money crops such as apples, cherries and wheat, he said. But it takes a level playing field, with lower tariffs and comparable production rules, for trade fully to benefit makers and buyers alike, he said. According to the Farm Bureau, the TPP would increase Washington state’s export income by $246 million per year and add more than 1,350 jobs to the state’s economy. Boeing, like the Farm Bureau, has expressed the hope it can work out concerns with the president-elect. After Trump’s election victory, the company issued this formal statement: “We congratulate president-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to ensure that U.S. companies can compete, win and grow our economy to provide good jobs to U.S. workers; as well as preserve American leadership in national security.” Will Trump, who campaigned to increase U.S. jobs and reduce the deficit in U.S. trade, respond to the concerns of Washington state export industries? Stuhlmiller predicted he will: During campaign season “rhetoric is rhetoric.” But governing, he said, is a different story. “We hope we will be able to reason our way through these things and find the right policy path forward. Farmers are the eternal optimists. We put everything at risk every year and hope the Lord provides the rain.” Published: Nov. 13, 2016, 6:15 a.m.  Tags: apples, Boeing, cherries, china, Donald Trump, farm bureau, foreign trade, jobs, NAFTA, Washington state economy, wheat Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

The Buzz: 'Click and collect' gains speed Maureen Wallenfang , USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 7:53 a.m. CST November 13, 2016 With "click and collect," shoppers buy online and then pick the item up in the store. Employees gather goods and set them aside for customers. (Photo: Getty Images) 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE If you love Black Friday deals but don’t love Black Friday, there’s a sneaky way to get the same stuff without the pushing and shoving. It’s called “click and collect” or “buy online and pick up in store.” Customers buy a product online and click the option of picking it up in the store. They can see if the item is available at a nearby store, and put the item on hold. Shoppers are notified via email when items are ready for pickup at the store's customer service counter, sometimes in as little as half an hour. They can then go get it right away, or over the next few days, with the assurance that it will be there waiting. They save delivery charges as the service is free. In some cases, it will work with Black Friday deals. RELATED: Read more about local businesses in The Buzz. RELATED: Fox River Mall will be open Thanksgiving “Some doorbusters would be available starting online on Wednesday,” said Kristen Taganashi, Shopko’s vice president of Ecommerce and Omnichannel. “There are some that are not eligible for ‘buy online and pick up in store,’ but I’d say most of it is.” Ineligible items might be a few of the “high velocity” items that sell so quickly that the systems can’t keep accurate track of quantities, she said. During the last Christmas shopping season, nearly one-third of all consumers checked the 'buy online and pick up in the store" option, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. It was most popular with shoppers age 18 to 34, said study author Jean Lambert, ICSC director of research. The Ashwaubenon-based Shopko is one of the latest stores to adopt the “buy online and pick up in store” service, which they call BOPIS for short. They began offering it in September and Taganashi said it’s already “27 percent of total orders on the website.” (See shopko.com/storepickup for answers to frequently asked questions on how it works.) “I was a little surprised by the fact that the most prominent category is actually furniture,” Taganashi said. “Furniture is something people tend to research more. They do the research online, and go ahead and finish the transaction. It’s also the items they want to make sure they get, like seasonal décor, bedding and bath. I think that’s what people are responding to. They don’t have to make a trip to the store and wonder if it’s going to be there.” Shopko joins stores like Wal-mart, Target, Best Buy, Kohl’s, Office Depot, The Home Depot and Macy’s in offering this service, which has been growing in popularity over the last few years. This year, Swedish retail giant Ikea opened more click-and-collect locations,19, than traditional stores, 12.​ Amanda Becker is a shopper who has used this shopping method for two years. She's a working mom who lives in Kenosha. “I like being able to shop at 11 at night and not have to rush out to get it,” she said. “It’s great for hard-to-find items because it saves me the hassle of going from store to store to find it. And why pay shipping if the store’s in my area?” She's gotten pajamas for her daughter, decorative pillows for her home and collectibles for her mother. “My mom collects Village (figurines), and I got a hard-to-find Disney Village at Sears. It was nice to know I could secure it, and run in at my convenience to get it.” She said the only glitch she’s experienced was a 20-minute wait at Kohl's when they couldn't track down her purchase. Still, she said, “the benefit outweighs the inconvenience.” In the bigger picture, perhaps the most significant thing is that this hybrid shopping method connects bricks-and-mortar stores with the growing world of online commerce. Clicking online is step one in the "click and collect" shopping process. Step two is going to the store to collect goods, bypassing the delivery option.  (Photo: Chad Baker/Thomas Northcut, Getty Images) “Stores must now encompass both worlds – the sensory experience of the physical store combined with the personalization and convenience of online shopping,” said Ken Morris, principal of Boston Retail Partners, a consulting firm. Based on his company's 2015 survey, 41 percent of stores offer a "click and collect" option, and that number will nearly double by 2018.

Is this a growing trend? With Stephen Lebovitz, CBL &amp; Associates President &amp; CEO.</p> Closed for Thanksgiving    Friday, 11 Nov 2016 | 12:00 AM ET | 04:27 For many families, shopping after the Thanksgiving feast has become a new tradition. That tradition, however, may be reverting to something more old-fashioned: Staying at home. Recently, national mall operator CBL & Associates announced it will close all 72 of its malls across 30 states for the Thanksgiving holiday. "We looked at it last year and we decided this year it was the right thing to do," CBL & Associates Properties President and CEO Stephen Lebovitz told CNBC's "On the Money" in an interview. CBL had been opening at various hours during Thanksgiving evening since 2013, a practice replicated by a number of big retailers hoping to juice holiday sales figures. In recent years, hordes of Thanksgiving shoppers leaving their homes to take advantage of sales—often trampling and fighting with others along the way—has been a source of growing controversy. "We have 1500 CBL employees, and almost 100,000 employees for our stores across our portfolio, and we think that they deserve Thanksgiving off." Lebovitz told CNBC. Workers have told him "how they appreciate getting the day off, how there are so few family days that are out there anymore and Thanksgiving really is special," he added. Getty Images People carrying shopping bags walk along Fifth Avenue in New York. CBL's announcement came just days after the country's largest shopping center, Minnesota's Mall of America said it would be reversing course by closing for Thanksgiving for the first time in its 24 year history. Black Friday door busters used to kick off to the holiday shopping season. Over the last several years, retailers have jumped the gun by opening their doors first at midnight and then encroaching earlier into Thanksgiving day to get a head start on those holiday shoppers. Lebovitz told CNBC since the Chattanooga, TN-based company made their announcement, "the reaction's been incredibly positive" from customers. "They're appreciative. They say we'll come to your mall on Black Friday. We don't want to shop on Thanksgiving." That may come as cold comfort to the estimated 35 million shoppers that hit stores on Thanksgiving day last year—a big incentive for retailers to open their doors to those dollars. Macy's, Kohl's, Target and Walmart are among retailers to open on the holiday. Yet Nordstrom, TJ Maxx, Apple, Barnes & Noble have opted to keep their doors closed this Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, CBL's top two competitors, mall operators Simon Property Group and General Growth both announced they will open their malls on the holiday. According to IBISWorld, Simon has a 41 percent market share and General Growth Properties has 19.1 percent of the market. CBL is a distant third with 9.1 percent. However, Lebovitz said "we don't feel we're putting our retailers at a disadvantage" by not being open. "A lot of our malls are the only mall in their market or in their community. So we're not competing with other malls, per se." There is a loophole: CBL malls, which are concentrated in the South and Midwest, has anchor stores that may opt to open on Thanksgiving. "They can and they will [be open], and that's their decision," Lebovitz said. But the interior mall portion, the specialty stores , those will be closed and that's where most of our business is done." Citing support of the mall's retailers, Lebovitz said they agreed "employees deserve the day off and they wanted to see this happen." Lebovitz called the increase in stores opening on Thanksgiving as a "knee-jerk reaction to online shopping" that has stolen the thunder of brick-and-mortar retail shopping. He said that if more stores closed on Thanksgiving, it could "restore the luster back to Black Friday." The CEO told CNBC it's too early to know if they'll do the same thing in 2017, "but for this year it's definitely the right thing."

The private, nonprofit university has nearly 17,000 students studying at campuses in North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. It has three campuses in Arkansas. • Northwest Arkansas Community College was founded by voters in the Bentonville and Rogers school districts in 1989, when they passed a 3-mill property tax to support the new institution. Enrollment this fall semester was reported at 7,973. Source: Staff report BENTONVILLE -- Some people attending class at Northwest Arkansas Community College next semester won't be the college's students. Webster University plans to rent a room at the college to offer a marketing class on Monday nights starting Jan. 9, officials from both institutions said. It's the first class in a program for those interested in obtaining master's degrees in business administration. Webster University is based in St. Louis but operates numerous campuses across the United States and in seven other countries. Those satellite campuses include ones in Fayetteville, Fort Smith and Little Rock, and at Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville. The university designs its schedule mainly to accommodate the schedules of adults with full-time jobs. It sought space in Benton County for the convenience of its students who live there, officials said. "It's tough, particularly with the road construction going on, for people to get from Bentonville to Fayetteville," said Michael Gibbs, director of Webster University's Fayetteville and Fort Smith campuses. "So we're trying to see if there's demand for classes there." The state Highway and Transportation Department is widening Interstate 49 from four lanes to six lanes in Benton and Washington counties. Construction is expected to last several years. Kevin Lee of Centerton has been a Webster student for two years, pursuing a master's degree in management and leadership. He has to leave his house at 4:15 p.m. to make it to his 5:30 class. "The traffic is just stop, stop, stop," Lee said. Ammie Serrano, who is pursuing a master's degree in human resources through Webster, said she has to leave early from her job at the Wal-Mart Stores Inc. home office in Bentonville on days her class meets. Fortunately, she has supervisors who are understanding, she said. Offering a class at Northwest Arkansas Community College will save Benton County students like Lee and Serrano time and gas money, Gibbs said. He estimated that one-third of the students enrolled at Webster's Fayetteville campus are from Benton County. The university could offer additional courses at the Northwest Arkansas Community College, depending on the interest level. The community college is "a nice, convenient location, and we can rent the rooms on a term-by-term basis," Gibbs said. "If the demand proves to be there, we would look for a more permanent solution to serving the students up there." The university will be paying a rental fee of $185 per week to use Room 1037 at the community college's Southern Region National Child Protection Training Center. The room seats 13-15 people, according to Steven Hinds, Northwest Arkansas Community College's director of public relations and marketing. The marketing class will meet from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Mondays. "That's a time it wouldn't be in use for us, so it's not a conflict," Hinds said. Hinds said as far as he knows, this is the first time the college has engaged in this kind of agreement with another institution of higher education. Webster University initially contacted Northwest Arkansas Community College in March to inquire about room rental rates but didn't follow up on the matter until September, Hinds said. Gibbs said it's "not unusual" for the university to rent additional space to better accommodate its students. "We're just trying to make it more convenient for people to get to class," he said.

Serious deal-seekers are already planning their Thanksgiving weekend shopping. Experts believe that once again Thanksgiving will offer better deals than on the day afterward, and there are signs that many of the offers will look similar to those in 2015. Amid the clutter of deals clamoring for attention, smart and careful shoppers can come out ahead. (Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, File) Betty Inskeep has been following the same Thanksgiving Day routine for years – visiting family, enjoying dinner with relatives and watching football. And, the Hubbard Township woman said, she has no plans to “break with tradition now” by spending her holiday time shopping. “I believe Thanksgiving is a day for families to be together,” she said. Inskeep, like other area consumers, believes there’s plenty of time for shopping before or after Thanksgiving. But others, like Michael Timms of Austintown, insist there is nothing wrong with rounding off the day’s festivities by kicking off the holiday shopping season on the day some now refer to as Brown Thursday. “Actually, you can eat, drink and be merry with your family, friends or both and then spend some quality time together buying presents or strolling through the mall,” Timms said. It appears, many analysts have said, that Thanksgiving Day shopping — a delight to some, an anathema to others — is here to stay, regardless of how some consumers view it. A 2015 National Retail Federation survey showed that 34.6 million, or 34 percent, consumers said they shopped on Thanksgiving Day last year, while 72.8 percent, or 74.2 million, said they shopped on Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the weekend, and 46.8 million, or 45.9 percent, said they shopped the Saturday after Black Friday. Still, some stores have started rethinking their strategies on whether it makes sense to be open on the holiday itself. Many of the nation’s major mall operators and the big retailers that anchor them, such as Toys R Us, JCPenney and Macy’s, are sticking with what they want to be a new tradition, kicking off the holiday shopping season on Thanksgiving Day. For example, Eastwood Mall in Niles and Southern Park Mall in Boardman will each kick off the holiday shopping season at 6 p.m. Thanksgiving day, close at 1 a.m. and reopen on Black Friday at 6 a.m. “For the most part, we’ve encountered a large percentage of consumers anxious to get out there and shop on Thanksgiving night,” said Joe Bell, spokesman for the Cafaro Co., which owns the local mall. “Certainly there are still many other people who have no interest in interrupting their Thanksgiving routine, and that’s fine. Many of them prefer to hit the stores at the crack of dawn on Black Friday. That’s why the mall will close in the overnight hours and re-open at 6 a.m. on Friday.” Lori Reda, Southern Park Mall’s marketing director, said the extended holiday hours are being provided to “meet shopper demand.” She added that a variety of mall happenings provide opportunities for “friends and family to shop, dine and spend time together.” Others, including the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., the nation’s largest shopping mall, are closing for Thanksgiving this year after being open for the past several years. Some retailers that are closing cite respect for the holiday, but in truth, the cost of being open might be more than the return. “Once you let the genie out of the bottle, it’s hard,” said Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, a mall operator with several shopping facilities in western Pennsylvania that is closing 72 of its malls for the day. “More retailers are coming to their senses and realizing it is a family holiday and from a business point of view, it’s not making much business sense.” Stores being open on Thanksgiving started in earnest in 2011 and took a punch out of sales on Black Friday, which had usually launched the shopping season. Many places like Macy’s, Target and JCPenney have been opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving as they try to outdo others to get first dibs on customers who could easily buy online. But the move has been controversial, as many workers have voiced complaints that stores are putting profits over workers’ time to be with their families. Some 89 of the 145 properties that Chattanooga, Tenn.-based CBL owns or has interest in opened at 6 p.m. on the holiday last year. While dozens of those will be closed this year, the department stores, movie theaters, restaurants and retailers with exterior entrances have the option to open on Thanksgiving. Other retailers including Office Depot and consumer electronics chain hhgregg Inc. plan to be closed after being open for the past several years. Plenty of retailers, particularly high-end stores like Nordstrom or those like T.J. Maxx that offer discounts every day, never opened on Thanksgiving and have collected goodwill because of that. Eau Claire, Wis.-based Menards, which has a local store on Elm Road in Bazetta, recently announced that as a family-owned business, it will continue its tradition of remaining closed on Thanksgiving for families. Last year, JCPenney opened at 3 p.m. for the first time, three hours earlier than its rivals Kohl’s and Macy’s. That may have hurt Macy’s, which had a weak holiday season and aims to reverse a sales slump. This year, Macy’s decided to open an hour earlier at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. JCPenney is sticking to 3 p.m., while Kohl’s will be opening again at 6 p.m. Most Sears stores will be open on Thanksgiving for the fourth year in a row, starting at 6 p.m. — the same as a year ago. Best Buy suffered over Thanksgiving weekend in 2012 because it didn’t open until midnight, while stores like Wal-Mart and Target began their sales earlier in the evening. Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy have not announced their plans for this Thanksgiving weekend; however, all indications are they’ll start the doorbuster sales on the holiday. For many big retailers, covering expenses like paying employees holiday pay is not that costly, said Joel Bines, a managing director at retail consulting group AlixPartners. But for small stores or those with specialized merchandise, it may make more sense to close. AlixPartners also found some retailers who did open on Thanksgiving were simply pulling Friday sales a day earlier and their profit margins took a hit. Bob Riesbeck, president and CEO of hhgregg, says business on Thanksgiving actually declined over the previous two years when it opened at 4 p.m. Andy Mantis, executive vice president of NPD Group Checkout Tracking, says stores should open on both Thanksgiving and Black Friday to maximize their sales. The company, which analyzes receipt data to understand consumer behavior, found the share of buyers who shopped on both days declined, while the number who shopped only on Thanksgiving Day or on Black Friday increased. Mantis believes specialty retailers, especially those near big stores like Macy’s that are open, should think again about whether to stay closed. “It is a heavy promotion time,” Mantis said. “People are buying, and they’re not always willing to go to multiple stores.” Associated Press writer Anne D’Innocenzio contributed to this report.

But before the day was over, the four students were huddled together over laptops, discussing their idea for a nutrition app over sandwiches in the Penn State Business Building — or their ad hoc home for the weekend. Sleep, they said, was not in their programming. So how did their complex problem-cracking codefest begin? With the simplest of solutions, of course. “I sat down,” Lin said. Nothing, it turns out, can hack basic human interaction. Welcome to HackPSU, a place where complete strangers can build the next great idea. Rome may have not been built in a day, but then again, Caesar didn’t have the Amazon Echo. “I think we could really do something with this,” Lin, 19, said. “I’m excited.” As Saturday spilled into Sunday, several more teams like Lin’s raced against the clock, putting their coding and collaboration skills to the test in creating a viable prototype, one that would impress judges enough to win the $300 top prize. More than 600 students attended the event, which is in its fourth year. Lin’s team was targeting a specific challenge, one of more than 14 levied Saturday, that tasked students with devising a data-driven solution to living healthier. Their app, she said, would combine Amazon’s voice-activated Echo technology with Spoonacular’s food API, a nearly endless trove of ingredients, nutritional info and prices. The endgame is to have a personal dietary assistant conversant in your nutritional needs. “I think hack-athons sum up what I love about coding,” Ghildyal said. “You sit down with no idea and you come out with a finished product.” In a classroom tucked behind the lobby, Geoffrey Billy was hammering away at a different problem. “Can we solder in here?” he asked at one point. His teammates advised him he couldn’t. Mind whirring, he had little time to think about impediments to his team’s all-weather snow globe: Tap an app and the weather changes inside. Shake it and start over anew. Equipped with a toaster oven-sized 3-D printer, Billy, a Penn State senior who placed second in HackPSU’s spring event, started tinkering on the team’s orb-like prototype: A fish bowl bought the night before. “I think we got it from Wal-Mart,” he said, smiling. “We were originally going to use a pickle jar.” Here the hacks extend beyond the screen. When completed, Billy hopes it will impress AccuWeather, the designer of his chosen challenge. A table over, Mike Hoare, a resident assistant at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, was trying to make his life easier. His team was developing a SMS service to streamline rounds made at night through the dorms. “We inspect every room,” he said. “We still write everything by hand, so we’re still kind of in the Stone Ages in Residence Life.” Cody Schory, Hoare’s teammate, said the group was looking at a solid 12 or more hours of coding. Huang, who has been to hack-athons elsewhere, said competitors have brought sleeping bags and pillows in the past. Air mattresses were set to be rolled out later that night. But for Huang, a perfectly fine school sweatshirt would do. “One night you can stand without a pillow,” she said. “Two nights, you probably need one.” Last year’s winner, Alex Patin, was garbed head-to-toe in giraffe-themed pajamas. He was prepared, he said, for a long night of hacking. From last year’s event, his four-person team ran with their idea of music therapy via biometric technology. Now his company, Musical Minds, has a team of 30. Could it happen to Lin’s team? They hope so. They said they’d love to work in a startup after college, with Ghildyal calling the experience “a perpetual hackathon.” Saturday night was, perhaps, a beta test of sorts. But for a night, personal connections — and the next great idea — can come at the expense of personal hygiene. For the experiences gained, the group said, it's a decent trade. “Sunday morning, everyone is going to smell,” Lin joked. “I might go back to my dorm.” Roger Van Scyoc: 814-231-4698, @rogervanscy Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Penn State Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:09 Franklin discusses upcoming game against Rutgers Pause 3:30 Franklin discusses offensive line, Tommy Stevens triple play 1:53 Veteran taught class, let kids try on his uniform 3:18 Summer concert at Beaver Stadium 1:43 2016 Election Day by the numbers 1:40 Fans in downtown State College 0:52 Veteran can't believe show of generosity 3:52 Penn State's Cael Sanderson reflects on winning the NCAA Championship 1:00 How to carve your pumpkin safely 0:40 Waters flood house in Milesburg Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 12 minutes ago Students hold #NotMyPresident protest at Penn State 1:33 12 minutes ago Students hold #NotMyPresident protest at Penn State 3:18 10 days ago Summer concert at Beaver Stadium 2:49 2 months ago Penn State student protests Joe Paterno 1st game commemoration View more video Penn State Penn State grad peels back curtain on social media, Broadway’s ‘Hamilton’ Students gather to discuss how to move forward after election Students hold #NotMyPresident protest at Penn State Penn State students protest Trump presidency Penn State team puts hope within reach for kids with upper limb deformities Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services e-Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Advertising Information Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping Place an Obituary Today's Circulars Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services e-Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Advertising Information Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping Place an Obituary Today's Circulars More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

And what else? Everything you need to know about what the controversial president-elect can and cannot do as leader of the US. 11 Nov 2016 07:44 GMT | US Elections 2016, US & Canada, Donald Trump By Patty Culhane White House Correspondent A crucial question people around the world are asking right now is if Donald Trump will be the same in the Oval Office as he was on the campaign trail. Many are wondering: How many of his controversial campaign promises will actually become reality? It's important to take a step back and look at the power of the president to see how a Trump presidency could play out. Here's a quick rundown: Can Trump build a wall and make Mexico pay for it? If Trump wants to build a wall along the entire southern border he is going to have to ask the US Congress for tens of billions of dollars. He can't do it without their sign-off. There has been some bipartisan talk in the past of doing more to secure the border but with a $20 trillion debt that is only going up, spending the amount it would take to build on the entire border seems like a tough sell, even with a Republican-led Congress. He cannot - repeat - cannot make Mexico pay for it. He said on the campaign trail that he would take remittances from the US that were being sent to Mexico. What would that even look like? Would FBI agents hang out at every Western Union and ask where the money is being sent? If as president he signed an executive order to take people's money, it would instantly be challenged in court. He will be able to make sure the Supreme Court stays conservative-leaning but it's hard to imagine any court not ruling that practice would be against the constitutional protection from illegal search and seizures. Can Trump ban all Muslims from entering the US? He did say he was going to "totally shut down" all Muslims from entering the United States. He later clarified that he was going to shut down people from entering who come from countries with a history of terrorism. The short answer is he can't ban an entire religion, but there are caveats. First let's take a look at Americans who practise Islam. No president can keep them from entering the country. That would violate several provisions of the constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion. READ MORE: Donald Trump - The Islamophobia president For non-Americans it is pretty clear that he couldn't come right out and say he was stopping Muslims from immigrating or visiting the US. The courts would probably step in if that was the case. That doesn't mean he can't do it though. The president is allowed to ban people from certain countries from entering the US. It has been done before, in 1980, when Jimmy Carter, the Democratic president, during the Iranian hostage crisis banned Iranians from entering the US unless they opposed the new government or had a medical emergency. That means Trump can also stop the resettlement of all Syrian refugees, another one of his controversial campaign promises. Can Trump renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal? He can try to change what he called "the stupidest deal of all time". He can call up the Iranian foreign ministry and say he "wants a better deal". There is no reason to think the Iranians would agree. As president, Trump could call the other nations who took part and ask them to put sanctions back in place in order to force the talks to resume. It seems pretty unlikely the other countries would agree to that. He could issue new US sanctions. That seems more likely because the incoming minority leader Senator Chuck Schumer has voiced opposition to the deal. READ MORE: As America votes, a voice from Iran He could say that the limited business US companies can do with Iran is no longer allowed. It seems unlikely that other countries are going to be willing to isolate Iran again to the extent they once did. He could sign sanctions that make it tougher for foreign companies to do business with Iran and use the US financial system. In short, he can try to make Iran renegotiate but he will likely be left with only unilateral actions. Can Trump start a trade war with China? Yes, on his own without Congress and no one can stop him. He can impose harsh tariffs on Chinese goods. That will mean that everyday goods that Americans are used to being able to buy fairly inexpensively at Wal-Mart will become incredibly expensive. That would be hugely unpopular but he has the power to do it if he wants. Can he renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA? He can and officials in Canada and Mexico have said they are willing to start talking. If he can he get a better deal remains an open question. Can he force American companies to move back to the US? No. He quite simply cannot. He can impose heavy tariffs on the products companies make in Mexico and ship to the US. Again, US consumers would quickly feel the pain of that move. What can Trump do in Syria? Anything he wants. The US involvement has been done under the legal authority of the Authorization for Use of Military Force from 2001. Congress could pass a new bill forcing him to continue to arm opposition fighters or to stop providing assistance and that would be binding, but his own party controls both chambers of Congress and are unlikely to take that step. READ MORE: What does Trump's victory mean for the Middle East? Members of Congress have been reluctant to put their names to anything that authorises or stops the use of force overseas. He can unveil his "secret" plan to stop the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group (ISIL, also known as ISIS) or he can side with the Russians and stop backing the groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and ISIL and there is little likely to stop him. Can Trump stop "normalisation" with Cuba? Yes. Just by signing his name on an executive order he can roll back every change President Barack Obama has made. What can Trump do at the UN? Anything he wants. He could try to lift sanctions on Russia over Ukraine in exchange for cooperation in Syria. Congress couldn't stop him, but the other veto-wielding countries can. Can he rip up the Paris climate agreement? Yes. With an executive order everything that was mandated under the agreement would simply go away. Can he deport undocumented migrants? He can do that and no one can stop him - short of a congressional bill. Can Trump make America great again? It seems we are about to find out.

  Singles' Day sales break records, again 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail Xinhua, November 12, 2016 Jack Ma, president of the nation's e-commerce giant Alibaba speaks in front of a giant screen displaying total gross merchandise volume (GMV) of Alibaba's online marketplace Tmall for Singles' Day shopping spree in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, Nov. 11, 2016. By 0 o'clock on Saturday, the total GMV of Tmall during Singles' Day has exceeded 120.7 billion yuan (about 17.78 billion U.S. dollars). (Xinhua/Huang Zongzhi) Thirteen minutes after touching a screen, a buyer surnamed Huang in Foshan City, south China's Guangdong Province, received the juicer he ordered on China's largest e-commerce platform Alibaba, the first parcel delivered on the platform on this year's Singles' Day shopping spree. Huang is one of the hundreds of thousands consumers staying up all night for online bargains on Singles' Day, China's annual online shopping fiesta. As orders keep pouring in, sales on major e-commerce platforms across China quickly broke last year's records. The first 10 billion yuan (1.47 billion U.S. dollars) was achieved in just six minutes 58 seconds on Alibaba, almost six minutes faster than last year. Just before 3:20 p.m., the number had surpassed 91.2 billion yuan, the whole-day sales volume for last year. At 6:55 p.m., the turnover expanded further to exceed 100 billion yuan. By 8 p.m., flocks of customers had made 549 million orders on Alibaba's e-commerce platforms. Other online platforms such as JD.com, Gome, and Suning.com all exceeded previous records in the first few hours. Seen by many as China's answer to Black Friday in the United States, Singles' Day has grown into a huge battle for market share among Chinese e-commerce companies. The born-in-China shopping spree has now spread its name worldwide, with Alipay, China's largest online payment platform, now available in over 200 countries and regions, supporting transactions in 18 currencies. Hu Bingjie, 22, read the message, among many online queries, as it came in. "Can you speak English?" A buyer in Thailand had ordered 25 items of children's clothing from Hu's store and was poised to pay a 355 yuan delivery fee, but wanted to pay cash on delivery instead. "If you want direct delivery you have to pay in advance," Hu replied, using a translator. While overseas consumers are getting more skilled at digging for bargains on Chinese websites, domestic shoppers enjoy a wider variety of foreign produce thanks to the publicity of Singles' Day in overseas media. This year, JD has worked with global supermarket chain Walmart to offer Chinese buyers quality overseas products. It has also inked partnership with Japanese logistics firm Yamato to speed up cross-border delivery. At this year's G20 meeting, Alibaba forged collaboration with Canadian and Russian companies to expand its presence overseas. It also invested in Singapore Post to target consumers in Southeast Asia. With easier access to overseas products, it is estimated that China's e-commerce market still has room to grow. According to Internet industry research agency iResearch, China's online shopping market's sales volume was 1.1 trillion yuan in the second quarter, up 27.6 percent year on year. It is estimated the volume will exceed 1.5 trillion in the fourth quarter. "E-commerce is leading the change in the global market," said Wang Jian, professor at the University of International Business and Economics. "The flow of global commodities through online purchases can help awaken the consumer market, which is good for the global retail industry." The shopping spree sheds light on the huge purchasing power of Chinese consumers and the strong domestic demand leads to optimism over economic prospects, said Guo Tianyong, a professor with the Central University of Finance and Economics. 1   2   3   4   5   Next   Print E-mail Go to Forum >>0 Comment(s) No comments.

Here are some popular places and their catalogs so you can start making that list:  For starters, it looks like Sam's Club is having sales on just about every item in their store, from refrigerators to TVs to diamonds. Sam's Club members could probably find it all. Are you one of those people that's not sure what you're shopping for? Head to Kohls. They have a whopping 64 pages of steals happening inside their department stores.  Sears decided to continue the newer trend of moving Black Friday to Thanksgiving Thursday. Its doors will open at 6 p.m. Check out what they've got going on since they needed an extra day to help their customers save money.  Target is known for its ability to lose shoppers for hours inside its red doors. The first 10 pages of its catalog focus on electronics and gaming. If this fits your families needs, it might be a good idea to begin there.  Need a new washer, dryer or any other kind of household appliance. Check out what hhgregg has to offer. They will open their doors at 4 p.m Thursday. Walmart has always spoken for itself when it comes to one-stop shopping. They will begin their online sales at 12 a.m. Thanksgiving morning. If you're not a online shopping kind of person, you'll have to wait til 6 p.m.  If you're in business for a new TV, Best Buy doesn't disappoint in that department. Its catalog features three LED TVs on the front page. Best Buy will open its doors at 5 p.m. Thursday.  Toys, toys and more toys. What else would Toys "R" Us be featuring? They're confident shoppers won't be able to wait for all the sweet deals they're having, so online shopping will begin at 9 p.m. Wednesday.   Hopefully these previews will help make the busiest shopping day of the year a little less stressful. And never forget to use respectable Black Friday shopping etiquette.  Follow WTOL:   Download our app here.  Copyright 2016 WTOL. All rights reserved.

Memorial services will be held 2. p.m., Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 at the First Baptist Church. All are welcome to attend.  Services will conclude at the church.  John was born July 31, 1944 in Pueblo, Co., to Harry Hamlin Boles and Elnora Maxine Kauffman. He graduated from William J. Palmer High School in Colorado Springs in 1962 with an emphasis in business.  In 1974 John graduated with an Associate in Arts degree/Bible Certificate from Nazarene Bible College in Colorado Springs.                 John spent many happy years in Colorado Springs, where he was a much-loved voice on area Christian radio stations. His first love, however, was spreading the Gospel.  To that end, he was ordained by the Rocky Mountain District of the Assemblies of God in May 2000.                 Upon moving to Sterling, John sought ways to serve his Lord, purchasing a communion set so he could take communion to those in the nursing home.  He loved going to preach there, and staying to visit with the residents.  He was a People Greeter at Wal-Mart, and many looked forward to seeing him there.                 John was preceded in death by his parents and his only brother, Robert. He is survived by his brothers and sisters in Christ, especially those at First Baptist Church, and numerous friends.                 In lieu of flowers, gifts are encouraged to be made to the First Baptist Church memorial fund, 915 S. 8th Ave. Sterling, CO 80751. Chaney-Reager Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.

(“MoneyGram” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: MGI) concerning possible violations of federal securities laws. Investors who purchased or otherwise acquired shares pursuant to the company&#8217;s secondary public offering completed on or around April 2, 2014, are encouraged to contact the Firm in advance of the November 14, 2016 lead plaintiff motion deadline. To participate in this class action lawsuit, click here. You can also call Brian Lundin, Esquire, of Lundin Law PC, at 888-713-1033, or e-mail him at brian@lundinlawpc.com. No class has been certified in the above action. Until a class is certified, you are not considered represented by an attorney. You may also choose to do nothing and be an absent class member. The complaint alleges that MoneyGram and underwriters of the secondary offering violated Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. Specifically, the complaint alleges that MoneyGram issued misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material adverse information in offering documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the possibility of Walmart entering the money transfer business and the consequences of such a development. On April 17, 2014, Walmart announced that it would launch a money transfer product on April 24, 2014.

This is your ninth team in three years, right? A. I believe so, yes. Q. That’s kind of a unique experience for a player. A. To be honest with you, the overall journey is fun and I’m blessed to be here and be able to help my family. You meet good people, but at the same time it can be stressful because everything may not always work out how you want. At the end of the day, it’s a journey and I know how I want it to end. I’m still writing my chapter. It’s ‘to be continued.’ [ NFL schedule and scores | NFL standings | Panthers schedule and results ] Q. Do you ever think about what it would be like to stay somewhere longer? A. You know, I’m looking forward to when the journey does end. That I can say, ‘It finished how I wanted it to.’ Q. In your career, sometimes you’ve been in a place for less than a week before having to go somewhere else. What do you do during that week? A. I mean, sometimes being in that position you’re at the mercy of whatever happens. In this specific position (defensive tackle), obviously you could still get picked up by any team overnight. That’s happened to me before. I went to one team and was on the practice squad, and then two days later I got picked up and was on an active roster. Sometimes it was the next week. At the end of the day, you can’t control it. ... I’m loyal to whatever team I happen to be on at the time and right now that’s Carolina. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:02 Perry Orth passionate about what his USC legacy should be Pause 1:14 Firefighters having 'difficulty' containing South Mountains State Park wildfire in NC 1:59 Missing S.C.

Charlotte Observer NFL writers Joe Person and Jourdan Rodrigue preview Kansas City Chiefs at Carolina Panthers and pick their winner. mpersinger@charlotteobserver.com Q. So I assume you’ve gotten really good at packing. A. Oh, yeah. I’m a professional traveler. I got that locked down. Q. What is one thing you make sure you always pack? A. Deodorant, toothpaste, socks. I’m not going to lie, my rookie year when I was traveling I forgot socks every single time I traveled. Every single time. I’d have to Uber in the middle of the night to Wal Mart to get socks. You’d be surprised how easy it is to forget socks. Q. How does your family respond to all of this change? A. Well, my family still supports me. Obviously I help support them too. They’re so loyal, you can’t ask for anything more than that because when you live this lifestyle and you’re at the mercy of getting up and leaving all of the sudden, your family understands and supports you and it’s a great thing. Q. What’s the best memory you’ve had from a specific town or city that you’ve been in in the last three years? A. You find yourself traveling to different teams and you meet teammates that you’ve played with before. I played with (safety Michael Griffin) before. Q. Any cities you loved? A. Well, I was in Chicago and I grew up there and grew up a fan. So playing there and running out of the tunnel was great, growing up a fan and all that. ... Seeing all the people from the South Side go up north with the Bears. But don’t get it twisted, now I’m a Green Bay fan. (Shakes his head, laughs, palms his forehead.) I mean, a Carolina fan. You know. Geez. So many different teams, I’m telling you. Carolina fan. It’s a blessing. Q. Would you say you describe yourself as a ‘journeyman’? A. Oh, definitely. There’s a lot of words, but mostly it’s a journey. That’s what this is. To the end of my career, it’s all going to be a journey. And playing in the NFL allows me a lot of opportunities to do other things too. It’s a blessing, you can’t really get better than that.

Congratulations, you’re on your way to a healthier, fitter, and more emotionally balanced life. But making the decision isn’t the hard part, the real work lies ahead. After all, the weight isn’t going to lose itself — you need long-term dedication and perseverance. A personal trainer can help keep you focused and on track, but it’s expensive to hire one. Increasingly, people are turning to fitness bands instead. They can monitor your workouts, track your calories, and measure your body’s cardio performance. In this article, I’m going to share six tips that’ll help you lose weight with a fitness band. The pounds will be falling off in no time! 1. Find Your Level When you’re just starting your plan, you need to get a firm grasp of your current levels. Without a base number to work from, it’ll be difficult to plan your schedule or monitor your improvements.

You need more data from this early period — specifically, you’ll also need to track your calorie intake. Some bands have an accompanying app that allow you to log your food, but the best app available is arguably MyFitnessPal. It’ll integrate with most of the leading fitness bands and adjust your calorie intake goals accordingly. According to a 2013 article in the journal Obesity Reviews, stringent self-monitoring is scientifically proven to help weight loss: Consistent self-monitoring of exercise is associated with greater total weight loss, a greater amount of exercise, and fewer difficulties with exercise. In moving past traditional methods of self-monitoring such as paper-and-pen diaries, research has found that technology can simplify the monitoring process. This can include recording one’s progress of food intake and physical activity. 2. Track Intensity Once you’ve discovered your current fitness levels, you need to increase the amount of data you actively monitor How to Get Your Best Workout Using Fitness Sensors How to Get Your Best Workout Using Fitness Sensors There are lots of devices and apps that will help you exercise and stay healthy. Here are some of the latest innovations in the area of fitness sensors. Read More . This new data will help you set effective and realistic goals. Start by tracking the number calories you burn during a workout. Look at how the number increases over time and how long it takes to burn a fixed number. Again, most of the leading fitness band manufacturers will provide an app for charting how your intensity changes over time. These figures are a great motivational tool — you’ll begin seeing some progress in a matter of days, even if the scales aren’t yet showing a change. 3. Add a Heart Rate Monitor Heart disease is responsible for 610,000 deaths in the United States and 31 percent of worldwide deaths every year. It’s comfortably the biggest global killer. Your heart rate is perfectly correlated with the number of calories you burn. The faster it beats, the faster you lose weight. Sounds perfect. But if it beats faster, you also tire faster. Even worse, if you’re not fit, it can be dangerous to have a highly-elevated heartbeat for a prolonged period. The solution is to keep your heart rate lower. You’ll be able to safely train for a greater amount of time, and thus burn the greatest number of calories. Unfortunately, a lot of bands only estimate your heart rate based on your activity, height, weight, age, and gender. If you’ve already got one of these bands, you’ll need a separate heart rate monitor. If you’re in the market for a new band 7 Best Fitness Trackers 2016 7 Best Fitness Trackers 2016 If you’re an active person, activity trackers provide incredibly valuable data for logging, improving, and understanding your fitness. But among the devices out there, finding the right activity tracker can be difficult. Read More , try the Mio Fuse or Basis Peak. They both have an optical heart rate monitor built in.

Track Your Sleep Why is it important to track your sleep 10 Android Apps for Tracking and Improving Your Sleep 10 Android Apps for Tracking and Improving Your Sleep These apps will surely help you get a better night's sleep. Read More ? You’re trying to lose weight, not lay around in bed! Consistently getting a good night’s sleep is hugely important to your ability to lose weight effectively: A lack of sleep is shown to lead to overeating. Your body craves sugary food to make up for the lost hours of restful recovery. An extended period (one week or more) of poor sleep will reduce your body’s insulin sensitivity. Your body will become less effective at burning calories and your weight could start to climb, even if your diet stays the same. Tiredness leads to laziness and reduced power. You might not make the effort to go to the gym or cook a healthy meal. It can quickly lay waste to your meticulous weight loss plans. Most fitness bands come with sleep trackers. They’ll show you how much restful sleep you’re getting every night, and give you a chance to make amends to your routine. 5. Choose a Good Scale It might seem like fitness bands can do everything, but one thing they can’t do is track your weight (seriously, don’t stand on it, it’ll break!). If your goal is weight loss, the final piece in the jigsaw is to invest in a good scale. Don’t buy the cheapest one you can find in Walmart — they can be wildly inaccurate. If you’re serious about your program, it’s better to buy a Wi-Fi connected set that’ll sync with your band’s app. A word of warning: weight can be deceptive. Some professional rugby players and American football players are well above 280 pounds and would be “morbidly obese” on the BMI scale, but they are among the fittest and healthiest athletes on the planet. Make sure whichever scales you buy can record your body composition as well as your raw weight. Fitbit Aria Wi-Fi Smart Scale, Black Fitbit Aria Wi-Fi Smart Scale, Black Aria syncs automatically and wirelessly through your home Wi-Fi network. Network requirements: Wireless 802.11b, WEP/WPA/WPA2 personal security, Automatic (DHCP) IP setup (static IP configuration not supported) Buy Now At Amazon $128.95 6.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Games Retro-era recreated with official release of mini NES Classic Edition: Full list of pre-installed vintage games The Mini NES Classic Edition is seemingly difficult to purchase due to its increased demand. Rahul R November 12, 2016 15:07 IST Retro era recreated with official launch of mini NES Classic Edition: Full list of pre-installed vintage gamesNintendo Nintendo has finally released the much-expected NES Classic Edition miniature console aka Mini NES Classic that bears uncanny resemblance to the company's first-gen Nintendo Entertainment System hardware released in 1985. The USP of the new mini console is that it comes pre-loaded with as many as 30 vintage games that bring back childhood memories. However, going by the latest reports it seems that the mini NES Classic cannot be purchased easily as stocks have already run out even within major retail stores in the US. Even e-tailers seem to have run out of stock. Amazon US had opened orders on Friday at 5PM ET; but those who tried to purchase the Mini NES Classic Edition console were fretting about the lack of availability. Why advertise with us?

Nintendo has also come out with an official statement about the increased demand in the Mini NES Classic Edition. The company is propagating optimism by having stated that new units of the mini NES Classic Edition would be made available with retailers soon. Participating e-tailers include Amazon US, Walmart, Best Buy, Target and Game Stop.

Chief Executive Officer Len Riggio is happy with the U.S. presidential election -- happy it's over. Riggio complained, along with other retailers, that the volatile campaign was a distraction that kept Americans from shopping. Barnes & Noble, the world's biggest bookstore chain, said it saw the biggest impact on weeknights, when the three major cable TV networks provided a steady diet of talking heads weighing the strengths and weaknesses of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. "We expect a bounce-back," Riggio said in an interview after Trump's victory. "The preoccupation with the election was hurting sales." Retail executives are notorious for coming up with excuses for weak sales, from the weather to a fluctuating holiday calendar, and analysts were skeptical of their claims. But in the months leading up to Election Day, Riggio was joined by a chorus of fellow CEOs that included Gap Inc.'s Art Peck, Signet Jewelers Ltd.'s Mark Light, Yum! Brands Inc.'s Greg Creed and Todd Penegor from Wendy's Co. On Thursday, Kohl's Corp. CEO Kevin Mansell joined in, saying on an earnings call that the election had been a distraction and that the "certainty" of the outcome would be good for the all-important holiday season. Niccolo Ricci, CEO of Stefano Ricci, a closely held Italian luxury-menswear company, said wealthy people often turn cautious during an election year. That proved to be true in New York, where sales fell during the past few months, according to the company. Ricci said he expects consumer sentiment to improve in the next few weeks. Ricci's comments were echoed by William Lauder, chairman of the beauty company Estee Lauder Cos., who said consumers will accept the election results. "There's nothing that will scare them off their traditional holiday shopping pattern," he said in an interview. Companies are eager to get their marketing plans back on track. Target held off on running its holiday ads on network TV during the campaign. Instead, the retailer moved them to lifestyle channels like HGTV and the Food Network, where they were less likely to appear alongside negative campaign commercials. With the election over, Target, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Co. on Thursday announced their store hours for the Black Friday shopping weekend. They will open on Thanksgiving day again, as will department stores like Macy's Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. As the election fades, the question of what a Trump presidency might mean for retailers, brands and restaurants remains. The president-elect campaigned on limiting international trade, including by slapping tariffs on goods from China and Mexico. That could increase costs for retailers because they mostly sell foreign-made products, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. "We have to wait and see how these policies unfold," Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren said. "There's a lot of things that are said in the election process, and then you actually get into office." On the campaign trail, Trump also talked about cutting regulations and corporate taxes, platforms now more likely to pass after Republicans maintained control of both chambers of Congress. "These could be very positive for business and our consumer, and ultimately very positive for Macy's," Lundgren said. Riggio, who founded Barnes & Noble, declined to say for whom he voted, but the 75-year-old entrepreneur said he's seen a lot of presidents come and go and that none has had a profound long-term effect on the bookseller's financial performance. He does, however, expect sales to pick up as the election moves further into the background. "You won't turn a switch and see the whole retail business coming back, but it hit a bottom and it's starting to turn up," Riggio said. "People are going to get on with their lives." -- Information for this story was contributed by Leslie Patton, Shannon Pettypiece, Lindsey Rupp and Stephanie Wong of Bloomberg News.

Froma Harrop: A political 9/11 changes our world By Froma Harrop, Creators.com 11:06 p.m. CST November 11, 2016 Trump is an enthusiast for the U.S. energy industry, insiders believe. (Photo: Katie Klann, Naples Daily News-USA TODAY Spor) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Like the 2001 terrorist attacks, the Donald Trump upset win threatens Americans’ sense of safety and continuity. Financial markets went into convulsions, just as they did on that Sept. 11. The difference is that the 9/11 tragedy forged national unity, whereas the Trump election exposed grave internal discord. And a world that rushed to America’s side 15 years ago shudders at us now. Calmer opinion says we’ll get through this. The erratic and uninformed Trump will be checked and balanced by Congress and wise advisers. One hopes but also wonders. With only a few brave exceptions, Republican lawmakers fell in line behind Trump, whatever the outlandish conduct. Can they stand up to an egotist who rains abuse on critics? And who’s going to choose the advisers? The fears expressed here don’t center on the prospect of an extreme conservatism in the White House. Trump, as principled conservatives have long complained, isn’t conservative. A former Democrat, he called for leaving Social Security and Medicare alone. He’s supported Planned Parenthood in the past. Religious conservatives expecting him to end abortion are going to be disappointed. During the primaries, Trump defanged the Club for Growth, the pitiless enforcer of free market purity. The Club for Growth once annihilated moderate Republicans open to any tax hike -- no matter how small, on whom or what in exchange for. Supporting regulations that might impinge on someone’s profit margin was another cause for political beheading. So when Trump backed tax and spending hikes, defended social programs and bashed free trade, another sacred cause, the Club for Growth turned its fire hose of money against him, but to no avail. The club failed to whip up tea party anti-establishment rage against Trump because Trump had absconded with the anti-establishment crown. On the campaign trail, Trump challenged conservative doctrine in ways big and small. In Manchester, New Hampshire, he told his audience a rarely spoken truth about the consequences of carting the old factory jobs back to the United States. ’’He said that his trade policies would, in addition to bringing jobs back to the U.S., raise prices for American consumers -- and that this was a good thing,’’ James Surowiecki wrote in The New Yorker. This revived a lost tradition in American politics in which government protected jobs and manufacturers as a policy goal. Consumers weren’t king, and keeping prices low at Wal-Mart was not a priority. Trump’s tirades against the North American Free Trade Agreement wallowed in misinformation, as did his flat rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Actually, the TPP is designed to help us compete against China. (China is not a member.) Economists say Trump’s promised trade war could push America into a recession and cost 5 million to 7 million U.S. jobs. Try explaining that to the blue-collar whites who flocked to Trump in search of a magical fix for their economic and social distress. Try to explain that robots are taking over manufacturing work everywhere, China included. The Chinese government’s response is to prepare these workers for higher-skilled occupations. That’s what we should do. But the populist con game pretends that nothing has changed since the 1970s and that stopping cargo ships would restore the past. (It would certainly stop our products from reaching other ports. See the job loss numbers above.) From a policy perspective, Trump’s proposals are not all bad. The man’s the problem. Nothing was worth the crude racism, vulgar attacks and in-your-face lying that Trump normalized in the election of 2016. Those wanting to address our challenges in a systematic way feel their orderly world has crashed down on them. The scary question now is, can Trump behave? Four years will tell.

It's part of the Greenlight a Vet movement to show visible support for our nation's veterans. Organizers ask citizens to change visible light in their home or office to green, the color of hope, then share about their actions on social media. The project is sponsored by Walmart, which says the project does more than raise awareness for veterans support. Last year, the company's philanthropic arm, the Walmart Foundation, made  a $500,000 grant to Hire Heroes and a $190,000 grant to Blue Star Families. Copyright 2016 WBRC. All rights reserved.

EMAIL LISTEN https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20161111_ShieldsandBrooks.mp3SEE PODCASTS JUDY WOODRUFF: And we come back to the analysis of Shields and Brooks. That is syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks. And let me just kick this off by saying there’s nobody I would rather spend more than nine hours with on Election Night than the two of you. (LAUGHTER) MARK SHIELDS: Thank you so much, Judy. (LAUGHTER) JUDY WOODRUFF: So, having said that, political earthquake. The earth moved under our feet, David. How big an earthquake was it? DAVID BROOKS: Well, it’s certainly the political shock of our lives, at least my lifetime. It feels like almost the ’60s, sort of like political revolution, cultural revolution, aesthetic revolution, the things that now you can say and get elected president. And so it was all those things. I’m sort of finding myself in a strange emotional territory, if I could lie on the couch here. On the one hand, Trump appalls me. I won’t be shy about that. But having — with the elective democratic process having taken its turn, I sort of feel we have to owe some respect to the process and owe some respect to the electorate and the people who voted him, on the assumption that they have something to teach us. And so all these people are marching in the street. There is all this hostility. I find myself — and I think this was the president’s attitude and frankly Hillary Clinton’s attitude — of respectful pause. Maybe I will be as upset at Trump as I was in another week, but what do they try to teach us? Just try to understand what the situation we’re in is. JUDY WOODRUFF: Respectful pause, Mark? MARK SHIELDS: Yes. I, Judy, believe devoutly that the national election is the closest thing we have to a civic sacrament of democracy. And I really do think that heed must be paid, and when people make a decision, those who are on the other side, including me, accept it, for that reason. I think that probably the best analysis, of the millions of words that were written, other than David’s — David’s were really perceptive and wise. But there’s a woman named — I don’t know her name — Salena Zito at “Atlantic.” And she said something. She said, to understand this election, critics of Donald Trump take him literally, but not seriously. His supporters take him seriously, but not literally. In other words, so while his critics were very upset with what he said, the — his supporters really were the mood and the positions he took, rather than precise phrases or words. I say that because now, as of Tuesday, everyone has to take him seriously, and I think that’s what we’re seeing. I think the anxiety in schools that we hear, in minority communities, those with the archbishop of Los Angeles at Our Lady of the Saints Cathedral yesterday at an interfaith service with Jewish and Muslim, and was very open and said, our children are fearful that their parents — the government is going to come and take their parents away. And I think that’s a consequence of the election. I mean, in addition, the fact that he won, but his positions appear to prevail, and I think there have left fear in a lot of places. JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, David, I was going to ask the two of you what you think, with reflection, the voters were saying. But I also — I was struck by what we just heard a few minutes ago by voters in Manassas, Virginia. One young woman said, I guess — she said, I guess hate is now state-sponsored. And we heard a man say — another woman say, I’m for immigrants, just the right immigrants. What were voters saying, do you think? DAVID BROOKS: Well, they certainly want change. We know that. They’re fed up with a lot of talk and no change. On the issues, they preferred her. She got better marks on the economy and foreign policy. But they just didn’t get the sense she was a reformer. So they want some unnamed change. I think they also wanted some sense of dignity, some sense of being heard. I mean, in some sense, there is something noble, in that people that was people who felt marginalized, working-class voters, A, taking over their party from basically what had been a corporate party, and then asserting their will on the country, against groups of people who were more privileged than they are, both on the left and the right. And so there is something nice about that. I think Trump is the wrong vehicle for that. But, you know, you’re living in a town, there are no jobs in the town, you know your friends are dying of O.D.-ing on opiates or something, you’re having trouble paying your bills, you’re playing by the rules, and other people are getting benefits without playing by the rules. Maybe you’re willing to tolerate a lot of bigotry from Donald Trump if you say, just change things, just change things. And so I don’t — I think the voters who voted for him certainly are willing to tolerate a lot of ugliness, but maybe, if you’re in desperate circumstances, or you think the country is deeply in trouble, you’re willing to tolerate that without necessarily liking it. JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you hear? What do you think the voters were saying? MARK SHIELDS: Well, the first thing that bothers me are my liberal friends, or too many of them, I think who immediately run to the race card. The fact is that it’s the most dangerous place to be on the political scale is to brand those on the other side as racist. That’s the atomic bomb. That’s the nuclear weapon of an American. Once I accuse you of racist, I have demonized you, and it means any future collaboration, cooperation between us is a sign of my moral deficiency, if I would deal with someone like that. It’s just — it’s a terrible thing to do. I say that for a factual reason. Barack Obama carried Iowa, carried Wisconsin, carried Michigan. He not only carried Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan twice. He carried the white — a majority of the white vote in those states. And so Hillary Clinton lost them, Donald Trump won them, and it’s a little, I think, transparent, false to say that the people are racist. These are the same voters who would vote for an African-American man and didn’t vote for the white woman Democrat. So, I think that’s dangerous. I think, Judy, it was a revolt of working-class Americans. I think it was a revolt against us in the press. I think it was a revolt against the ruling class who were indifferent to their plight, to the fact that, for a generation, their standard of living has declined or that their children’s futures are blighted. I thought Peter Hart and Dan McGinn, when they wrote that the people who led this revolution are foreign to Washington and New York, they don’t go to Starbucks and they don’t take their children on tours, they care about high school sports more than about pro sports, they go to Walmart, McDonald’s, and they have declining incomes, and they think their grandparents and parents built this country. They scream that they want their country back. And I think that — I think they saw indifference from the ruling elites, both public and private, particularly private. JUDY WOODRUFF: You said it wasn’t race. And, yet, David, people — many people of color are saying they feel the message is directed at them. DAVID BROOKS: Right. So, there is a racial element here. There is clearly a racial element. And so I think that I don’t have a machine to peer into the souls of the voters. So I don’t know how much of the racial element was dominant, how much was there, something they tolerated, something they endorsed. Clearly, for some people, it was a large element. I do not believe, having spent these last many months interviewing Trump voters, that it’s a dominant element in at least a lot of the people I spoke to. They had good reason, as Mark just elucidated, for why they were really upset with the course of the country. Their culture, their life economically, socially, families breaking apart, drug use, it’s going downhill. And I think the two things — one, we don’t want to turn this into a children of light, children of darkness, where us college-enlightened people, educated, enlightened people are looking down at those primitive hordes. We do not want that. That’s what — that condescension is what fueled this thing in the first place. And so I don’t think we want that. Second, through American history, we have had populist movements that often, often, often have this ugly racial element. But, often, there are warning signs of some deeper social and economic problem. And we have rapidly increasing technology, which is making life very good for people who are good at using words, and not so good for people who are not good at using words. And so the ugliness can sometimes be super ugly, but also a warning sign of something down below. MARK SHIELDS: No, I agree with what David said. I would just add, Judy, that the problem is that what Donald Trump said, if you take it literally now, is cause for anxiety and nervousness. JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean during the campaign. MARK SHIELDS: What he said during the campaign, I mean, is — it’s legitimate, the anxiety and the nervousness that you feel and that children feel right now, because — if you do take him literally. He has to do something to reassure, and beyond tweeting that he either likes or doesn’t like protests. I just — the protests, the breaking of windows at this point, I mean, I just want anybody in the protest to have an “I voted” sticker on their jacket lapel before they get out there. And I understand the concern, but please accept this democracy. And he is the president. He’s going to be the president in 75 days, or whatever. And, you know, he now has a responsibility, I think, to calm those waters and to reassure people that there isn’t going to be — there aren’t going to be Storm Troopers coming down to take their grandparents in a patrol wagon. JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, in the last couple of minutes, David, we are seeing some signals from Donald Trump or the people he has put on his transition committee, putting in the vice president-elect, instead of Chris Christie. He’s putting his children, his son-in-law on that committee. He said today that he’s — in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that he’s thinking about keeping part of the health care reform law after talking to President Obama about it. So, what are we to think? Maybe this is not going to be all the big moves that were hinted at during the campaign? DAVID BROOKS: I’m obviously outraged Tiffany didn’t get a job. Maybe she will get Fed chairman or something. I think when — the nomination of Mike Pence is more of a sign that he’s going for conventional Republicans. Until last summer, Pence was a very conventional. He was in the House, well connected with the conventional movement Republicans. And I assume he will tap, he may be more conventional. I think Donald Trump is going to find it very hard to do the kind of massive change he wants. Obamacare is woven into the fabric of health care. It’s very hard to just rip it out, as he sort of acknowledged with The Wall Street Journal. The Iran deal, maybe we can withdraw from the deal, but our other partners are not going to withdraw from the deal. When you get down to each of these individual things, deporting people, when you get down to each of the individual things, the barriers to change are massive. And the simple promises he makes just don’t apply to reality. So he’s got to do some big changes, because what he was voted on. But when you think about how to do it, it would take massive expertise, which his people, believe me, do not have. JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 20 seconds, Mark. What do you think he… MARK SHIELDS: Well, 213 times to vote to repeal Obamacare, it’s a very easy, grandstand act. Doing it and taking 20 million people and taking them off insurance, those with preexisting conditions, those who don’t have any other coverage, you know, that’s a reality. And it is going to be difficult, make no mistake about it. And this is where you confront reality from the rhetoric of the campaign. JUDY WOODRUFF: The transition begins.
