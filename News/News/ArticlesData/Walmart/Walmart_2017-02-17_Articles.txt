Matthew Adam, of Hamilton County, is championing a class-action lawsuit alleging Walmart's line of "Trouble Brewing" beers is an act of fraud and false advertising. According to Adam's complaint [PDF], filed to the county court this month, the retail goliath is pulling off an elaborate ruse by describing the Trouble-branded Cat's Away IPA, After Party Pale Ale, Round Midnight Belgian White, and Red Flag Amber Ale, as "craft beers." In fact, the origin of the booze is anything but artisanal and other adjectives you're supposed to associate with "craft." The beer is, we're told, mass produced. Still with us? It's OK, take another moment, the anger will subside. To be specific, the beer is brewed and bottled by a national brewery called Genesee. Adam's big problem, aside from allegedly being lied to about brewery size, is that Walmart charges a premium (on average $2 extra) for its craft beer offerings above what it asks for brews from larger regional or national brewery chains. "Defendant's Craft Beer has never been a "Craft Beer" nor has it been produced by a craft brewery," the complaint reads. "Rather, it is a wholesale fiction created by the defendant that was designed to deceive consumers into purchasing the Craft Beer at a higher, inflated price." In defining a "craft beer," Adam refers to the Brewers Association, which says that true craft suds have "annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less (approximately 3 percent of US annual sales)." Thus, Adam and his lawyer argue, Walmart has been ripping off the American beer-drinking public by putting its macro-brewed Trouble Brewing lineup with local craft offerings rather than on the national shelf with the likes of Budweiser and Coors. He seeks a jury trial to decide damages and attorney fees on behalf of himself and Walmart beer drinkers in Ohio for violation of state laws on false and misleading advertising. Walmart did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. ® Tips and corrections 28 Comments More from The Register Walmart sues Visa for being too lax with protecting chip cards The only thing lower than our prices is your security! 66 Comments Speaking in Tech: Went to Cancun... visited the Walmart Podcast All the best tech gossip here...

(Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post) If you believed the Trouble Brewing beers sold at Walmart are truly craft beers, instead of private-label beers produced at a large industrial brewery in Rochester, N.Y., you’re not alone. But one Cincinnati beer drinker is so mad that he’s suing the world’s largest company over what he’s calling the “wholesale fiction” around the ales, seeking compensatory damages “in an amount to be determined at trial.” A class-action complaint filed in the Hamilton County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas on behalf of Matthew Adam “and all others similarly situated,” alleges that Walmart used a “fraudulent, unlawful, deceptive and unfair course of conduct” to market and sell its four Trouble Brewing beers as craft beers, and because of this, “Members of the public were fraudulently induced to purchase Defendant’s Craft Beer at inflated prices.” Ragan Dickens, Walmart’s national director of media relations, said in an email statement, “We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality products they expect. While we have not yet been served with the complaint, we take this matter seriously and intend to defend ourselves against the allegations.” Adam’s attorney did not respond to email or phone messages seeking comment. [There’s something brewing in the Walmart beer aisle, but you can’t call it ‘craft’] The 12-page complaint, published online by Consumerist, reiterates most of the facts laid out in a story I wrote last month, down to quotes from a senior buyer for Walmart’s adult beverage team: The four Trouble Brewing beers were created for Walmart by WX Brands, a company that “develops exclusive brands of wine, beer and spirits for retailers around the world.” Though the cans say the contents were “brewed by” Trouble Brewing in Rochester, N.Y., no American brewery with the name Trouble Brewing actually exists. They’re actually produced at Genesee Brewing, makers of Genesee and Genesee Cream Ale, on a contract basis. Genesee is owned by North American Breweries, a subsidiary of Costa Rica-based Florida Ice and Farm, which includes breweries among its holdings. These “statements and omissions were material to the transaction at hand,” the complaint says, “as Plaintiff would not have purchased [the Trouble Brewing beer] otherwise.” Beyond the issue of where the beer is made, the lawsuit is partly based on the fact that it’s not craft beer, a claim that Trouble Brewing never makes outright on its label, though Teresa Budd, a senior buyer for Walmart, told me, “We were intentional about designing a package that conveyed a look and feel you’d expect of craft beer.” The Brewers Association, a national trade group for small brewers, defines craft brewery as being small (under 6 million barrels produced per year); independent (less than 25 percent owned or controlled by a non-craft brewer) and traditional (making traditional beers, not flavored malt beverages, alcoholic sodas or other products). Further, Julia Herz, the Brewers Association’s craft beer program director, told me last month that “we do not classify contract companies as brewers because they don’t have a brewers’ notice from the Tax and Trade Bureau.” This is not the first lawsuit filed by a consumer who alleges being misled into thinking that a product made by a large company is in fact produced by an artisan brewery or distillery, and it certainly won’t be the last. The problem is that the track record of these lawsuits isn’t very good. Last June, for example, a federal judge dismissed a case brought by a California beer lover who claimed that Blue Moon, which is owned by Coors, was marketing itself as a craft beer produced by the Blue Moon Brewing Company. The judge found that “a reasonable consumer was not likely to be deceived” by Blue Moon’s packaging or website. In 2015, a federal judge dismissed several lawsuits against Tito’s Handmade Vodka from consumers who complained that the vodka was not, in fact, handmade as the label asserted; Maker’s Mark had similar suits dismissed the same year. But Templeton Rye Whiskey settled a 2015 class-action lawsuit in which a man from Iowa claimed Templeton was “deceptively marketing” its whiskey as a small-batch spirit distilled in Iowa using a “Prohibition-era recipe.” In fact, it was made at the large MGP Ingredients distillery in Lawrenceburg, Ind., and then blended with flavoring agents before being bottled in Templeton, Iowa. Consumers who had bought bottles of Templeton Rye between 2006 and 2015 were eligible for a refund of $3 per bottle, or $6 if they kept original receipts, according to the Chicago Tribune. lifestyle food food true Please provide a valid email address.

TWIN FALLS — Your used foam cups and egg cartons could soon become picture frames sold at Wal-Mart. Dart Container Corp. launched a free, 24-hour recycling drop-off site this week in Twin Falls. The leading foam cup manufacturer, which produces plastic straws and containers in its Twin Falls facility, wanted to give people a local option for recycling foam. The drop-off site at 750 Eastland Drive S. can take clean foam products with a recycling No. 6 on the bottom, including many cups, egg cartons, meat trays and ice chests. The recycled materials are later turned into picture frames — sold at Michaels, Target and Wal-Mart — or Home Depot’s baseboards and crown molding. “If businesses are throwing the foam out, they may as well bring it to us,” Corporate Director of Recycling Programs Michael Westfield said.

I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. “We are thrilled to be able to offer Twin Falls residents, businesses and organizations a new recycling drop-off for their used foam,” Ashley Elzinga, recycling and community outreach specialist at Dart Container, said in a statement. “This drop-off advances recycling in the city. Our hope is that residents will take advantage of this free program and make it a habit to recycle their foam.” Dart provided the following tips to consider before you lift the doors up at the drop-off container: Look for the No. 6 chasing arrows symbol on your foam donation. Put the foam in a clear or translucent bag. Rinse or wipe food off of food service containers. Remove straws, lids, tape or any other non-foam material. Do not include foam-packaging peanuts (Call 800-828-2214 or visit loosefillpackaging.com for drop-off sites). Have a lot of foam? For large deliveries, call Michelle Root at 208-733‐7613 extension 2002 from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Patrol car with lights flashing Photo: Ron Chapple, Getty Image Driver allegedly tries to run down women at Fremont Walmart 1 / 1 Back to Gallery A woman and her daughter received some unwelcome attention at a Fremont Walmart on Monday when a man tried to run them over with a minivan full of garbage, police said. The two women had just arrived at a Walmart on Albrae Street when the man angrily confronted the younger woman, apparently without provocation, the older woman told police. He then got into a minivan full of trash and almost hit the younger woman, police said. The altercation is being treated as an attempted assault with a deadly weapon, according to police. Fremont Police described the assailant as 68 or 69 years old, “unshaven with a thin face.” Police did not specify what time the incident occurred. Filipa A.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Feb 16, 2017 at 6:20PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently said some 4 million locations, or about 35% of all retail stores in the U.S., accept its Apple Pay mobile payment option. Although there are some notable exceptions among the largest retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, who don't offer it, others like Gap do, or soon will feature the payment solution. Because it's available on mobile phones, tablets, and even the Apple Watch, its ubiquity and relative ease of use make it the go-to choice for consumers on the go as well as those dissatisfied with the hassle and delays of embedded chip cards. According to data analytics firm TXN Solutions, which surveyed the transactions from over 3 million payment cards, Apple Pay usage has soared by 50% over the past year. Image source: Apple. The rise of Apple Pay Indeed, during Apple's first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts last month, CEO Tim Cook said transaction volume had risen sixfold from the prior year as Apple Pay expanded into four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain. While that would seem to clash somewhat with TXN's more muted (though still significant) rise, it comes down to a difference in what's being measured. While Apple isn't particularly forthcoming on details of the Apple Pay ecosystem, it is talking about the actual number of transactions made, while the data analytics firm is referencing the percentage of transactions from its panel of consumers who provide their credit and debit card data and whose banks distinguish Apple Pay transactions. While that naturally limits the universe of transactions captured, over time it still tracks the acceptance of the mobile payment option and its growth, and what it found was that most people were using it in mobile apps and on websites. A place to crash for the night That surprising conclusion was reached after finding that of all the places Apple Pay users were using the payment option, getting a cheap hotel room at the last minute topped the list. Ordering takeout was apparently the second favorite way to use the service.  Image source: HotelTonight. The TXN data, which examined payments made between December 2015 and December 2016, found mobile travel app HotelTonight, a last-minute reservation service, had 3.4% of all its credit cards transactions made with Apple Pay, followed by food delivery services Caviar, Postmates, and DoorDash, which all had around 2.5% usage rates or slightly higher.  What is more notable about the survey results is that despite the broad proliferation of places accepting Apple Pay as an option, it really hasn't caught on among brick-and-mortar retailers, where most places saw it represent less than 1% of all credit card transactions. And ultimately, regardless of where it is used, it isn't creating much of a stir in the payments industry, as it represents just a small percentage of total credit card transactions.   But let's first cross off the names of stores where people aren't using Apple Pay. Starbucks' mobile ordering trumps Apple pay At the bottom of the list is Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which came in last on a list of the 13 top places processing Apple Pay transactions, accounting for about 0.5% of the coffee shop's total credit card transactions. Considering Starbucks has its own highly regarded mobile ordering and payment option, which is often looked at as the gold standard for convenience and ease of use, it raises eyebrows that people are using Apple Pay there at all. On its first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts two weeks ago, Starbucks President Kevin Johnson said, "Mobile Order & Pay had a banner quarter, representing more than 7% of total transactions, double the figure from Q1 last year, and we now have nearly 1,200 stores with 20% or more Mobile Order & Pay transactions at peak, compared to only 13 stores one year ago." When you have customer loyalty like that, who needs Apple Pay? Image source: Starbucks. Food retailers still represent the lion's share of places seeing Apple Pay usage, and Lowes Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets, Panera Bread, and Schnucks round out the bottom five places for users of the mobile wallet, with around 0.6% of their credit card transactions accounted for using the payment method. A prescription for future growth? So, if Starbucks and trendy grocery stores were bringing up the rear, who was it that was leading the brick-and-mortar pack? Would you believe Duane Reade, the New York metropolitan area drugstore chain owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA)? According to the TXN data, the pharmacy operator was the top spot where people used Apple Pay, with 1.8% of the credit card transactions identifying the mobile payment option being chosen. That put it slightly ahead of No. 2 retailer Whole Foods Market (Nasdaq: WFM), which had about 1.7% of its credit card transactions using Apple Pay. Because both retailers have been with the service since Apple launched Apple Pay in 2014, it might not be so surprising they were well ahead of the others, including Canteen Vending at No. 3 with slightly less than 1% of its transactions, and fourth place Peet's Coffee with just under 0.8%. Whether that means Apple Pay will ever supplant EMV cards as a preferred payment option remains to be seen, but it seems hard to believe it will replace Starbucks' mobile order and pay app anytime soon. And though Apple Pay users seem to be a rare breed indeed, maybe all you need to see them in action is to simply stop by your local pharmacy.

And ultimately, regardless of where it is used, it isn't creating much of a stir in the payments industry, as it represents just a small percentage of total credit card transactions.   But let's first cross off the names of stores where people aren't using Apple Pay. Starbucks' mobile ordering trumps Apple pay At the bottom of the list is Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which came in last on a list of the 13 top places processing Apple Pay transactions, accounting for about 0.5% of the coffee shop's total credit card transactions. Considering Starbucks has its own highly regarded mobile ordering and payment option, which is often looked at as the gold standard for convenience and ease of use, it raises eyebrows that people are using Apple Pay there at all. On its first-quarter earnings conference call with analysts two weeks ago, Starbucks President Kevin Johnson said, "Mobile Order & Pay had a banner quarter, representing more than 7% of total transactions, double the figure from Q1 last year, and we now have nearly 1,200 stores with 20% or more Mobile Order & Pay transactions at peak, compared to only 13 stores one year ago." When you have customer loyalty like that, who needs Apple Pay? Image source: Starbucks. Food retailers still represent the lion's share of places seeing Apple Pay usage, and Lowes Foods, Sprouts Farmers Markets, Panera Bread, and Schnucks round out the bottom five places for users of the mobile wallet, with around 0.6% of their credit card transactions accounted for using the payment method. A prescription for future growth? So, if Starbucks and trendy grocery stores were bringing up the rear, who was it that was leading the brick-and-mortar pack? Would you believe Duane Reade, the New York metropolitan area drugstore chain owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA)? According to the TXN data, the pharmacy operator was the top spot where people used Apple Pay, with 1.8% of the credit card transactions identifying the mobile payment option being chosen. That put it slightly ahead of No. 2 retailer Whole Foods Market (Nasdaq: WFM), which had about 1.7% of its credit card transactions using Apple Pay. Because both retailers have been with the service since Apple launched Apple Pay in 2014, it might not be so surprising they were well ahead of the others, including Canteen Vending at No. 3 with slightly less than 1% of its transactions, and fourth place Peet's Coffee with just under 0.8%. Whether that means Apple Pay will ever supplant EMV cards as a preferred payment option remains to be seen, but it seems hard to believe it will replace Starbucks' mobile order and pay app anytime soon. And though Apple Pay users seem to be a rare breed indeed, maybe all you need to see them in action is to simply stop by your local pharmacy.

(Adds details on previous sales, analyst comment paragraph 14)
    By Lisa RichwineLOS ANGELES, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co <DIS.N> and
major retailers will release the galaxy's newest "Star Wars"
toys at a Sept. 1 midnight event ahead of the holiday debut of
the next film in the saga, "The Last Jedi," company executives
told Reuters.
    The marketing push called "Force Friday II" is a sequel to
an event Disney used to build buzz for merchandise tied to the
2015 movie "The Force Awakens."
    Star Wars products were a big contributor to the financial
success of the series reboot. BB-8 droids, lightsabers and other
playthings made "Star Wars" the U.S. toy industry's top-selling
property for 2015 and 2016, with $1.5 billion in sales over the
two years, research firm NPD said.
    Hasbro Inc <HAS.O> cited "Star Wars" sales when it reported
its biggest quarterly revenue rise in nearly five years for the
December 2015 quarter. Mattel Inc <MAT.O> also posted a surprise
rise in sales for the same period with help from "Star
Wars"-based Hot Wheels toys. And at Disney, licensing income
from "Force Awakens" merchandise drove record quarterly
operating income in the consumer products unit.
    Force Friday II will begin just after midnight on Sept 1.
Lego, Hasbro and others will release the first toys, apparel,
books and other products tied to "The Last Jedi," both online
and in stores around the globe at retailers including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc <WMT.N>, Target Corp <TGT.N>, Toys R Us Inc
<IPO-TOYS.N>, Kohls Corp <KSS.N>, Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> and
Disney Stores.
    Disney will incorporate new technology to its "Last Jedi"
products like it did with the popular BB-8 droid, said James
Pitaro, chairman of Disney consumer products and interactive
media. New products will feature returning characters such as
Rey and Finn, plus new ones, and will span a broad range of
categories for male and female fans, he said.
    "One of our top priorities is to expand the audience,"
Pitaro said.
    Disney bought "Star Wars" producer Lucasfilm in 2012.
    "The Last Jedi," the eighth installment in the "Star Wars"
saga that began in 1977, debuts in theaters Dec. 15. Toys
typically hit shelves closer to a movie's release, around four
to six weeks in advance.
    At the 2015 Force Friday, fans dressed as stormtroopers and
Jedi waited hours in line ahead of the midnight store openings.
    "There was a certain mania that took over," said Marty
Brochstein, a senior vice president at the International
Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association. The excitement
around "Star Wars" in 2015 was unique because it had been a
decade since the last film, Brochstein said.
    "It would be unfair to expect the same kind of volume
generated this time around by consumer products," he said,
adding it was too early to assess demand.
    Pitaro said Disney continues to see "very, very healthy
sales" of "Star Wars" merchandise. "We have a lot of confidence
we will continue in that direction," he said.
    The 2015 Force Friday contributed 3.7 percent to "Star Wars"
sales that year, NPD data showed. NPD toys industry analyst Juli
Lennett said the franchise has ranked among the 10 top-selling
toy properties for more than 10 years and she expects it will
"continue to be a strong force."

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo 4/4 By Lisa Richwine | LOS ANGELES LOS ANGELES Walt Disney Co and major retailers will release the galaxy's newest "Star Wars" toys at a Sept. 1 midnight event ahead of the holiday debut of the next film in the saga, "The Last Jedi," company executives told Reuters. The marketing push called "Force Friday II" is a sequel to an event Disney used to build buzz for merchandise tied to the 2015 movie "The Force Awakens." Star Wars products were a big contributor to the financial success of the series reboot. BB-8 droids, lightsabers and other playthings made "Star Wars" the U.S. toy industry's top-selling property for 2015 and 2016, with $1.5 billion in sales over the two years, research firm NPD said. Hasbro Inc cited "Star Wars" sales when it reported its biggest quarterly revenue rise in nearly five years for the December 2015 quarter. Mattel Inc also posted a surprise rise in sales for the same period with help from "Star Wars"-based Hot Wheels toys. And at Disney, licensing income from "Force Awakens" merchandise drove record quarterly operating income in the consumer products unit. Force Friday II will begin just after midnight on Sept 1. Lego, Hasbro and others will release the first toys, apparel, books and other products tied to "The Last Jedi," both online and in stores around the globe at retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp , Toys R Us Inc (IPO-TOYS.N), Kohls Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Disney Stores. Disney will incorporate new technology to its "Last Jedi" products like it did with the popular BB-8 droid, said James Pitaro, chairman of Disney consumer products and interactive media. New products will feature returning characters such as Rey and Finn, plus new ones, and will span a broad range of categories for male and female fans, he said. "One of our top priorities is to expand the audience," Pitaro said. Disney bought "Star Wars" producer Lucasfilm in 2012. "The Last Jedi," the eighth installment in the "Star Wars" saga that began in 1977, debuts in theaters Dec. 15. Toys typically hit shelves closer to a movie's release, around four to six weeks in advance. At the 2015 Force Friday, fans dressed as stormtroopers and Jedi waited hours in line ahead of the midnight store openings. "There was a certain mania that took over," said Marty Brochstein, a senior vice president at the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association. The excitement around "Star Wars" in 2015 was unique because it had been a decade since the last film, Brochstein said. "It would be unfair to expect the same kind of volume generated this time around by consumer products," he said, adding it was too early to assess demand. Pitaro said Disney continues to see "very, very healthy sales" of "Star Wars" merchandise. "We have a lot of confidence we will continue in that direction," he said. The 2015 Force Friday contributed 3.7 percent to "Star Wars" sales that year, NPD data showed. NPD toys industry analyst Juli Lennett said the franchise has ranked among the 10 top-selling toy properties for more than 10 years and she expects it will "continue to be a strong force."

He was already doing most of the things he outlined in his big announcement last week, but maybe they'll start to bear fruit. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Feb 16, 2017 at 9:07PM Things look grim for Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD), but the ailing retailer's plan to trim $1 billion in costs and close more stores heartened investors enough to send its stock soaring 25% last week. Has Chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert finally convinced the market he can turn things around for the parent company of the once-venerable Sears chain?  Maybe, though probably not. Sears stock had hit an all-time low before the rally, and even with Friday's big gain it's still lost more than half its value over the past year. The shares may have benefited more from short sellers who got squeezed than from any sudden belief Sears will become relevant to U.S. consumers again, but hope also remains that Lampert can pull a rabbit out of the hat. Sears may not exactly thrive in the current market, but perhaps it can at least survive. Image source: Getty Images. Although I'm a longtime critic of many of the moves Lampert's made over the years that brought Sears to this precipice, with the retailer set to report its fourth-quarter and full-year results later this month, let's look at what Lampert is doing right that just might save Sears after all. I see four areas where his maneuvers might help, and though each carries risk, they could pay off handsomely if they work. Unique deals for remaining premium brands The sale of the Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) indicates the way Lampert may go with both his Kenmore appliances and DieHard batteries, as well as Sears Home Services and auto centers. On one hand, this move could hurt Sears, because shedding the tool brand and allowing the items to be sold at other retail outlets, even as it retains rights to make and sell them, means it will be competing against itself and gives consumers another reason not to shop at Sears. On the other hand, Lampert structured the deal so the retailer earns a small percentage on every sale Stanley makes for three years. That could give Sears a nice stream of revenue it wouldn't otherwise have. Doing similar deals for Kenmore and DieHard might generate more cash, too. A better strategy might be to simply open up the brands to more retail outlets outside Sears. No doubt the Stanley deal was done because Lampert needed a quick injection of cash into the business, but making the appliances and batteries available in a Wal-Mart, for example, or at least in Home Depot or Lowe's, would help boost their sales. Again, it undercuts sales its own stores make, but you can find Coach handbags at a department store as well as in its own stores, so it's not a fatal move and can help foster brand awareness. Image source: Craftsman. Becoming asset light The big selling point of a Sears investment has long been the ability of the retailer to monetize its asset base. Lampert finally did that with the creation of the Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE:SRG) real estate investment trust and the sale to it of several hundred stores. By leasing them back from the REIT, Sears relieves itself of the costs associated with the properties. Of course, that means it still has to pay rent and may have to keep underperforming stores open longer than would be wise because of lease obligations, but so far Sears has sold mostly good properties to Seritage, and it pays bargain-basement rents. More sales will provide it with greater cash, and though that's a one-time fix, Sears' expansive footprint gives it greater flexibility in that regard. In his restructuring announcement, Lampert reiterated that he planned to close 150 stores in the first quarter and had closed on a $72.5 million real estate sale last month for five Sears stores and two auto centers. He's also committed to marketing and selling an additional $1 billion worth of real estate. As the company's store base shrinks in size and number, the amount of money it needs to maintain and improve the stores is reduced. Remodeling stores Tied to that model is using its square footage more efficiently. What Seritage is doing with many Sears stores it bought is carving them up and renting out the space to a number of different retailers, such Dick's Sporting Goods, Petsmart, Nordstrom Rack, and Saks Off 5th. It is then tripling the rental income from what Sears paid. Sears is doing that on a smaller scale, allowing retailers to rent out space in its existing stores. Two years ago Lampert suggested that one day Sears might start opening smaller stores, and while in its current financial shape it's not about to go that route, it can in some fashion do so by reducing its footprint within its own stores. And since it will collect rent from the retailers it shares space with, it accomplishes the same thing while giving Sears an influx of cash. Lampert said last week he planned to "capitalize on valuable real estate through potential in-store partnerships, sub-divisions, and reformatting," so we'll probably see more of that coming in the future. Image source: Sears Holdings. Integrated retail Among one of Lampert's more transformational investments for Sears is the Shop Your Way membership loyalty program that awards customers points depending on how much they spend, whether it's in-store, online, or via catalog. As a result, some three-quarters of all eligible sales at Sears and Kmart stores are from Shop Your Way members. Lampert has used the member loyalty program as a stepping stone to create his integrated retail strategy, and he continues to expand Shop Your Way's partners, including ride-sharing service Uber and a Shop Your Way-branded credit card with MasterCard. Sure, those are no-cost relationships to the partners, but it can and does make the program more valuable and useful to the millions of members. Better than nothing There may be no solution. Macy's is falling under the weight of legacy retail and is considering a sale or reorganization. J.C. Penney, which had pulled back from the brink a few years ago, may be sliding again. The Limited closed all of its stores to become an online-only store. (Now there's an idea for Lampert.) Some of these companies were significantly better situated financially than Sears, and if they're wracked with problems, what hope is there for Lampert and his store? Little, it would seem, but Sears has defied expectations of its demise before, and it could do so again. In reality, Lampert's big announcement last week really did nothing but codify plans he's already made and told the markets about before. It could very well have been little more than an attempt to soften the blow of what will surely be a very disappointing earnings report. After all, he did say comparable sales will be down more than 10% for the fourth quarter and losses will probably widen over last year. Lampert may be doing some things right at Sears but if the company survives that doesn't mean I'd be investing in its stock. That rally was nuts. There are structural issues here that would be difficult for a better company to surmount, and Sears isn't one of those businesses. Still, investors might want to hold off writing the eulogies for Sears Holdings for the moment. Reports of its death might not be greatly exaggerated, but they may be premature nonetheless.

While the $20.4 billion business grew a healthy 5 percent last year, insiders are hoping for an even better year this year as 20 movies with toy tie-ins are scheduled to hit the big screen. That’s up from about eight last year. As the toy industry prepares to gather for the annual Toy Fair extravaganza beginning Saturday, companies, from giants like Mattel and Hasbro to smaller shops will be unveiling toys licensed from “The Lego Batman Movie,” “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Pirates of the Caribbean” — and plenty of others. That means the toy aisles of Walmart, Target, Toys R Us and many other retailers will look like the gift shop on some Hollywood back lot. “It’s not even close — 2017 is by far a record,” Jim Silver, chief executive of TTPM, a toy review Web site, said of the flood of movie tie-in toy ready to hit store shelves. “In a typical year there might be six to eight kids movies that come out.” The commercial success of the 2015 release “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” awakened Hollywood as well when it generated more than $700 million in toy sales alone that year. The studios get a piece of the licensing revenue. “Studios are being smarter about creating entertainment that translates better into toys,” added Silver. For many parents, it’ll mean getting dragged to the movies to see “Beauty and the Beast” in March, “Wonder Woman” in June, “Justice League” in November and then “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” in December — and then to a store for the toys. Toy sales related to movies will account for up to 20 percent of the industry’s revenues this year, according to toy reviewer TTPM. That’s up from about 10 percent last year. But not every movie has a shot at being the next “Star Wars.” “Some of these properties are not reliable” sales engines, pointed out Sean McGowan, managing director of Liolios Group. “ ‘Harry Potter’ was a big franchise but was never a big toy line, and ‘Men in Black’ did well at the box office [but] didn’t sell a stitch of toys,” McGowan said. Retailers will also be quick to swap out less popular toys on the shelves when the next movie comes out. “There is only so much space in the toy aisle,” McGowan said. “There’s going to be a lot pushing and shoving on the shelves.” For example, there’s going to be less room for the “Despicable Me 3” merchandise on shelves when the highly anticipated “Cars 3” is released a couple of weeks later on June 30, he said.

They allegedly sold the same "Disney on Ice" tickets to multiple people. (Published Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017) A Massachusetts couple is accused in a scam in which they sold the same "Disney on Ice" tickets to multiple people. It all started with a Facebook post requesting $150 for four tickets to Disney on Ice at the TD Garden. UpdatedTrump: Russia Controversy a 'Ruse' by 'Dishonest' Media "The guy told me they were still available and he could meet me wherever," said Steven Perez of Northbridge. Perez met Kevin Wood in a Walmart parking lot in Northbridge Tuesday and bought the tickets for his 9-year-old daughter. Britax Strollers Recalled for Damaged Receiver Mounts "They were printed on paper, so I assumed they were legitimate," Perez said. Ariel Cierpich saw the same post and she, too, was told the tickets were available. She was planning to take her friend Tyler Marengo's 2-year-old son Ryan to the show. Would You Let Someone Who's Not a Dentist Pull Your Teeth? "He was so excited, he was so excited to see Disney on Ice, he was so excited," said Marengo. But when Cierpich met Wood in a McDonald's parking lot in Northbridge to purchase them, she knew something wasn't right. Classic Game Piece Voted Out of Monopoly Board Game "When he left, I went to message him and say 'thank you so much,' and he had me blocked," Cierpich explained. Cierpich reached out to another woman who had shown interest in buying the tickets. Trump's Pick for Israel Envoy Goes on Damage Control "She says the guy says they're still for sale," said Cierpich. So the two women went to Northbridge police and set up a sting operation in the Shaws parking lot, where an undercover officer purchased the same tickets a third time from Wood and his girlfriend, Miranda Paille. Fact Check: Trump's Iffy Grasp of Autism Research The Blackstone couple was arrested, the fake tickets confiscated and the money was returned to the victims. But they say it was about more than just the money. Trump's Labor Secretary Pick Withdraws Nomination "They were doing something scummy to kids," said Cierpich. "Like, come on!" After Wood and Paille were arrested Wednesday, they were charged with larceny. Both remain in custody on bail.

Don’t ask why, and don’t ask how; it really doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s there, and that the camera tilts down to see it: a visual metaphor that manages to punctuate the film in a way that can’t possibly have been intentional, saying everything you need to know about the movie while still managing to say absolutely nothing at all. Had director Richie Keen possessed even a modicum of self-effacing irony he would have opened with this shot and thrown the title on screen right then and there. And that’s “Fist Fight” in a nutshell. It isn’t even funny by accident, let alone on purpose. It’s a film where everyone shouts their dialogue BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT MAKES IT FUNNY, and where the word “f—k” is treated as both a foolproof set-up and punchline. As such, it’s just people shouting “f—k” without understanding that, like when you’re actually doing what the word means, it’s all in how you use it. This turgid, overlong cacophony of migraine-inducing noise is the feature-length equivalent of that last sketch of the night on any of the worst seasons of “Saturday Night Live,” snuck in during the final minutes before its shot and put out of our misery by the closing credits. The idea of two teachers (Charlie Day and Ice Cube) having an afterschool row in the parking lot has about five minutes’ worth of mineable material; in this case, it’s bloated, corpse-like, to eighteen times that length, decomposing gaseously before your very eyes. It’s like watching an autopsy video on the concept of humor. There are literally no jokes. It’s the aforementioned shouting (peppered at times with screeching), and a preoccupation with erect penises, masturbation, and ejaculation, all of which serve as metaphors for the People of Walmart filmmaking you’re watching. It’s unintentionally meta. Charlie Day continues to refine his performance as “Charlie Day,” while Ice Cube, who used to wear his Compton background as a seal of authenticity, continues his transformation into a safe and fuzzy Saturday morning cartoon caricature. Once upon a time, he was rapping about gang violence, or informing white America that to inner city youth, “Uncle Sam was Hitler without an oven.” Now, he’s play-fighting an actor from “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” inside a toilet stall while a nerdy kid jerks off to internet porn. Keepin’ it real! Straight-up hardcore frontin’ duties go to Day’s onscreen (and I’m pretty sure unnamed) daughter (Alexa Nisenson), who performs a song I’m happy to say I’d never heard and can’t be bothered to investigate for this review (because I’m keepin’ it real). This sequence, built around a climactic middle school talent show, is groundbreaking in its effort to raise the comedic bar. Instead of uptight old people dancing to rap music, “Fist Fight” has a pre-teen singing a rap song! With gang signs! And eff-bombs! That’s why it’s funny! KEEPIN’ IT F—KIN’ REAL! But maybe I’m off base. The audience at my preview screening spent the entire film in a near-convulsive state of hysteria so visceral that the floor was literally shaking from the stamping of feet. All the while my bitter migraine was exacerbated by the braying, hyena-like laughter fired directly into my ears. “Fist Fight” provoked a football-like response, as the crowd spent ninety-one minutes engaging the movie, directly – asking questions, repeating back every other line of dialogue, and kindly going so far as to narrate the action for the benefit of everyone else in their row (who, strangely, were all doing the same thing at the exact same time). This might have led to some missed spots on the crowd’s part, as I overheard more than one group trying to piece together the plot on the way out, or attempting to explain to their slightly slower companions the deep intricacies of the many penis jokes. In that respect, “Fist Fight” is an amazing success, as it can miss something as obvious as a (literally) shitty ending and its intended audience doesn’t even notice.

On Feb. 14, Manuel Garcia posted to Facebook a photo of him standing under a dangling “p” at a local Texas Walmart. Garcia wrote he was “waiting for the P to fall and knock [him] out to be able to sue Walmart.” As of Feb. 16, the picture garnered 18,000 likes and more than 44,220 shares. However, Garcia’s Facebook suggested he was unsuccessful in his attempt to sue Walmart and decided to go back to the same spot the next day.

By Rachael Bade, Burgess Everett and Eliana Johnson 02/16/17 07:38 PM EST House Speaker Paul Ryan has framed his proposal as a compromise between a tariff, which the president wants, and conservative orthodoxy against border taxes. | AP Photo Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print Paul Ryan showed up to Senate Republicans’ weekly lunch on Tuesday hoping to salvage a controversial pillar of his tax reform plan that would change how imports and exports are taxed. “Keep your powder dry,” the House speaker pleaded. The next day, Sen. Tom Cotton took to the Senate floor to slam Ryan’s so-called border adjustment tax, saying “some ideas are so stupid only an intellectual could believe them.” Story Continued Below “Many other senators share these concerns and we most certainly will not ‘keep our powder dry,’” Cotton went on, without naming the speaker in his speech. The sequence was an ominous sign for a linchpin of Ryan’s tax plan — and perhaps for the prospects of tax reform happening at all. The border adjustment tax would generate more than a trillion dollars over a decade; there’s no obvious way to replace that money, which is needed to help pay for a steep cut in corporate and income taxes. In meetings with administration officials and Senate leaders, Ryan has framed his proposal as a compromise between a tariff, which the president wants, and conservative orthodoxy against border taxes. He has suggested it's in keeping with President Donald Trump’s “America first” mantra, since it would reward American manufacturers that make products here and sell it abroad. But the idea is sharply dividing Republicans — even within the White House. Trump fumes over leaks at private meeting with Republicans By Kyle Cheney and Rachael Bade Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon likes it, but the president’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, is opposed, according to people who have talked with them. Trump himself has acknowledged he doesn’t think much of the proposal, though he has said he will keep an open mind. Many Republican senators say privately they detest the concept, fretting that it will hurt their in-state retailers like Walmart, which is headquartered in Cotton's state of Arkansas. Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), sources said, has warned Trump and Ryan that border adjustment won't likely have the support needed to clear the Senate. Hatch, in an interview after Ryan's presentation, said the speaker “didn’t cover [the border adjustment proposal] as specifically as I would have liked.” And Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, the fifth-ranking GOP senator, said the Finance Committee will likely go a “different way.” Others were more unequivocal. “It’s beyond a complication. It’s a bad economic proposition,” said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). That’s not to mention Ryan’s issue in his own chamber. A handful of Ways and Means Republicans — including some with close ties to Trump — are fretting that retailers slapped with an import tax will ultimately pass the cost onto consumers. One member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio), asked his chairman Wednesday to hold hearings on the proposal. House Democrats say they were kicked out of meeting with ICE official By Heather Caygle The clock is ticking for Ryan. Senior House Republican sources told POLITICO that if the border adjustment proposal is not included in Trump’s tax blueprint, set to be unveiled in the coming weeks, it could be even tougher to rally Republicans to the idea. Supporters of Ryan’s proposal are crossing their fingers that Trump doesn’t introduce a detailed tax plan at all, worried it could complicate their work. A source familiar with the White House’s thinking said it’s unlikely Trump would try to push through the border-adjustment tax if key administration officials and senators are still divided over it. “It’s fair to say there’s a lot of questions about how it would work and the assumptions on which it’s based,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). During a news conference Thursday, Ryan downplayed questions about opposition to the border adjustment tax and argued some people simply don’t understand how it works. Holding up reporters’ tape recorders as props, he explained how an American-made recorder is taxed much more than a Japanese product. His idea, he added, would make American businesses more competitive worldwide. Senior House Republican sources who back him say the House has been working on tax reform for years and has already considered numerous financing mechanisms. But all of them have set off firestorms within various industries. A border adjustment tax, they say, is the best option on a limited menu. Without it, they contend, tax reform will die. Ryan has made the same pitch to his colleagues privately, according to one source close with the speaker who heard it. McCain to skip Pruitt confirmation vote By Austin Wright and Alex Guillén “Ryan is impressing on his fellow Republicans that any tax reform proposal is bound to contain controversial measures — which is precisely why it hasn’t gotten done,” the source said. If the new Republican majority is going to clear the hurdle, he has told colleagues, it is going to have to be with this plan. Ryan spent at least a half-hour explaining why the border adjustment is essential. But multiple GOP senators told POLITICO they felt his talk was too wonkish and hard to follow. Some bristled at being told to keep their “powder dry” while Ryan is aggressively campaigning for the tax. “I heard 'keep your powder dry' as, ‘Don’t articulate your cogent arguments against our bad idea,’” one senator said. “I have not yet talked to a single senator who’s enthusiastic about it. Ryan and [Ways and Means Chairman Kevin] Brady seem to have a near-theological commitment to it.” At the Senate GOP lunch a week earlier, former Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas blasted the border adjustment tax idea. His arguments were easier to follow and resonated with many of his ex-colleagues, attendees said. “To me he made more sense,” said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), contrasting Gramm’s presentation with Ryan’s. Not all Senate Republicans are panning Ryan's idea. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader, said “they've got a bold proposal out there" and said "at least conceptually, there are a lot of things in it to like." Trump names Alexander Acosta as labor secretary nominee By Josh Dawsey and Marianne LeVine However, "I think the border adjustability is the hard thing to sell," he added. Ironically, the speaker seems to have a strong ally in Bannon, the ex-boss of Breitbart News, which attacked the speaker mercilessly during the campaign. A senior House Republican source, however, said it would depend on who most has the ear of the president when he decides whether or not to support the proposal. In other words: Bannon's support doesn't necessarily mean Trump will follow suit. Ryan is hoping he can also win the support of Trump’s influential son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Treasury Secretary pick Steven Mnuchin and senior adviser Stephen Miller. While a host of conservative groups led by the Koch brothers and the Club for Growth have lined up in opposition, other outside groups with close Senate contacts are set to begin a campaign to pressure the chamber to take a closer look. It's led by former National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director Ward Baker at a firm run by Josh Holmes, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s former chief of staff — well-connected former ex-Senate staffers who could help Ryan tremendously. But the prospects in the Senate, at this point, appear grim. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) called Ryan a “brilliant man” and — parroting Ryan's talking point — said he’s keeping his “proverbial powder dry.” Yet Scott said Ryan needs to be aware that he might not have the votes to get his way in the chamber. “It’s not what we think about border adjustability. It’s what we do think about having 51 of 52 senators saying yes to border adjustability,” Scott said. “I’m not yet sold.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Rachael Bade rbade@politico.com @RachaelMBade Burgess Everett @burgessev Eliana Johnson ejohnson@politico.com This story tagged under: White House James Inhofe Jim Inhofe Taxes Paul Ryan John Cornyn John Thune Senate Donald Trump Phil Gramm Tim Scott Tom Cotton Jim Renacci House Of Representatives David Perdue Jared Kushner President Donald Trump Donald Trump Presidency Donald Trump Cabinet Wilbur Ross Stephen Bannon Listen to today's flash briefing POLITICO Playbook's must-listen rundown on what's driving the day in Washington.

And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world."   — Donald Trump on Thursday, February 16th, 2017 in a press conference Trump hints stock market record high linked to optimism about his presidency By Miriam Valverde on Thursday, February 16th, 2017 at 5:12 p.m. President Donald Trump's plans for deregulation and tax cuts led to record closing highs in the stock market. As he lauded his first month in office, President Donald Trump reaffirmed his promise to create jobs by citing the progress of the stock market as signaling a promising business environment. "The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world," Trump said in a press conference Feb. 16. "To me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, ‘Oh, that's good.’ Now it means, ‘That's good for jobs.’ Very different." Trump had sent a similar message earlier in the day, tweeting: "Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!" Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017 All three major stock indexes closed at record highs for five days in row on Feb. 15. But does Trump get credit for that, as he suggested? Experts told us there are nuances. Stock market winning streaks The Dow Jones Industrial Average includes the stocks of the 30 largest and most powerful companies in the country (Wal-Mart, Disney, Pfizer, for example). The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) consists of the 500 most commonly traded stocks and represents about 80 percent of the total value of U.S. stock markets. The Nasdaq Composite Index features mostly technology companies. All three major indexes on Feb. 15 closed at record highs for the fifth consecutive day. It was the first time the three indexes achieved concurrent high records for that length of time since January 1992, according to analyses reported by CNNMoney and MarketWatch. MarketWatch countered part of Trump’s tweet, saying that the Feb. 15 high really wasn’t "the longest winning streak in decades." "Rather, it’s the best record-setting stretch in a quarter century … In terms of winning streaks, the S&P has risen for seven consecutive trading days for its longest stretch of up days since September 2013, when it also rose for seven straight sessions. That’s according to Dow Jones data," wrote MarketWatch’s Victor Reklaitis, also noting Dow gains for five days straight and a Nasdaq seven-session winning streak. (More on the those winning streaks here and here.) Experts told us that investors are at least somewhat hopeful about Trump’s promised tax and regulation cuts, though that’s not the sole driver of the stock market highs. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 30 directing that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be eliminated. Trump says "wasteful and unnecessary" regulation kills jobs and stop businesses from growing. Trump also has promised to slash the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. In meetings with CEOs of different industries, Trump has reiterated that tax cuts are coming and that he’d like to get rid of 75 percent of regulations, "maybe more." He has also tweeted about a border tax for imports. "I would definitely say Trump gets credit," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The S&P 500 returns are up 3.8 percent from Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, said Stovall, who has studied the market’s returns during each president’s first month dating back to President Herbert Hoover in 1929. Amid the recession and during Obama's first month in office in 2009, returns fell 9.4 percent, Stovall said. They rose 1.4 percent during Obama's first month in office in his second term, according to Stovall's study. Tim Duy, an economist and professor at the University of Oregon, said the economy was poised for relative strength as the end of 2016 approached, regardless of Trump’s inauguration. "Underlying growth remained solid, and it increasingly looked like some of the inventory overhang of the previous year was easing," Duy said. Manufacturing and services sector surveys were going up, and two factors that’d been weighing on stocks -- decline in oil prices and strength of the dollar -- waned over 2016, Duy added. "The economy was not headed into a recession and, in the absence of a recession, stocks are more likely to go up than down," Duy said. "In other words, this was largely baked into the cake regardless of who won the election. Trump was handed a solid economy at the macro level." It’s still reasonable to believe that hopes of tax cuts have boosted stocks to some degree, but it wasn’t the dominant factor, Duy said. Economic news has been nuanced in recent weeks. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show 227,000 jobs were added in January 2017. The unemployment rate in January was 4.8 percent, slightly higher than the previous month but based on 584,000 more people looking for jobs after accounting for annual adjustments to population controls, according to Feb. 3 BLS figures. "Consumer confidence decreased in January, after reaching a 15-year high in December," said in a Jan. 31 statement Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, which presents the Consumer Confidence Index based on a monthly survey. "The decline in confidence was driven solely by a less optimistic outlook for business conditions, jobs, and especially consumers’ income prospects. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions, on the other hand, improved in January," Franco said. "Despite the retreat in confidence, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the coming months." Trump certainly isn’t the first to boast about the stock market’s performance. In 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed the stock market does better when there’s a Democratic president. While several calculations backed her statement, we rated her claim Mostly True because experts said several other factors are key in determining performance, including timing, policies and international economic trends. Our ruling Trump said, "The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world." The three major stock indexes, Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed at record highs for five consecutive days. While investors are optimistic about Trump’s plans to cut taxes and eliminate regulations, experts say other factors play influential roles in the stock market. After rising in December, consumer confidence dropped in January, though consumers are confident the economy will expand in coming months. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

MARKETING How Facial Recognition is Shaping the Future of Marketing Innovation "Getting to know the customer" is taking on a much deeper meaning. By Molly Reynolds Molly Reynolds has a strong passion for helping creative innovators fine-tune their skills for selling their product and themselves. For more of her work, please visit The Unicorn in the Room. @Molly_Reynolds1 The Unicorn in the Room@Molly_Reynolds1 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Facial recognition technology is something that most of us take for granted. We've casually noticed that our smartphones now organize photos by people, or that Facebook somehow always knows the right friends to tag. But until recently, most people haven't realized that this technology is less of a "cool trick" and will actually significantly shape the way we do business in the next five to ten years. The technology is already being tested out in many different industries for vastly different purposes. For example, security scanners at the airport use it to allow e-passport holders to clear customs more easily; as facial recognition improves, Customs and Border Protection will be able to weed out travelers with fake passports more easily. Also, facial recognition is now being rolled out to further government facilities and businesses that require a high level of security clearance. Through use of this technology, security professionals can easily run realtime criminal searches using CCTV. If you're constantly buying online (like me), it may have been a while since you stepped into your local mall or a mainstreet store, but large retailers are now using facial recognition to step up their game and compete with online shopping shopping sites by using intelligent technology to instantly recognize customers and target offers based on their buying preferences. They can also use it to catch shoplifters in the act, a system that Walmart has already implemented in several of its stores. If it's the first time your noggin has appeared on their screens, they will begin to build up a profile for you based on your in-store actions. For example, the amount of time you spend in a certain area, your path around the store and the items you pick up. The entertainment industry, casinos and theme parks have also caught on to its uses. They can hand tourists photos of themselves during their stay, or keep an eye on customers and any suspicious activity. And we're just at the tip of the iceberg as to what facial recognition can do for industries like banking and fintech. NTechLab is one of the prominent players in developing artificial intelligence algorithms and more specifically, facial recognition technology. In fact, at the end of 2015, they beat Google and nearly one-hundred other teams around the world in the University of Washington's MegaFace competition. I recently had a chat with Artem Kukharenko, CEO of Ntechlab to learn more about how Facial Recognition will innovate new avenues of marketing and advertising. And it's starting to feel like we're in the middle of a science fiction movie. "Facial recognition will allow marketers to effectively know their customers better," he said. "Visitors' photos may function as cookies referring to the identification and storage of user settings. In other words, loyalty cards will become obsolete. As soon as you walk into a store, the staff will already know what you bought last time, thanks to the camera's footage and our technology." This is certainly an advantage for retailers struggling to keep up the pace with internet giants like Amazon and online stores offering targeted deals and fast delivery. Facial recognition technology can also be used to retarget customers with personal offers. "Imagine that you walk into a supermarket, and examine a coffee maker but do not buy it, in a few days you could be shown an Internet ad of the same item with a discount or receive a personal message on social media with relevant information about such products," suggests Kukharenko. Obviously, having a strong data backup strategy certainly plays a strong role when it comes to the way we collect, store and utilize data of any kind. But the question on most people's minds, is what about the possibility of errors? Where the technology picks up a face that isn't the right one? According to Kukharenko, this is unlikely. This technology is improving almost daily and, being applicable to so many different industries, growing up fast: "We have found a special type of internal architecture for neural networks, that perfectly fits the face recognition tasks," he says. "That internal architecture removes the possibility of error." As this technology becomes more accessible, it will be not only be used for security or retail giants, but by progressive marketers and advertisers as well. This means that the one-directional, sweeping message of the billboard will likely be a thing of the past. Every advertisement you see, whether you know it or not, will be 100 percent targeted to you and your interests. When marketers can use Big Data, whether through online transactions or in store preferences, they can create almost entirely targeted campaigns, down to a single customer. We're not just talking about re-marketing here, but an AI technology that can pretty much read your mind - well, your face at least.

Bean rebuffs boycott over granddaughter’s big Trump donation Dylan Stableford Senior Editor Yahoo NewsJanuary 10, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos A man wipes off the headlights of the L.L. Bean Bootmobile in the parking lot at the facility where the famous outdoor boot is made. (AP Photo/Pat Wellenbach)More L.L. Bean is pushing back against a boycott led by a group urging consumers not to shop at retailers that support President-elect Donald Trump after it was revealed that Linda Bean, heir of the Maine-based company’s founder, had donated to a political action committee that helped elect Trump. “We are deeply troubled by the portrayal of L.L. Bean as a supporter of any political agenda,” Shawn Gorman, L.L. Bean’s executive chairman, said in a statement posted to Facebook late Sunday. “L.L. Bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters or make political contributions. Simply put, we stay out of politics.” Last week, the Associated Press reported that Linda Bean, a longtime Republican activist and granddaughter of Leon Leonwood Bean, contributed $60,000 to the Making America Great Again LLC. According to the Federal Election Commission, the donation exceeded the PAC’s contribution limit. In response, Grab Your Wallet, a group that advocates boycotting companies that “do business with the Trump family,” added L.L. Bean to its running list of pro-Trump entities. (Among them: Amazon, Macy’s, NASCAR and Walmart.) But L.L. Bean said the boycott against its company is “simply misguided,” considering Linda Bean is one of more than 50 family members involved with the business. “Like most large families, the more than 50 family member-owners of the business hold views and embrace causes across the political spectrum, just as our employees and customers do,” Gorman said. “And as every member of the family would agree, no individual alone speaks on behalf of the business or represents the values of the company that L.L. built.” Linda Bean is a member of L.L. Bean’s 10-member board of directors. Shannon Coulter, who co-founded Grab You Wallet in October after Trump’s controversial comments about women were revealed in a 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape, told Maine Public Radio that the group would drop L.L. Bean from its list if the company dropped Linda Bean from the board. “As fans of L.L. Bean’s products, everybody is hoping that the company is really seriously evaluating whether or not Linda Bean’s presence and contributions to the company are worth the damage she continues to inflict on L.L. Bean’s brand and reputation,” Coulter said. “We fully acknowledge and respect that some may disagree with the political views of a single member of our 10-person board,” Gorman said. “And we respectfully request that Grab Your Wallet reverse its position.” In lobbying against the boycott, L.L. Bean is trying to avoid the backlash fellow Northeast retailer New Balance received after a spokesman for the Boston-based company came out in support of Trump’s trade policies after his election victory. “The Obama administration turned a deaf ear to us,” Matt LeBretton, New Balance’s vice president of public affairs, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “And frankly, with President-elect Trump, we feel things are going to move in the right direction.” New Balance also posted a statement to Facebook saying LeBretton’s remarks were taken out of context. “New Balance does not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form,” the company said in its Facebook post. “My loyalty to New Balance ended today,” one woman wrote in response. “You endorsed a vile excuse for a human being whose policies are going to cause a lot of suffering to people, animals and the environment. My boyfriend and I have bought your shoes and sportswear for decades, now I’d rather go barefoot than wear anything with the NB logo.” The shoe manufacturer was subsequently embraced by the so-called alt-right. “Neo-Nazis have declared New Balance the ‘Official Shoes of White People,’” the Washington Post reported. “I’m a Nike guy. Or rather, I was,” Andrew Anglin, a noted neo-Nazi blogger, wrote in a post on his website, the Daily Stormer. “It’s time to get on-board with New Balance now. Their brave act has just made them the official brand of the Trump Revolution.” Read more from Yahoo News: Chuck Schumer trolls Mitch McConnell with copy of his own letter After mass shooting, Florida lawmakers want more guns in airports On the left, a call to ‘Resist’ Donald Trump Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Shepard Smith Calls President Trump’s Press Conference ‘Crazy’ 6642 messages5%60%35% Apple's Nightmare Begins, and Investors Are Happy Wealth DailySponsored Mariah Carey rocks first live performance since disastrous NYE show 2 messages0%100%0% ‘I was given that information; I don’t know’: 12 standout quotes from Trump’s marathon press conference 4285 messages6%63%31% 'Day Without Immigrants' protests across the U.S. 954 messages6%75%19% Signs and Symptoms of Breast Cancer MedStar HealthSponsored Gigi Gorgeous' doc 'This Is Everything' gives raw look into her life 2 messages0%50%50% There’s a broken iPhone on eBay right now for $149,999, and here’s why 196 messages3%71%26% Thimble tossed!

Posted: Thursday, February 16, 2017 Greenville police ask for help in finding indecent exposure suspect By Cory Smith • Last Updated 6:29 pm on Thursday, February 16, 2017 Tweet GREENVILLE — The Greenville Department of Public Safety is asking for public assistance after receiving multiple complaints involving recent incidents of indecent exposure. According to Interim Director of Public Safety Dennis Magirl, the department fielded two complaints in January and several more complaints last year about an individual who has been exposing himself in the parking lots of Meijer, Wal-Mart, Kmart and the Wesco gas station in Greenville. “We are not sure if we are dealing with more than one person,” Magirl said. “The individual positions themself within their van, where people would be able to look down and see him (expose himself). All of the reports so far have been about a man in a vehicle. Magirl said reports have indicated that the vehicle is a light or dark green van, and “very dirty,” possibly due to being driven on dirt roads. The suspect(s) has been described as a white male over the age of 30 with an average build and average height. Magirl said the department is attempting to retrieve security camera footage, but said a more complete description of the suspect or vehicle from a witness would be helpful. “The recent reports have come in between 7 p.m. and midnight at big parking lots of major retailers,” he said. “If someone is a victim of this, or have seen this type of activity, please contact us, as we are trying to establish a suspect in this. Right now I have very limited descriptions.” Anyone with information is asked to call the Greenville Department of Public Safety at (616) 754-9161.

Comments aAFont Size The majority of Americans have no clear idea what "sell by" labels are trying to tell them. But after 40 years of letting us guess, the grocery industry has made moves to clear up the confusion. On Wednesday, the Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the two largest trade groups for the grocery industry, announced that they've adopted standardized, voluntary regulations to clear up what product date labels mean. Where manufacturers now use any of 10 separate label phrases, ranging from "expires on" to "better if used by," they'll now be encouraged to use only two: "Use By" and "Best if Used By." The former is a safety designation, meant to indicate when perishable foods are no longer good. "Best if Used By" is a quality descriptor -- a subjective guess of when the manufacturer thinks the product should be consumed for peak flavor. That's what most "use-by" dates indicate now, though studies have shown that many consumers believe they signal whether a product is OK to eat. In fact, it's totally fine to eat a product even well after its so-called expiration date. These dates typically indicate one of two things: a message from the manufacturer to the grocery store, telling the store when the product will look best on shelves, or a subjective measure -- often little more than a guess -- of when consumers will most "enjoy" the product. Methods for setting those dates have been left to manufacturers, rather like the phrasing of the labels themselves. But when consumers see a date labeled "use by" (or, even worse, not labeled at all) they often tend to assume that it's a food-safety claim, regulated by some objective standard. Both the Department of Agriculture and a coalition of environmental groups have been urging the industry to clear this up. In addition to costing average Americans, in the form of prematurely tossed groceries, the waste represents a significant use of landfill space and source of greenhouse gas emissions. "I think it's huge. It's just an enormous step," said Emily Broad-Leib, the director of Harvard's Food Law and Policy Clinic. "It's still a first step -- but it's very significant." Advocates and environmentalists have been warning for years that many people interpret date labels as a sign that food is no longer good to eat. As a result, one industry survey found, 91 percent of consumers have mistakenly thrown away past-date food, when the label only signals the manufacturer's guess at its peak quality. Shoppers shouldn't expect to see the new labels the next time they buy groceries; the change won't be immediate. While the Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery Manufacturers Association are urging manufacturers and retailers to make it now, they have until July 2018. Even then, the standards are voluntary, so there's no guarantee that they'll be adopted by every single company. Some states also have labeling regulations that preempt the industry standards. In Montana, for instance, milk must come with a "sell by" label. That means milk in the state will still say "sell by," even if every other product gets the new labels. Still, a number of major manufacturers have already signaled their enthusiasm, including Wal-Mart, the largest seller of American groceries. And both the Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery Manufacturers Association are expecting to see widespread adoption, in part because the standards were written by a working group comprised of representatives from large food companies. The voluntary standards are also a way to influence, or preempt, pending federal regulation; there has been growing interest in a federal standard for label dates, which would both align the contradictory patchwork of state rules and guarantee corporate compliance. Last May, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, introduced legislation that would standardize both date labels and food donation laws. They're expected to reintroduce the bill in the coming weeks. In mid-December, the USDA also published nonbinding guidance that encouraged manufacturers to switch to the "Best if Used By" phrasing. This all delights Broad-Leib, who made similar policy recommendations in a 2013 report with the Natural Resources Defense Council. According to the council, Americans throw $218 billion worth of food away each year. The anti-food-waste coalition ReFed estimates that 398,000 tons, or $1.8 billion, could be saved through standardized date labels. Of course, that is just a drop in the waste bucket: To make a real dent in America's food waste problem, Broad-Leib said, more will have to be done. The Food Law and Policy Clinic is arguing for several federal interventions, including policy changes that make it easier for companies and farms to donate food and incentives to encourage them to do so. (Some of this appears in the Food Donation Act of 2017, which Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, introduced a week ago.) Broad-Leib would also like to see the Department of Agriculture designate more funds for local composting and anaerobic facilities, as well as education campaigns for consumers.

Broad-Leib would also like to see the Department of Agriculture designate more funds for local composting and anaerobic facilities, as well as education campaigns for consumers. NRDC and the Ad Council are currently running one such campaign, called “Save the Food.” After all, Broad-Leib points out, if Americans don’t understand food waste, the new labels won’t help. And, ultimately, neither will anything else. 16485698 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Bedford Police arrested 51-year-old Tamara Coulter, of 49 Newton St., on charges of operating a vehicle while intoxicated while endangering a person, inhaling toxic vapors and possession of a controlled substance. At 3:54 p.m. police received a report of a woman in a Pontica Grand Prix on Plaza Drive near the car wash huffing a can of air duster. "We then received a call saying the vehicle had left and was traveling east on 16th Street," says Bedford Police Chief Dennis Parsley. "The officer noticed erratic driving and stopped the vehicle at Brian Lane Way." The officers noted Coulter seemed confused and had slurred speech. Police found two cans of air duster, a bag that contained a pill crusher that had white residue on it. Coulter was taken to the Lawrence County Jail and later posted a $505 cash bond and was released. She was arrested again Thursday morning on a warrant stemming from an incident Friday at Wal-Mart. She is now facing additional charges of public intoxication, possession of a controlled substance and inhaling toxic vapors. According to a Lawrence County Superior Court probable cause affidavit, Coulter was found intoxicated at Wal-Mart. Police say Coulter had alprazolam, a Schedule IV controlled substance in her possession. She is currently being held without bond because she was out on bond when she was arrested this morning.

As well as showcasing exciting new products, services and equipment from 120 business from around the globe, the event provides first-class networking opportunities and the chance for attendees to raise their profile, discover all the latest industry trends, forge new business relationships and do deals. Organised by Informa Life Sciences Exhibitions, Food East Africa will host many of the F&B industry's key figures alongside other food industry professionals, suppliers and customers in order to provide participants with an exceptional marketing and sales opportunity. The event will also host a number of free-of-charge conferences that will address the market's challenges, opportunities and solutions. The F&B retail industry is witnessing a surge in demand among an increasingly wealthy consumer class in Kenya which is expected to maintain resilience in the sector. According to a recent Bloomberg survey, 36% of Kenyans do their grocery shopping in formal retail outlets which is the second highest ratio on the African continent. Indeed, Kenya is the largest economy in East Africa as well as a major trading hub for a region of 400 million people, and in 2015 was responsible for more than $300 million of consumer-ready food imports. Direct investment from companies such as Walmart, Carrefour and Botswana's Choppies reflects an increased international interest in the Kenyan market. This in turn has played a key role in increasing consumer confidence and spending as international brands enter the country to take full advantage of the retailing opportunities. Jamie Hill, Director, Informa Life Science Group, Africa, said: "After the successful launch of Food Nigeria in 2016, Food East Africa has become a much-anticipated event throughout the industry. Visitors will be able to view, and in many cases see demonstrations of all the new ground-breaking products and equipment currently on the market. There will also be the opportunity to establish long-lasting and lucrative business ties between participants. "It is appropriate too that this event takes place is Nairobi - the hub of the burgeoning Kenyan economy. The country is looking to position itself as a gateway to the continent, with roughly 45% of its exports by value going to other African nations. Of this, the majority of Kenya's Africa-bound goods go to fellow East African nations. "What is more, global and local fast food chains have signalled plans for aggressive expansion in 2017 to build on their entry into major towns around the country this year."

The former Weekend Update anchor is proficient at hijacking interviews and segments, especially when it comes to Conan’s various shows. But Tracy Morgan tossed his hat into the ring on Wednesday by stealing almost every segment from Conan and his fellow cast mates from Fist Fight. It starts with the story of “Big Murtis” above and her Sonny Liston hands, but soon devolves into Morgan bringing one of his stories into every free moment. And it’s welcome. One of the funnier moments was when Ice Cube revealed that Tracy likes to talk and joke about how much money he got from his accident. Making fun of a near fatal incident is certainly one way to help move past it, so why not? Morgan is just happy the Walmart truck was the one that hit him instead of one from like Bob’s Discount Furniture. “You know they ain’t got no money.” Next, he comes in following JoAnna Garcia Swisher’s story about being “knocked up” while filming the movie — a funny moment by itself. Once he hears the story, Morgan has to agree. He’s old school and loves the Sylvester Stallone suite.

Hot Topics: Walmart head-butting Missing Boulder woman Airport noise Frog Belly Farm cleanup Twin Lakes proposal denied News tips Longmont Humane Society reopens expanded Well Pet Clinic By Karen Antonacci Staff Writer Posted:   02/15/2017 07:47:58 PM MST Updated:   02/16/2017 09:37:32 AM MST Correction: The original version of this article contained incorrect information about how the Longmont Humane Society funded the renovation. That information has now been corrected. Sue Peterson and her 12-year-old blind basset hound Baxter marveled at the amount of people and pets in the newly-reopened Well Pet Clinic at the Longmont Humane Society on Wednesday afternoon. The Longmont Humane Society announced earlier this month that crews had finished renovating and expanding the clinic in order to accommodate more people bringing in their pets for services such as exams, spaying and microchipping. More than 7,500 pets in the Longmont community were treated at the clinic in 2016, according to a news release. On Wednesday, people filled the waiting room as staff reopened after the lunch break. A dachshund puppy wagged his tail under his owner's chair, a black labrador mix happily gobbled down free treats and a cat in a carrier looked out with wide eyes at the whole scene. The clinic expansion includes a new, 349-square-foot lobby and a new, 114-square-foot exam room. Carrie Brackenridge, marketing and communication manager for the Longmont Humane Society, said that anecdotally there have been more and more people coming in to get their pets checked out. Advertisement "We've had a pretty high demand for our services from the community and with the renovation, we can accommodate more people from the community and the space flows much better and more efficiently for our staff," Brackenridge said. Kelli Kanemoto, Longmont Humane Society director of development, said in an email that the renovation cost a total of $140,000. The Longmont Humane Society covered 55 percent of that cost through private donations while grants covered 25 percent and corporate support covered the other 20 percent, Kanemoto wrote. Sun Construction and The Walmart Foundation contributed to the project. Peterson brings Baxter, who is diabetic, to the clinic regularly so veterinarians can check his glucose levels. Peterson said she was impressed with the renovation and expanded waiting area. "Oh, I think it's wonderful. It used to be so crowded we would sit out in the hallway," Peterson said as Baxter plopped down to the ground with a grunt. "And we need some space because the dogs are not supposed to meet because you never know why a dog is in here or if they have something quite contagious. This looks way more professional — there used to be stuff piled up behind the (reception) desk." The Longmont Area Chamber of Commerce will hold a ribbon cutting at the renovated clinic at 4 p.m. Thursday.

Opinion Livable City Op-Ed I lived in a truck for 6½ years. Trust me, trying to roust homeless from their vehicles is no solution Santa Barbara's New Beginnings Safe Parking Program Los Angeles Times Homeless people who live in camper trailers park in one of 20 lots available to them through the New Beginnings Safe Parking Program in Santa Barbara on March 6, 2016. Homeless people who live in camper trailers park in one of 20 lots available to them through the New Beginnings Safe Parking Program in Santa Barbara on March 6, 2016. (Los Angeles Times) Les Gapay The recent crackdown in Los Angeles on people living in their cars and recreational vehicles got me remembering what it was like to be homeless. I lived out of my truck for 6½ years from 2002 through 2008. There is no easy solution to homelessness, but criminalizing it isn’t the answer. That’s essentially what L.A.’s new ban does: It prohibits parking “for habitation purposes” in residential neighborhoods and bumps the homeless to commercial and industrial streets, many of which have parking restrictions or meters. I feel for those people. I marvel that I survived something similar and finally got out of it. I was lucky. I never pushed a shopping cart, had mental or drug problems, begged for money or stayed in a homeless shelter. I had an old pickup with a camper shell to sleep in and a little income, but not enough to rent an apartment. I mostly paid to stay at county, state and federal campgrounds in the desert and at the beach in Southern California, and in cooler northern states in the summers. When campgrounds didn’t have showers, I had to make do with bathrooms in shopping malls and fast-food restaurants. During the day, I went into town to use library computers to get work doing freelance writing assignments for newspapers and corporations. My clients had no idea I was homeless. One challenge was finding places to clean up. When campgrounds didn’t have showers, I had to make do with bathrooms in shopping malls and fast-food restaurants, where I usually ate dollar sandwich deals. Once I qualified for early Social Security in 2005, at age 62, my plight eased somewhat. I was already on waiting lists for government-subsidized apartments, but it took years due to the demand. Building more permanent housing for the homeless, as L.A. plans to do with the proceeds of its recent $1.2-billion bond issue, is a crucial but long-term solution. Homelessness is an immediate problem.  Shelters help. Some businesses allow overnight RV and car stays in their parking lots. In Santa Barbara, a nonprofit runs a program for the city that includes “case management” with an overnight-only parking spot in certain lots, which revert to their regular uses every morning. More cities need such programs. Chula Vista, San Francisco, Santa Rosa, Sacramento and others have an answer for the bathroom problem too. They set up mobile showers and toilets, some with washers and driers for the homeless. That’s a lot better than trying to wash your hair in a bathroom sink at a fast-food place. I thought my homeless days were over in December 2008, when I finally got a subsidized apartment in Rancho Mirage, and then in Palm Desert. However, in the summer of 2014, I took a chance, put my stuff in storage and gave up my apartment in order to look into moving back to my home state of Montana. I couldn’t afford both the rent and the trip. In Missoula, Mont., I was en route to a Forest Service campground, but it was late so I checked out a Walmart parking lot where RV and car camping was allowed. I went into the store. When I came out, two men running with loaded shopping carts stopped me and one slugged me several times in the chest. A third came up from behind, put my head in an armlock and pounded my right eye. I was permanently blinded. The police told me the trio had been on a shoplifting spree. All three eventually pleaded guilty; the one who blinded me was sentenced to 20 years in prison with five years suspended. It took the monetary help of friends and strangers for me to recuperate in a motel after eye surgery and then return to Southern California. After three more months of cheap-motel living I found another subsidized senior apartment. Now I hope my homeless days are behind me forever, but I know nothing is certain in life or the economy. A year ago Christmas, the priest at my church in Palm Desert gave me $100 to give out to homeless people as I wished. I broke it down into $10 bills. I didn’t have any trouble on Christmas Day finding men and women in need outside fast food restaurants, resting at a bus stop, pushing a shopping cart down a sidewalk and in a parking lot at a Walmart. I had already decided the money should go to the first 10 homeless people I saw: no judgments. It wouldn’t matter if they were drunk, on drugs, able to work, whatever. Their eyes all lit up. They got a $10 bill, so much better than a buck, and it made me feel good.  Try it sometime, maybe with the next homeless person you see pushing a shopping cart — or sleeping in a vehicle on your block.

The marketing push called “Force Friday II” is a sequel to an event Disney used to build buzz for merchandise tied to the 2015 movie The Force Awakens. Star Wars products were a big contributor to the financial success of the series reboot. BB-8 droids, lightsabers and other playthings made Star Wars the US toy industry’s top-selling property for 2015 and 2016, with US$1.5 billion (RM6.68 billion) in sales over the two years, research firm NPD said. Hasbro Inc cited Star Wars sales when it reported its biggest quarterly revenue rise in nearly five years for the December 2015 quarter. Mattel Inc also posted a surprise rise in sales for the same period with help from Star Wars-based Hot Wheels toys. And at Disney, licensing income from Force Awakens merchandise drove record quarterly operating income in the consumer products unit. Force Friday II will begin just after midnight on September 1. Lego, Hasbro and others will release the first toys, apparel, books and other products tied to The Last Jedi, both online and in stores around the globe at retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp , Toys R Us Inc, Kohls Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Disney Stores. Disney will incorporate new technology to its Last Jedi products like it did with the popular BB-8 droid, said James Pitaro, chairman of Disney consumer products and interactive media. New products will feature returning characters such as Rey and Finn, plus new ones, and will span a broad range of categories for male and female fans, he said. “One of our top priorities is to expand the audience,” Pitaro said. Disney bought Star Wars producer Lucasfilm in 2012. The Last Jedi, the eighth instalment in the Star Wars saga that began in 1977, debuts in theatres December 15. Toys typically hit shelves closer to a movie’s release, around four to six weeks in advance. At the 2015 Force Friday, fans dressed as stormtroopers and Jedi waited hours in line ahead of the midnight store openings. “There was a certain mania that took over,” said Marty Brochstein, a senior vice president at the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers’ Association. The excitement around Star Wars in 2015 was unique because it had been a decade since the last film, Brochstein said. “It would be unfair to expect the same kind of volume generated this time around by consumer products,” he said, adding it was too early to assess demand. Pitaro said Disney continues to see “very, very healthy sales” of Star Wars merchandise. “We have a lot of confidence we will continue in that direction,” he said. The 2015 Force Friday contributed 3.7 per cent to Star Wars sales that year, NPD data showed. NPD toys industry analyst Juli Lennett said the franchise has ranked among the 10 top-selling toy properties for more than 10 years and she expects it will “continue to be a strong force.” — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week George and Amal Clooney are expecting a boy and a girl, actor’s mum reveals Nicole Kidman confirms she was engaged to Lenny Kravitz Anne Hathaway has monster problems in ‘Colossal’ (VIDEO) Check out the trailer for Demetri Martin’s directorial debut ‘Dean’ (VIDEO) Keith Urban leads country nominations after Pitbull rap Jimmy Fallon, Alec Baldwin try to out-Trump each other in ‘Box of Lies’ (VIDEO) Nur Fazura’s dog photograph irks Muslim fans Ben Affleck ‘wants out’ of Batman 'Fifty Shades Darker' has moodier vibe, says author and producer EL James Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Related Articles Daisy Ridley and Mark Hamill react to ‘The Last Jedi’ big reveal What we know about ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ (VIDEO) ‘Last Jedi’ title reveal sends ‘Star Wars’ fans into tizzy (VIDEO) US$700m — that’s how much Americans spent on ‘Star Wars’ toys in 2015 Check out this cool 15-foot long Star Destroyer drone!

Luster is in his first year as an assistant men’s basketball coach at University of the Pacific. He moved his girlfriend Tai Massey and toddler Kaius here from San Diego earlier this month.  The young family packed their every belonging into a U-Haul truck, hitched their car to the back and drove to their new apartment in north Stockton. It was too late to unpack. So they parked truck and car at the curb and slept. When they woke, both vehicles were gone. In their parking space was nothing but shattered glass. “I thought it was a joke,” Massey, 29, said of her disbelief. When she realized the loss was for real, she said, “I just wanted to run home to my mom.” Gone was new furniture they had just purchased, the new couch, new mattress and box springs, new nursery for Kai; and their clothes, plates, towels, and so forth. Gone, too, were irreplaceable things. The Oregon Ducks onesie Kai wore home from the maternity ward. JayDee’s framed basketball jersey from his playing days at the University of Wyoming. The picture of JayDee and Tai as teenagers, young sweethearts dressed for the prom. They called police. A policewoman came out. She said to them: “Welcome to Stockton.” That wasn’t good enough for Stefanie Leland. The wife of Pacific Athletic Director Ted Leland sent out an email blast to the athletic department and to Pacific boosters. “Athletics fam, men’s basketball coach JayDee Luster needs our help.” Leland related the Luster’s predicament. She invited people to donate. Replies were not long in coming. • “I can help with baby clothes and some furniture.” — Ryan Redondo • “I should be able to contribute at least some kitchen items.” — Mike Dalgety • “I have plates, bowls and mugs, table lamp, kitchen towels and hotpads, wine glasses.” — Holly Trexler • “We would like to help by donating $200 …” — Henry and Alice Hirata • “This is Jon Loo. I have a full sized bed (good clean condition) mattress, box spring and frame.” • I bought clothes, diapers, toys, wipes, towels, bibs, socks for JayDee’s son and some towels and a $250 Walmart gift card for them.” — Christina Perry • “My boys need to get rid of some toys anyways!” — Kristen Dyke And on and on. Someone contacted Basel Karabala, the owner of 209 Furniture, and asked if he could help. With extraordinary generosity, Karbala donated a sofa set, bedroom set and dining room table. “That’s what we’re taught to do,” said Karabala. “Be kind to others. Help those in need.” A Syrian immigrant’s son, Karabala is Muslim. “Now we’re in this time, unfortunately, Muslims, we’re the bad guys," Karabala added. "So what we need to do in this community is show people who we really are.” Pacific folks transported everything, lugged it upstairs and assembled what needed assembling. “There was just a pile of things for us,” Massey marveled. “From people we had never met.” Stefanie Leland, “So I said, ‘This is welcome to Stockton.’ ” Ultimately police found the stolen U-Haul and the car. The truck was cleaned out, the car gutted. But the family had been made whole. “The amount of just positive vibes and good energy from the people we were able to meet has been amazing,” Massey said. Her head is spinning. “We literally went from having everything to having nothing to having everything in 48 hours. Such a roller coaster. I’m just so grateful.” — Contact columnist Michael Fitzgerald at (209) 546-8270 or michaelf@recordnet.com. Follow him at recordnet.com/fitzgeraldblog and on Twitter@Stocktonopolis.

If It’s You, You Need A Plan by Nicole Spector Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement All the furniture, crystal, and china sets our dear old folks have acquired may have suited their needs just fine, but the baby boomers and Gen-Xers who stand to inherit it may find themselves overwhelmed. There's often just so much stuff, and in many cases its value has diminished. Not only can our parents' stuff be hard to let go of when they pass on or move in to an assisted living facility, it can be impossible to sell.

Eisenberg told NBC News the blog post was among the most popular articles the website has ever published. Targeted at baby boomers, the site garners between 1 and 2 million views per month. This post surpassed a million views in just a view days, Eisenberg told NBC News. "This story went viral because so many people can relate to it," said Eisenberg. "Even old high school friends I've not talked to in years are reaching out saying they have the same problem." Even Charities May Say No The problem is that even when our parents — or even we — are attached to our parents' household items, it is rarely feasible for anyone, even a charity, to take it in. "It came as a sad surprise that even the Goodwill and the Salvation Army wouldn't pick up most of the stuff," Eisenberg said of the rooms of brown furniture and the cupboards of antique china. "I think they're saying no because their stores are cluttered and they don't think they will find a market for this stuff." Old Habits, New Ways of Living Marty Stevens-Heebner, founder & CEO of ClearHomeSolutions, notes that advanced seniors tend to have radically different ways of thinking about their possessions than younger generations. "Our older clients belong to what I call 'the Deprivation Generation' because they lived through, or were the children of the Great Depression and World War II," said Stevens-Heebner. "They weren't allowed to waste anything, and so it's stressful for them to let things go." Our elderly relatives may also have some understandable misconceptions about what is valuable and what is not. For instance, back in the day, china sets and crystal meant a lot. They were both high-cost and meaningful to a home. "We don't entertain at home anymore [to the extent we did]," said Stevens-Heebner. As a result, "many china, crystal and silver-plated utensil sets don't find a place." Related: Here's How Much the Average Person Saved for Retirement "Today people can go to Target, Ikea, and even Walmart and outfit an entire apartment," said MaryKay Buysse, executive director of the National Association of Senior Move Managers. And we're gradually living more minimally, with many of us, particularly millennials, not even buying homes let alone furnishing them for the long haul. "People just want to travel lighter now," said Buysse. "Boomers are downsizing and they don't want their mom's stuff — and millennials, who aren't even buying houses and are dealing with student loan debt — don't want their grandma's stuff." To Keep or Not to Keep? Chances are you already know of a thing or two in your parents' home that you will hold on to, but if you have any questions that they can help answer, don't wait. However morbid and sad it is, knowing as much as you can ahead of time will help. And it's okay to start out with the little things — those certainly pile up, too. "Ask your parent(s) if there are any non-family members they would like a piece of jewelry or book to be given to," said Kristin Meekhof, social worker and author. "Friendships are often decades old and they may not have considered giving something meaningful to a friend.

Same thing with jewelry or books or that car that hasn't been driven. Now is the time to find the car title." You may want to explain to your parents, or at least to yourself and siblings, that a lot of the furniture won't be sellable and will have to be tossed if it has no takers. "There's an overabundance of used furniture on the market," said Stevens-Heebner. "Unless it's mid-century modern or a verified and valuable antique piece, sales outlets don't want it. And if there's any evidence of wear and tear, the non-profits will refuse it as well." Try and keep in mind that even if you handle this like a pro, it's going to be hard on everyone involved. And these talks may take time. "Expect to have multiple conversations with your parents as it is highly unlikely that this will be taken care of during one chat," said Meekhof. "Expect tears. Memories will be stirred, and it is bittersweet to plan for a time when they are no longer here." Getting the Whole House? Try Selling It Furnished Many boomers and Gen-Xers find themselves inheriting not only a home's worth of stuff, but the home itself. If you are putting it on the market, keep in mind that you can try selling it furnished. "I recently represented the estate of a baby boomer whose out-of-state Gen-X children ultimately agreed that once they removed those items of personal significance to sell the recently renovated apartment complete," said Roberta Golubock of Sotheby's International Realty. "It was sold fully furnished, with all the china, crystal, every appliance, [including] pots and pans, furnishings, linens and some art and books included. The out-of-state buyer was delighted not to have to set up a new household and the children were relieved of the need to move, sell, or donate the contents."

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Cracker Barrel Old Country Store to build first California store in Victorville Thursday Feb 16, 2017 at 6:08 PM Feb 16, 2017 at 6:08 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz VICTORVILLE — Known for its Southern charm and popular comfort food, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store is finally coming to California. The state’s first Cracker Barrel will be located on a 5-acre lot on the south end of Restaurant Row on Amargosa Road south of Bear Valley Road in Victorville, according to city spokeswoman Sue Jones. City officials announced Thursday that Cracker Barrel submitted plans to build and operate the southern-themed restaurant and gift shop that will encompass 9,550 square feet with 1,284 square feet under a covered porch. “Cracker Barrel will be a wonderful addition to our City’s Restaurant Row, and we are thrilled this major retailer will be building its first California location in Victorville,” Mayor Gloria Garcia said. “This speaks to the strength of our City’s retail market, and we will continue to attract quality dining and retail choices for our community.” Cracker Barrell will join Starbucks, Nekter Juice Bar, Which Wich Superior Sandwiches, Pieology, Ono Hawaiian BBQ, Cafe Rio and The Habit Burger Grill in the 11,350-square-foot, multi-tenant building project currently under construction, just south of BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. The property, which was used annually as a pumpkin and Christmas Tree lot, will be developed by Vantage One Real Estate Investments. Victorville’s Restaurant Row is home to 14 dining establishments and located adjacent to the I-15 and Bear Valley Road. With visibility to more than 98,000 cars traveling the I-15 daily, this dining destination has become a highly profitable investment for retail developers, Jones said. With some 640 stores across the nation, the restaurant's menu includes biscuits and gravy, pancakes, country fried steak and meatloaf. The store feature a country store that sells items such as games, candy, clothing, games and furniture. Each Cracker Barrel is designed with pieces of American artifacts, signage and memorabilia that reflects the nation’s history. Over the last five year, businesses such as the Wal-Mart Supercenter, BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, Panera Bread, Dollar Tree, Staples and Michaels have opened on Amargosa Road. The first Cracker Barrel was opened in 1969 by Dan Evins in Lebanon, Tennessee, to attract highway travelers.

Shawn Coolman/U.S. Marine Corps via AP) By JULIE PACE / The Associated Press Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF WASHINGTON – Vice Admiral Robert Harward has turned down an offer to be President Donald Trump’s new national security adviser, the latest blow to a new administration struggling to find its footing. Harward told The Associated Press that the Trump administration was “very accommodating to my needs, both professionally and personally.” “It’s purely a personal issue,” Harward said Thursday evening. “I’m in a unique position finally after being in the military for 40 years to enjoy some personal time.” Asked whether he had requested to bring in his own staff at the National Security Council, Harward said, “I think that’s for the president to address.” Following Flynn’s ouster, administration officials said his deputy, KT McFarland, was staying on at the NSC. McFarland is a former Fox News analyst. Harward would have replaced retired Gen. Michael Flynn, who resigned at Trump’s request Monday after revelations that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about discussing sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Trump said in a news conference Thursday that he was disappointed by how Flynn had treated Pence, but did not believe Flynn had done anything wrong by having the conversations. Harward, a former Navy SEAL, served as deputy commander of U.S. Central Command under Gen. James Mattis, who is now defense secretary. Harward served on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush and commissioned the National Counter Terrorism Center. Upon retirement in 2013 after a nearly 40-year career in the Navy, Harward became chief executive officer for defense and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin in the United Arab Emirates. Trump has recently been in very public negotiations with Lockheed over the cost of its F-35 fighter jet. Officials said earlier this week that there were two other contenders in the running for the job: acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg and retired Gen. David Petraeus. Petraeus, a retired four-star general, resigned as CIA director in 2012 and pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information relating to documents he had provided to his biographer, with whom he was having an affair. He was also fined $100,000 and remains on probation.
