Patti LaBelle Bringing Cobblers to Walmart August 28, 2016  |   By Toya Sharee 0 Comments Remember last year when people were being filled with the Holy Ghost after tasting Patti LaBelle’s Sweet Potato Pies? Well Ms. LaBelle is giving Walmart five additional reasons for people to get their praise dance on in the aisles. After the success of her pies, People Magazine reports Ms. LaBelle will be bringing 5 new desserts that will be sold exclusively at Walmart: three cobblers (apple, peach, and berry), apple pecan cake, and sweet potato loaf. LaBelle says the desserts are a result of her having a little fun experimenting with traditional family recipes: “I’ve been cooking for most of my life. As you’re standing in the kitchen and you think of certain ingredients, you just put them in — sometimes they work, and sometimes they don’t.” The desserts require almost no prep which will come in handy for folks like me this Thanksgiving who still can’t quite get mom’s mac and cheese quite right. All you have to do is pop them in the oven and “lie and say you made them,” jokes LaBelle. Many credited Youtube star James Wright Chanel in making the pies fly off the shelves over night after his viral endorsement video. After a little shade from Patti’s way in which she denied Chanel’s video had anything to do with her confectionary success, the two became friends and even filmed a cooking special together. Patti revealed that the two have remained close but she doesn’t expect another viral video: “I’m definitely sending him everything to taste but I’m not expecting him to do anything like that again. That was a one time thing only.” The singer/chef is also working on a cookbook she says will include recipes for additional desserts and should be in bookstores before the end of the year. I’ll admit I was skeptical of the hype surrounding those Sweet Potato Pies last year, especially since I didn’t actually find one to taste until months later. But I must admit, I found myself singing Patti’s praises afterwards too. The new desserts are scheduled to hit store shelves August 29th.

The names of some very well-known corporate giants showed up on our screens this week, and much of the insider selling was massive, though nothing for investors to get too concerned about. We cover insider selling every week at 24/7 Wall St., and we like to remind readers that just because an individual or 10% institutional owner is selling stock, that is no cause for immediate alarm. Many top executives, and even directors, are compensated with stock and often sell just to diversify or purchase other assets. Here are companies that reported notable insider selling last week. Wal-Mart Three of the Waltons — Alice, Samuel Robson and Jim — via the family trust have unloaded a huge number of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) shares in the past week. At share prices ranging from $72.36 to $72.73, the more than 4.68 million shares shed brought in more than $339.67 million. These transactions came in the wake of a positive earnings surprise from Wal-Mart that pushed shares to a 52-week high of $75.19. The stock ended Friday’s trading at $71.14 a share, so the sales appear to be well-timed. Facebook The big daddy of social media reported some insider selling again in the past week. The chief counsel and a director at Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) gave up a total of more than 933,000 shares of the stock at prices that ranged from $125.00 to $123.86. Altogether that was worth nearly $116.21 million. Note that Facebook remained a favorite of hedge funds in the second quarter. And the stock closed most recently at $124.96 a share. Juniper Networks A director at Juniper Networks Inc. (NYSE: JNPR) thinned his stake last week. That director sold almost $17 million worth of the stock, or 750,000 shares valued at $23.46 apiece. Afterward, that director still held more than 1.2 million shares. Juniper was one of a handful of undervalued tech companies this summer, and it hit its 52-week low of $21.18 in June and then again in July. Shares closed Friday at $23.28 apiece. PacWest Bancorp A PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ: PACW) director also reduced his stake last week. He sold 610,000 shares of the Beverly Hills-based bank at prices that ranged from $41.89 to $42.33 per share. That netted him about $25.67 million and shrank his stake to less than a million shares. Shares are up 30% in the past six months, and the stock ended Friday’s trading session at $41.84 per share. Home Depot The chief financial officer sold shares of big-box retailer Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) stock this past week. At a share price of $135.10, those more than 97,000 shares sold were worth some $13.21 million. Analysts, like investors, were more pleased with Home Depot’s earnings report than that of rival Lowe’s. Home Depot stock closed on Friday at $134.36, down marginally for the week. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   And Others These companies also reported insider selling last week: BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NYSE: PANW), Pentair PLC (NYSE: PNR) and Viacom Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAB). While some the selling was huge, it resembled nothing other than normal selling. With the markets still trading near all-time highs, investors can expect more of the same, but nothing appears to be out of the ordinary at this juncture.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive VVC board discusses potential problems of Wal-Mart Supercenter project Sunday Aug 28, 2016 at 10:04 AM Aug 28, 2016 at 10:04 AM Charity Lindsey Staff Writer @DP_Charity VICTORVILLE — The proposal to construct a Wal-mart Supercenter near the Spring Valley Lake community has long hung over the heads of Victor Valley College officials, and at the last board meeting a discussion was held on the project’s potential impact on the college. Board member Joseph W. Brady said the project could cause several “serious issues.” “If Wal-Mart wants to build, it’s going to build,” Brady said. “But I think Wal-Mart needs to be incredibly sensitive to the college and the fact that the Yucca Loma Bridge will open sometimes in 2017.” The Victorville City Council first approved the plan for a Wal-Mart Supercenter in 2012. This year, in late June, the Spring Valley Lake Association was successful in thwarting its progress, with the appellate court ruling that Wal-Mart’s environmental impact report failed to discuss several important issues. Since the report was not completed correctly, “it’s back in Wal-Mart’s hands,” VVC Superintendent/President Roger Wagner said. “The college’s concerns were not so much whether the store comes or not,” Wagner said, “but of our ability to mitigate a few concerns we have — one is traffic.” Another potential problem includes water shedding. Wagner said VVC would need to plan ahead to make sure the campus could mitigate water runoff. He mentioned that when the campus was flooded in September 2015, it was shut down for a few days. “We’re not in the position to take in any more water ... we’re at capacity to handle rain,” Wagner said. Brady suggested that a group of county and city leaders, including city engineers and the SVL board, further discuss the issues facing the college and surrounding community. “I’m personally disappointed that back when the issue was originally raised three years ago, that the leadership of VVC did not want to have an open dialogue with Spring Valley Lake,” Brady said. “Now is the time to come up with a universal plan.” Charity Lindsey may be contacted at 760-951-6245 or clindsey@vvdailypress.com.

(WFLA) — Seven people are accused of participating in a massive organized theft ring that spanned 26 counties in Florida, including six here in the Tampa Bay area. The group is also accused of thefts in Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. Investigators say the suspects stole $178,929.25 worth of merchandise from Walmarts during the 135 thefts. Polk County detectives helped uncover the operation. The investigation began in 2014 when the Polk County Sheriff’s Office Organized Retail Crimes Unit received a tip about an organized retail crimes group committing early morning thefts of electronics and merchandise at multiple Wal-Mart stores throughout Polk County. PCSO detectives, worked with detectives with the Tarpon Springs Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies. “These suspects made a living systematically stealing. Retail theft is a serious problem in Polk County and in Florida. This isn’t just shoplifting; this is an organized racketeering business that costs retailers and consumers millions of dollars every year,” said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. “Walmart doesn’t incur that cost. You do as the consumer.” Investigators say the suspects traveled in pairs or small groups. They would commit “push outs” or “box stuffing” focusing mainly on stealing high-end electronics. A “push out” is when a thief conceals items in a purse or bag and leaves the store without paying. “Box stuffing” is when a thief hides high-end items in a box, and pays at the register, with the box containing the concealed merchandise. “They would stuff electronics in boxes of diapers and go through and pay for the box of diapers,” Sheriff Judd said. “They are experienced criminals and they are organized to steal.” From September 11, 2014 to June 22, 2015, the suspects traveled to 26 different counties within the State of Florida: Walton, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Escambia, Leon, Columbia, Suwannee, Duval, Hernando, Citrus, Pinellas, Pasco, Volusia, Alachua, Osceola, Orange, Polk, De Soto, Manatee, Hillsborough, Bay, Brevard, Seminole, St. Lucie, and Charlotte. 25 thefts were documented in Georgia. Seven suspects have been identified. Investigators say more people may have been involved. Jaron Scott, Johnecia Holmes, Samaria Gay, and Marquishia Edwards have all been arrested and are in the Polk County Jail. $2,000 Crimestoppers rewards are being offered for information that leads to the arrest of the following suspects who are at large: Vincenia Tumblin, age 46, who may be in the Tampa area, Ke’Chelle Roberts, age 23, and Arkeem Woods, age 23, who may be in Jacksonville, Florida. The charges filed by the Statewide Prosecutor are: Racketeering, a 1st Degree Felony; Conspiracy to Engage in Racketeering, a 1st Degree Felony; Grand Theft, a 3rd Degree Felony; and Conspiracy to Commit Grand Theft, a 2nd Degree Felony.

Photograph: Chris McGreal for the Guardian Chris McGreal in Williamson, West Virginia Sunday 28 August 2016 06.30 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.36 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Wilbert Hatcher admits he broke the law. In the depths of a decade-long addiction to prescription opioid painkillers, the father of two fed his craving by buying blackmarket pills on the streets of his small West Virginia town. He finally shook the addiction three years ago. But now Hatcher, 50, an assistant manager at Walmart, is at the heart of a groundbreaking legal battle with the medical industry over whether he is a criminal or a victim. “I’m a well-rounded, educated individual who thinks that I don’t have an addictive personality. But when you go to the doctor and they’re pushing the drugs, and they feed and feed the addiction,” he said. “What is it going to take before we as a nation accept that we are the victims for the most part and the doctor, the pharmacist and pharmacies are the perpetrators feeding off the lives of others?” A deadly crisis: mapping the spread of America's drug overdose epidemic Read more Hatcher is among 29 survivors of opioid addiction or relatives of those who overdosed on painkillers who accuse doctors, pharmacies and distributors in a rural corner of West Virginia of pushing the powerful and highly addictive drugs, which have properties similar to those of heroin. The lawsuit alleges that “a veritable rogue’s gallery of pill-pushing doctors and pharmacies” grew rich on the back of patients who sought medical treatment only to have their lives wrecked by addiction. “It was a conspiracy,” said Jim Cagle, the lawyer for Hatcher and other plaintiffs. “Doctors and pharmacies were keeping them hooked. They were feeding the addiction.” Some of the physicians and pharmacists involved have been jailed and stripped of their medical licences while several drug distributors agreed in June to pay West Virginia millions of dollars for flooding the state with opioid pills, contributing to an addiction epidemic and the highest death rate from drug overdoses in the US. The doctor, the pharmacist and pharmacies are the perpetrators feeding off the lives of others Wilbert Hatcher The case is expected to go to trial later this year after the West Virginia supreme court rejected a claim by lawyers for the accused doctors, pharmacists and drug stores that former addicts should not be able to sue because they admit abusing drugs. But lawyers for the accused parties maintain that the fault lies with the addicts. They claim that Hatcher and other plaintiffs are criminals who only became hooked because they illegally abused the drugs – a position backed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who could face a hit to their multibillion dollar market. That argument met with derision from one of West Virginia’s US senators, Joe Manchin, who likened attempts to blame the victims for their addiction to the tactics of cigarette manufacturers. “That’s the same argument that the tobacco industry used. They can’t go down that path,” he said. “It’s an epidemic because we have a business model for it. Follow the money. Look at the amount of pills they shipped into certain parts of our state. It was a business model.” Rapidly escalating doses Hatcher received his first opioid prescription after he fell down steps working at a motel in 2003. The state workers’ compensation fund referred him to a busy pain clinic, the Wellness Center in Williamson, a declining coal town of about 3,000 people. The clinic was run day-to-day by Dr William Ryckman, who formerly worked as a physician at a federal prison. Ryckman said in a deposition that he was hired to work in Williamson in 1997 by a prisoner he befriended, Henry Vinson, who served five years for running a gay prostitution ring in Washington DC. Ryckman described the former prisoner as “setting up the practice” and recruiting doctors. Vinson said he did no more than manage the building. Hatcher’s first consultation was with another early recruit to the clinic – Dr Katherine Hoover. She moved to West Virginia in the midst of a legal battle to keep her medical licence in Florida after she was accused of having asked a 17-year-old patient to have sex with her son. Hatcher said Hoover immediately prescribed him opioids and rapidly increased the dosage. He said he was alert to the dangers because he once counselled drug addicts but he trusted the doctor and assumed he would be safe if he diligently followed the prescription. Yet within six months he was addicted to the opioids. “I had to have that pill every morning to get out of bed, to function. To go without it, the physical pain. Oh gosh. Your hands is jerking. You feel the cramps in your arms and your legs. The anxiety. You’re trying to figure out, what am I going to do here? It’s real bad. I’ll tell you, it’s the worst time of my life,” he said. You’re not going to fight the doctor giving them to you when you’re addicted to them Wilbert Hatcher Hatcher said his head told him he needed to get off the drugs and he hoped the doctor would reduce his prescription. Instead, he found that Hoover barely examined him and then stopped bothering to see him at all – instead leaving prescriptions for him to pick up for cash without a consultation. “When you’re taking them, you’re not going to fight the doctor giving them to you when you’re addicted to them. You’re not going say stop giving them to me,” he said. Like many of those hooked on opioids, Hatcher needed ever-increasing doses to satisfy the addiction. Eventually, he looked to the black market to top up his prescriptions. “You can go out on the streets and get it. I’ve done it. There are people in my life that I would never have associated with. There are people that couldn’t get five minutes of my time because I knew what they were doing. These were drug dealers. But now these people are in my circle because they have the pills I need,” he said. “You knew who had them. This is my town. This is where I grew up. You knew who they were.” How cracking down on America's painkiller capital led to a heroin crisis Read more The drugs took over much of his life. They were costing him large amounts of money but also time with his children because he would spend hours waiting for dealers. His answer was to quit a well-paying but demanding position as assistant manager at Walmart and take a $10-an-hour job in an auto parts store. Hatcher weaned himself off the drugs with the help of counseling in 2013. He got his job back at Walmart but regards those years as a lost decade. “I could have been the store manager by now. But when your mind is not functioning correctly, you’re not thinking clearly, you lose that opportunity,” he said. Lawyers for the doctors, pharmacies and pain clinics named in the legal action claim that Hatcher’s addiction was his own fault. They say he and other addicts abused the drugs by buying some illegally, grinding them up to get a more powerful high or “doctor shopping” in search of several prescriptions at once. “The very core of (their) alleged claims stem from their own criminal, illegal and immoral activity,” the defendants said in court papers. Cagle does not deny that some, but not all, of his clients misused drugs before their opioid addiction. But he said that neither justifies prescribing them opioids for years on end nor the circumstances of other plaintiffs who never touched illegal drugs and only became hooked on painkillers after seeking treatment for work injuries or car accidents. Cagle contends that the doctors and pharmacists knew just how addictive the drugs were but kept on prescribing and dispensing them in large quantities because they were making big profits. Hatcher says the claim he became an addict because he abused drugs is back to front. He and others say they became addicted while following the prescriptions and only once they were hooked did they abuse drugs. “It’s a circle. You go to the doctor and they bill you. The pharmacy, they’re a part of it because they were giving out a whole bunch of pills. It’s business,” he said. “This is spit town. How many pills were they selling? Enough for a major city. This is ridiculous.” ‘No medicine was practiced at her office’ The Wellness Center, later renamed Mountain Medical Care, was shut down after a federal raid in 2010. Federal prosecutors who convicted some doctors and an administrator at the clinic described it as a moneymaking machine, raking in more $4.5m a year as word spread beyond Williamson that opioid prescriptions could be had with ease. In legal papers to seize Hoover’s assets, federal officials said she prescribed more pain medication than any other doctor in West Virginia during the 2000s. Among her other patients was Willis Duncan, who worked as an electrician in coal mines for more than 30 years until he was referred to the clinic after he suffered a crushed sternum and broken ribs in a work accident. “You’d get to the clinic at five o’clock in the morning. They didn’t open till eight o’clock, but at five o’clock there would be a hundred people there waiting,” he said. “You could tell them your dick hurts and they would write you a script. The doctor’s signature was already on it when you went in.” Federal investigators said the doctors frequently did not even see the patients they were writing prescriptions for. Hatcher and Duncan both noticed that after handing over cash they picked up prescriptions signed by a Dr William Ryckman, who had never examined them. Ryckman, one of Vinson’s first hires, lived nearly 300 miles from the clinic in Pennsylvania and was later convicted of sending blank prescriptions to the clinic which assistants filled in with patients’ details. He was jailed for six months and lost his medical licence. The authorities also found a bank account with Ryckman’s name on it and more than $1m in cash deposits but he denied knowledge of it. Another Williamson doctor, Diane Shafer, who Ryckman said in his deposition was married to Vinson, at one time wrote more painkiller prescriptions than some hospitals in West Virginia. “Shafer simply handed out prescriptions in exchange for cash, even pre-signing scripts for patient files,” said the lawsuit against her for allegedly contributing to the death of a patient. “No medicine was practiced at her office.” Shafer was arrested, admitted to illegally prescribing opioids and was sentenced to six months in federal prison. She has been barred from practicing medicine after surrendering her licence. Hatcher, Duncan and the other plaintiffs contend that the doctors were only part of the problem. They allege the pain clinics were working in league with drug stores, which also made large profits from selling the opioids. The lawsuit calls them “among the most grossly negligent pharmacies in America”. One was a small stone building on Williamson’s main street, Tug Valley Pharmacy, which became notorious in the town for the long lines of out of state cars at its drive-through window. Its owner, Randy Ballengee, said in a deposition that he filled up to 200 prescriptions a day from the Wellness Clinic but did not know that it was widely spoken of locally as a “pill mill”. Witnesses testified that drug deals were openly made outside the pharmacy and that prescriptions were refilled early for cash. Hatcher used another pharmacy in the neighbouring town of South Williamson, just across the border in Kentucky. Its owner, Larry Ray Barnett, who has since died, also claimed in a deposition not to know about the pain clinic’s reputation. But federal authorities said both pharmacies made large profits off of opioids. Duncan was earning $2,500 a week working in the mines but estimates he was spending close to a $1,000 on pills. They all worked together. The doctors. The pharmacies. They didn’t give a rat’s fuck Wilbert Hatcher “These people messed a lot of people up. Me being a dumbass hillbilly, I didn’t understand what was going on. I didn’t think that they would hurt you and make you keep wanting and wanting,” he said. “They all worked together. The doctors. The pharmacies. They didn’t give a rat’s fuck. If you paid cash, you get your stuff. There was never no doctor who said we want to cut you on this one, cut you on that. More, more, more, more, more, more, more. Just kept increasing.” Hatcher said he believed doctors and pharmacists got away with it for years because people in the state have been “stereotyped for years as barefoot, toothless and inbred hillbillies to now welfare drug abusers”. He said the exploitation was perpetuated by the stigma around drug addiction. “People that are affected by this treat it just as sexual abuse once was treated, as the public has made it to be something that is shameful and dirty,” he said. ‘Handing out drugs like candy’ By the time the Wellness Center was shut down in 2010, Henry Vinson had been in and out of prison for a second time after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting one of the clinic’s doctors, Armando Acosta, in evading taxes by keeping patients’ payments off the books. Vinson today denies he did anything of the sort but said he pleaded guilty to protect his mother because a “malicious” federal government threatened to indict her too. Vinson’s mother, Joyce Vinson, owned the building with the clinic until she died in 2006 and Henry inherited it. Four years later he agreed to relinquish the $1m property to the government in return for a guarantee that he would not be prosecuted for whatever criminal activities may have taken place at the Wellness Center. Today, Vinson denies having any direct role in setting up or running the clinic. “I have never been in the clinic business. I have never been in that practice. I would think it’s a doctor’s responsibility to see patients and if there’s a patient care issue, I would think that’s between the physician and a patient,” he said. Hoover left the US for the Bahamas. Federal authorities seized her assets and she was stripped of her medical licence over the allegations she pressured a patient to have sex with her son. Hoover has defended the prescriptions as legitimate. A similar pattern played out across West Virginia. By the 2000s, the Sav-Rite pharmacy in Kermit, a town half an hour’s drive north of Williamson with a population of little more than 300, was among the top 25 dispensers of hydrocodone opioid pain medication in the entire country. Federal investigators later accused the pharmacist, James Wooley, of working in concert with the owner of a local medical centre, Debra Justice. The pair allegedly “hatched a get rich(er) quick scheme to open a pain clinic that would refer all of its prescriptions for controlled substances to Sav-Rite Kermit”. Investigators said the clinic and pharmacy were “handing out drugs like candy”. At its peak, Sav-Rite was selling more than 3m dosages of hydrocodone a year, earning $6.5m, in an impoverished town of a few hundred people. Investigators said there was so much cash receptionists had difficulty closing the till. Key to the success of the scheme was to find doctors prepared to cooperate. One of them was Dr Donald Kiser. Among the prescriptions he wrote was one for $500 worth of opioids and valium for William Preece, a former coal miner who had been injured in a work accident. Preece overdosed on the drugs the next day. It came just two weeks after Preece had received an earlier prescription for opioids originally prescribed for an injury as a coal miner after he was caught in a rock fall. Preece’s sister, Debbie, said he fought hard to shake the addiction, including attending a methadone clinic. But he kept returning to the pills and the pain clinic kept giving him prescriptions. “I get emotional about it because I can’t get over it,” she said, her voice breaking. “After he was not able to work in the mines, he opened a little store for a living. Then he ended up losing his home, his store, everything he had due to the addiction ... Wooley’s clinic, the Sav-Rite, was a like a circus. They even handed out popcorn to people waiting in line. You would see licence plates from everywhere. Virginia. Ohio. Tennessee. Kentucky.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Debbie Preece remembers her brother: ‘I get emotional about it because I can’t get over it.’ Photograph: Chris McGreal for the Guardian Kiser was sent to prison for seven years for violations of federal drug laws and lost his medical licence. Prosecutors said the doctor earned $4,000 a day churning out prescriptions and on occasion exchanged drugs for sex. The judge in the case called Kiser a “danger to the community”. In 2012, Wooley pleaded guilty to illegally selling prescription medication and conspiracy, and was sentenced to six months in prison. It is this whole chain of manufacturers, doctors, distributors, wholesalers Francis Hughes, the state’s former chief deputy attorney general The West Virginia authorities say none of this would have been possible if it had not been for distribution companies pouring drugs into the state. The attorney general’s office has sued a dozen firms which between them delivered more than 200m opioid pills to West Virginia in the five years to 2012. The lawsuits alleged that the companies knew large numbers of the drugs were sold by “notorious pill mills” but were more interested in profit. “It is this whole chain of manufacturers, doctors, distributors, wholesalers,” said Francis Hughes, the state’s former chief deputy attorney general who was instrumental in the legal actions. “We were seeing drugstores that were located in a town where the population is 365 running millions of dollars a month through the drugstore selling opiates. You would have to know if you are a distributor that there was something going on and they would not fulfill their duty to report this to the proper authorities. It goes all the way up the chain, people having duties and responsibilities.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pharmaceutical distributor McKesson Corp cut off deliveries to Tug Valley Pharmacy in Williamson earlier this year. Photograph: Chris McGreal for the Guardian This year, six drug wholesalers agreed to a $6.7m settlement with West Virginia over accusations that they flooded the state with millions of prescription opioids. But several others continue to fight the accusation, including the country’s largest pharmaceutical distributor, McKesson Corp, which shipped nearly 100m opioid pills to West Virginia. Its clients included Tug Valley Pharmacy in Williamson. McKesson cut off deliveries to the pharmacy after the state lawsuit was filed against it in January. The distributors say they are being unfairly blamed for the addiction epidemic and that no action has been taken against them by West Virginia’s pharmacy board, which licences drug wholesalers. Senator Manchin is not persuaded. “Look at the amount of pills they shipped into certain parts of our state and the pill mills that sprouted up and everyone trying to hide behind thinking it was legal. It was awful. Absolutely awful,” he said. “I believe it was business driven. It was a business model. Those who have done extremely well on that and been rewarded very highly for that have looked at it as a legal business plan like any other business plan.” More features Topics West Virginia Drugs trade Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US selected politics world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US selected politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video US News › West Virginia Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 27, 2016 at 8:01PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) recently agreed to buy e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion in a pricey attempt to challenge Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Jet.com was founded two years ago, and its site is just over a year old. The company initially sold products at break-even prices for a $50-per-year membership fee, but scrapped the model last October, getting rid of the membership fee in favor of generating revenue from commissions paid by retailers. Jet.com's defining feature is a "Smart Cart" which lowers prices each time you add an item to your cart that resides in the same warehouse as the other items you are purchasing. Eligible items are tagged on the site. This encourage shoppers to purchase items located at a single distribution center, which greatly reduces shipping costs. Users can further lower their bills by paying with debit cards, or opting out of the ability to return their merchandise for free. Jet.com offers free 2- to 5-day shipping on orders over $35 and a $5.99 shipping fee on orders under $35. Wal-Mart claims that Jet.com has been adding about 400,000 new shoppers monthly -- many of them "urban and millennial" customers -- and processes 25,000 orders daily. Jet's mobile app. Image source: Google Play. Jet.com's business model is unique and its growth is impressive, but it probably won't add much to Wal-Mart's top or bottom lines. Re/code's Jason del Rey estimates that Jet will generate "no more than around $500 million in revenue over the next year," and notes that the company isn't profitable. By comparison, Wal-Mart and Amazon are expected to respectively generate $487.6 billion and $136.9 billion in revenues this year. Wal-Mart's online sales totaled $14 billion last year. Wal-Mart plans to keep the Wal-Mart and Jet.com sites and brands separate, but it will likely integrate Jet.com's Smart Cart technology and customer database into its own site and app. Unfortunately, the acquisition of Jet.com still doesn't help Wal-Mart counter Amazon's greatest strength -- Amazon Prime. Why Amazon Prime is so hard to beat Amazon introduced Prime back in 2005 as a subscription-based plan that offered free two-day shipping within the contiguous United States. But now, the $99-per-year service has expanded to include free same-day delivery on select items, special discounts, unlimited streaming of shows and movies from Amazon Video, e-books from the lending library, unlimited cloud storage for photos, and various other perks. Amazon Video. Image source: Amazon. That all-in-one combination of e-commerce and media platforms locked in a lot of customers. Amazon doesn't say how many, but in early July, research firm CIRP estimated that Amazon had 63 million Prime members in the U.S. -- an increase of 19 million from the previous June. At that rate, Amazon's paid service added about four times as many new customers as Jet's free service every month. CIRP also estimated that Prime shoppers spent an average of $1,200 last year, compared to $500 for non-members. Amazon keeps those users tethered to Prime with Dash buttons that let you reorder with a click, appliances that automatically reorder, Fire TV set-top boxes, and its Echo family of smart speakers. The more "frictionless" these orders are -- whether by single button presses, automatically programmed orders, or voice commands -- the more users will depend on Amazon. As a result, Prime members are probably less likely to subscribe to other services promising free shipping for products that they can buy on Amazon. But Wal-Mart isn't giving up It seems incredibly tough for Wal-Mart to cross Amazon's moat, but it doesn't plan to give up anytime soon. The retail giant matches Amazon's non-Prime prices, offers a $49-per-year service for free two-day shipping, heavily promotes in-store and curbside pickups, and is expanding its digital ecosystem with e-books and streaming video from its Vudu service. Its payment app, Walmart Pay, also offers promotions to shoppers and collects data on their shopping habits. By integrating Jet.com's proprietary technology into its website and app, Wal-Mart could win over the same "urban and millennial" shoppers who like to use the Smart Cart feature to save money. But if the feature proves popular enough, there's nothing stopping Amazon from launching a similar feature to encourage shoppers to buy more items from the same fulfillment centers. Moreover, Amazon can probably tap into its AI-powered recommendations engine to offer better suggestions for additional purchases than Jet.com. Will the Jet.com acquisition be worth it? If Jet.com generates $500 million in revenues in the coming year, Wal-Mart will have paid more than six times sales for an unprofitable company. That's incredibly high compared to other e-commerce buyouts. Unilever's (NYSE:UL) recent acquisition of Dollar Shave Club valued the start-up at between four and five times sales, but the company said it could be profitable on an EBITDA basis by the end of the year. The acquisition certainly looks desperate for Wal-Mart. Jet.com might add some useful technologies to Wal-Mart's e-commerce portfolio, but it probably won't turn the tide against Amazon, which seems to have established a nearly impenetrable defense with Prime.    Leo Sun owns shares of AMZN.

Officers were called to the Walmart on Route 23 at 9:30 p.m. after they were alerted to an alleged shoplifter who fled the store, according to a press release. When officers arrived they saw the suspect, later identified as 27-year-old Wayne resident John Sanchez, run into the back parking lot and jump a fence, officials said.  The area behind the fence has a severe drop of 20 to 100 feet near the Tilcon Riverdale Quarry, according to police. Police said they climbed down a wooded area where they found Sanchez unconscious on his back with broken bones. Emergency responders, including a state police helicopter, were called to the scene to help rescue Sanchez. With the help of the borough's fire department, Sanchez was extracted from the quarry area and was transported to St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson by helicopter, police said. Police said his condition was not available Saturday afternoon.  An investigation determined the Sanchez tried to take a cart of merchandise worth $462, police said.

How to join the network One in ten retail sales in the United States –- a projected $373 billion in 2016 -– happens online. Forrester predicts total U.S. online retail will grow to $500 billion by 2020. That number will only continue to increase globally as more businesses take core operations to the web. Retailers grasp the web-focused future of the industry, but the sale of Jet.com to Walmart earlier this month has sped up the shift and validated the online marketplace approach to e-commerce. Moving Storefronts Online and Logistics Next Door is a Winning Model With the sale of Jet.com, traditional retail significantly moves into the business of online storefronts with global reach and locally-sourced logistics. The move by Walmart follows years of trying to compete with Amazon’s e-commerce success fueled by a fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward on-demand quality. More importantly, Walmart buying Jet.com and Macy’s decision to close 100 stores in order to boost online operations this month does confirm that the next generation of retail will be dominated by online sales and direct-to-consumer logistics companies. Global retail sectors once defined by brick-and-mortar, face-to-face customer interactions – selling items from electronics to books to automobiles – now need to consider incorporating the online marketplace model originally created by Amazon to differentiate during the dot com boom. Next generation retailers will move away from storing goods in numerous local retail stores and into regional distribution centers. Consumers will browse those goods online and have them delivered directly to them, increasingly on demand, with easy return policies. This means less inventory, more selection and lower prices being delivered to an increasingly urbanizing America where retail space costs are rising and storefronts start to not make business sense. This model helped Amazon capture close to 60% of the U.S. online sales market growth in 2015. Retailers who successfully subscribe to a version of it will be able to capture some of that online sales market share. Retailers who don’t entertain adopting the model risk fading away completely. (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)   The Point of Sale is Now Anywhere with an Internet Connection Amazon, Jet.com and other leading online-first retailers create and continue to improve purchase-to-delivery models to reduce backend friction. The resulting supply chain efficiency delivers consumer access to goods at consistently lower costs. In order to succeed in this new environment, new, legacy and smaller companies alike will need to move beyond traditional sales to provide convenient, reliable and on-demand online service to customers looking for their next pair of shoes, suit, headphones – even their next car. Consumers with access to the web can search, find and purchase products from anywhere. They can use the internet and their own connected mobile devices to read product information, survey options and complete purchases. And third party review sites like Yelp and testimonials on company websites and consumer message boards enable shoppers to hold retailers accountable better than ever before. In the near future, retailers will need to incorporate consumer freedom into their sales models to meet the customer whenever, wherever to complete an online sale. Retailers Must Invest in Both Technology and Convenience Driving down the costs associated with buying and selling allows these retailers to spend more on technologies that will connect suppliers with buyers and shorten the distance between point of sale and delivery. A technology-powered focus on finding new products and securing logistics will allow online-focused companies to win over today’s device-wielding customers. Retailers should use the web to target consumers who care less about who delivers the goods, and more about their price, quality and convenience. Facebook did not create social networking. Mark Zuckerberg and his team created technology to do it much better. That’s what legacy leader Amazon and relative newcomer Jet.com have done for retail. They have built web-based models that cut costs for buyers and sellers. Models that other retailers can riff off of. Online marketplaces that allow consumers who value quality and convenience above all to search for goods and services they need from the comfort of anywhere. Walmart took note of Jet.com’s prowess and scooped up a leading e-commerce platform that will help define how the company, and retailers in general, do business moving forward.

A federal appeals court is allowing a trade group representing liquor store operators to join a stalled federal lawsuit that the nation's largest retailer filed against the Texas agency that hands out permits to sell booze by the bottle. In trying to crack Texas' restrictions on package liquor licenses, some dating to the end of Prohibition, Wal-Mart contends that some of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission's rules amount to unconstitutional discrimination. Austin-based U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman had set the suit for trial next month, but everything stopped in May when the Texas Package Stores Association, representing about 2,500 existing liquor store retailers, got a green light from an appeals court to move forward with challenging Pitman's refusal to let them intervene on the side of the beverage commission.

Spec's, one of the state's largest liquor store chains, belongs to the Texas Package Stores Association, a trade group that has received court approval to join the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission in a lawsuit Wal-Mart has filed against the agency that dispenses liquor licenses. Wal-Mart wants to begin selling bottled liquor in Texas but contends it is prevented by TABC rules that are unconstitutional. (AP Photo/Michael Graczyk) A panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Pitman's ruling last week and let the association join the lawsuit, saying the trade group had a "protectable interest that may be impaired or injured" in the outcome. Pitman now must set a new trial date. "On behalf of our Texas customers, we are prepared to pursue the case to provide Texans their freedom of choice," Wal-Mart spokeswoman Anne Hatfield said. Booze is popular in Texas: The liquor industry in Texas generated nearly $14 billion in sales in 2014, the latest annual numbers available from the state Comptroller's Office. And Wal-Mart, with its 574 stores, markets and Sam's Club outlets in Texas, says it's the state's largest purveyor of beer and wine. While the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company sells liquor in 31 states, it's resorted to court actions only in Texas to try to get into a state's liquor market. In its February 2015 lawsuit, Wal-Mart touted it "helps people save money and live better by purchasing quality products at competitive prices." But the Texas Package Stores Association contends the retailing giant wants to "upset the level playing field" and "change the structure of the Texas market" that's existed for decades so the company can make "mass sales of low-priced liquor." The store group contends the initial defendant, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, was focused on more general issues regulating the alcoholic beverage industry in the state and not specifically on liquor store dealers who "stand to lose substantial revenues and long-term investments and be placed at a competitive disadvantage." TABC spokesman Chris Porter said he couldn't comment on pending court matters. Bills to loosen liquor license restrictions were introduced in the Texas Legislature in the last session in 2015 but never got out of committee. One such rule that mandates that a publicly traded company — like Wal-Mart — can't hold separate beer and wine and liquor licenses; Hatfield said the rule "is counter to Texas' belief in free enterprise and fair competition." Another idiosyncrasy allows publicly traded hotel corporations to sell both beer and wine and liquor by the bottle, which Wal-Mart said in its lawsuit is "nothing more than naked economic protectionism." A Texas liquor license holder also is limited to no more than five package stores, though an immediate blood relative can acquire other licenses and consolidate those licenses into a single entity that exceeds the five-store limit. The effect of that rule is growth of family-owned chain liquor stores in the state; Wal-Mart complains it has "no blood relative" to take advantage of the provision. The five-store limit and the prohibition on holding both a package store permit and a beer and wine retailer's permit go back to 1935, when the Texas Liquor Control Board was created after Prohibition ended. Lawmakers revised its duties and renamed the panel in 1970, and legislators added the publicly traded company ban in 1995 to blunt the effect of a court ruling that invalidated a provision requiring a license holder to be a resident of Texas for at least a year. One restriction not being contested is a ban on liquor sales at grocery stores. A separate building with its own entrance is permitted under the law, and Wal-Mart says it would accommodate that by dedicating a distinct piece of property at stores to the liquor operation.

The incident occurred at about 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday at the Walmart along the 2000 block of the Fruitville Pike in Manheim Township, according to township police. The teenager was part of group at the Subway sandwich store inside the Walmart. "As the group became disruptive, an employee became suspicious that one of the males was armed, and asked them to leave," police said. The group eventually left the store after threatening the employee, but police said they were able to identify the teen with the gun as a Manheim Township resident. The teenager was eventually spotted walking along the 900 block of Olde Hickory Road at about 8:10 p.m., police said. The handgun, which was loaded, was found in the teen's pants, along with a pair of metal knuckles, police said. It was later discovered that the handgun was reported stolen from a vehicle in the township in July, police said. The teen has been charged with terroristic threats, disorderly conduct, receiving stolen property, carrying a firearms without a license, possession of a firearm by a minor, resisting arrest, and possession of prohibited offensive weapons, police said. He was turned over to the Lancaster County Youth Intervention Center.

The deadline to submit grant requests is 11:59 p.m. CST on Friday, Sept. 2. The funding opportunity — which provides grants to 501(c)(3) organizations ranging from $25,000 to $200,000, depending on the type of program — is open to Illinois nonprofits with efforts that focus on hunger relief, career opportunities, education programs, health care access and other human-service programs designed to meet the needs of undeserved, low-income populations. Over the last fiscal year, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave $44.1 million to hundreds of nonprofit groups throughout Illinois. The company said in a statement that it seeks out organizations and initiatives that have a long-lasting, positive impact on communities nationwide. Phil Newton, founder of Perennial Partners, a Peoria-based consulting firm that caters to nonprofits, as well as small businesses, said private funding amid the state’s budget impasse is not only welcome, but also vital for many of Illinois’ community-focused operations. “When a company of Walmart’s caliber says it’s going to invest some extra dollars, that helps immensely,” Newton said. “To their great credit, they make a lot of small gifts. They’re not just giving to the larger, more well-known charities, but they’re giving to the local organizations…the baseball teams and the Cub Scout troops.” At this point, Newton said the best survival strategy for community organizations is to “get diversified right now. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, don’t rely entirely on the state. Write grants, do a special event, get involved with what’s called ‘planned giving,’ work on corporate solicitation. That way, you can better weather the times when the State of illinois is not paying its bills.” To be considered for grant support, prospective grantee organizations must submit online applications through the Walmart Foundation State Giving Program website, http://giving.walmart.com/foundation. Applicants must have a current 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to meet the program’s minimum eligibility criteria.

Now she's expanding her line to include five new pies: berry cobbler, apple cobbler, peach cobbler, apple pecan cake and sweet potato loaf. NEW YORK — Patti LaBelle is making an encore. Her sweet potato pie was a smash-hit last year for Walmart, her exclusive retailer. Now she’s expanding her line to include five new desserts: berry cobbler, apple cobbler, peach cobbler, apple pecan cake and sweet potato loaf. LaBelle’s sweet potato pie hit stores last August, but it wasn’t a huge success until Youtube star James Wright Chanel sang its praises in a expletive-laced video that went viral. “I want to taste Patti live,” said Wright, breaking into song as soon as he dug in. “You turn into Patti after eating this! Go to Walmart and buy the Patti LaBelle pie.” After that video came out in November, LaBelle’s sweet potato pie sold like hot cakes. “We were selling one per second for a while after his video went live,” said Walmart spokesman John Forrest Ales. “He posted that video and we sold out and had to quickly make more, a million pounds.” And it wasn’t just a Thanksgiving thing. Even after the holidays the pies were still selling, so Walmart has been churning them out year round even though they were originally meant to be a seasonal item. “It’s pretty insane that it’s August and people are still buying the sweet potato pie,” said Ales. LaBelle fans may want to brace themselves for a bit of sticker shock, though. While the sweet potato pie costs $3.98, the cobblers are $6.98, the apple pecan cake costs $9.98. LaBelle was not immediately available for comment.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it A quadcopter drone arrives with a small delivery at Deutsche Post headquarters in Bonn, Germany. (Andreas Rentz/Getty Images) By Editorial Board August 28, 2016 Follow postopinions FOR YEARS, the rules on unmanned aerial vehicles — also known as drones — have been irrational. Recreational drone users — ordinary people who buy quadcopters at Walmart and play around with them in their backyards — have been given broad freedom to pilot their flying devices. This seems to have resulted in increasingly large numbers of close-call incidents reported by commercial airline pilots. Meanwhile, companies have been largely barred from using drones for all sorts of productive uses, from surveying storm damage to taking aerial photos to delivering packages. This bizarre situation will change on Monday. But the government still has a long way to go to enable the tantalizing possibilities unmanned flying machines offer. FAA rules phasing in Monday will allow companies to fly small drones — weighing less than 55 pounds — without a special waiver from the agency. Instead, commercial drone pilots will have to be certified by taking a written test, and those pilots will have to keep their devices below 400 feet and always within sight. These rules avoid several crucial mistakes that could have grounded a young industry; for a time, there was talk that the FAA would require commercial drone pilots to have full airplane pilot’s licenses. This would have been nonsensical: Drone pilots do not need to log hours of flight time in a Cessna, they need to know the rules of the airspace and the characteristics of the craft they actually control. More appropriate drone pilot training programs, which include specially designed flying courses, have already begun popping up. Yet the new rules are still quite restrictive, particularly the requirement that operators keep drones within their line of sight. This makes sense for unsophisticated drones that require pilots’ constant attention. But it also limits companies from putting drones to many valuable uses, unless they get a special waiver. Amazon.com — whose chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Post — wants to use custom-built drones to deliver orders within half an hour. But there are a variety of other, less-heralded possibilities: Drones fitted with hazard-avoidance technology, advanced communications systems and other equipment could also scan electrical wires for damage, conduct search-and-rescue operations, collect news and, no doubt, do dozens of other things no one has thought of yet. As long as commercial drones have to stay within a pilot’s line of sight — and, indeed, have a dedicated pilot — their range and usefulness will be limited. The FAA is not oblivious to these considerations, and even if the agency were more permissive, it would take time for the technology to prove itself to the public. But officials used to decades of regulating big airliners need to do a more nimble job adapting to the revolution in unmanned and, some day soon, automated flight.

The company's cash and equivalents have fallen to $276 million from $1.8 billion one year ago, Sears said Thursday. The company's sales have been falling for years and it has been shutting down stores, selling real estate, and spinning off brands to stem the bleeding. Since 2007, Sears has closed half of its locations — which include Sears and Kmart stores — and eliminated more than 137,000 jobs. Some employees have predicted that the rest of the company's physical stores will close within the next two years. The stores are severely understaffed, with some operating on less than half of the employees they need, according to workers who spoke to Business Insider. Not only are the stores firing people, but they are also cutting labor hours for the workers that remain, according to the employees. In some cases, stores are operating with just one or two cashiers and sometimes no cashiers at all, they said. That's making it increasingly difficult to hire and retain experienced workers, according to a former Kmart employee of 41 years, who said that she was laid off in February. She told Business Insider that her store's employees hadn't seen raises in eight years. She blames the company's CEO, Eddie Lampert, for the company's downfall. "Lampert has taken this company and, with pompous arrogance, has destroyed it," she said. "Customer care is vital to a retail business. Lampert just couldn't understand that." ReutersWorkers also said that the stores are suffering structurally from a lack of investment. An employee who currently works for a Sears in Ohio said that his store is rife with issues, from broken walls and escalators to frequent roof leaks. He said that the merchandise on the floor is often torn open, and no one will buy those items. A former assistant manager of Kmart who left the company in 2012 after 12 years, said that the company really started going downhill after the introduction of Shop Your Way, a loyalty program that Sears introduced in 2009. The program, which allows customers to earn points for purchases, was confusing and poorly executed, killed profits, slowed down customer service, and featured targeted advertising that was completely off base, the former manager said. He said: "Items scanned per minute decreased from 18 to five items per minute because the program was littered with exclusions and confusion. Several items didn't ring as advertised or generate the points as expected. This resulted in long lines and angry customers. Abandoned carts meant utilizing payroll to return those items back to stock." ReutersHe said that he and his family shopped at Walmart instead of Sears or Kmart to avoid the confusion of Shop Your Way. "Imagine trying to keep an eye on two children and trying to understand a confusing SYWR [Shop Your Way] offer," he said. "We opted to avoid the confusion and shop Walmart — where the tag or the sign told us what we would pay. No gimmicks." The 41-year employee of Kmart who spoke to Business Insider had similar complaints about Shop Your Way. She said: "[Eddie Lampert's] ideas of reward cards to transform the company were a waste of time and money. If they didn't have a card, you were supposed to enroll them while you have 10 waiting in that one line to check out. Most people were so disgusted when they finally got to pay, they didn't want to apply. They just wanted to pay and go." In response to the employee complaints, Sears spokesman Howard Riefs said that the company encourages workers to provide feedback. "One of our cultural beliefs as a company is to embrace feedback," Riefs said. "We have a variety of ways that associates can give authentic feedback — even anonymously — and would encourage them to do so." He also directed Business Insider to a Sears blog post published last year in which employees shared why they are proud to work for Sears and Kmart. "I am very proud to be part of SHC [Sears Holding Co.]," said Jen Chamberlain, a Sears sales associate in Victor, New York. "From online and in-store shopping to home and car repair services integrating with Shop Your Way, it is truly a high standard of operation for any company." Scott Ogden, an associate store manager in Miami, Florida, said, "I am proud to be part of the SHC team because we all work together on a daily basis to achieve the same common goals. SHC is comprised of great leaders and team members who strive every day to deliver their best results." In addition to speaking with employees, Business Insider also reviewed a message board that workers said they use to communicate with Sears and Kmart employees at other stores. In dozens of messages over the last several weeks, people claiming to work for Sears and Kmart complained about the stores' deterioration. Several people claimed that the quality of the products that Sears and Kmart sell has declined, and that no one will buy clearance items regardless of how much they mark down the prices. Reuters"Clearance is the standard operating procedure at our store," one person wrote on the message board. "We have at least half of our store on clearance. Too much stuff people don't want... and what they do buy they will usually return as defective. ...Not long until the end, it will come soon." Another person claiming to work in Sears' automotive section wrote: "Lately the majority of tire shipments consist of Patriot and Radar tires. These are simply cheap crappy tires. We have about 12 sets of Michelin tires left and a handful of Goodyear. Even shipments of their signature RoadHandler tires have slowed down. It's embarrassing when I have to face a customer and explain I just don't have much product to offer." One person said that the stores have deteriorated so much that it's like caring for a "dead body." "Our motto now is 'you can only do what you can do,'" the person wrote. "It's sad to watch what we worked for with pride for so many years to be slain in front of us and then we still have to care for the dead body." ReutersSome stores are being inundated by shipments of merchandise several times a week, and they don't have enough employees to move the products from the trucks to the stock rooms, and then to store shelves in a timely manner. "We have been getting shipments of things that we don't need — it seems like they are just trying to empty out of the warehouses," one person wrote. The understaffing appears to be a major issue for many stores. "My store is down to a skeleton staff," one person wrote. Another said that they have a 17-year-old in a managerial position. They wrote: "With new hires only lasting less than a month, experienced employees quitting for better paying and better working conditions we have hardly anyone with any experience to run the store. The worst is that we have a 17-year-old running the office and cash office. He has no experience in either but he is a warm body to fill the job. The end is coming soon, get out while you can."

Seither hat der Amerikaner ganze 150 Kilo abgespeckt – und wurde mit seiner speziellen Diät berühmt. Der Gewichtsverlust gelang ihm mithilfe der inzwischen nach ihm benannten «Walmart»-Diät. Brocco änderte sein Leben, nachdem ihm Ärzte sagten, dass ihn sein Gewicht in Lebensgefahr bringt. «Es ist hart, wenn dir jemand mit 28 sagt, dass du sterben könntest», sagt er gegenüber «ABC». Er sei damals nicht einmal fähig gewesen, einen Push-up zu machen. «Mein Bauch hing bis zu meinen Oberschenkeln. Ich ekelte mich an», sagt der ehemalige Promi-Bodyguard.  My drug of choice was food, and I abuse it for so many year not knowing the harm I was causing! I abused it to the point of bringing myself close to death. We all make mistakes in life I'm just thankful I had the ability to change , learn and grow from mine! Some people may never try to change, some may give up, some may think it's impossible! Well I'm here to say and show you all that it is very possible!! Most will only have to lose half or a quarter of what I had to lose so if I can trust me so can you! If you want it bad enough you stop talking about it and start doing! Never stop no matter what even if you fail, even if you fall off your plan just grab life by the horns and get right back on! We all fail, we all get off of track at some point, but only the ones that really want it will keep fighting! So today find the fight deep inside you, find your motivation, find yourself and become what and who you want! This isn't just for fitness it's for life! It won't happen over night and it won't be easy, but it can be done you must stay consistent, dedicated and know if you believe you will achieve! Limitations are set by the mind and I refuse to let my mind think anything less then greatness for me! I started my journey 3 years ago at 605lbs and over 53% bodyfat today I'm 270 and under 10%! Yes I have loose skin and yes I will get it removed and I'll wear my scars proudly and it will always remind me of all the work I had to do! #transformationtuesday #transformation #bodybuilding #bodytransformation #fitnessmotivation #motivation #weightlossjourney #weightloss #weightlossmotivation #nevergiveup #instafit #fitness #lifestyle #fitfam #nodaysoff #eatcleantraindirty #healthychoices #beastmode #gymrat #workhard #gymmotivation #gymlife #focused #focus #inspire #inspiration #itspossible #teampossible A photo posted by Passquale Brocco (@possiblepat) on Jul 26, 2016 at 4:37pm PDT Dann kam ihm die zündende Idee: Er beschloss, künftig immer zum nächsten Walmart zu laufen und dort einzukaufen, wenn ihn der Hunger packt. Die 1.6 Kilometer zu seiner nächsten Filiale ging er stets zu Fuss – der Anfang sei schwer gewesen. «Monatelang waren meine Füsse geschwollen, meine Knie taten weh. Ich war müde», sagt er. Nach wenigen Monaten legte er für drei Mahlzeiten täglich bereits zehn Kilometer pro Tag zurück. Alleine mit seinen Spaziergängen zum Supermarkt verlor Brocco rund 90 Kilo, das Übrige tat seine Ernährungsumstellung von Fast Food auf gesunde Kost.

The town, whose population is nearly 30,000, last year welcomed a new Walmart off Highway 12. City staff in the past year wrapped up a deal with a local group to run the Harbor Theatre on Main Street and the historic train station opened a one-stop shop in late 2014. Suisun City is also home to the Lawler House Gallery, a Kroc Center operated by The Salvation Army, a history museum and a bevy of live outdoor entertainment in the summer. The city dates back to 1850 when Josiah Wing, a schooner captain, found an island in the Suisun Marsh and built a wharf and warehouse there. It soon became the major agriculture shipping point for the farms and orchards in the Suisun Valley and Green Valley areas. A train depot was built. Suisun City was bustling with several hotels along Main Street. Fairfield was the smaller of the two towns. That changed with World War II, the construction of what’s now Travis Air Force Base and Interstate 80. Suisun City’s growth tapered off. Tough years followed. In the early 1980s, a survey of San Francisco Bay Area communities determined that it was the least attractive place to live in the area. The city got a facelift. Waterfront properties were redeveloped. Apartment complexes were razed in favor of Victorian-style homes. The changes continued with the addition of a senior center, community center and library. Suisun City had a new face. A few years ago, Sactown magazine called it “a hidden getaway.” The Suisun City Community Services Foundation was formed to develop and fund service projects. The organization raises money in a variety of ways, including selling an annual Christmas ornament with Suisun City scenes. The Kroc Center, which recently celebrated its fourth anniversary, is home to community events as well as offering a place for worship and workouts. The city hosts many events, including Christmas on the Waterfront and Fourth of July fireworks. During the summer, there are free movies on Saturday nights and jazz concerts Sunday afternoons. Suisun City has also become a recreation destination. Fishermen launch their boats to explore the Suisun Marsh. Paddle boarders and kayakers can be found on the water. One of its best-kept secrets may be the Suisun Wildlife Center, which is home to a variety of wildlife. Some residents will call it home forever. Others are there with hopes of being released back into their native habitat. The city is divided by Highway 12. The east half is largely residential and commercial. The west half is old town and the waterfront area. The 2015 census estimated Suisun City’s population at 29,492. About 38 percent of its residents are white, 24 percent Latino, 20 percent black and 19 percent Asian. Its median household income is about $71,306.

A federal appeals court is allowing a trade group representing liquor store operators to join a stalled federal lawsuit that the nation’s largest retailer filed against the Texas agency that hands out permits to sell booze by the bottle. In trying to crack Texas’ restrictions on package liquor licenses, some dating to the end of Prohibition, Wal-Mart contends that some of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission’s rules amount to unconstitutional discrimination. Austin-based U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman had set the suit for trial next month, but everything stopped in May when the Texas Package Stores Association, representing about 2,500 existing liquor store retailers, got a green light from an appeals court for their challenge of Pitman’s refusal to let them intervene on the side of the beverage commission. A panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Pitman’s ruling this month and let the association join the lawsuit, saying the trade group had a “protectable interest that may be impaired or injured” by the case’s outcome. Pitman now must set a new trial date. “On behalf of our Texas customers, we are prepared to pursue the case to provide Texans their freedom of choice,” Wal-Mart spokeswoman Anne Hatfield said. The liquor industry in Texas generated nearly $14 billion in sales in 2014, the latest annual numbers available from the state comptroller. And Wal-Mart, with its 574 stores and Sam’s Club outlets in Texas, says it’s the state’s largest purveyor of beer and wine. While the Arkansas-based company sells liquor in 31 states, it has resorted to court actions only in Texas to try to get into a state’s liquor market. In its February 2015 lawsuit, Wal-Mart said it “helps people save money and live better by purchasing quality products at competitive prices.” But the Texas Package Stores Association contends the retailing giant wants to “upset the level playing field” and “change the structure of the Texas market” that’s existed for decades so the company can make “mass sales of low-priced liquor.” The store group contends the initial defendant, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, was focused on more general issues regulating the alcoholic beverage industry in the state and not specifically on liquor store dealers who “stand to lose substantial revenues and long-term investments and be placed at a competitive disadvantage.” TABC spokesman Chris Porter said he couldn’t comment on pending court matters. Bills to loosen liquor license restrictions were introduced in the Legislature in 2015 but never got out of committee. One such rule mandates that a publicly traded company — like Wal-Mart — can’t hold separate beer and wine and liquor licenses; Hatfield said the rule “is counter to Texas’ belief in free enterprise and fair competition.” Another idiosyncrasy allows publicly traded hotel corporations to sell both beer, wine and liquor by the bottle, which Wal-Mart said in its lawsuit is “nothing more than naked economic protectionism.” A Texas liquor license holder also is limited to no more than five package stores, though an immediate blood relative can acquire other licenses and consolidate those licenses into a single entity that exceeds the five-store limit. The effect of that rule is growth of family-owned chain liquor stores in the state. Wal-Mart complains it has “no blood relative” to take advantage of the provision. One restriction not being contested is a ban on liquor sales at grocery stores. A separate building with its own entrance is permitted under the law, and Wal-Mart says it would accommodate that by dedicating to liquor operations a distinct piece of property at its stores.

Food Safety News Breaking news for everyone's consumption Home Foodborne Illness Outbreaks Food Recalls Food Politics Events Subscribe About Us Jobs Directory Listeria prompts recall of fresh-cut vegetables in 9 states By News Desk | August 27, 2016 A Texas company is recalling 30,000 cases of fresh-cut vegetable products from eight retail chains — including Wal-Mart, QuikTrip and Publix — after a random sample tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Country Fresh LLC of Conroe, TX, distributed various combinations of 45 different fresh-cut vegetable products to retailers in nine states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The recalled vegetables have best-by dates between Aug. 7 and Aug. 19, according to the recall notice that was posted Aug. 26 on the Food and Drug Administration’s website. “The company has ceased distribution of the affected product as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Country Fresh continue their investigation as to what caused the problem,” according to the recall notice. “Consumers who have purchased any of these products are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 281-453-3305.” Eight retailers received the fresh-cut vegetables, which are packaged in clear plastic “clamshell” containers and Styrofoam trays overwrapped with clear plastic film. The retailers are: BI-LO; Fresh Point; Harris Teeter Supermarkets; Publix Supermarkets Inc.; QuikTrip; The Spinx Company; Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; and Winn Dixie. No illnesses had been reported in connection with the fresh-cut vegetables as of the posting of the recall notice on the FDA’s website. Listeriosis, the infection caused by the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, can take up to 70 days after exposure before causing symptoms. The company initiated the recall after a sample collected from a retail store by officials with the  Georgia Department of Agriculture tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Dates for the sample collection and lab tests were not provided in the recall notice on the FDA’s website. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled vegetables and develops symptoms of Listeria infection is urged to see a doctor immediately. Listeria monocytogenes is a microscopic organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.

By Jason Pafundi Kennebec Journal Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-621-5663 Share Comment Read Article Samantha Jordan arranges a mathematics display in her classroom last week at Helen Thompson School in West Gardiner. In her first classroom and teaching first grade, Jordan's first day of school is Wednesday. Staff photo by Andy Molloy Checkout lines at stores such as Wal-Mart, Target and Staples have been packed this week with parents holding baskets filled with pencils, paper, notebooks and binders. The annual markdown of these supplies means that school is about to start. “My daughter Leah and I have a really fun time every year shopping for her school supplies,” said Amy Jordan, of Gardiner, who on Tuesday morning was at Staples in Augusta. “Though it’s bittersweet, because as each year passes, she grows up more and more.” Her daughter, 8, is going into third grade. Whitefield Elementary School Principal Josh McNaughton talks about renovation done over summer during an interview on Thursday at the school.

Staff photo by Joe Phelan Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Across the region, districts are putting the finishing touches on summer maintenance projects, filling any remaining open positions and getting schools ready for students’ return this week. Many local schools open for the year on Wednesday, with Augusta students in grades 1-9 returning that day and all other Augusta students returning on Thursday. Superintendent James Anastasio said the city’s schools are “clean and safe and ready to greet the students.” The district did some regular maintenance including paving, painting and fixing up some bathrooms throughout the summer. Superintendent Patricia Hopkins, of School Administrative District 11, which includes Gardiner, West Gardiner, Randolph and Pittston, said her district recently completed a $3.8 million contract with Siemens that resulted in the updating and upgrading of boilers and lighting. The district switched to natural gas and installed solar panels in some spots. Hopkins said the money saved will cover the cost of the project, and the district’s operations will be more efficient. She hopes the efficiencies will allow the district to benefit from additional savings in the future. The district also built a storage unit next to the gymnasium at Gardiner Area High School to help solve equipment problems associated with the music program. The big project for Regional School Unit 2, according to Superintendent William Zima, is the continued negotiations to build a school in Monmouth. Zima said the district hopes to consolidate Monmouth Middle School and Henry L. Cottrell Elementary School into one building over the next several years. There will be public forums, including one Sept. 15, to discuss the ongoing plans. “We’ve also been doing typical maintenance and upgrades to our schools, and we’ve replaced some old fire safety doors in Richmond,” Zima said from his office on the Stevens School campus in Hallowell. RSU 2 includes Hallowell, Farmingdale, Monmouth, Richmond and Dresden. Whitefield Elementary School, a part of RSU 12, had asbestos removed after old, run-down flooring was taken up and replaced with new carpeting. Principal Joshua McNaughton said the crews took every precaution to make sure the asbestos was taken out safely, and he said he hasn’t heard any concern from parents. The school also updated its library to make it more inviting and comfortable for the students. Bookshelves were re-organized and seating areas were expanded. Beanbag chairs and other comforts will be added throughout the year, librarian Marcie Abbott said. All three superintendents said their districts nearly have filled all available positions, but all three expressed the same concerns about struggling to find special education teachers, which they said is a statewide, if not national, problem. “It’s a really, really tough job with a tremendous amount of paperwork, which I think would be mind-numbing,” Zima said. “There will continue to be more kids with special needs, but we have fewer special educators, so what happens?” Hopkins said a new state law requiring special educators to have full certification upon being hired has made it challenging because districts no longer can offer potential hires a conditional certificate. Districts also are finding it hard to recruit teachers in specialized areas including mathematics and science, in part because people with those skill sets aren’t looking at a career in education. “There are better-paying jobs, like in engineering, for someone with those skills,” Hopkins said. “It’s a concern because if we’re struggling now to find qualified professionals, where are we going to be in a few years if the trend continues?” Hopkins’ district did add several new positions through the budget process, including a new social worker at the high school, a second nurse and a new science, technology, engineering and mathematics — or STEM — teacher. The district also has a new pre-kindergarten-through-grade 2 social and behavioral program to help children at that level learn the social skills they need for the classroom. Augusta was able to fill the majority of the district’s open positions, Anastasio said, except for a plumbing teaching position at the Capital Area Technical Center. “But we’re all experiencing the same thing,” he said. “It’s getting more and more difficult to attract people to some specialized areas.” None of the superintendents has a definitive answer to the question of how education can attract new people to the profession, but they all offer multiple reasons why that task is becoming harder and harder. “Demands on teachers are increasing every year, and being a teacher is far more challenging now than it ever used to be, because of all the scrutiny and expectations,” Hopkins said. “It detracts from their ability to really focus on classroom instruction.” Anastasio said teaching isn’t competitive salarywise with other professions, so districts are relying on finding people who are committed to working with students to make a difference. But with all the social changes and problems facing so many of the region’s students, not the least of which is the opiate crisis, teachers and schools are being asked to do more than just teach. “We’re providing a lot more social services to students, and we’re doing things educators didn’t do in the past,” Anastasio said. “It’s part of the role of education, but it makes it more difficult to achieve the primary goal of education, which is to educate, because there are so many outside issues kids are facing.” He said for many students in the Augusta area, school is the most normal and safest place they can be during the day, so students and families are looking to schools for support. “It’s becoming a place for community service,” Anastasio said, “so we’re partnering with outside agencies to help provide those services to our kids.” Enrollment hasn’t increased or decreased, the three superintendents said, but the number of students with special needs has increased. Having to deal with budget cuts should be one of the major requirements listed on any superintendent’s job description. Zima, Anastasio and Hopkins are all impressed by how much their districts can do with such limited and decreasing resources. “It amazes me how our staff and administration is able to take those minimal resources and really stretch them and go above and beyond to meet the needs of our kids,” Hopkins said. Zima agreed, saying, “It’s quite amazing what public schools can do with a dollar.” Anastasio said everyone in the Augusta school district does whatever he or she can to provide the best opportunity for students, which is “where we get the best bang for our buck.” Despite the challenges of increasing social concerns and decreasing budgets, the three superintendents can’t wait for the school year to begin. “When you walk around in the summer, the schools are just buildings; then that changes when the kids are in there,” Zima said. “There’s so much laughter and excitement, and I love that.” Jason Pafundi — 621-5663 [email protected] Twitter: @jasonpafundiKJ Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Why take a job in which you get low pay (for the qualifications),long hours (not just the ones in class), vilified for student failures, required committees and multiple meetings that take away from planning and collaboration and blamed for society’s problems? Public educators are paid with tax money and taxpayers don’t want to pay the price of truly excellent education.

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez) HOUSTON — Wal-Mart’s court fight to sell liquor at its stores in Texas looks to be back on track, but the courtroom is getting crowded. A federal appeals court is allowing a trade group representing liquor store operators to join a stalled federal lawsuit that the nation’s largest retailer filed against the Texas agency that hands out permits to sell booze by the bottle. In trying to crack Texas’ restrictions on package liquor licenses, some dating to the end of Prohibition, Wal-Mart contends that some of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission’s rules amount to unconstitutional discrimination. Austin-based U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman had set the suit for trial next month, but everything stopped in May when the Texas Package Stores Association, representing about 2,500 existing liquor store retailers, got a green light from an appeals court to move forward with challenging Pitman’s refusal to let them intervene on the side of the beverage commission. A panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Pitman’s ruling last week and let the association join the lawsuit, saying the trade group had a “protectable interest that may be impaired or injured” in the outcome. Pitman now must set a new trial date. “On behalf of our Texas customers, we are prepared to pursue the case to provide Texans their freedom of choice,” Wal-Mart spokeswoman Anne Hatfield said. Booze is popular in Texas: The liquor industry in Texas generated nearly $14 billion in sales in 2014, the latest annual numbers available from the state Comptroller’s Office. And Wal-Mart, with its 574 stores, markets and Sam’s Club outlets in Texas, says it’s the state’s largest purveyor of beer and wine. While the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company sells liquor in 31 states, it’s resorted to court actions only in Texas to try to get into a state’s liquor market. In its February 2015 lawsuit, Wal-Mart touted it “helps people save money and live better by purchasing quality products at competitive prices.” But the Texas Package Stores Association contends the retailing giant wants to “upset the level playing field” and “change the structure of the Texas market” that’s existed for decades so the company can make “mass sales of low-priced liquor.” The store group contends the initial defendant, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, was focused on more general issues regulating the alcoholic beverage industry in the state and not specifically on liquor store dealers who “stand to lose substantial revenues and long-term investments and be placed at a competitive disadvantage.” TABC spokesman Chris Porter said he couldn’t comment on pending court matters. Bills to loosen liquor license restrictions were introduced in the Texas Legislature in the last session in 2015 but never got out of committee. One such rule that mandates that a publicly traded company — like Wal-Mart — can’t hold separate beer and wine and liquor licenses; Hatfield said the rule “is counter to Texas’ belief in free enterprise and fair competition.” Another idiosyncrasy allows publicly traded hotel corporations to sell both beer and wine and liquor by the bottle, which Wal-Mart said in its lawsuit is “nothing more than naked economic protectionism.” A Texas liquor license holder also is limited to no more than five package stores, though an immediate blood relative can acquire other licenses and consolidate those licenses into a single entity that exceeds the five-store limit. The effect of that rule is growth of family-owned chain liquor stores in the state; Wal-Mart complains it has “no blood relative” to take advantage of the provision. The five-store limit and the prohibition on holding both a package store permit and a beer and wine retailer’s permit go back to 1935, when the Texas Liquor Control Board was created after Prohibition ended. Lawmakers revised its duties and renamed the panel in 1970, and legislators added the publicly traded company ban in 1995 to blunt the effect of a court ruling that invalidated a provision requiring a license holder to be a resident of Texas for at least a year. One restriction not being contested is a ban on liquor sales at grocery stores. A separate building with its own entrance is permitted under the law, and Wal-Mart says it would accommodate that by dedicating a distinct piece of property at stores to the liquor operation.

(Photo credit: MGN) AA WLOS —  HENDERSON COUNTY, N.C. -- The Henderson County Sherrif's Department asks residents to be on the alert for yet another phone scam. Recently scammers have targeted Henderson County residents by calling and telling them their children or grandchildren have been arrested and are in jail. The victims are told the only way they can bond their loved ones out is to buy a Walmart or ITunes card. Several Henderson County residents have fallen for this scam and lost thousands of dollars. The caller informs the victim they can’t use a check or credit card and must give them the code off the back of the purchased card. The twist to this current scam is the caller has represented themselves to be a member of the local district attorney’s office in the county where the child or grandchild is in jail. Bonding people out of jail with a gift cards is, obviously, not standard procedure. The reason the scammers insist on getting a Walmart or ITunes card is they have complete control over the value of the funds once the victim turns over the code. The scammer can either use the code or they can sell it. Once the scammer redeems or uses the code that was given, the victim cannot get their money back. Sheriff Charles McDonald urges anyone who might be contacted by these scammers to slow down, check out the facts, and not make a hasty decision to send money just because you are told a loved one has been arrested. Scammers want you to make quick decisions and can pressure you into doing something you will regret once you know the truth, McDonald said in a press release. If you feel you have been a victim of this or a similar scam, please contact the Henderson County Sheriff's Office at 828-697-4912. close News In Pictures Possible snow totals increasing; western N.C. could see 4-6 inches, icy roads Winter Storm Warning issued for WNC, Upstate Federal investigation underway in Weaverville Gallery: January 6, 2017 Snow Trending 1   Possible snow totals increasing; western N.C. could see 4-6 inches, icy roads 2   Federal investigation underway in Weaverville 3   Why we buy milk, bread and toilet paper when it snows 4   Homeland Security investigation in Weaverville continues with few answers 5   Winter Storm Warning issued for WNC, Upstate DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WLOS Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO LOADING ShareTweet × Trending 1 Possible snow totals increasing; western N.C. could see 4-6 inches, icy roads 2 Federal investigation underway in Weaverville 3 Why we buy milk, bread and toilet paper when it snows 4 Homeland Security investigation in Weaverville continues with few answers 5 Winter Storm Warning issued for WNC, Upstate 6 Second round of snow expected Friday evening 7 Trooper saves the life of a small child: 'I said, Lord, I need your help' 8 Suspect traveled with gun in checked bag before killing 5 at Fort Lauderdale airport 9 Crews already working to make sure roads are safe for travel during the storm 10 Raid on Marion home leads to five suspects, drugs and guns

All warehouse clubs have similar offers, but one clearly gives its cardholders the most perks. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Aug 27, 2016 at 10:23AM Image Source: Getty. Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club, and privately held BJ's Wholesale all operate essentially the same business. That gives consumers lots of choice. Sometimes geography provides the answer, and others it's a favorite product stocked by one of the the three, but not the others. In many cases, however, the decision to join Costco, Sam's, or BJ's comes down to which company offers the best rewards credit card. All three have cards that reward loyalty, but the perks vary between the chains. Knowing which warehouse club makes the most sense for you involves examining what each of the three credit card programs has to offer, then balancing it against your actual uses. Getting 4% off on gas, for example, may not be much of a perk if you don't drive, and free travel insurance or rental car benefits means less to people who travel infrequently. All three programs are generous, but different, with the "best" not necessarily being the same for everyone. What is Costco offering? Costco's card has been in the news recently because of the company's switch from its longtime provider American Express to the new Costco Anywhere Visa, serviced by Citigroup. That transition had its share of bumps, but now that the card has been moved over, cardholders receive some enhanced perks. Costco Anywhere does not come with an annual fee, but to get one you need to pay the warehouse club's $55 annual membership. Once you qualify for the card (all three of these cards, of course, require credit checks), it then serves as your membership ID. The new card's benefits include 4% cash back on gas purchases for the first $7,000 spent in a year. Costco Anywhere also offers 3% back on eligible travel spending and 2% cash back on all Costco purchases, with 1% returned on anything bought elsewhere. Aside from the gas benefit, none of the others has a cap. The new Visa card also offers worldwide car rental insurance along with worldwide travel accident insurance. In addition, it includes damage and theft protection. What is Sam's Club offering? Sam's has a cheaper membership price than both its rivals. The Wal-Mart company charges $45 a year compared to $55 at Costco and $50 at BJ's. Sam's Club members can also get nearly the whole membership fee back if they spend $100 on the day they open a Sam's Savings MasterCard account because the company will credit any customer who meets that initial spending threshold with $40. Members also get 5% back on gas -- on spending up to $6,000 a year (then it drops to 1% with no limit) -- 3% back on dining and travel, and 1% back on all other purchases. Cardholders also receive price protection on some purchases, as well as identity theft resolution services. Like Costco's card, Sam's does not have an annual fee and it doubles as your membership ID. A maximum of $5,000 in cash-back rewards can be earned in a calendar year. All three warehouse clubs have slightly different rewards offers. Image source: Wal-Mart. What is BJ's offering? The My BJ's Perks MasterCard offers 3% cash back on in-store and online purchases from the warehouse club. It also has a slightly different take on the gas reward, giving consumers $0.10 off per gallon with no limits. How that compares to 4%-5% off on gas varies based on the price of fuel, but with current prices hovering around $2 in much of the country, it's comparable. In general, given that current prices are near historic lows, it's fair to say BJ's offers a worse gas deal than its rivals unless your gas spending is more than Sam's $6,000 ceiling for its 5% giveback or Costco's $7,000 cap on its 4% reward. The BJ's credit card also offers 1% cash back on all other purchases made on the card and a $10 discount when it comes time for cardholders to renew their membership to the warehouse club. Like the rival cards, the My Perks MasterCard has no annual fee and serves as your membership card. Which is the best deal? These are all very similar overall deals. In fact these offers are so similar that, for consumers, it likely comes down to other factors beyond the card perks -- such as which warehouse club has a location closest to your home, or which one offers a product mix that's more to your liking. These are all good deals for frequent shoppers at the three chains, and the gas benefits can add up to a significant perk if you drive enough and can manage to fill up at your warehouse club of choice regularly.

A federal appeals court is allowing a trade group representing liquor store operators to join a stalled federal lawsuit that the nation’s largest retailer filed against the Texas agency that hands out permits to sell booze by the bottle. In trying to crack Texas’ restrictions on package liquor licenses, some dating to the end of Prohibition, Wal-Mart contends that some of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission’s rules amount to unconstitutional discrimination. Austin-based U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman had set the suit for trial next month, but everything stopped in May when the Texas Package Stores Association, representing about 2,500 existing liquor store retailers, got a green light from an appeals court to move forward with challenging Pitman’s refusal to let them intervene on the side of the beverage commission.

A panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Pitman’s ruling last week and let the association join the lawsuit, saying the trade group had a “protectable interest that may be impaired or injured” in the outcome. Pitman now must set a new trial date. Advertisement “On behalf of our Texas customers, we are prepared to pursue the case to provide Texans their freedom of choice,” Wal-Mart spokeswoman Anne Hatfield said. Booze is popular in Texas: The liquor industry in Texas generated nearly $14 billion in sales in 2014, the latest annual numbers available from the state Comptroller’s Office. And Wal-Mart, with its 574 stores, markets and Sam’s Club outlets in Texas, says it’s the state’s largest purveyor of beer and wine. While the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company sells liquor in 31 states, it’s resorted to court actions only in Texas to try to get into a state’s liquor market. In its February 2015 lawsuit, Wal-Mart touted it “helps people save money and live better by purchasing quality products at competitive prices.” But the Texas Package Stores Association contends the retailing giant wants to “upset the level playing field” and “change the structure of the Texas market” that’s existed for decades so the company can make “mass sales of low-priced liquor.” The store group contends the initial defendant, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, was focused on more general issues regulating the alcoholic beverage industry in the state and not specifically on liquor store dealers who “stand to lose substantial revenues and long-term investments and be placed at a competitive disadvantage.” TABC spokesman Chris Porter said he couldn’t comment on pending court matters. Bills to loosen liquor license restrictions were introduced in the Texas Legislature in the last session in 2015 but never got out of committee. One such rule that mandates that a publicly traded company — like Wal-Mart — can’t hold separate beer and wine and liquor licenses; Hatfield said the rule “is counter to Texas’ belief in free enterprise and fair competition.” Another idiosyncrasy allows publicly traded hotel corporations to sell both beer and wine and liquor by the bottle, which Wal-Mart said in its lawsuit is “nothing more than naked economic protectionism.” A Texas liquor license holder also is limited to no more than five package stores, though an immediate blood relative can acquire other licenses and consolidate those licenses into a single entity that exceeds the five-store limit. The effect of that rule is growth of family-owned chain liquor stores in the state; Wal-Mart complains it has “no blood relative” to take advantage of the provision. The five-store limit and the prohibition on holding both a package store permit and a beer and wine retailer’s permit go back to 1935, when the Texas Liquor Control Board was created after Prohibition ended. Lawmakers revised its duties and renamed the panel in 1970, and legislators added the publicly traded company ban in 1995 to blunt the effect of a court ruling that invalidated a provision requiring a license holder to be a resident of Texas for at least a year. One restriction not being contested is a ban on liquor sales at grocery stores. A separate building with its own entrance is permitted under the law, and Wal-Mart says it would accommodate that by dedicating a distinct piece of property at stores to the liquor operation.

(KRQE) – So many people were affected by the news of Victoria Martens’ death, but one woman jumped into action, planning the birthday party Victoria was looking forward to celebrating the day of her murder. Complete strangers stepped in to set up a special celebration of Victoria’s life. They gathered this weekend to work on Sunday’s party. RELATED STORY: Mom, 2 others charged in gruesome killing of New Mexico girl Erica Smith and a group of helpers headed straight for the toy aisle at Walmart Saturday afternoon. She and a group of moms loaded up shopping carts with dozens of stuffed animals. “I think Victoria would have liked that one, she liked purple,” Smith told a little girl as she picked out a stuffed animal. (Courtesy: KRQE) Smith and others are planning a special birthday bash, the one 10-year-old Victoria Martens didn’t get to have. “I think that’s why it hit me so hard is because I am a mom,” Smith explained. Even though she has no relation to Victoria, when Smith heard on the news that a child was brutally murdered the day after her birthday, she stepped up. “Initially, the thought was just to share it with my 158 Facebook friends,” Smith smiled. “I think over the last two days that number has tripled.” Since the post, thousands of people have responded to the Facebook invite for Princess Victoria’s Heavenly Birthday. One man donated $200 specifically to purchase stuffed animals for Victoria’s classmates. “To make sure that just every child at Petroglyph Elementary who knew and loved Victoria has something to comfort them every night,” said Smith. Also helping plan the party are families who suffered their own tragedies, grandmothers whose grandchildren were murdered. “I wish that it didn’t take a child getting murdered for the community to come together,” said Tracey Sylvia, whose granddaughter was murdered nearly four years ago. The group has vowed it won’t stop here. Smith said she feels a calling to continue helping people. “When the dust settles and this is all over, I feel like I want to be involved,” Smith said. “I want to be an advocate for children.” Passing shoppers were touched by the shopping excursion and shared tears and hugs with the moms. When it was time to check out, even the cashier choked up. “I think it’s just a true testament to the community here,” said Smith. Businesses, individuals, state representatives, and Albuquerque Mayor Richard J. Berry are also helping with the birthday festivities. Smith said the whole experience has been a touching response to her small idea. “A lot of times the bad folks outshine us, but us good folks, we are winning today,” Smith said Saturday. A church in Peralta is also bringing a horse to Victoria’s birthday party Sunday. Everyone is encouraged to wear purple, Victoria’s favorite color.

Frank Ocean earns his first No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart with the arrival of Blonde. The set, which was released on Aug. 20, bows atop the list with 276,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending Aug. 25, according to Nielsen Music. Blonde logs the third-largest debut of 2016, behind only the arrivals of Drake's Views and Beyonce's Lemonade. The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption, which includes traditional album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). The new Sept. 10-dated chart (where Blonde bows at No. 1) will be posted in full to Billboard's websites on Tuesday, Aug. 30. Of Blonde's start of 276,000 units, 232,000 were in traditional album sales, while the rest were SEA (44,000 units). Only two albums started bigger than Blonde in 2016: Drake's Views (1.04 million units earned in its debut frame) and Beyonce's Lemonade (653,000). Blonde also logs the third-biggest sales start -- behind, again, just Views (852,000 copies sold in its first week) and Lemonade (485,000). Blonde was available exclusively to stream via the Apple Music service and for sale through the iTunes Store (but only as a full album -- none of its tracks were sold a la carte). The songs on the Blonde album generated 65.4 million streams during the week. It was the second-most streamed album on the chart, behind only Drake's Views, with 67.5 million streams. Blonde arrived two days after Ocean released the long-form video Endless (which many have referred to as a visual album). It is available exclusive to stream via Apple Music. Both releases are Ocean's first full-length offerings since his debut album, Channel Orange, which came out in 2012. The set debuted and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and sold 131,000 copies in its first week. It was released on July 10, 2012, initially exclusively through iTunes, and a week before its advertised street date of July 17. The bulk of Channel Orange's first-week sales were digital, though there were some on physical CD, as brick-and-mortar retailers began selling the title mid-week following iTunes' exclusive launch. Blonde is the third independently distributed No. 1 album in 2016. It follows Blink-182's California and The Lumineers' Cleopatra. California was released on Blink-182's own Viking Wizard Eyes LLC, licensed to BMG and distributed by Alternative Distribution Alliance (ADA). Cleopatra was released on Dualtone Records, which is also distributed by ADA. Blonde is different from both albums in that it was released by Ocean himself directly to Apple and iTunes -- bypassing a traditional distribution company. The last set to reach No. 1 in the same manner was Garth Brooks' 2013 box set, Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences. The hefty box (six CDs and two DVDs) was issued through Brooks' Pearl Records and sold exclusively through Walmart stores. It debuted at No. 2 with 164,000 sold, and rose to No. 1 the following week -- for one frame -- selling 146,000. Before Brooks, Pearl Jam's Backspacer also hit No. 1 (in 2009) without a traditional distributor. The set, which bowed with 189,000 sold, was released on the band's Monkeywrench label, and initially sold exclusively through Target, iTunes, Pearl Jam's website and independent retailers. Slightly less than two years earlier, Eagles flew in at No. 1 with its self-released Long Road Out of Eden, exclusively sold through Walmart. It debuted with 711,000 copies sold on the Nov. 17, 2007-dated chart. Back on the new Billboard 200 chart, Drake's Views holds at No. 2 with 77,000 units (up 9 percent) and the Suicide Squad soundtrack falls from No. 1 to No. 3 with 76,000 units (down 18 percent). Tory Lanez arrives at No. 4 with his debut studio album, I Told You, earning 52,000 units (32,000 in pure album sales). The album follows a pair of top 10-charting singles for Lanez on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where he has reached No. 10 with "Say It" and No. 9 (so far) with the still-building "Luv." Both cuts are available on the new album, which also starts at No. 2 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Lindsey Stirling claims her second top 10 album, as her new Brave Enough launches at No. 5 with 49,000 units (45,000 in traditional album sales). It follows the violinist's 2014 effort, Shatter Me, which debuted and peaked at No. 2 with 56,000 copies sold in its first week. The new effort also leads the Classical Albums, Classical Crossover Albums and Top Dance/Electronic Albums charts -- her third No. 1 on all three lists. The classical-meets-EDM artist previously led all three charts with Shatter Me and her self-titled debut. Twenty One Pilots' Blurryface dips 5-6 on the Billboard 200 (33,000 units; down 19 percent), Adele's 25 rises one rung to No. 7 (28,000 units; down 1 percent), Rihanna's Anti climbs 9-8 (just over 27,000 units; down 2 percent) and DJ Khaled's Major Key slips 6-9 (27,000 units; down 19 percent). The original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton closes out the top 10, as it ascends 11-10 with 23,000 units (down 3 percent).

That adds up to about 30,000 cases of affected product delivered to nine states and eight retailers, including Walmart, Publix, and Winn Dixie stores. The vegetables had been packaged either in clear plastic containers or Styrofoam trays wrapped with plastic wrap. They’re stamped with best by dates ranging from August 7 to August 19.

Picture: Ian Rutherford SCOTT REID 00:00 Monday 29 August 2016 2 Have your say Social Investment Scotland (SIS), the lender to the third sector, has delivered another year of investment growth and financial progress, aided by its partnership with one of Britain’s biggest supermarket chains. End-of-year figures published this week will show that SIS invested more than £4.3 million in more than 50 organisations throughout Scotland. The figure includes £1.8m from SIS Community Finance in 24 projects, some £900,000 from the Social Growth Fund across three projects and a further £1.6m from other third-party funds managed by SIS. What is classed as “total unrestricted income”, including lending operations, management fees, transfers and grants, amounted to just over £1.3m, up 13 per cent from the previous year. The increase was underpinned by the loan book growth and additional management fees generated from an extended partnership with Asda, the grocery giant owned by US-based Walmart. This tie-up has seen the expansion of Asda Community Capital, a fund set up by SIS to utilise the charitable funds raised from the single use carrier bag levy. Using 100 per cent of proceeds, compared to just 50 per cent in the prior year, these funds support a small loans programme and the running of Asda’s dedicated “supplier development academy”, which provides opportunities for social enterprises, based in Scotland and Wales, to reach the supermarket shelves. SIS chairman Nick Kuenssberg said: “Social Investment Scotland has delivered another year of significant development in financial, social impact, and corporate governance terms, firmly establishing itself as Scotland’s, and one of the UK’s, leading responsible finance providers. “Our success has been such that we have outgrown the five-year strategy outlined 2013 and launched a new, more ambitious strategy to be delivered by 2020. “Based on a year of major achievements, continually growing investments and financial success, SIS can look forward with confidence to the implementation of this new strategy. “At its heart is an ambition to extend the remit of SIS to include hybrid models of social enterprise incorporating both financial and social objectives, stimulating the creation and growth of social enterprise and working with and supporting young social entrepreneurs.” Alastair Davis, chief executive of SIS, added: “Despite another year of economic volatility, we have seen both a sustained demand for social investment and a growth in supply of investment capital from a range of sources.” Highlights for the lender during 2015/2016 included the launch of and full investment of SIS Community Capital – the first social interest tax relief fund in UK – and further development of the Social Growth Fund in partnership with Big Society Capital and the Scottish Government.

Will these fly off of shelves like her sweet potato pie? Published August 28th Patti LaBelle has more delicious goodies coming your way. After her sweet potato pie flew off the shelves at Walmart last year, the singer-turned-baker and the superstore has announced that she will be expanding her exclusive line to include five new desserts, including berry cobbler, apple cobbler, peach cobbler, apple pecan cake, and a sweet potato loaf.  The success of LaBelle's pies is due in no small part to viral sensation James Wright Chanel, who literally sang its praises after tasting the original sweet potato pie for the first time. "We were selling one per second for a while after his video went live," said Walmart spokesman John Forrest Ales. "He posted that video and we had to quickly make more, a million pounds." The prices will range from $3.98 for the original sweet potato pie and $9.98 for the apple pecan cake.  As Walmart said in a statement, "It's a sweet time to work in Walmart’s fresh bakery." Hopefully Wright will be available to "review" these new concoctions as effectively as he did the last one.   Written by Evelyn Diaz (Photo: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for NYCWFF) COMMENTS Get More!

(AP) By Michael Reagan Sunday, 28 Aug 2016 10:40 AM More Posts by Michael Reagan Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Readers of this column know that I am a strong supporter of requiring school children to be vaccinated before allowing them to attend school. It’s my belief that if parents feel so strongly about the so–called dangers of vaccinations that they won’t protect their children from disease, then they should also be committed enough to either home-school the kids or send them to a private school that doesn’t have a problem rolling the dice with measles or other communicable diseases. Up until recently the strange alliance of Walmart shoppers and Harvard faculty that was so opposed to vaccination — a common practice only a couple of decades ago — appeared to be winning. More parents were opting out and government schools didn’t seem to care much one way or the other. I’m assuming the teachers had their shots. Parents could claim personal or religious reasons for not having their child immunized. Then kids started getting sick. The California legislature took a break from trying to confiscate constitutionally guaranteed firearms and finally addressed a real problem. It passed a law that required vaccinations regardless of personal beliefs or what the latest TV guru claimed. It took effect on July 1 and now the state faces its first real test. KPIX5 reports in Oakland alone “hundreds” of school children were sent home the first day of school because they could not prove they have been vaccinated. If kindergartners and incoming seventh graders can’t prove they’ve had their shots, then they have to hit the road. And this is the point where we will learn how serious the state and school systems are about enforcing the new law. Children sent home mean complaints to principals, school boards and politicians. Empty–headed reporters will write heart–tugging stories about little Rasputin being denied his chance to invent the iPhone because heartless bureaucrats won’t let him in school. Even worse, a group of sanctimonious “activists” called “Disease 4 All” — whoops, my mistake. The name is “Education 4 All.” This group is one of the activist gangs that wants to elevate the misguided personal preferences of the very few into the accepted procedure for the many. The group has just filed a federal lawsuit that claims requiring vaccinations for school kids deprives them of the right to learn. Here’s hoping the judge throws the case out of court — I know, common sense on the federal bench in California is a long shot — and the legislators and school officials stand firm. Vaccination vacillation is a fad that needs to die out just as much as the measles needs to die out. Michael Reagan, the eldest son of President Reagan, is a Newsmax TV analyst.

News UK Home News The toilet sign that is raising awareness of 'hidden disabilities' Mental illnesses, developmental disorders, and conditions such as Crohn's disease, chronic fatigue syndrome and IBS can all be 'hidden disabilities' Charlotte England @charlottengland Sunday 28 August 2016 15:30 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The NHS trust staff claimed they saved £40,000 iStock Asda is to put up signs in 421 UK stores raising awareness of 'hidden disabilites'. The signs, placed on accessible toilet doors, will urge customers to remember not all disabilities are visible. They are intended to make people with conditions like Crohn's disease, autism, anxiety, and inflammatory bowel disease feel they can use disabled facilities without facing criticism from other shoppers. "We want to make sure all our customers feel comfortable using our facilities – including those with disabilities that aren’t always obvious," a spokesperson for the supermarket said.  Read more Vogue Brasil's digitally altered images sent the wrong message about disability DWP call handler says staff have 'no time to care' about disability claimants Benefits rule change forces 500 disabled people to give back vehicles every week The supermarket, which is a subsidiary of American retail giant Walmart, announced signs will be placed in the majority of its 525 stores after charities praised a single sign placed in a store in Newark, East Midlands.   A photograph of the original sign was shared on Facebook by Crohn’s and Colitis UK in early August and has been liked over 10,000 times. The reminder to the public was inspired by the experience of artist Tonya Glennester and her five-year-old daughter Evalynn, an Asda spokesperson said.  Ms Glennester assisted Evalynn, who has ADHD and autism, in using the disabled toilet in store, but was questioned on leaving the cubicle by another customer who said they 'didn't look disabled'. “Evalynn can be affected by the noise of the hand dryer as well as queues and crowds of people,” said Ms Glennester, who is a member of a local autism support group. “It can cause a sensory reaction causing her to become upset or have aggressive outbursts, so the accessible toilet gives us a little more space and privacy. “When we walked out there were two customers waiting, one in a wheelchair, and they disagreed that I should be using the toilet. I also suffer from health issues that can cause pain, chronic fatigue, bowel pain and balance problems meaning I often have to use the hand rails. We were both really upset and left the store but I decided to speak to the manager because I know there are so many stories like ours.” The original sign in a Newark store (Facebook) After the sign was shared online, other people with disabilities that aren't always visible said they had had similar experiences. A spokesperson for Crohn's and Colitis UK said, "For many people with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), the sudden and uncontrollable need to use a toilet is a genuine and recognised symptom of their condition. Whilst they may not look ill on the outside they are affected from debilitating symptoms that affect all aspects of their lives. “Many members of the charity feel that they are judged for using accessible toilets because others perceive them to be well and not entitled to use the facilities. The experience or fear of faecal incontinence is, as you can imagine, very undermining to a person’s confidence and self-esteem." They added the charity hopes more businesses will follow suit and help the public to be aware of ‘invisible’ diseases. The group is running a campaign to have other supermarkets put up the same signs on their accessible toilet doors. Supporters have so far sent over 11,000 emails urging bosses at Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsburys, and Waitrose to follow Asda's example. 7 ways the Tories have ‘helped’ disabled people 7 show all 7 ways the Tories have ‘helped’ disabled people 1/7 Closing Remploy factories The Work and Pensions Secretary called time on Britain’s system of Remploy factories, which provided subsidised and sheltered employment to disabled people. People employed at the factories protested against their closure and said they provided gainful work. “Is it a kindness to stick people in some factory where they are not doing any work at all? Just making cups of coffee?” Mr Duncan Smith said at the time, defending the decision. “I promise you this is better.” The Remploy organisation was privatised and sold to American workfare provider Maximus, with the majority of the organisation’s factories closed. The future of the remaining sites is unclear 2/7 Scrapping the Independent Living Fund The £320m Independent Living Fund was established in 1988 to give financial support to people with disabilities. It was scrapped on July 1 2015, with 18,000 often severely disabled people losing out by an average of £300 a week. The money was generally used to help pay for carers so people could live in communities rather than institutions. Councils will get a boost in funding to compensate but it will not cover the whole cost of the fund. This new cash also doesn’t have to be spent on the disabled 3/7 Cut payments for the disabled Access To Work scheme Iain Duncan Smith is bringing forward a policy that will reduce payments to some disabled people from a scheme designed to help them into work. The £108m scheme, which helps 35,540 people, will be capped on a per-used basis, potentially hitting those with the more serious disabilities who currently receive the most help. The single biggest users of the fund are people who have difficulty seeing and hearing. The cut will come in from October 2015. The charity Disability UK says the scheme actually makes the Government money because the people who gain access to work tend pay tax that more than covers its cost. The DWP does not describe the reduction as a “cut” and says it will be able to spread the money more thinly and cover more people 4/7 Cut Employment and Support Allowance The latest Budget included a £30 a week cut in disability benefits for some new claimants of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The Government says it is equalising the rate of disability benefits with Jobseekers Allowance because giving disabled people more help is a “perverse incentive”. The people affected by this cut are those assessed as having a limited capability for work but as being capable of some “work-related activity”. A group of prominent Catholics wrote to Mr Duncan Smith to say there was “no justification” for this cut. Mental health charity Mind, said the cut was “insulting and misguided” 5/7 Risk homelessness with a sharp increase disability benefit sanctions Official figures in the first quarter of 2014 found a huge increase in sanctions against people reliant on ESA sickness benefit. The 15,955 sanctions were handed out in that period compared to 3,574 in the same period the year before, 2013 – a 4.5 times increase. The homelessness charity Crisis warned at the time that the sharp rise in temporary benefit cuts was “cruel and can leave people utterly destitute – without money even for food and at severe risk of homelessness”. “It is difficult to see how they are meant to help people prepare for work,” Matt Downie, director of policy at the charity added 6/7 Sending sick people to work because of broken fitness to work tests In 2012 a government advisor appointed to review the Government’s Work Capability Assessment said the tests causing suffering by sending sick people back to work inappropriately. “There are certainly areas where it's still not working and I am sorry there are people going through a system which I think still needs improvement,” Professor Malcolm Harrington concluded. The tests are said to have improved since then, but as recently as this summer they are still coming in for criticism. In June the British Psychological Society said there was “now significant body of evidence that the WCA is failing to assess people’s fitness for work accurately and appropriately”. It called for a full overhaul of the way the tests are carried out. The WCA appeals system has also been fraught with controversy with a very high rate of overturns and delays lasting months and blamed for hardship 7/7 The bedroom tax The Government’s benefit cut for people who it says are “under-occupying” their homes disproportionately affects disabled people. Statistics released last year show that around two-thirds of those affected by the under-occupancy penalty, widely known as the ‘bedroom tax’, are disabled. There have been a number of high profile cases of disabled people being moved out of specially adapted homes by the policy. In one case publicised by the Sunday People last week, a 48 year old man with cerebral palsy was forced to bathe in a paddling pool after the tax moved him out of his home with a walk-in shower. The Government says it has provided councils with a discretionary fund to help reduce the policy’s impact on disabled people, but cases continue to arise Sue Bott, the deputy CEO of Disability Rights UK, also praised the move.  “We support Asda putting signs on the doors of accessible toilets stating that not all disabilities are visible,” she said. “It will help to take the stigma away from those who may need to use such toilets for reasons other than having a mobility impairment and which are not obvious for example people who have bowel and bladder problems.”     More about: Asda Supermarkets Disability Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

According to Detective Sgt. Cortice Miles with Bessemer police, the case is now being investigated as a homicide.  The incident happened yesterday in the Bessemer Wal-Mart parking lot. Witnesses said Tammy Lynn Huddleston, 49, was in a physical dispute with her daughter, Ashia Christine Huddleston. The 29-year-old stabbed her mother multiple times near the abdomen. Police said the daughter fled the scene with her boyfriend in a blue Nissan Versa after the stabbing. Tammy Huddleston, of Concord, died overnight at UAB Hospital. The suspect was last seen yesterday on AL Hwy 216 between Bessemer and Tuscaloosa County. The boyfriend is cooperating with police. Ashia Huddleston might be using the last name of Fletcher, Miles said. If you have any information on Huddleston/Fletcher's whereabouts, call Bessemer police at (205) 425-2411 or the tip line at (205) 428-3541.    Most Read Active Discussions About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

(WIAT) — Update: According to the Bessemer Police Department, Ashia Christine Huddleston was apprehended by the police department and the United States Marshal’s Fugitive Task Force. Detectives ascertained a murder warrant for her arrest Monday morning with a bond of $250,000. She is awaiting transfer to the Jefferson County Jail. Original: Bessemer Police say Tammy Lynn Huddleston, 49 of Concord, is dead after being stabbed several times by her daughter.

But unfortunately, it's not a good time to score a deal on the iPhone 7, an iPad, or a large appliance. By Benjamin Glaser, Dealnews.com August 28, 2016 Save for later Saved Shoppers walk around to explore a mall in west London. Lefteris Pitarakis/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of September is an exciting month for bargain hunters. Not only does it bring us one step closer to the holiday season — which is the best time of year for many big-ticket items — but this month is also a great time to stock up on a variety of items, thanks to a small overlap in Labor Day, summer clearance, and back-to-school sales. So while the end of summer may be upon us, the best deals of the year are only now just beginning. Check out our guide below for tips on the best things to buy in September. For more deals every single day of the month, consider signing up for the DealNews Select Newsletter to get the best deals of the day delivered to your inbox. 9 Things to Buy Now Labor Day Sales on Summer Apparel Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer. That means all summer-related goods will be at or near their lowest prices of the year, as stores try to clear out summer inventories ahead of the holidays. Expect to see sales from major retailers like Gap, Banana Republic, and Forever 21 offering 50% to 70% off. Last year Amazon discounted a wide range of men's, women's, and children's apparel; though it was a modest 20% off, that might be worth it for Prime members. Recommended: Can you manage your money? A personal finance quiz. Outdoorsy goods were also popular last year. We saw strong discounts from stores like REI, L.L. Bean, Eddie Bauer, and Nautica, and expect the same this year. Also be on the lookout for an influx of deals on designer clothes. Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, and Calvin Klein (at 6pm) all saw discounts of up to 80% off last year. Test your knowledge Can you manage your money? A personal finance quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 01/04 Grills September offers the best deals on grills and BBQ-related utensils. Although grills are generally associated with the summer, the less humid autumn weather may actually provide a more ideal climate for your backyard soirees, so rest assured that any investment you make this month can still be put to use in the coming weeks. Sears was the grill king last year, supplying over a third of the grill deals we saw in September. That included a broad 25% off sale with stackable coupons. Walmart also had several good discounts. Patio Furniture Similar to grills, patio furniture sees some of its lowest prices of the year at the end of outdoor season. We recommended patio furniture purchases last month, too, with August providing six times as many Editors' Choice deals as June and July. And September has twice the percentage of Editors' Choice patio furniture deals as August! Look to Target and Sears for discounts of around 40% off. Freebies on National Coffee Day Coffee is one of the most beloved morning beverages, so it's no surprise that it has its own holiday. September 29 is National Coffee Day and to celebrate, food chains across the country will offer free or discounted cups of joe to their customers. Last year, we saw freebies (no purchase required) from Dunkin' Donuts, Krispy Kreme, Flying J, Pilot, and LaMar's. One notable exception: Starbucks did not offer a freebie; instead the chain chose to kick off a charity initiative on Coffee Day last year. 32" TVs, or Big-Screens September is traditionally a stellar month for deals on 32" 1080p HDTVs. Not only will deals be abundant for this category, but they'll be at the lowest prices of the year. Last year, they hit an astounding $110, though $150 is a more realistic bet. These small screens are perfect for a dorm room or first apartment. Outside of 32" TVs, the other end of the size spectrum is hot for deals in September. During Labor Day weekend in 2015, a full quarter of the TV deals we listed that were 55" or larger were at an Editors' Choice price. Otherwise, if you can't find a low price on the set you want, we recommend waiting until November for TV purchases. Mattresses Mattress deals are generally at their best during the months of April and May, when retailers add stackable coupons to their already-existing sales. However, Labor Day has become a mattress event itself. US-Mattress, Sam's Club, and Sears in particular had noteworthy sales taking 50% off select mattresses with an extra 10% to 40% off via a stackable coupon. That's on par with the best mattress deals we see in April and May. Laptops If you're in the market for a new laptop, make your purchase early in the month to take advantage of lingering back-to-school sales. Last year, 75% of the Editors' Choice laptop deals we saw were in September. Look for deals on 15" laptops with current-generation Intel Skylake processors from Cowboom, Dell Home, Newegg, Lenovo, and more. For Apple users, we recommend bypassing the Apple Store's back-to-school sale, which this year (like last year) offers a free pair of Beats Solo2 On-Ear headphones to qualifying students. Instead, look for Mac deals at Best Buy, eBay, and Micro Center. There you'll find the 2015 MacBook Air 11" Laptop for around $700, and the 13" for around $750 — a better value than a full-price laptop with headphones. Textbooks Many students will head to college for the first time this September, and while it may be too late to apply for new scholarships, there are still many ways you can reduce your college expenses. For instance, these days students can find cheap college textbooks online, by either comparison shopping or using social media to trade/borrow books from other students in their college. The earlier you begin your search, the greater your chances of scoring a deal. Previous-Generation iPhones September wouldn't be the same without Apple's fall keynote, where we're expecting the debut of the iPhone 7. Look for sales that discount the previous-generation iPhone — since that's where you'll find the deepest price cuts — rather than the just-released model. For instance, on the day of the keynote, Apple will shave $100 off the subsidized cost of an iPhone 6s. But it won't stop there. In the weeks that follow, you can expect retailers (such as eBay, Walmart, and Best Buy) to offer iPhone 6s deals with prices around $50 (with a 2-year contract). For unlocked models, you'll find the best deals on eBay where prices for an unlocked iPhone 6 could hit $500 (it's been around $610 all summer). Remember, you can always sell your old iPhone to help offset the cost of a new unlocked model. 3 Things to Wait to But Newly Announced iPhones While September will be a great month to buy an iPhone 6s, it's not the best time to score a deal on the soon-to-be-announced iPhone 7. We don't expect to see deals on that model until November. And even then, we'll likely only see modest discounts that take $10 off the full price of the phone, or discounts that bundle a free $50 Apple Gift Card with the purchase of an unlocked iPhone 7 at full price. iPads For those waiting for a new iPad, you might have to wait longer. Fans have expected an iPad Air 3 for over a year, but the introduction of the 10" iPad Pro last spring could suggest an entirely different direction for this product line; there might be no iPad Air 3 at all as Apple shifts focus to the Pro line. If there is an iPad Air 3 coming, it certainly doesn't seem like it will arrive this fall. That means your best bet for now for iPad deals is still Black Friday. Walmart is definitely a leader in deals on the Apple Tablet, as well as usual suspects like eBay and Micro Center. Appliances Labor Day tends to offer excellent deals on large appliances, with sales that take up to 54% off items such as dishwashers and refrigerators. However, if you can wait until November, Black Friday will offer better sales, with discounts that take up to 75% off the same items. On average, about 35% of Black Friday appliance deals are marked Editors' Choice — only 15% of deals see that distinction throughout the rest of the year.

From a single PET resin and sheet production plant in Salalah in 2006, the company has grown to a four plant operation in Oman, KSA and USA, with a workforce of more than 600 people, producing one million tons of PET resin, DPET, APET and RPET sheet and printed PET packages per year. This has cemented the company's international reputation as an export powerhouse of high quality, technologically advanced and environmentally friendly packaging materials with the lowest carbon footprint in 75 countries. "This celebration marks a 10 year journey of bringing innovation, environmental sustainability and cutting-edge packaging solutions from Oman to the world," said OCTAL CEO, Nicholas Barakat. "OCTAL was conceived from the idea that the sustained growth of clear rigid packaging requires a strategic investment in capacity, proprietary technology and innovation. Our knowledge-based approach has enabled us to become the unanimous choice for reliable, clear rigid packaging with a wide range of applications for foods, liquids, consumer and industrial products." Over the last decade, OCTAL has risen to become a global technology leader developing new applications for PET including injection-molding, high temperature as well as frozen applications and positioning it as the supplier of choice. This technology is critical to increasing the penetration of PET into high volume applications. The company's unique PET resin and patented DPET™ sheet have gained critical acclaim for their superior mechanical and optical properties, while delivering the lowest carbon footprint compared to other PET sheet and the polymers for which DPET substitutes. To date, OCTAL's unrivalled customer portfolio includes some of the largest brands in the region and the world such as Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Almarai, Nestlé and Lulu among many others, which represent a wide array of product end-uses. William J. Barenberg, Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President at OCTAL, echoes those sentiments, "OCTAL's story of market success is about changing the equation for delivering value downstream, employing disruptive technologies that redefine PET's capabilities, expanding the universe of applications for which it is the preferred packaging polymer. We only enter markets and businesses where we have a competitive advantage to ensure success driven by technology and product performance. As a result, OCTAL's DPET has led the way in the wholesale conversion of entire product categories from other polymers to PET. With our ongoing product innovations, we will continue this trend, targeting large scale conversion opportunities with new performance features." Barenberg added, "We have utilized innovation in material science to create a clear competitive advantage, setting the standard in PET packaging with high quality products that deliver yield and cost reduction benefits, increased productivity for thermoformers, and unmatched environmental advantages. This has translated to higher volumes, enhanced margins and expanded market applications by large multinational brands. We will continue to develop solutions for a world that demands greater performance from its packaging, earning profits for our partners who transform it and improving life for consumers who use it." OCTAL has significantly contributed to the Sultanate's economic diversification and is one of its major non-oil exporters. The company also prides itself on training and developing many promising Omani professionals, with a number of staff posted to OCTAL's other facilities around the world to gain international exposure. Barakat added, "What we have achieved so far is only the beginning of our legacy as there are vast opportunities and tremendous potential that can be harnessed from PET. Our investment in the downstream factories in the USA for Recycling and KSA for Printed Packaging Material enable OCTAL to capture the entire value chain. Our ambitions are limitless and with the continued support of our employees, partners, customers and wider stakeholders, we are confident that we will make our shared vision a tangible reality."

Surveys suggest that "checking in on the pets" is a core reason for purchase and use of web-connected home- security cameras. Most video snoopsters also have a built-in speaker, so app-linked viewers can remotely coo words of comfort or bellow, "Get off the couch!" Even better, I've found, are specialty video cameras that also distribute treats, such as the Furbo Pet Cam, the Petzi TreatCam, and the Feed and Go Smart Pet Feeder. Furbo ($119 at www.furbo.co) has the sleekest design and an easily popped-off lid for dropping in refills of your dog or cat's favorite yummies. Furbo's Barking Alerts feature pushes a message to your smartphone when your high-strung pal is complaining, encouraging a quick response in your most calming voice. The Petzi ($151.37 at Walmart.com) has the Pavlovian response mechanism down pat. Remotely wake up Petzi through your phone or tablet app and a yellow light glows next to its lens, telling whomever, "You're on Candid Camera." Other app-taps remotely cue Petzi's pleasant musical-jingle alert, capture, and then send your voiced communications and - most important - pump out a handful of dog or cat treats (better crunchy than soft, no longer than one inch). Petzi's secure holding tank won't spill stuff if your smart guy knocks the box over. As with Furbo, remote video views of the darlings can be snapped, shared, and compared on social media - in color when there's strong room light, otherwise captured in black and white. The Feed and Go ($249 at Amazon.com) sits apart by serving full meals, with six rotating compartments that each hold up to 8 ounces of dry or (if you dare) wet food. An SMS or email message is pushed when the feeding starts. And you'll get a warning if there's a system failure. Coming soon, the Gosh easyFeed will increase the options with portioned food and water refilling, too. It will even reorder pet food from Amazon automatically when sensing the storage bin is running on empty. Due in November, it's now a $155 early-bird special on Kickstarter. No pictures, just treats. Too far removed or lacking the gear to connect remotely with your pooch? CleverPet serves as a surrogate babysitter, engaging your pal with paw-at-the-blinking-lights games that reward pattern recognition with treats. Get a demo and make an order ($299) at www.clever.pet. Exercise this. WonderWoof is a cute, connected Bluetooth bow tie that attaches to your dog's collar, then reports (to an app) if your pal is doing enough running, sleeping, playing, and walking. $95 at www.wonderwoof.com. For dogs that like to play "fetch" longer than you do, there's PetSafe's Playtime Anytime Automatic Ball Launcher. A tennis ball shoots out, adjusted to fly between eight and 30 feet away. Poochie hustles after the ball, doubles back, drops it into the device's top hole, and then . . . boom! . . . the ball launches again. A rest feature guarantees a cool-down every 15 minutes. A Launcher costs $149.95 at www.petsafe.net, where you'll also find the Train 'n Praise Potty Training System, $110 and up. High-rise animals' best friend, this thing dispenses a treat every time your pet uses its indoor/outdoor pee pad with fake (washable) grass, a large holding tank, and optional liners. The real fake scoop. Clean yards, parks, and sidewalks are happy places for pooches and people. Which may explain why several "responsible" news-gathering organizations recently bought whole hog into Pooper, a fake art school project touted as "the Uber for animal cleanup." Promoted with a satirical commercial (viewable at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC14Ohz5h4Q) that should have been the scam's giveaway, the poop dream envisions customers taking and sending a location-fixing photo to "connect you with people to scoop up your dog's poop." So you can get on with more important business - say, ordering food delivery to the dog park from UberEats? In fact, Philly does have several "dog waste removal services" that will come by and clean the yard once or twice a week, as scheduled. Among them: Delco Scoopers; Poop Scoop; We Scoop Dog Poop; and All Dogs Poop. The latter, serving South Jersey, also offers a Pet Taxi service that will escort your fur baby to the groomer, day care, or a routine vet visit. For real! Plush accommodations. Spend half your day cleaning animal fur off the furniture? EnchantedHomePet.com offers an amazingly diverse and pretty line of pet sofas/beds that both lure your critters and blend with your home decor. Sized for either small pups or big bruisers, these snooze spots feature washable plush or pleather upholstery and storage for toys and bones, priced from $89.99 to $599.99. Also available online from Amazon, Wayfair, Target, Kohl's, Bed Bath and Beyond, dog.com, and petco.com. EnchantedHomePet's Pet Therapeutics brand resting mats are prominent on the same websites. Placed atop a grownup sofa, a TheraWarm Sofa Bolster and Furniture Protector ($59.99) captures and radiates a pet's natural body heat. Conversely, the TheraCool Gel Cell Cooling Pad ($82.99) absorbs and dissipates excess body heat. Both have memory foam, which help ease joint and arthritic pain, it's claimed. takiffj@phillynews.com 215-854-5960 @JTakiff Published: August 28, 2016 — 3:01 AM EDT The Philadelphia Inquirer Continue Reading More in business Comcast › Comcast faces backlash over black-ministry channel the Word Business › SugarHouse and Parx casinos tops in 2016 slots revenue growth Business › FAA imposes 'ground stop' on flights to Fort Lauderdale Comcast reloads Fox's Yes network, putting Yankees back on Xfinity Joel Naroff on Dec.

Talent Engine recently put out its virtual shingle with the launch of a brand new website. The new site outlines the process and system whereby the consultancy claims to be a single source of competitive intelligence and sourcing data. Talent Engine best serves organizations of all sizes looking for accurate candidate sourcing and hiring data. Talent Engine was built on the processes and methodologies that have won Mendoza, the Managing Director, awards from some of the industry's most visible media companies. "My Futurecasting methodology and the work I've done at Informatica, Wal-mart, Cisco, Blizzard and more have all created a library of sourcing knowledge that have scaled the work for the average talent acquisition department," said Mendoza. "We're not only impacting the big companies who have had access to great sourcing resources for some time, we're creating real change for small to mid-sized companies, those that make up most of the workforce." The Talent Engine team offers a proprietary platform that works with their clients' recruiters to build a "single source of truth" for talent acquisition data within their company. This allows talent acquisition leaders to control how their talent acquisition team works best and with different external resources. With that off their plate, company recruiters can spend their day on important parts of the hiring process requiring personal touch and attention like calling candidates, closing offers and training new hires. "Dave consistently delivers on what he sets out to do. His Talent Engine team (a very appropriate name) drives results," said Matt McDonald of SAP. "They consistently deliver high volume and high quality data. The amount of detail they are able to capture in such a short period of time goes above and beyond expectations and really helps drive projects to fruition." With accolades from some of the largest names in the global talent acquisitions space, Mendoza's Talent Engine is poised to bring sophisticated sourcing to the SMB market. With the help of media partner, Red Branch Media, the company launched a new website to do just that. "We completely understood Dave's vision for the site from day one. It's an engine that drives talent acquisition within your company," said Maren Hogan, CEO of Red Branch Media. "I've known Dave for years and worked with him on many projects in the past. This is one I am very excited about." Talent Engine is taking select clients through Spring 2017. Connect with Talent Engine to start your candidate sourcing process today.

European banks are acquiring mobile-savvy fintech start-ups rather than building their own. Given the long history of start-ups that have sold themselves for eye-watering valuations before crashing down to earth (case in point: Yahoo's $1 billion purchase of Tumblr ) you might be forgiven for getting twitchy about where this all might be headed. Especially given the banks' record of value-destroying takeovers. Remember RBS's record takeover of ABN Amro months before the financial crisis of 2008? Almost ten years and billions in losses later, shareholders are pushing for any surplus cash to be returned to them -- not reinvested. But fintech is a long way from having its own exuberant and ultimately painful Tumblr moment. The balance of power is still in the buyer's favour - even if valuations turn out to be optimistic. Here's why: None of the mobile banks being acquired have really gained traction with consumers in the way that start-ups have in other industries. When Yahoo! bought Tumblr, the blogging site had 300 million views per month, while online retailer Jet.com - recently bought by Wal-Mart for $3 billion - has 3.6 million customers. Contrast that with mobile bank Fidor, acquired by French bank BPCE. It has 120,000 account holders. When BBVA bought Simple for $117 million in 2014 the US app had about 100,000 customers. The technology might be there, but the pressure to pay a premium for a competitor that could just eliminate your customer base isn't. That could change if newly-minted banks like Mondo, Atom or Number26 were to hit upon the right strategy or product. In Europe, Fidor is probably the closest to reaching that point after it reached a deal to provide payment services for mobile network Telefonica, which has 43 million customers in Germany. But vacuuming up deposits remains expensive and lending requires capital. With established rivals benefiting from expansive branch networks, vast customer data and a regulatory head-start, it's harder for a new entrant to gain traction in micro-banking than micro-blogging. Frequently, they've had to partner up with incumbent lenders rather than compete directly against them. That doesn't mean that recent purchases of mobile banks are wrong-headed -- quite the opposite. The Fidor deal will allow French lender BPCE to expand its digital operation and bring in experts that it could assign to other ideas and products. Fidor's technology itself can help internally but also be licensed to others. There's growth there. Modest outlay And, for the banks, the outlay so far looks modest. At best, European bank shares trade on about five times revenue. Applying that multiple to Fidor produces a valuation of about 130 million euros, based on its net interest income of 26 million euros in 2015. Set against BPCE's net income of 1.7 billion euros in the first half of 2016, it's a small bet. There's also the likelihood that start-ups are going to get even cheaper. The IPO market is still lacklustre (something my colleague Shira Ovide has noted) and some of the inflated hopes for publicly-traded fintech companies have been punctured. Shares of peer-to-peer darling LendingClub have tumbled since their IPO after the company revealed flaws in its internal controls. Venture-capital funding for fintech fell by 50 percent in the second quarter to $2.5 billion, according to CBInsights.

The foyer is seen in the Tudor revival Windsor Manor, built in 1921. The house was on Historic Augusta's "Endangered Properties" list when it was purchased. The owner is turning it into a venue for weddings. Ian Shiverick painted the floor pattern in this room in south Augusta's Windsor Manor. Another view of the living room of the Windsor Manor house in south Augusta off Windsor Spring Road in Augusta. The living room of the Windsor Manor house in south Augusta off Windsor Spring Road in Augusta. The manor's owner, Ian Shiverick, said friends warned him against purchasing it, telling him that "you can't live in south Augusta." A flowered arch and soon-to-be finished pergola will be used for outdoor weddings at the Windsor Manor house in south Augusta. In this photo from the lat 1940's, the Windsor Manor house stands in the background as a woman swims with some children. The pool still exists but is surrounded by dense vegetation and needs repairs.   Transforming a long-neglected 1921 Tudor revival mansion in south Augusta into a wedding venue might seem an unlikely task in an unlikely place for former programmer and school teacher Ian Shiverick, but the Idaho native said it suits him nicely. After flipping six Atlanta houses in eight years, doing nearly all the work himself, Shiverick, 44, said Windsor Manor, also known as “Cole­ridge” and nestled in 13 wooded acres off Windsor Spring Road, might be his final stop. “I like Augusta. I like my friends here. I have a lot more fun here socially. I’m not trying to flip the house,” he said. It’s the parties he’s thrown so far – seasonal affairs with games such as croquet and badminton that evoke the home’s origins in the Great Gat­s­by era – that motivate Shi­ver­ick to spend all day working on the house and grounds. “When my friends come out, they’re like, ‘Oh, the bathroom,’” he said. “That’s why I’m so motivated – it’s trying to impress the next party. I guess I’m a people pleaser, and that’s what drives me to do it.” The location – seconds from the Windsor Spring-Tobacco Road area on the rebound with a new Wal-Mart, Hardee’s and several other retailers appearing since he did – defies the south Augusta stereotype he hears so much about. After discovering the property on Historic Augusta’s “Endangered Properties” list, Shiverick said friends warned him against making the purchase. “People said, ‘Do not buy that house – you can’t live in south Augusta – it’s terrible,’” he said. Laughing, Shiverick said he asked when they’d last visited and it was as children, if at all. “I don’t know what the fuss is, why everybody has such a bad, negative opinion of south Augusta,” he said. “Everyone says it’s bad, but they’ve never been here. It’s eight miles from downtown and they’ve never been here.” The area – or its image – seems so retail-deprived to many residents that there’s a push by Augusta Commission members and legislators to create an authority to spur development. Mayor Hardie Davis and commissioners recently toured the area in search of and to promote economic growth. Shiverick said making Windsor Manor a public, self-sustaining business will help transform the area’s image and protect his investment. “I think if people came here for a wedding, they would see this is just a normal place – that you’re not going to get shot by a gang member coming to south Augusta,” he said. Having lived in the San Francisco Bay area, overseas and Atlanta, Shiverick doesn’t share the attitude that bigger and faster are better. “People think all these magical things are going on in other cities that aren’t,” he said, “and that any place is better than Augusta. It’s not true, especially if you’re a homebody like me.” Shiverick has transformed his “oasis in the middle of all this development” almost entirely by hand, repairing walls, floors and windows and checking YouTube videos when he’s not sure how to do something. Admittedly, he’s good with his hands. “My mom is a violin maker. I’m from a family of do-it-yourselfers,” Shiverick said. The challenge of preserving some of the home’s vintage details sometimes makes him wish to go back in time. There’s not a roofing company around willing to help with the home’s concrete shingle roof; all want to replace it or charge a huge fee, he said. “Why would I tear off an awesome historic roof that will last 100 years?” Shiverick said. “I almost wish I could go back then, because of the things that are so difficult now for me to get done or do.” Shiverick said he used $80,000 in profits from the last house he flipped to buy Windsor Manor from the Walter Golosky family. The family, which owned a downtown camera shop in 1946, bought the home from Chicago businessman A.T. Cole, who built it as a winter retreat. Shiverick said he’s since purchased an adjoining pool house property for $37,000 and has spent $100,000 on materials so far. From the parties to the upcoming opening of the site as a wedding venue – he was recently permitted, with conditions, by the Augusta Commission and is building a pergola on the lawn for ceremonies – Shiverick said he’s creating new, happy memories at the site. “I feel like when I came out here, it was just the saddest. You know, how houses have a vibe? It felt like a desert, barren, hot and sad. Now it feels like a home again,” he said.

EpiPen is the leading way to treat anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can stop breathing. The patented device makes it easy to inject yourself with the drug epinephrine in an emergency – easy enough that kids can do it, too. But while a dose of the decades-old drug costs just pennies to make, the self-injectable pen is expensive: GoodRx shows that the cost of a two-pack of EpiPen or EpiPen Jr starts at around $600. Parents of children who need the lifesaving drugs have to buy several injectors for home and school, and those costs add up. Tracy Bush of Pfafftown, N.C., whose 14-year-old son relies on EpiPen for severe food allergies, says that even with health insurance, the family budget takes a hit. “We have to factor in EpiPen costs with other school expenses, including supplies and clothing, making our budget extra tight,” she says. Here’s more information and options about emergency epinephrine auto-injectors. Consider Adrenaclick The good news is that there are cheaper options. We found a generic version of the Adrenaclick pen for $142 at Walmart and Sam’s Club, using a coupon from GoodRx. If you pay with insurance, you might also be eligible for an insurance co-pay coupon from the drug’s maker, Amedra Pharmaceuticals. Adrenaclick uses a different technology than EpiPen, but both auto-injectors contain the same drug, available in the same dosages, says Barbara Young, a doctor of pharmacy with the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. The key concern in switching, says Young, is that “patients may not be aware of differences in how to use the injector.” She advises making sure you know how to use the injector before leaving the pharmacy, as well as scheduling periodic refreshers. Research shows that people forget how to use the injector after about three months and need frequent retraining. EpiPen costs on the rise Since Mylan purchased EpiPen in 2007, the price has increased by more than 400 percent, according to the health data firm DRX. “The astronomical cost increase is a very real problem,” says Dr. Andrew Murphy, a board-certified allergist at the Asthma, Allergy and Sinus Center in West Chester, Pa. High prices are one of the main reasons that people go without the lifesaving drug, according to a 2014 study published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Although Mylan has poured billions into marketing, company spokeswoman Julie Knell attributes increased consumer costs to more people enrolled in high-deductible health plans. “This change to the industry is not an easy challenge to address,” says Knell, but adds that the company is “committed to solutions.” Currently, Mylan offers a coupon that cuts co-pays by up to $100 as well as a patient assistance program that provides free EpiPens for some patients without insurance. The DIY syringe method To further cut costs, some have resorted to using manual syringes and vials of epinephrine, which cost a few dollars each. But experts caution that the do-it-yourself system is complicated. You’ll need to be trained by a doctor or pharmacist on how to inject the drug quickly and accurately before attempting it in an emergency. And it’s critically important that you work with your pharmacist to make sure you get the proper dose. You’ll also need to replace the syringe and epinephrine four times a year; the drug loses potency after just three months. (EpiPens and Adrenaclick pens should be replaced every 12 to 18 months.)

(AP) — Fresh-cut vegetables are being recalled from grocery, discount and convenience stores across the Southeast because the food may be contaminated with potentially fatal Listeria bacteria. Conroe, Texas-based Country Fresh Inc. said Friday that the recall involves its vegetable products shipped to retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The vegetables carried the Country Fresh and store labels at Bi-Lo, Fresh Point, Harris Teeter, Publix, QuikTrip, Spinx, Walmart and Winn-Dixie stores. The recalled items had “best if used by” dates of Aug. 7 through 19. Listeria can cause serious infections in the young or frail. Healthy people may suffer high fever, severe headache and other symptoms. One person in Connecticut died during a four-state outbreak linked to frozen vegetables recalled earlier this year. The complete FDA announcement about the recall is below- Country Fresh, Inc.281-453-3305 Announcement August 26, 2016.  Country Fresh, LLC. of Conroe, Texas, is recalling 30,000 cases of various fresh-cut vegetable products (product descriptions attached), because they have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.  Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeriainfection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. The product in question was shipped to retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia under the Country Fresh and store brand labels described in the product listing. The product bears “BEST IF USED BY” dates between August 7, 2016 (8/7/16) through August 19, 2016 (8/19/16).  The product is in either a clear plastic container as labeled below or in Styrofoam trays overwrapped with clear plastic film as labeled below.  No products except those on this list are subject to this recall. To date, no illnesses have been confirmed by public health authorities. “We are treating this incident very seriously because we want to ensure that our customers are provided with only the safest, most wholesome, and high-quality products available,” said Max Payen, Country Fresh’s Director of Food Safety.  The potential for contamination was uncovered as the result of a single routine sample taken at a retail store by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, which revealed the finished product tested positive for the bacteria.  The company has ceased distribution of the affected product as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Country Fresh continue their investigation as to what caused the problem.  This recall is being undertaken with the knowledge of the FDA. Consumers who have purchased any of these products are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 281-453-3305, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. CDT.

The recall is due to possible listeria bacteria contamination. The recall comes from Country Fresh Inc., which is based in Texas. The vegetables carry the Country Fresh and store labels at Harris Teeter, Walmart, Bi-Lo, Fresh Point, Publix, QuikTrip, Spinx and Winn-Dixie. The recalled items have “best if used by” dates of August 7th through the 19th. Country Fresh says the recall involves products sent to retailers in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee.

One of the first to land in that area was Best Buy, which opened in 2006, he said. The Little Apple is one of the few cities in Kansas located in two counties, Riley and Pottawatomie. Manhattan’s economic activity and growth is felt in both counties, but also along the US-24 highway corridor, where subdivisions and businesses are sprouting. Much of the commercial development on the city’s east side is in Pottawatomie County, said Eric Cattell, Manhattan’s assistant director of planning. “The dividing line of the two counties is where the Blue River used to run,” he said. “All of our residential areas do happen to be in Riley County. A lot of commercial is on the Pottawatomie side of the line. The whole Walmart-K-mart development area and the whole McCall Road corridor, which has seen a lot of growth in retail, is actually in Pottawatomie County.” In addition, the Blue Township, considered part of East Manhattan, sits in Pottawatomie County. Leaders of both counties work together as they plan growth in the area, Cattell said. Pottawatomie County was part of Manhattan’s previous comprehensive plan update in 2003, Cattell said, and county officials asked for a larger area to be included in recent years. Jack Allston, executive director of the Pottawatomie County Economic Development Corp., said Riley and Pottawatomie counties are closely linked, each supporting needs in the other. There is more land for development possibilities in Pottawatomie, for instance. “So what’s very, very important, and the business community understands this, is that we have a porous border, and that we work very closely with the Manhattan Chamber on almost all issues,” Allston said. “We let them take part in lots of things we’re doing, and they let us take part in a lot of things they’re doing.” Allston, who has extensive economic development expertise nationwide, joined the PCEDC in 2014 and said he was hired to look at the “big picture.” Part of that is understanding the importance of working with Manhattan. “Our partnership with the Manhattan Chamber is a real partnership,” he said, adding that an example was the relocation of Vets First Choice, a veterinary prescription management company. They had been in downtown Wamego but needed more space. They were looking at moving to Omaha, Neb., where their distribution center was, or other places outside Kansas. “I found out about it, called the Manhattan Chamber,” Allston said. “Manhattan Chamber contacted the corporate office, and they got together and found them a building, and they’re going to stay in the area.” As the two counties collaborate, Allston and other Pottawatomie County leaders also fight to keep their county competitive. “You’ve got to expand the workforce,” Allston said. The county recently released a Strategic Workforce Implementation Plan with six objectives, including educating and working with students on career clusters and pathways, and employment of the disabled and disenfranchised. A strategic implementation plan, completed in 2015 lays out a five-year guide for what needs to be done in the county. The county also needs to focus on infrastructure. One element of that is widening K-99 highway from Interstate 70 to Wamego. “The engineering is completed, but the governor’s got no money that I know of, although he did promise this to Caterpillar,” Allston said. Caterpillar is one of the largest companies in Wamego. On its website, the PECDC tracks Pottawatomie County’s growth in several ways. One is through a report by Catalyst Commercial Inc., hired to do a market analysis on the region. It showed a high demand for retail expansion. The residents, students, workforce, commuters and visitors demand enough retail to support an additional 306,998 square feet of retail space, Catalyst said. The bulk of that demand was for general merchandise stores. The county’s retail sales grew from $376.9 million in 2009 to $442.2 million in 2012.

He was airlifted to a Paterson trauma center with extensive injuries, authorities said. According to Lt. James MacIntosh, the suspect was seen running to the back parking lot at 9:30 p.m. yesterday and jumping the fence. Patrolman Mike Reilly and Patrolman Kyle Parrill checked the Tilcon Riverdale Quarry, which is behind the fence, and then climbed down the wooded area below the fence. They walked several hundred feet to check the area, and the suspect, John Sanchez, was located at the base of the very high retaining wall below the fence. He was on his back and became unconscious with extensive injuries including internal injuries and broken bones, MacIntosh said. The Pompton Lakes Riverdale First Aid Squad, paramedics and Riverdale Fire Department were all contacted, along with State Police NorthSTAR, which arrived with rescue equipment to send down to his location. With the use of Riverdale Fire Department's ladder truck, Sanchez was extracted from the area and taken to a landing zone where he was loaded onto the helicopter. He was flown to the Emergency Room at St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson, and his condition was not known at the time of Riverdale's press release. According to MacIntosh, police learned that Sanchez had attempted to take a cart full of merchandise valued at $462.58 from the Route 23 North store. When confronted by employees, Sanchez had run, MacIntosh said. Sgt. Chuck Quant charged Sanchez with fourth-degree shoplifting. He will be processed and given a court date when he is released from St. Joe's. - Donna Rolando NorthJersey.com : News : Crime and Courts NorthJersey.com : News : Crime and Courts August 30, 2016 Last updated: Tuesday, August 30, 2016, 1:01 PM Alleged shoplifter falls in Riverdale, airlifted to hospital Suburban Trends Alleged shoplifter falls, airlifted to hospital RIVERDALE - A 27-year-old Wayne man suspected of shoplifting from the Walmart store allegedly fled from store employees and jumped a fence with a severe drop-off of 20 to 100 feet.

It is a Christian social service center for the homeless and poor at 1430 Pacific Ave. in Long Beach. The following is an interview with some of the homeless men living at the Mission. They are basically recovering from alcohol and drug addiction. Steve, age 63, was born in Detroit, Michigan. Steve was on the Detroit Police Department for a short time and left because of a medical problem. There was a big snow storm in Detroit and Steve thought it was best to travel to California. It was here that he worked as a truck driver off and on over the years. Today, he enjoys reading books and swimming occasionally. Anthony, is age 52 and his nickname is “the Reverend.” He was born in Providence, Rhode Island and he left because he thought California offered him more work as a carpenter. He also found employment as an assistant chef in some restaurants. Today he is involved in ministry and relaxes listening to music. Kevin, age 55 was born Long Beach, California. All his life he was involved in retail sales for stores like Walmart and Marshals. Today he spends most of his time watching different sports on television and lots of old time movies. Terri, age 43 was born in Baltimore, Maryland. For a large part of his life he worked for a postal contractor sorting out mail. He also filled in his working time as a part time security officer. Today his enjoyment is watching movies most of the afternoon. Chris, 29 was born in San Pedro. His primary employment is being a carpenter specializing in hardwood floors. He likes to try and stay in shape by exercising, swimming and snowboarding when he can get up to the mountains. David, age 19 was born in Torrance. David says his mother left him to move back to Mexico. He elected to stay in California and has sought work in construction. To pass his spare time he likes to play the guitar, and play the drums if he has any to play. The homeless population in the greater part of Long beach is rising every year. To some extent it is their good fortune to live in California and not in the mid-west where the winter months really take a toll in lives. A large portion of the homeless are women and children. The Long Beach Rescue Mission is helping to provide a way for keeping the homeless off the streets and getting them on the road to recovery. By having a nice shelter, good food and spiritual guidance, this in itself helps those to recover from the homeless cycle induced by alcohol and drug addiction. With some basic work-related training, and our support many will return to normal lives in today’s society. Most of the homeless are referred to the mission from the Long Beach Police Department, local hospitals, case workers and many are walk-ins. The mission provides food, clothing, shelter and spiritual guidance to everyone.

 Sears workers reveal why the company is bleeding cash Hayley Peterson Aug. 27, 2016, 7:11 PM 234,512 facebook linkedin twitter email print A worker unpacks televisions at a Sears in Schaumburg, Illinois, near Chicago. Reuters Sears is bleeding cash. The company's cash and equivalents have fallen to $276 million from $1.8 billion a year ago, Sears said Thursday. The company's sales have been falling for years and it has been shutting down stores, selling real estate, and spinning off brands to stem the bleeding. Since 2007, Sears has closed half of its locations — which include Sears and Kmart stores — and eliminated more than 137,000 jobs. Some employees have predicted that the rest of the company's physical stores will close within the next two years. The stores are severely understaffed, with some operating on less than half of the employees they need, according to workers who spoke to Business Insider. Not only are the stores firing people, but they are also cutting labor hours for the workers that remain, according to the employees. In some cases, stores are operating with just one or two cashiers and sometimes no cashiers at all, they said. That's making it increasingly difficult to hire and retain experienced workers, according to a former Kmart employee of 41 years, who said that she was laid off in February. She told Business Insider that her store's employees hadn't seen raises in eight years. She blames the company's CEO, Eddie Lampert, for the company's downfall. "Lampert has taken this company and, with pompous arrogance, has destroyed it," she said. "Customer care is vital to a retail business. Lampert just couldn't understand that." Sears Workers also said that the stores are suffering structurally from a lack of investment. An employee who currently works for a Sears in Ohio said that his store is rife with issues, from broken walls and escalators to frequent roof leaks. He said that the merchandise on the floor is often torn open, and no one will buy those items. A former assistant manager of Kmart who left the company in 2012 after 12 years said that the company really started going downhill after the introduction of Shop Your Way, a loyalty program that Sears introduced in 2009. The program, which allows customers to earn points for purchases, was confusing and poorly executed, killed profits, slowed down customer service, and featured targeted advertising that was completely off base, the former manager said. He said: "Items scanned per minute decreased from 18 to five items per minute because the program was littered with exclusions and confusion. Several items didn't ring as advertised or generate the points as expected. This resulted in long lines and angry customers. Abandoned carts meant utilizing payroll to return those items back to stock." Sears He said that he and his family shopped at Walmart instead of Sears or Kmart to avoid the confusion of Shop Your Way. "Imagine trying to keep an eye on two children and trying to understand a confusing SYWR [Shop Your Way] offer," he said. "We opted to avoid the confusion and shop Walmart — where the tag or the sign told us what we would pay. No gimmicks." The 41-year employee of Kmart who spoke to Business Insider had similar complaints about Shop Your Way. She said: "[Eddie Lampert's] ideas of reward cards to transform the company were a waste of time and money. If they didn't have a card, you were supposed to enroll them while you have 10 waiting in that one line to check out. Most people were so disgusted when they finally got to pay, they didn't want to apply. They just wanted to pay and go." In response to the employee complaints, Sears spokesman Howard Riefs said that the company encourages workers to provide feedback. "One of our cultural beliefs as a company is to embrace feedback," Riefs said. "We have a variety of ways that associates can give authentic feedback — even anonymously — and would encourage them to do so." He also directed Business Insider to a Sears blog post published last year in which employees shared why they are proud to work for Sears and Kmart. "I am very proud to be part of SHC [Sears Holding Co.]," said Jen Chamberlain, a Sears sales associate in Victor, New York. "From online and in-store shopping to home and car repair services integrating with Shop Your Way, it is truly a high standard of operation for any company." Scott Ogden, an associate store manager in Miami, Florida, said, "I am proud to be part of the SHC team because we all work together on a daily basis to achieve the same common goals. SHC is comprised of great leaders and team members who strive every day to deliver their best results." In addition to speaking with employees, Business Insider also reviewed a message board that workers said they use to communicate with Sears and Kmart employees at other stores. In dozens of messages over the last several weeks, people claiming to work for Sears and Kmart complained about the stores' deterioration. Several people claimed that the quality of the products that Sears and Kmart sell has declined and that no one will buy clearance items regardless of how much they mark down the prices. Sears "Clearance is the standard operating procedure at our store," one person wrote on the message board. "We have at least half of our store on clearance. Too much stuff people don't want ... and what they do buy they will usually return as defective. ... Not long until the end, it will come soon." Another person claiming to work in Sears' automotive section wrote: "Lately the majority of tire shipments consist of Patriot and Radar tires. These are simply cheap crappy tires. We have about 12 sets of Michelin tires left and a handful of Goodyear. Even shipments of their signature RoadHandler tires have slowed down. It's embarrassing when I have to face a customer and explain I just don't have much product to offer." One person said that the stores have deteriorated so much that it's like caring for a "dead body." "Our motto now is 'you can only do what you can do,'" the person wrote. "It's sad to watch what we worked for with pride for so many years to be slain in front of us and then we still have to care for the dead body." Sears Some stores are being inundated by shipments of merchandise several times a week, and they don't have enough employees to move the products from the trucks to the stock rooms, and then to store shelves in a timely manner. "We have been getting shipments of things that we don't need — it seems like they are just trying to empty out of the warehouses," one person wrote. The understaffing appears to be a major issue for many stores. "My store is down to a skeleton staff," one person wrote. Another said that they have a 17-year-old in a managerial position. They wrote: "With new hires only lasting less than a month, experienced employees quitting for better paying and better working conditions we have hardly anyone with any experience to run the store. The worst is that we have a 17-year-old running the office and cash office. He has no experience in either but he is a warm body to fill the job. The end is coming soon, get out while you can."

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it The just-completed Deepwater Wind project, which sits off the coast of Rhode Island’s Block Island, is set to begin generating power this fall. (Courtesy of Deepwater Wind) By Brady Dennis August 27, 2016 Follow @brady_dennis BLOCK ISLAND, R.I. — The turbines stand like sentinels off the coast of this tiny island, each rising twice as high as the Statue of Liberty. Workers attached the final 240-foot-long blades just days ago, turning the nation’s first offshore wind farm into a reality. When residents look out at the altered horizon from their gray-shingled houses, some see progress, the birth of a promising industry, a way to ditch the 1 million gallons of diesel fuel that Block Island burns each year for power. Others see an expensive eyesore, a boondoggle that they contend will enrich private investors while burdening the state’s ratepayers and doing little to improve daily life here. One group went to federal court in an unsuccessful effort to stall the project. The country’s inaugural foray into offshore wind power is modest compared with the sprawling developments that have existed in Europe for decades. The five-turbine, 30-megawatt project, which is set to start operating this fall, will feed into New England’s electrical grid via underwater cables and provide enough energy to power about 17,000 homes. But here’s what makes it momentous: It exists. From her family’s cottage on Block Island, Rosemarie Ives has a clear view of Deepwater Wind’s five turbines — a project she and her husband have long opposed. (Brady Dennis/The Washington Post) [U.S., Canada and Mexico vow to get half their electricity from clean power by 2025] Building offshore turbines to capture ocean winds has long appealed to U.S. proponents who see them as an untapped source of renewable energy. Yet efforts to jump-start the industry have faltered, none more publicly than the Cape Wind project off Martha’s Vineyard, which has been beset by permitting struggles, legal challenges and opponents with last names such as Koch and Kennedy. In part because of its deliberately small size, only the Block Island wind farm has successfully navigated the legal, regulatory and political hurdles that have tripped up others. Deepwater Wind, the Providence-based company behind the facility, views it as a steppingstone to much bigger endeavors. “Something had to be first,” said the company’s chief executive, Jeff Grybowski. “Some project had to be successful in order for the U.S. to be able to begin taking advantage of this huge resource.” There’s reason to believe offshore wind farms could soon see a U.S. boom. The federal government has awarded nearly a dozen commercial offshore wind leases, including locations off the coasts of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia. This month, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) signed a law requiring utilities to buy a combined 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind power in coming years. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) wants half the state’s power to come from renewable energy sources by 2030, a plan backed by the state’s Public Service Commission. Deepwater Wind already is angling to build a proposed 15-turbine wind farm off the eastern coast of Long Island, the first phase of what it hopes will be more than 200 turbines to help supply parts of New York and Massachusetts. Other companies have a growing list of offshore projects in various stages of development. ( The Washington Post) Tens of thousands of wind turbines already dot Texas, Iowa and other states, accounting for about 5 percent of the nation’s energy generation. Building these structures on land is cheaper and simpler, but the ocean provides stronger and more reliable winds, and the larger turbines there can, in theory, harness vast amounts of energy. [Why companies like Google and Walmart are buying so much wind power] The wind farm three miles southeast of Block Island has not been universally embraced by the island’s roughly 1,000 year-round residents — a population that swells to 20,000 during the summer, when tourists pour off ferries and fill quaint saltwater-sprayed inns and bars. “We certainly don’t appreciate the turbines ruining the view our family has had for nearly 100 years,” said Rosemarie Ives, whose husband has been coming to a cottage atop Mohegan Bluffs since he was a baby in the 1940s. But Ives, the former mayor of Redmond, Wash., said the couple’s opposition goes beyond aesthetics. They and other detractors say they think officials approved the roughly $300 million project without adequately considering the long-term costs and other effects. They argue that it will do little to lower electricity bills on Block Island, where residents pay among the highest rates in the country. “It was a charade of public process,” Ives said. Mary Jane Balser, who owns Block Island Grocery, typically the island’s biggest electricity consumer, is even more blunt. For years she tried to win grants to connect the island to the mainland electricity grid in an effort to escape the unreliability of diesel generators. “Financially,” she said this month, the wind farm “just makes no sense.” Under a 20-year agreement with regional utility National Grid, Deepwater Wind will receive about 24 cents per kilowatt hour for the power generated by the turbines, with guaranteed increases over time. The average American pays about 12.3 cents. That means Rhode Islanders will pay more for power to subsidize a project benefiting Deepwater’s private investors, Balser said. “It’s not benefiting Block Island. It’s not benefiting Rhode Island,” she said. “The notoriety of being the first in the nation? Can I take that home and eat it?” Grybowski, the Deepwater Wind CEO, is familiar with the criticisms but insists that the wind farm has broad support. Block Island’s town council and residents association backed it, he said, as did environmental groups, three Rhode Island governors, the state’s congressional delegation and the Obama administration. “It’s not unanimous, but I don’t know that there’s an energy project anywhere in the world that is unanimously praised,” he said. “I think the folks who think the process was insufficient are really upset that they didn’t win.” Cristina Archer, a professor in the College of Earth, Ocean and Environment at the University of Delaware, likens offshore wind farms in the United States to personal computers and other technologies that are expensive in the beginning but grow cheaper and more accepted over time. She suspects that the same will happen as the industry grows domestically. “It paves the way,” Archer said of Block Island. Yet she acknowledged that islanders themselves might not see many direct benefits from the project. “The benefit is long term for society in general, not necessarily for the place where the turbines are,” she said. For Norris Pike, a home builder and the island’s second warden, his vote in favor of the project came down in part to a commitment to combat climate change. “It’s the right thing to do. Everybody has to do their part. I believe this is our part,” said Pike, whose family settled here in the 17th century. He estimates that about 70 percent of residents support the project and that the 30 percent who were against it “just tended to be pretty vocal.” He expects to see community gains, such as ecotourism and the mainland power connection, that will include fiber-optic cable that eventually might help improve the island’s notoriously sluggish Internet speeds. “We’ve been running on diesel generators for 80 years,” Pike said. “It’s time to turn them off.” Clifford McGinnes, the octogenarian co-owner of Block Island Power, agrees. “We won’t have these ups and downs that we’ve had with the [diesel] engines,” he said, noting that a recent fire disabled several engines and led to rolling blackouts. “I can’t wait to shut them down. There’s always a problem.” Some Block Islanders are delighted that the smallest town in the smallest state is ground zero for a new renewable energy industry. “Isn’t it awesome?” asked Judy Gray, a retired meteorologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as she stood on her deck overlooking the wind farm. “I’m what they call a YIMBY — Yes in my back yard.” Gray’s family began coming to the island in the 1930s, and she and her husband settled here full-time when she retired. “People are afraid of what they don’t know,” she said. “I think people will eventually get used to it. I think it’s going to make us a model.” In recent days, Gray has spent hours on her deck with her camera, giddily documenting how the turbines were taking shape. This fall, when their blades at last begin generating electricity, she plans to throw a “wind farm party” to celebrate with friends and neighbors. national health-science Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

(AP) — A mother has been charged in the death of her son who drowned in the pool at a central Alabama apartment while she shopped at Walmart. Al.com reported Friday that 29-year-old Davida Samantha Flint left her 2-year-old son Caden Jemison and two other children at home while she shopped. Homewood police said she initially told them she was home during the incident, but surveillance video from Walmart showed she was at the store when Jemison drowned at the Chastaine Park Apartments on July 26. Jail records show that Flint is charged with reckless manslaughter. She was released from the Jefferson County Jail after posting a $10,000 bond on Thursday.

Print Email Jeff Duncan, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Jeff Duncan, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 27, 2016 at 1:45 PM, updated August 27, 2016 at 1:46 PM comments MANDEVILLE -- It was a random act of kindness on a random Friday night in a random part of south Louisiana. Just like countless other schools across Louisiana, the Fontainebleau Bulldogs hosted a high school football jamboree Friday night. But this one, against the Live Oak Eagles, was different. Live Oak's 9-7 victory won't be what the Eagles and their 200 or so hearty fans remember from the humid night among the piney woods in St. Tammany Parish. They'll remember the Bulldogs' neighborly hospitality and simple act of human decency. Laura Cahill, left, and Dayna Berthaut display the "We Are One" T-shirts sold by the Fontainebleau High School football team booster club to help raise funds for Live Oak High School.Jeff Duncan, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune Since floods inundated the Baton Rouge area earlier this month, countless people from across the country have volunteered time, energy and money to help the storm victims in their time of need. The good folks at Fontainebleau High School were among them. Fontainebleau sits about 64 miles down I-12 from Live Oak, which is located in the bedroom community of Watson just outside of Denham Springs. The schools share similar demographics and academic missions, but compete athletically in different LHSAA classifications. Consequently, they aren't regular adversaries other than the annual preseason football jamboree game. When Live Oak officials determined the flood-ravaged parish would not have the security or support staff necessary to host the jamboree as scheduled, Fontainebleau officials rallied to the cause. The Bulldogs not only agreed to play host to the Eagles, but they elected to donate all the profits from the jamboree to Live Oak High School. The football team's booster club staged a fundraising night at a local restaurant and sold 240 "We Are One" T-shirts to students, faculty and parents. What's more, school officials lured a couple of local fast-food chains to donate postgame meals for both the junior varsity and varsity teams. Fontainebleau officials presented a check for $2,500 to Live Oak coach Bret Beard between the jamboree games. They didn't do it for publicity. They did it because they cared. "We just decided we wanted to help in any way we could," said Tammy Blocker, the wife of Fontainebleau coach Chris Blocker and a member of the football team's booster club. "And it just took off from there." The night reminded me of a comment former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue made at a press conference in those grim days after Hurricane Katrina: "A friend in need is a friend indeed." The Live Oak football team is a living example of this proverb. The Eagles have both given and received aid during the exhausting past two weeks. Live Oak took on water but not nearly as much as their neighbors in Denham Springs and St. Amant. An aerial photo of Live Oak High School sitting in a lake of water was widely circulated online and in social media. However, the school actually received minimal water. Just three buildings took on water, and school officials were able to quickly remedy the damage. Beard and his staff were able to rescue all of the team's gear and equipment from the field house and eventually remove the debris and dead fish from the waterlogged artificial-turf football field. "The photo looked a lot worse than it was," Beard said. "It ended up being a lot better than I thought it was going to be." Nevertheless, the Eagles were far from unaffected. Beard said between 60 and 70 of his players' homes flooded. Five members of his coaching staff "lost everything," he said. Defensive coordinator Brian Smith, center, sends Live Oak defenders through pre-game drills before the Eagles' jamboree game against Fontainebleau on Friday night.Jeff Duncan, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune Defensive coordinator Brian Smith lost his entire home and three cars when floodwaters from the nearby Amite River swamped his neighborhood in southern Denham Springs. Smith and his wife were rescued by boat from the second story of the house as the floodwater rose to the roofline on Aug. 13. They were deposited in the parking lot of a nearby Wal-Mart, where they spent the next 24 hours marooned with hundreds of other storm victims. "When I got to Wal-Mart, I had my shorts and my shirt," Smith said. "That's all I owned. This guy walked up and gave me a pair of socks and there I was, standing there in the rain in the Wal-Mart parking lot in my socks, nowhere to go, no one to come get you because the water is everywhere. Them 24 hours was just bad. That day was brutal." Beard eventually rescued them, and the Smiths have been living with the head coach ever since. For the first week after the flood, Beard, Smith and about 20 members of the team wake up early and take to the streets to help neighbors and friends gut homes. They'd work all day, then hit the practice field around 5 each night. "We'd work all day and play at night," Beard said. "Realistically, we needed to get back to some stability and some type of normalcy. Some of these are sleeping in beds they never thought they'd sleep in, houses with no walls. Football is their stability, and we needed to get back to it. The kids were ready to get back. They were tired. But their excitement got them through it." The Eagles' enthusiasm and resiliency was evident in the jamboree. The Bulldogs shocked them with a long kickoff return and a 20-yard touchdown run on the first play from scrimmage. Forty seconds into the scrimmage, the Eagles trailed. But they settled down and eventually started to execute on both sides of the ball to edge the hosts 9-7. "They have really responded," Smith said of his team. "You're working all day helping people clean their houses out, lifting all that heavy stuff. Your back's hurtin'. Your hamstrings are hurtin'. You're sore everywhere. But you just want to play some football. That's the bottom line for these kids." Fontainebleau athletic director Ricky Zimmer can sympathize with the Eagles' plight. A former wrestling coach at Chalmette and Andrew Jackson High School, he survived Hurricane Betsy and lost his house in Chalmette to floodwaters in hurricanes Katrina and Rita. He knows the feeling of hopelessness and estrangement from the vagabond existence. Fontainebleau High School boosters welcomed Live Oak to the schools' jamboree with several signs on the fence at the football field.Jeff Duncan, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune "I had 13 feet of water at my house in Chalmette," Zimmer said. "We understand. We know it could have been us. This isn't about football. It's about community." It's been a whirlwind two weeks for Live Oak. Classes are scheduled to start Sept. 12. For the time being, Live Oak will share its facilities with hard-hit Denham Springs High School. Live Oak students will attend class in the morning and Denham Springs in the afternoon. Meanwhile, Beard and Smith will try to ready their team for their home opener against St. Amant on Friday night. The Eagles went 6-4 and won the first playoff game in school history a year ago. Expectations were high in Watson for Beard's second season at the helm. Then Mother Nature blitzed, and the Eagles have been calling audibles ever since. Gestures like the one Fontainebleau made Friday night make the road to recovery a little easier. "There's no words I could ever say to tell them how much I appreciate everything they've done," Beard said of Fontainebleau's gesture. "I'll never be able to thank them. I keep telling people, if this ever happens to you all we want to re-pay you and take care of you the same way you're taking care of us, but, hell, I hope it never happens to you." follow us Twitter Facebook LInkedIn Google+ Pinterest Tumblr Most Read Active Discussions Today's Front Page Today's front page stories delivered to your inbox each morning at 5:30 a.m. Leave this field blank    optional Check here if you do not want to receive additional email offers and information.

Posted: Saturday, August 27, 2016 BUSINESS BEAT: Murphy Oil USA breaks ground in Greenville By Meghan Nelson • Last Updated 10:46 pm on Friday, August 26, 2016 Tweet Murphy Oil USA employees, Greenville Chamber of Commerce members, Mayor Pro-Tem Frances Schuleit and Walmart employees attended Thursday’s groundbreaking of Murphy Oil USA. The gas station will be located on M-57 in front of Walmart and is expected to open the second week in October. — Daily News/Meghan Koglin GREENVILLE — After a long process of planning and preparing, Murphy Oil USA officials broke ground Thursday on the site of a future store. The new gas station will be located on M-57 in front of Walmart, and will offer gas, hot cocoa, soda, milk, lottery tickets, tobacco products, frozen drinks and much more. The store will be open 24/7. “We’re hoping to be open by the middle of October, depending if everything goes smoothly,” said Store Manager Rebecca Buchheister. “The tanks are in. We need to do grating and get that all done. They need the columns for the canopy and the building in. There’s still a lot to do.” Greenville Mayor Pro-Tem Frances Schuleit, center, was among those present. She welcomed Murphy’s and Manager Rebecca Buchheister to Greenville. — Daily News/Meghan Koglin Besides finishing the building, two assistant managers and five cashiers still need to be hired. The hiring process will begin Oct. 1 to be ready to open the store during the second week in October. Buchheister of Port Huron works at the Fort Gratiot Murphy Oil USA, but she’s worked across the state and even in Indianapolis. “Right now, I’m the go-to person to go to other places, so this is an exciting time that I get to move up into a bigger store than what I have right now,” she said. “I have been with the company for 10 years. I have traveled to almost every store in Michigan to work, and I’ve also worked in a store down in Indianapolis. “I’m excited. I can’t wait and I’m happy,” she added with enthusiasm. Greenville Mayor Pro-Tem Frances Schuleit welcomed Buchheister and “the wonderful nationwide company” to Greenville. “We’re thankful for your faith in Greenville,” Schuleit  said. “We are happy to have you and we welcome you.” Greenville Area Chamber of Commerce members also expressed their excitement for the new company. Murphy Oil USA has been in existence since 1996 and has about two dozen stores open throughout the United States. Visit www.murphyoilusa.com online for more information about the company.

The discovery was made shortly after 9 p.m. when firefighters responding to a 911 call about a car on fire, put out the blaze and discovered the charred remains of a person sitting in the driver’s seat. Police have determined that the car belonged to a 59-year-old man, but it is not known whether he was behind the wheel at the time of the incident. According to Laval police spokesperson,  Lieutenant Frédéric Jean, an autopsy will be required to identify the victim.

But for golf course owners, it’s much harder to pull the plug on a failing business; as courses fall into disuse, they become suburban zombies – not quite dead, yet far from alive. Is this a market correction and also, why are so many literally going up in flames? Find out more at this link. HOW OUTSIDER BUSINESSES ARE GOING MAINSTREAM Fast Company  reports, “As black market businesses become mainstream, it’s clear that mastering illicit activities can help develop a lot of business acumen. Moonshine. Camel milk. Cannabis. Once only products of the gray and black market economies, decriminalization is bringing a new wave of underground goods to consumers across the U.S. “But while the quality may be better, the commercial recipes are still very much inspired by the bootleg generation.” And then there’s the revenue. States legalizing informal businesses – cannabis being the most obvious example – are finding new revenue opportunities. And once struggling informal entrepreneurs are finding new pathways into mainstream business. Since Tennessee legalized moonshine, its wholesale alcohol beverage tax revenue has grown substantially. Learn more about the huge successes of outsider businesses going mainstream, here. INSIDE BILLIONAIRE JAMES DYSON’S REINVENTION FACTORY Forbes posts, “Dressed in a blue polka-dot oxford and striped Reebok sneakers, James Dyson abruptly veers off a paved path that cuts through his company’s 56-acre compound. The beanpole-thin 69-year-old billionaire pushes his way into some shrubbery and presses his nose right up to the reflective glass that encases his new, top-secret laboratory, a sleek two-story cube that looks like it was beamed directly from Santa Clara to the Cotswolds. To his delight, he can’t make out what his engineers are doing inside. “I hope they are working,” he says, chuckling.” In reality, it’s move-in day at this brand-new $200-million-plus research facility, and on the other side of the glass dozens of young engineers are unpacking their gear and settling into their quarters. Their job at D9, as the building is cryptically known, is to experiment fearlessly, fail constantly and document those failures in company-issued black-and-yellow notebooks, which form the basis for still more experiments, still more failures–and also a corporate sideline in patent litigation. “Very rarely this unending cycle of failure results in a revolutionary new product: the bagless vacuum cleaner (5 years, 5,127 prototypes), the 360 Eye robot (17 years, 1,000-plus prototypes) and the Supersonic hair dryer (4 years, 600 prototypes). But those successes add up: Dyson’s 58 products generated $2.4 billion in sales last year and an estimated $340 million in net profits, even after Dyson reinvested 46% of the company’s Ebitda in R&D, more than rivals such as Electrolux and Techtronic. Dyson owns 100% of the company, which is worth some $4.8 billion.” What’s next in the Dyson lineup of products? Go to this link for a fascinating read. SUPERBOSSES AREN’T AFRAID TO DELEGATE THEIR BIGGEST DECISIONS Harvard Business Review says, “The answer to excessive micromanaging, we’re often told, is to learn to trust our reports, empowering them to make decisions for themselves. Yet that sounds far easier than it actually is. In practice, many bosses fail to delegate because they haven’t cultivated a set of underlying mindsets and practices. Over the past decade, I’ve studied the world’s greatest bosses, extraordinarily successful leaders who have also unleashed vast pipelines of talent. These “superbosses,” as I called them, spanned dozens of industries and included legendary figures such as fast casual restaurant magnate Norman Brinker, packaged foods titan Michael Miles, tech mogul Larry Ellison, hedge fund pioneer Julian Robertson, media icon Oprah Winfrey, and a host of others.” Analyzing these leaders’ careers and business practices, I found that superbosses were expert delegators, ceding degrees of authority and control that would send chills down the spines of ordinary bosses. Would you hand a twenty-something $25 million in seed capital and tell him to go off on his own to manage it? Julian Robertson did. Would you task a young protégé with generating the main strategy for a new real estate development — only two days before a big presentation with investors? If you’re real estate legend Bill Sanders, the answer is yes. “Superbosses embrace a number of specific behaviors and beliefs that enable them to trust their subordinates more deeply, and delegate decision-making authority more aggressively. (Take this assessment to find out if you’re a superboss.)” Find out more at this link. ETHICISTS SCOFF AT CLINTON FOUNDATION TRANSITION PLAN POLITICO posts, “The Clinton Foundation’s vague timetable to limit its involvement with overseas programs, and its insistence that Chelsea Clinton remain on its board, raise red flags for ethics watchdogs even as the charity vows to avoid conflicts of interest in a Hillary Clinton presidency. Foundation President Donna Shalala suggested Tuesday that reorganizing the $2 billion enterprise could not happen overnight. The charity pledged last week not to accept foreign or corporate donations if Clinton is elected.” But Richard Painter, former ethics counsel in the George W. Bush administration, said that if the Clintons really wanted to separate themselves, they could do it tomorrow. “That could be done in one board meeting — change the name, have the board members resign and be replaced with people with no ties to the Clintons. No one in the Clinton family should be there. … That’s an easy step to take. It could be done in an afternoon,” Painter said. Independent trustees with experience at other charities could oversee any necessary changes without jeopardizing programs, he said.” “Questions about how the global philanthropy would sever ties that raise potential conflicts of interest for a President Clinton are the latest controversy surrounding its work. Assertions that donors to the charity got special access to Clinton while she was secretary of state have dogged her campaign.” More on this evolving story at this link. RACHEL MADDOW’S DUEL WITH TRUMP MANAGER KELLYANNE CONWAY Donald Trump has only been doing Fox News these days, but on Wednesday night his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, gamely ventured into the unfriendly confines of Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show. What followed was a fascinating, lengthy back-and-forth over the importance of policy to Trump, among many other topics. The whole thing was so riveting that The Washington Post annotated it. Check it out for yourself at this link. STRAIGHT TALKIN’ McCAIN “Facing his toughest reelection fight ever, the Arizona senator looks like the freewheeling presidential contender of 2000,” reports POLITICO. “The dour John McCain of Capitol Hill is on hiatus. In his place, at least for a day: The loose, accessible, happy warrior of Straight Talk Express yesteryear. McCain is deadly serious about winning reelection and continuing his long-running battle against the health care and foreign policies of President Barack Obama.” McCain has plenty weighing on his mind these days, including a wild card Republican nominee for president who’s attacked him personally as well as his state’s growing Latino electorate. A super PAC supporting his primary opponent, Kelli Ward, is receiving a late infusion of money ahead of the Tuesday election, an attempt to embarrass McCain with a poor showing. Though McCain is heavily favored to win that race, he’ll then run into Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.) in the general, easily the toughest opponent he’s ever faced. Follow this link for the complete story including McCain showing the humorous side of his personality that endeared him to millions in multiple state and national campaigns. HOW ALCOHOL PLAYED A ROLE IN AMERICA’S POLITICS “Booze and presidency has a long and illustrious history in the United States. Whether it’s President Obama’s “Beer Summit” in the Rose Garden or Richard Nixon’s famous trip to China, alcohol has been a necessary part of diplomacy. Historian Mark Will-Weber, author of “Drinking with the Republicans,” joins “CBS This Morning: Saturday” to share some of the presidents’ boozy stories in office.” Did President Harding actually stash a fifth in his golf bag and was Nixon a “light-weight” drinker?

RYAN LOCHTE TURNS EXPERTLY FROM APOLOGY TOUR TO COMEBACK “Ryan Lochte lost all his big sponsorship deals after his idiocy down in Brazil during the Olympics. Today, you might say he’s failing upward, or something,” reports MarketPlace. Lochte has been on what you might call an apology tour, giving interviews and admitting  his story was “over-exaggerated.” But today, Pine Brothers cough drops signed him up, saying “Just as Pine Bros. is forgiving to your throat, the company asks the public for a little forgiveness for an American swimming legend.” Cheesy and opportunistic all at once. And for other huge “Lochte Redemption news” you can get the scoop by clicking here. FOR THE COLONEL, IT WASN’T ‘FINGER-LICKIN’ The New York Times says, “A small boy, seated at a table in Kentucky Fried Chicken store in Greenwich Village paled and almost dropped the extra‐crispy drumstick he was about to bite into yesterday as he looked up and saw none other than the Kentucky Colonel himself, Harland Sanders, every inch his television image with flowing white hair, trim goatee and blazing white suit.” Looking over to the boy’s mother who was managing a thin smile of disbelief, the colonel boomed, “Ah, madam, I bet you never thought it was true. But you, boy, you never doubted it, did you?” And then he handed the child signed photograph of himself. “This unannounced inspection visit to the Kentucky Fried Chicken store on the Avenue of the Americas near Eighth Street followed a prebirthday luncheon for the colonel at the Coach House. Today the colonel’s 86th birthday will be celebrated with a luncheon at “21.” But driving back from lunch yesterday in the colonel’s limousine, I noticed this Kentucky Fried store, at which I had purchased some of the worst fried chicken I’ve ever eaten in my life.” Oh no. The Colonel was a purist with high standards. What’s going on? “Wing” it over to this link to find out. PSYCHEDELIC DRUG INSPIRED BEATLES’ MASTERPIECE “The story of Revolver began in a night of hell and illumination.” reports Rolling Stone. “We’ve had LSD,” John Lennon told George Harrison.

A 25-year-old catcher hung back. Matt Paré chatted with teammates and underwent a long treatment session as other Augusta GreenJackets players exited through a clubhouse door wedged open with a broken bat. He kept himself awake with a marathon shower. By the time Paré dressed, he had the clubhouse to himself, along with what was left of the GreenJackets' postgame buffet. "What have we got, Sarge?" he called toward clubhouse manager Kristopher Nichols, a former Army drill sergeant who appreciates - and usually rewards - Paré's resourcefulness. Paré is the oldest player for the San Francisco Giants' Class-A affiliate, and he begins most homestands by waiting out his teammates in order to stockpile free food. Far away from Major League Baseball's mighty salaries and Hollywood glitz, Paré is among the thousands of minor leaguers who survive on baseball earnings below the federal poverty line. Baseball has in recent years parlayed renewed popularity into record earnings, leveraging apparel and media demands into $9.5 billion in revenue last year; each of its 30 franchises averaged $23 million in profits in 2015, and many of their minor league affiliates saw attendance figures and team values continue a steady climb. But the overwhelming majority of players in professional baseball's extensive player development system never see a cut of that wealth. More than 80 percent of draft picks will never reach the big leagues, and most live on salaries of less than $10,000 per season; the starting salary for a first-year player, paid only during the regular season, is $1,100. "You always question yourself: Should I be doing this?" said Pare, who says he's making about $7,500 in salary during this 22-week season - a little more than $340 a week, or about $8.50 an hour. Paré shares a two-bedroom apartment with three teammates. He has, in four years as a professional ballplayer, accumulated a mountain of credit card debt. His experience is typical among players on pro baseball's ground floor, highlighting that financial struggle is, as much as promo nights and floodlit nostalgia, a minor league tradition. One that might, according to a lawsuit filed against Major League Baseball two years ago, violate federal and state minimum wage laws. "The organization traces its roots to the nineteenth century," reads the suit, filed in a California district court and led by 41 former players. "Unfortunately for many of its employees, its wage and labor practices remain stuck there." MLB has denied that its organizational structure is unlawful and rather provides opportunity to thousands of young athletes who want to make it to the big leagues. Indeed, many players say the sacrifices are worth it. "In reality I just wanted a chance," said Wilmer Difo, a Dominican-born player who, before being called up by the Washington Nationals last year, spent five seasons in the minor leagues and spent the majority of the 2013 season sleeping on an air mattress in an apartment with five other players. "That's everyone's dream, to get to the major leagues. But it's not always going to be like that. Not everyone. Unfortunately, not everyone, but there are a lot of people that depend on it anyway." Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred indicated to reporters in July that additional regulation could ultimately lead to smaller minor league rosters or fewer teams. The lawsuit has nonetheless turned a spotlight on a shadowy corner of a game in which players routinely put in 60-hour work weeks and must face continual personal and professional obstacles in the name of chasing a dream. Athletes from Latin America are particularly at risk. Many come to the United States from impoverished backgrounds with little or no knowledge of English, and lack both the cultural understanding of life in the country and network of family and friends that can help ease the burden. They are guaranteed a salary, health insurance and not much else. But there are reasons they keep playing: Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw's $33.8 million annual salary is the game's richest, and the average major league player earns $4.4 million per season. When the GreenJackets' season began, their highest salary belonged to Adam Sonabend, an undrafted 24-year-old catcher. His biweekly paycheck, after taxes, is $671. That's enough for Sonabend to have his own bedroom, which is more than his three roommates can say. GreenJackets pitchers Michael Connolly and Jake McCasland share a room, and Paré sleeps on a mattress on the dining room floor. Before heading home on this July night, Paré loaded a serving bin with chicken thighs and vegetarian lasagna; Nichols encouraged him to take as much as he wants. At nearly midnight, Paré finally headed for the clubhouse door, carrying his bounty with both hands. Barb Rothstein used to stay up late after her husband went to bed, opening beers and listening to the young men's stories. Barb and Bob invited the first of the players on the Norwich Navigators, at the time a New York Yankees Class-AA affiliate, to live rent-free in their Connecticut basement in 1996. Two years later, after visiting a few Latin Americans prospects' apartment shocking for both its grime and the landlord's price gouging, there were a dozen players and two wives spread through the house on futons, a mattress in their living room, sharing a room with their son. "I'm not the warm and fuzzy type," Barb would say much later. "But there was something about their living situations that I just couldn't stand." Some of the tales common on the minor league circuit are amusing: how smaller prospects sometimes climb into the team bus's luggage bin to sleep, the way a good meal on the road is a jug of peanut butter before flies or sweaty fingers contaminate it, that it was a good bet the team's bat boys were paid more per hour than the players. "I would be very confident to say that anyone working in that stadium was making more than we were, no matter what job they had," said Brett Newsome, a former Nationals farmhand and one of dozens of current and former minor leaguers interviewed for this story. Newsome is among the co-plaintiffs in the lawsuit against MLB. Players travel with air mattresses, sometimes the only constant in a life of change, and essentials aren't easy to come by. One former first-round draft pick said teammates often asked him to "over-order" baseball equipment from sponsors and distribute the extras within the clubhouse. Luxuries are even rarer: A trick known throughout the minors is to buy a television from Wal-Mart, use its box as a stand and return the TV on the 89th day of a 90-day return policy for a refund. Other stories are sad. Many of the Dominican players had been discovered in their early teens by buscónes, or searchers, the unlicensed scouts who work on commission and compel young and hopeful athletes to abandon their educations to play baseball full-time. The controversial system, in which players guarantee the buscón up to half of any future signing bonus in exchange for exposure to major league teams, is an inexpensive way for franchises to expand their scouting networks and for poverty-stricken families to go all-in on a high-risk gambit. If a player does eventually sign, he is sent to some faraway outpost to begin the climb through baseball's ranks. From there they attempt to gain footing in a new culture and are taught to play ball without complaints while nonetheless sending portions of their meager earnings to their families back home. Difo said he made between $400 and $500 every two weeks - or, he said in Spanish, "only enough to eat" after sending his mother a couple hundred dollars from each paycheck - until his salary multiplied six-fold when he was added in 2014 to the Nationals' 40-man roster. Another former player, the Venezuela-born pitcher Jose Mejias, signed with the Philadelphia Phillies at age 16 and spoke so little English he only felt comfortable communicating with hand gestures. After a few months, teammates started calling him "El Mudo," or The Mute. John Wesley, a former minor league player and pitching coach, said he used to sneak water to Dominican players because their apartment's tap output was brown and the young men could not spare $1.50 for a bottle. "These poor kids," said Wesley, who coached in the Toronto Blue Jays system. "It's a pyramid scam: Everything goes to the top. Nothing comes down." The Rothsteins, one of many host families who offer housing to minor leaguers, fit dozens of players in their 2,000-square foot house until a few years ago. Barb said they came to love their guests, and when one player moved up the ladder or gave up the dream, another took his place. In 2008, after the Giants took over the Norwich team, a tall 24-year-old pitcher named Garrett Broshuis moved in. He was from small-town Missouri and bookish, and like Barb, he too collected stories. Every once in a while, as he and Barb shared a few of their favorites, he'd wonder aloud if the system would ever change. Broshuis' office window overlooks downtown St. Louis and the Mississippi River, a wall decorated with reminders of an old life and a new one: his rookie card next to his admittance to the Missouri Bar Association. "I still love the game," Broshuis said, though a decade after signing a contract to play professional baseball, he was declaring war on it. In February 2014, he filed the lawsuit against MLB, its 30 franchises and former Commissioner Bud Selig. In it, he referred to the league as a "cartel." A former all-American at Missouri, he had tried, years earlier, to keep quiet and play. When a group of fans in Norwich watched him push-start the broken-down pickup he shared with a teammate, he shook it off as paying his dues. When he invited his then-girlfriend to his meager apartment, finding a room flooded by a neighbor's toilet upstairs, he assured himself brighter days awaited. He chronicled his experiences in articles for the Sporting News, though he squashed the grittier anecdotes and submitted the entries to the Giants for approval. But as the years passed, the stories ate away at his resolve: the Venezuelan teammate who struggled each month to send $20 back home to his pregnant girlfriend, the young pitchers worrying each month about how they'd pay their student loans. He was told by team officials that he was lucky to play, that the system had been in place for decades, that if he wanted to make more money, he should get better. Four days after his final game in 2009, he took the Law School Admission Test and was later accepted into St. Louis University's law school. He spoke with professors about a long-term plan to challenge a system that succeeded in part because the hopeful and desperate athletes continued to accept it for one prevailing reason: They always had. MLB filed an answer to the suit last year, denying the allegations in Broshuis's complaint. A league spokesman declined an interview request for this story, referring The Washington Post to a June statement comparing players to "artists, musicians and other creative professionals who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act." "Like those professionals," the MLB statement went on, "it is simply impractical to treat professional athletes as hourly employees." Paré was on his 38th consecutive hour awake - games on consecutive nights and in stadiums 426 miles apart, one pitch to the head in the first one, a nine-hour bus ride in which he wasn't allowed to sleep because he was being evaluated for a possible concussion - and now it was approaching midnight. He put the leftover chicken and lasagna into the fridge, and when he opened the sliding pantry door it fell off the track. "Believe it or not," he said of the apartment, "the last place was worse." In this complex west of town, roughly 10 units are filled - packed, in some cases - with GreenJackets players and coaches. In here, the air conditioning rumbles and the front door must be slammed to close; Paré sat on carpet singed in places by a previous tenant, examining the lens on his video camera. All four players in this second-floor apartment hold second jobs at least part of the year. Connolly works construction during offseasons, McCasland is a substitute teacher and Sonabend spends part of the morning hours organizing online inventory for a pharmaceutical company. Neither pays especially well, but it's enough financial oxygen to keep the dream alive. Paré makes YouTube videos that poke fun at the plight of a "homeless minor leaguer," a light-hearted look at the lonely hours and inelegant lifestyle the common fan rarely sees. "You can sponsor a player right now," he implores viewers in one video inspired by those old "Save the Children" ads. Paré ends most videos by soliciting donations, and a good month - he collected $83 in July - means he doesn't have to negotiate food prices at Waffle House. A 26th-round draft pick out of high school by Houston in 2009, Paré elected to play at Boston College rather than accept the Astros' offer, which he said included a $200,000 signing bonus. He tore a meniscus as a sophomore, and scouts never viewed him the same. He wasn't drafted after his junior and senior seasons, but after a tryout in June2013, the Giants offered him a contract - this one offering $1,000 to sign. He met Sonabend, another undrafted former college catcher, at a voluntary camp last year before spring training. They traded stories and agreed that luck and persistence had led them to the professional ranks. Sonabend reached Class-AA Richmond last season, collecting a salary increase because of service time at a higher level, and this spring they were assigned to Augusta. Sonabend and Paré agreed to room together with Connolly and McCasland, collaborating on ways to cut costs: Paré sleeping in the dining room because the other residents pay for the Internet, Sonabend buying eggs a few times a week in exchange for use of Paré's SUV. Evenings are spent at the ballpark or at fan events; Paré has perfected the art of asking boosters for donations. This year the roommates have scored eyedrops, a few jugs of coffee, laundry detergent, a sofa and a potholder set. As Friday turned to Saturday, Paré not yet able to wind down, Connolly and McCasland came in through the front door and one of them wrestled it closed. "I brought lasagna!" Paré announced, but his roommates had stopped at a restaurant on the way home. Connolly wished he had known. "That could've saved me some bucks," the 24-year-old pitcher said. Paré returned his attention to the camera, a few ideas in mind for new videos, and Connolly approached the pantry. The door again fell off the track, and Connolly slammed it. "This whole place is a joke," he said, and all Paré could do was laugh. Paré was living rent-free in a cousin's spare bedroom last fall when the email arrived: "The purpose of this Notice," it read, "is to inform you of the existence of a collective action lawsuit against Major League Baseball." A group of former minor leaguers had formed a movement against the league, and hundreds more were adding their names. He thought about it and talked to people he trusted. He read articles about the attorney who had once played for the same organization now leading a charge against MLB. Paré wondered if, like the 1968 uprising that ultimately led to free agency, a victory here would be good for the game. And in the end, he couldn't be certain it would. He believed the Giants (who through a spokeswoman declined to comment for this article) and MLB had, all told, been good to him. Around 2,300 current and former players would opt-in on the suit, but Paré would not be one of them. He didn't want to take a side. He reported for spring training last February, reconnecting with Sonabend and Connolly, who also received the email but refused to add their names. "If I signed it," Connolly said, "it would almost be like me not appreciating the opportunity." Sonabend saw it similarly. "I knew what I was getting into," he said, "and I worked for it anyway." Last month, a California magistrate judge stripped the suit of its conditional class-action status. A setback, Broshuis admitted, but earlier this month the same judge granted a request to reconsider the class certification; a hearing is scheduled for Dec. 2. For now, Broshuis and the 41 co-plaintiffs wait, and for different reasons so do the young men in the apartment in west Augusta: Paré increasingly realistic about his baseball fate, Sonabend seeing how a former baseball castaway can climb, Connolly defiantly hopeful that the phone will someday ring, a voice on the other end inviting him to a higher level in the game and a better lifestyle. "It's only going to be a couple years and you filter out," Connolly said, "or you get that paycheck everybody dreams about." Early on a Saturday afternoon, another game a few hours away, Paré dressed for work. Sonabend joined him in the den, and they collected their bags. "Is Mike pitching?" Paré asked. "Who's pitching?" Sonabend shrugged. "Ready?" he said. "I'm ready," Paré said, and they walked into the midsummer sun, through a door that didn't want to close.

Without (so far) any consultation, the NHS proposes a massive reorganisation that could include hospital closures and cuts, and these could start within months, just as the NHS suffers its winter overload. Why have things come to this? According to Government figures, the £437 million spent in the first year of the NHS’s existence in 1948-49 is equivalent to £15 billion today. Yet the UK total spent on the NHS is now £116.4 billion, £101.3 billion of which is spent in England. The population is nearly a third larger than in 1948-49; we are 64 million people against the 50 million at the 1951 census, thanks not least to the last Labour government’s mass immigration policies and the EU’s refusal to let us control our borders. Yet this population growth cannot account for such an enormous real increase in spending. The problem is that the NHS is doing things its founders never envisaged. It might not survive It also suffers from grotesque overmanning in non-medical staff, a lack of strategic planning to cope with demographic change, and many of the failures associated with the absence of an effective price mechanism. Without rethinking its whole purpose and method of operation, it will, within a decade or two, simply collapse. Even though this is no longer 1948 – our standard of living, our disposable income, our awareness of the dangers of smoking are all radically different from then – governments have avoided profound NHS reform for decades. The insurers of boy racers who mangle themselves in car accidents should be made to pay for their treatment Labour wouldn’t touch it because of the mythology it has sedulously created: that the NHS, free at point of use and controlled on the shop floor by comrades in the trades unions, for whom it represents a considerable employment opportunity, is “safe” only in Labour’s hands. “Safe” in this context equates to eating up a sixth of public spending without worrying too much about how and where that money is spent. The NHS now employs 1.5 million people. As its website proudly proclaims, only McDonalds, Walmart, the US Defence Department and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army have larger payrolls. It may not have occurred to the NHS that this is not necessarily something to be proud of. Watch | Campaign group warns over hospital closures and cutbacks 01:13 The Tories haven’t addressed the NHS with serious radicalism because they fear reinforcing the Labour mythology: that any reduction in spending, irrespective of how it is found, must prove an underlying Tory hatred of the NHS and, therefore, of the people it serves. This is utter nonsense, but nonsense that has so crippled the Tories that in one whole election campaign – 2001 – they tried not to mention the NHS at all. One hopes the Government has noted the near-death of the Labour Party, and the near-certainty that it will be at least another five years before Britain has a credible Opposition, and will now take reform of the NHS to a hitherto unimagined level. We are in this mess not least because of the refusal by all governments over the past 30 years to think strategically. Lord Fowler, one of the best health ministers Britain has ever had, warned colleagues in the mid-Eighties that the growth in the ageing population would put impossible strains on the NHS. Watch | Simon Stevens: Economic tailspin from Brexit 'severe concern' for NHS 00:31 Large amounts of beds and resources are devoted to elderly people in hospital because there is no place for them in a care home, and they can no longer manage at home. This is scandalous and, next to the dismal state of Britain’s defences, the present Government’s greatest dereliction. An insurance system must be introduced now to provide residential care for the elderly. It would offer dignity for them and take a huge burden off the NHS. A contingency fund must be established for those for whom an insurance scheme would come too late and who lack the resources to fund themselves. There is no way round this in a supposedly civilised society. The NHS must also review what it provides. Except in shocking cases of disfigurement, cosmetic surgery should be a luxury and the province of the private sector. And while I deplore the unhappiness of those men who identify as women, and vice-versa, there can be no obligation on the state to fund such options in the way it funds, say, treatment for cancer. The insurers of boy racers who mangle themselves in car accidents should be made to pay for their treatment. And those who engage in benefit tourism to come to Britain for NHS treatment should be invoiced for it, and pursued until they pay. If such treatment is not life-saving, it should be refused. The big earners 2015/16 | Monthly rates paid for NHS trust interim managers The Government needs to encourage private medicine and especially private GP services, if necessary through tax breaks: our European neighbours spend far more in the private sector than we do, which is one reason why their health services are not collapsing. Wealthy people should be encouraged to use the private sector. Finally, the Government needs to ask whether the NHS needs such a vast direct labour force. Much non-medical work could be contracted out to private sector companies whose staff management and manpower might be more efficient. The ageing population will demand more doctors and nurses, but everything else should be up for review. The NHS boasts that it has cut managers since the late 1998.

"Perfect timing," says Ayers, 32, of Athens, Ga. An Amazon shopper had complained that one of Ayers's products wasn't authentic. Ayers disputed the claim and provided receipts to back it up. But about two weeks had passed by the time his account was reinstated, and the downtime cost him sales. "I wasn't doing anything shady," says Ayers, who estimates he'll sell $500,000 worth of goods on Amazon this year. "It seems there are a lot of Amazon sellers who aren't doing anything wrong and are getting punished. There's an arbitrary nature to it." He has plenty of company. Attendees at an annual gathering of online merchants in Seattle on Friday said merchants are "living in fear" that they'll be kicked off the site. Most Amazon customers probably don't realize that almost half of the items sold on the site come from third-party merchants. That means a set of kitchen knives could have been plucked from a Walmart bargain rack in Nebraska by a mom-and-pop business looking to profit from a little retail arbitrage. Amazon relies on more than two million merchants like Ayers to keep its website and warehouses stocked with an assortment of goods no brick-and-mortar store could ever match. But the company's relentless focus on customer service means that when Amazon receives a complaint, it's the shopper - not the merchant - who typically gets the benefit of the doubt. "We treat sellers like customers," said Erik Fairleigh, a company spokesman. "The perfect seller experience is seamless self-service that allows the seller to independently run their business. If a seller needs to contact us, we have Seller Support associates available 24 hours a day worldwide, including support for urgent issues with a response in an hour or less." But Ayers and other sellers maintain Amazon is too quick to suspend its business partners and too slow to review their appeals, cutting off their primary revenue source, leaving them saddled with inventory. That ties up thousands of dollars in Amazon accounts until the issues get resolved, they say. So many are reducing their reliance on Amazon by placing some merchandise on other sites, including eBay, one of Amazon's chief rivals. The tension between Amazon and its sellers was on full display at the Seattle conference, which attracted 100-plus merchants and vendors. The suspension process has given rise to a cottage industry of lawyers, former Amazon seller account investigators and veteran online merchants who charge up to $3,000 to help sellers navigate the mysterious suspension appeal process. Consultant Lesley Hensell was scheduled to lead an afternoon session on "hot button suspensions." She and her partner noticed the business of helping sellers deal with Amazon suspensions pick up a year ago, and they have a 30-person team working on it. "Amazon is getting harder and harder to persuade," she says. "There's no consistency. It's all by email with different people handling the case. This isn't how business partners are supposed to act."

"I thought, 'Oh Crap. Perfect timing,"' says Ayers, 32, of Athens, Georgia. An Amazon shopper had complained that one of Ayers' products wasn't authentic. Ayers disputed the claim and provided receipts to back it up. But about two weeks had passed by the time his account was reinstated, and the downtime cost him sales. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "I wasn't doing anything shady," says Ayers, who estimates he'll sell $500,000 worth of goods on Amazon this year. "It seems there are a lot of Amazon sellers who aren't doing anything wrong and are getting punished. There's an arbitrary nature to it." He has plenty of company. Attendees at an annual gathering of online merchants in Seattle on Friday said merchants are "living in fear" that they'll be kicked off the site. Most Amazon customers probably don't realize that almost half of all items sold on the site come from third-party merchants. That means a set of kitchen knives could have been plucked from a Walmart bargain rack in Nebraska by a mom-and-pop business looking to profit from a little retail arbitrage. Amazon relies on more than two million merchants like Ayers to keep its website and warehouses stocked with an assortment of goods no brick-and-mortar store could ever match. But the company's relentless focus on customer service means that when Amazon receives a complaint it's the shopper -- not the merchant -- who typically gets the benefit of the doubt. "We treat sellers like customers," said Erik Fairleigh, a company spokesman. "The perfect seller experience is seamless self-service that allows the seller to independently run their business. If a seller needs to contact us, we have Seller Support associates available hours a day worldwide, including support for urgent issues with a response in an hour or less. Sellers have available to them at any time many comprehensive tools and services to reach and interact with our Seller Support team." But Ayers and other sellers maintain Amazon is too quick to suspend its business partners and too slow to review their appeals, cutting off their primary revenue source, leaving them saddled with inventory. That ties up thousands of dollars in Amazon accounts until the issues get resolved, they say. As a result, many are reducing their reliance on Amazon by placing some of their merchandise on other sites, including EBay Inc., one of Amazon's chief rivals. "Any complaint from any buyer or manufacturer can result in a seller suspension, and their livelihood stops," says CJ Rosenbaum, a New York attorney who says he's helped hundreds of sellers navigate the suspension appeal process in the past several months. "Mom-and-pop businesses can't make the mortgage and big businesses can't make payroll." Sellers say the suspension process is guilty-until-proven-innocent, forcing them to prove complaints are unwarranted or pledging to make improvements to get selling privileges reinstated. They also say that the e-mail appeal process wastes time and energy, and they often field the same request, often vague, seeking additional information without specifying what's wanted. The tension between Amazon and its sellers was on full display at the Seattle conference, which attracted 100-plus merchants and vendors. The suspension process has given rise to a cottage industry of lawyers, former Amazon seller account investigators and veteran online merchants who charge up to $3,000 to help sellers navigate the mysterious suspension appeal process. Consultant Lesley Hensell was scheduled to lead an afternoon session on "hot button suspensions." She and her partner noticed the business of helping sellers deal with Amazon suspensions pick up a year ago, and they now have a 30-person team working on it. "Amazon is getting harder and harder to persuade," she says. "There's no consistency. It's all by email with different people handling the case. This isn't how business partners are supposed to act. If I'm your business partner and you're unhappy with me, I'd hope I could speak with you about it." Amazon is clear in its seller policies that its rules can change at any time, taking effect immediately. Sellers are informed about changes via e-mail and other notifications sent on the platforms they use to manage their accounts. Amazon's view of the perfect customer experience is one that is completely automated with no person-to-person interaction. Someone orders something online, and it arrives on their doorstep. Any additional interaction -- a complaint or a return -- is considered friction that indicates a problem. Sellers maintain this policy is unrealistic and fails to recognize that some shoppers lodge unwarranted complaints to get refunds when they are simply having buyers' remorse. EBay has grappled with similar complaints from its marketplace sellers and last year relaxed its rules in an effort to make amends. Consultants for online merchants encourage sellers to get inventory on EBay and other platforms so their business isn't crippled by an Amazon suspension. That's what happened to Emad Abukheit, who spent several years building a $2 million business selling mostly health and beauty products on Amazon before his account was suspended in March. Customers complained that products they purchased were expired, damaged or not as advertised. He submitted a plan of action to improve operations in his North Carolina warehouse, but Amazon kept requesting additional information and saying his account remained under review without making a decision. He hired Chris McCabe, who once investigated sellers for Amazon and now runs a business helping sellers get reinstated. Frustrated with the lack of response from Amazon beyond generic e-mails telling him his account was under review, Abukheit filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau in April. About two weeks later, he received an email from Amazon that his account would not be reinstated. » Next page...

It has become an alarming platform for bullying, and the network is disturbingly reluctant to intervene. It is a haven for scammers and spammers. And, perhaps most concerning of all, it has become an incredible driver of misinformation. A single post on Facebook can go “viral” in a matter of minutes, receiving hundreds or thousands of shares. In some cases, that’s great — law enforcement can employ the public’s help in catching a dangerous fugitive, for example. But in many cases, that can also be bad, because the viral posts contain misinformation that does more harm than good. Locally, an incident on Aug. 17 was a perfect example of that. As several schools went into “soft lockdown” — whatever that is; principals say that is a term they don’t use, but it’s a term that was widely distributed, including in a post by yours truly — rumors flared throughout the community. The lockdown decision was made after the Scott County Sheriff’s Department issued a “BOLO” — be on the lookout — for a burglary suspect the previous evening. The Scott County man, whose name has not been released by authorities, allegedly stole several guns and his whereabouts were unknown. On Wednesday morning, the Sheriff’s Department spoke with principals at each school to alert them to the situation. The result was a play-it-safe approach: schools heightened their security efforts as a safeguard. And then Facebook blew up. There are some who feel that last week’s response to the burglary was an over-reaction. Burglary suspects are routinely unaccounted for — even suspects who have stolen guns. But, to be fair, we still don’t know the exact details of the burglary or the suspect; the Sheriff’s Department has been mum, except to say Wednesday afternoon that students were believed to be safe. In a short conversation with the Independent Herald, detective Abby Duncan said that there was believed to be no direct threat to any school. And while burglary suspects are routinely unaccounted for, schools going into lockdown mode because of various threats is also a relatively routine occurrence. It’s safe to say that never before has a lockdown generated as much local anxiety on Facebook as last week’s did. There are several reasons for that — not the least of which is the number of people affected, since several schools were on lockdown. But another reason, and an unfortunate one to say the least, is misinformation that was being spread on Facebook. There were stories of gunmen threatening schools, stories of windows being covered and students being ushered into safe rooms — the stuff of Hollywood scripts. And let’s be clear: there’s nothing wrong with concerned parents taking to Facebook to ask questions and seek information. I’m a parent, too. It’s human nature for parents to be concerned about the safety of their children. It also should be said that the spread of misinformation was probably innocent. Concerned parents see a report, don’t realize it’s unfounded, and repeat it. It goes viral, not because the parents did anything wrong, but because they were concerned. The problem, though, is the origination of the misinformation. And the ease of which it can be spread. What might have been minor concerns from many parents turned into major concerns as these reports continued to pop up on Facebook. And here’s the dark truth of the matter: Facebook serves as the perfect platform for people who derive special delight from intentionally starting wild rumors. Two weeks ago, when a suspect in a domestic dispute was shot by an Oneida Police Department officer in the Walmart parking lot as he brandished a realistic-looking air pistol, Facebook became a play-by-play account of what was happening . . . and much of the information was wrong. There were reports of officers being shot, of a gunman roaming the inside of the store, of multiple victims. One Facebook user warned everyone to stay away from Walmart, saying that “multiple people have been shot.” That might have been the innocent and unintended spread of misinformation. Except the same user later posted again, claiming to have seen the entire ordeal play out first-hand and adding that the suspect had held the gun to the victim’s head as cops arrived on the scene. That last part may or may not have been true, but if the Facebook user was close enough to see the suspect allegedly holding a gun to his wife’s head, they were certainly close enough to see the only person shot was the suspect himself — not “multiple people,” as was earlier claimed. Unfortunately, that report quickly gained traction on Facebook. Even when the spread of misinformation is unintended, it can have dangerous consequences. Several months ago, a Facebook user shared a photo of a Helenwood man, saying that the man had abused a small child. Hundreds of people shared the photo. The man was instantly branded a child-abuser. The problem? He was not charged with a crime, and still hasn’t been. (For the record, the Sheriff’s Department says the case is still under investigation, but no charges have been filed.) Another case-in-point came just last month, when a driver in Knoxville entered the wrong side of Interstate 40 and collided head-on with a semi-truck driver. Both were killed instantly. The grisly crash scene became a raging fire that had to be allowed to burn itself out. Almost instantly, rumors began spreading that the wrong-way driver wound up on the wrong side of the interstate because he was playing Pokemon Go — the augmented reality game that took the nation by storm this summer — on his phone. Despite multiple media reports from Knoxville saying there was no indication that the driver was playing the popular video game, the rumors took hold. When the daughter of the truck driver posted photos of the accident scene to Facebook and said that her father had died because the driver of the other vehicle was playing Pokemon Go, her post was shared more than 136,000 times. In reality, investigators say that wrong-way crashes are far too common on that particular stretch of I-40, where there are multiple interchanges that authorities say can easily confuse drivers. Nevertheless, the Pokemon Go rumor spread like wildfire, eventually resulting in a Snopes.com page debunking it. None of us are immune to the innocent spread of misinformation on Facebook. I’ve done it, and you probably have, too, if you’ve been around Facebook long enough. If there’s a lesson to be learned, it’s that sometimes it’s best to carefully consider the information in quesiton before hitting the “share” button. • Ben Garrett is Independent Herald editor.

Tampa Bay Times: Subscribe Make Payment/Renew Missed Paper Vacation Stop E-Paper TBO: Advertise Contact Us AUTOS HOMES JOBS Friday, Jan 06, 2017 74° Home Local News US & World Sports Entertainment Radar Weather Celebrity Throwback Thursday: Local millennials remember Tampa’s ‘David D TV’ By Christopher Spata | TBO.com Published: August 25, 2016 Updated: August 25, 2016 at 11:07 AM David Dodd Throwback Thursday: Local millennials remember Tampa’s ‘David D TV’ Local millennials remember David D TV as that show that aired on WFTS-TV* after Captain Planet and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the ‘90s. It followed a guy with a perfect surfer cut and a single earring, David D, and his mildly mischievous Muppet-looking friend, Smedley. It would have completely faded into the past if not for someone quietly posting several episodes online a few years ago. They went mostly unnoticed until a recent Reddit post about David D TV started getting attention from people excited to find the old episodes available online. “I’ve been trying to figure out this show’s name for years,” wrote user DanglesWangles on the Reddit post. “I only remember it because they went to a Walmart that was right next to my house growing up.” Those YouTube videos reveal a show that’s profoundly weird, Tampa-centric and maybe the most 1990s thing ever. It’s also strangely watchable, with a subtle humor and a world where nobody questions a guy whose roommate is a puppet. “Most shows with puppets, like Sesame Street, they bring the humans into the puppet world. We did the opposite,” said David Dodd, who played David D. Dodd enjoyed a local celebrity status during that run, making public appearances at events like Bucs Fan Fest and marching band competitions. “I remember doing an appearance at Petland where there was a line of hundreds of people wrapped around the building,” said Dodd, now 50. “Whenever I’m in Tampa and I’m doing something around people who are 10 or 20 years younger than I am … I’ll be in line for a beer and some guy will go, ‘Hey! You’re the guy with the puppet.’ “ The show started as part of the Fox Kids Club in 1992 as public service-oriented bumpers between cartoons. When the station changed network affiliations in 1994, David D TV was turned into a half-hour series for Saturday mornings and ran until around 2000. “I remember it as the essence of Florida in the ‘90s,” said filmmaker Thomas Nudi, 27, who grew up watching the show in Bradenton. “It’s full of orange and pink neon, and everyone had Flock of Seagulls haircuts. Seeing it again brought back all the feels. I grew up in a generation that was the fade out of local stations doing narrative TV. Nothing like that show exists now or ever will again. It’s a piece of local history.” David and Smedley’s adventures usually took place around Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater because actual sets would have cost more than the show’s “shoestring” budget allowed. They crash a David Hasselhoff fan convention at Tradewinds Resort in the episode “Vacation Nightmare.” In “Movie Flakes,” they eat cereal in their pajamas inside St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport, though it’s unclear why. Busch Gardens stands in for ancient Egypt in “Mummies From Mars,” though a sign in the background reading “restrooms” kills the illusion. “Stuck at the Mall” takes place entirely in the Tyrone Square Mall parking lot, where Dave and Smedley become trapped when their shoes stick to discarded chewing gum. Dodd, whose on-air name is David Jones, has spent the last 21 years hosting what’s billed as one of the nation’s longest-running morning radio shows, The Jones and Crane Show, on Sarasota’s WSRZ-FM 107.9. Locals are more likely to recognize him from his commercial and infomercial work, specifically the ubiquitous Sunsetter Retractable Awnings commercials that run every summer in the area. He credits David D TV, though, for giving him a start in television. “It was a crash course. Like going to college,” he said. “When it went away, the station manager said, ‘The sales team sells news now,’ and this just isn’t making money. We were heartbroken.” Todd Coyle, a St. Petersburg native who provided the voice and puppeteering for Smedley, now runs a costume business outside of Los Angeles. That career path sprang from his work on David D TV, where he created the Xena: Warrior Princess costumes that David and Smedley wear at Al Lopez Park in the episode “Xenaphobia.” “It was like $50 per show. If we needed an extra character, we’d just get our friends to be in it, or ask someone off the street,” Coyle said. “We’d write the shows ourselves, make the props ourselves. We did a whole episode in a mall parking lot. I don’t know if you’d call that stupid, or creative or desperate.” Even now, he struggles to explain the show’s premise. “There’s a guy and a puppet and they live in a house. We had nothing more concrete than that. Once in awhile we’d think, ‘Who are these people and why are they living in this house?’ and we couldn’t explain it, so we just went with it.” “It was so much fun to hear the recognition when you told people what you did,” he said. “When it’s over, you miss it. I’m not saying it’s the same exactly, but it gives you a little insight into how a famous actor feels when his career is over and nobody knows who he is anymore.” Coyle said he still has one of the Smedley puppets in a box in the attic, though he’s scared to look at it for fear it has probably disintegrated.

Mother thrashes, tries to strangle infant son Andhra Pradesh grapples to fulfil job promiseKrishna Prasad The AP government has been struggling to fulfil its ambitious poll promise of ‘one job per family’ despite roping in major multi-national companies. | TNN | Aug 27, 2016, 08.13 AM IST Representative image HYDERABAD: The AP government has been struggling to fulfil its ambitious poll promise of 'one job per family' despite roping in major multi-national companies. After two-and-a-half years in the government, TDP could provide not more than 50,000 jobs as against the pre-poll promise of creating 10 lakh jobs in the manufacturing sector. Some of the major investments received in the last two years include Walmart, Dalas, Sun Edition, Ashok Leyland, Bharat Forge, Essel Group, Suzlon Energy and Linde Group. However, they have not yet started their operations in the state. The AP government had set a target of developing 5,000 startups and 100 technology incubators by 2019. Introduction of the new industrial policy to bring down the approval time for business to an average of 14 days in 2016-17, compared to an average of 21days in 2015-16, had succeeded in attracting foreign direct investment into the state. The government could convince 41international companies and 328 Indian companies to make an investment of about Rs 4,800 crore in AP. But, only US-based Mondelez International (Cadbury) opened its manufacturing unit in Chittoor district. "Many of these units are still bargaining for more incentives and free infrastructure. Some of them are even threatening to move to other states. These issues will be resolved at a higher level," said a senior official in the investment and infrastructure department. The companies, which entered into MoUs with the state government, are still finding it difficult to get the necessary infrastructure, including power, water and road connectivity. There are several complaints over lack of cooperation at the ground level resulting in the delay. Thinking that tourism will be the next big thing, the AP government also entered into agreements with 16 companies that agreed to invest Rs 4,000 crore. It also released the new tourism policy, which projected creation of 50,000 jobs every year. But in reality, none of the projects has started. In the last 26 months, only 2,000 jobs have been created in the tourism sector. The state government also launched a Skill Development Corporation to train local talent in various skills. As many as 90,000 people were imparted 'employability' skills. Interestingly, most of them refused the offers saying that the salary offered was meagre. Only 20,000 people took up jobs in the construction sector. AP ranks 10 in the list of unemployment rate in the country. About 30 per cent of people in the state do not have jobs in urban areas. The TDP stormed to power in the May 2014 elections after it promised jobs to all unemployed in the state. It had also promised unemployment allowance.

Past the $21 car valet, through the incense-scented lobby, at the head of a well-appointed conference-room table, sat the tourism minister of Mexico. His mission: to counter the rhetoric of Republican nominee Donald Trump. Or, as Minister Enrique de la Madrid put it: “To set the record straight.” The record between the U.S. and Mexico, as de la Madrid sees it, is one of shared prosperity and of ties so tight that both countries — not just Mexico — would lose if politics managed to tear them apart. “Six million jobs in the U.S. are dependent on the trade with Mexico. Twenty-eight states of the 50 states in the United States have Mexico as a No. 1 or No. 2 most relevant trading partner,” he said. “Mexico is a very important market for many investments of U.S. companies —firms like Wal-Mart, firms like Citigroup, firms like American Airlines, that are doing very good business because they are selling goods and services into Mexico.” If the U.S. were to halt trade or raise tariffs, de la Madrid warned, its leaders should “ask Americans if they want to pay higher prices for their cars, higher prices for their clothes, higher prices for their food.” “That’s the reality, and the whole story must be told,” he said. “That’s what we feel is our obligation — because, of course, it affects us, but it would also affect you.” He was more than comfortable rattling off the numbers. But what de la Madrid didn’t want to do was tackle Trump’s positions. He maintained he didn’t want to talk about Trump at all — though publicists who scheduled his local media interviews specifically pitched an anti-Trump message. “We’re not against anyone. We’re just against bad ideas,” de la Madrid insisted. “I’m not here to discuss Mr. Trump.” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, he added, is also “not very much in favor of trade.” Yet there was no getting away from the fact that Trump — who called some Mexican immigrants “rapists,” who proposes building a “big, beautiful” border wall that Mexico would pay for, who prompted former Mexican President Vicente Fox to call Trump “crazy” and later apologize — has led the alarmed government of a neighboring foreign country to take unusual action. “It is becoming more usual,” de la Madrid said — adding that the government of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto learned, “because of the American campaign, that probably the image of Mexico was not at its best.” Trump’s hard-line promises of building the wall and creating a “deportation force” to round up people who are in the U.S. illegally helped him win the GOP primary. Faced with a far more diverse group of general-election voters, Trump has spent the past few days waffling on his position, saying he was open to “softening” it. He told Fox News on Tuesday he might give some undocumented immigrants legal status if they paid “back taxes” — the sort of stance shared by ex-rivals Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. By Friday, Trump told CNN there would be no legalization. De la Madrid delved into none of that, touching only on the wall. “The one who wants to build it should pay for it,” he said. “Americans should be more worried about building better schools. They should be more worried about building better infrastructure. They should be more worried about building better housing. The last thing they need to be worried about is building new walls.” Over the past few months, de la Madrid — the son of former Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid — said he’s visited New York, San Diego and Phoenix, and Cleveland and Philadelphia, the cities that hosted the presidential conventions. In Miami, he planned to meet city Mayor Tomas Regalado and the Doral City Council. He had already spoken to Bush’s son, Jeb Bush Jr. On Thursday, the elder Bush told a New York radio station that Trump’s immigration-policy shift was “abhorrent.” De la Madrid said he feels “challenged” by the U.S. campaign — and is happy to react by offering “information.” Could his PR campaign put the relationship with a future President Donald Trump at risk? Said de la Madrid: “I hope not.” ——— ©2016 Miami Herald Visit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. _____ Topics: g000362665,g000221937,g000362669,g000226000,g000362695,g000220155,g000065577,g000220201,g000362661,g000066164 Subscribe to NewsOK's Breaking News We will send you breaking news notifications as news happens, locally or wherever.

Dykes and Barbara Eisenhardt said they were surprised when they found out the site plan included an entrance and exit on Wild Wing Boulevard. “Wild Wing Boulevard is very heavily traveled with people going to the golf course and all of the neighborhoods and developments in the Wild Wing area,” Eisenhardt said. “I think it not only creates congestion, but also dangers as people are trying to hurry to cross the road or make the light and somebody is trying to get into the ALDI,” Dykes said. “It’s just ripe for accidents I believe.” Conway Planning Director Adam Emrick said the planning commission’s goal is to minimize conflict when planning ingress and egress. He said a Wild Wing Boulevard entrance will be safer than having an entrance on U.S. 501 because that would be too close to the traffic light. He said a 2007 South Carolina Department of Transportation traffic study for the feasibility of the traffic light at Wild Wing Boulevard and U.S. 501 allows for an entrance and exit on Wild Wing Boulevard for whatever commercial development would go into the land on that corner. Dykes got a copy of the study and he said he think it is outdated. “It was before Walmart was built,” he said. “It was before all of the expansion that has occurred at Coastal Carolina and Horry Georgetown Tech.” However, Emrick said the study accounted for the full development of Wild Wing, which he said is only at about 50 percent completion right now. He added there is no need to do another study now or change the design because it accommodates all of that residential development along with development of all four corners of commercial properties. Dykes said he thinks safety is at risk with the use of a 2007 study in 2016. “I think it is inappropriate,” he said. “I think it is a bad decision. I think it represents bad planning. I think the city needs to change their mind on this and go back and re-evaluate it.” Now, Dykes and Eisenhardt are working together to get more people to ask the city to rethink the plan. However, Eisenhardt said she thinks they were not properly notified of how to express their opinions throughout the planning process. She said she was never notified of the public hearing for the ordinance involving annexation and rezoning of the property on the Conway City Council agenda in July. Eisenhardt also said she found out the proposed ALDI for that same site would be on a Conway Board of Zoning Appeals agenda from a friend who has property closer to it. “It felt to me like they were trying to somehow circumvent the notice that we would liked to have had for all the neighborhoods here so that we could participate in the decision making for our own community,” she said. Emrick said only properties within 200 feet receive notice by mail. He said a sign was posted about the public hearing in July on the ALDI site along U.S. 501 and another has been posted for the Board of Zoning Appeals meeting, which was rescheduled from Thursday to Sept. 15 at 5:30 p.m., at city hall. He said the opportunity for public comment passed with the zoning. Emrick said the entrance and exit is not approved yet and that the technical review committee has been going back and forth with the developer to finalize the plan. However, he said he does not expect it to change because it has been planned this way since the SCDOT traffic study and he does not know where else it could logically go. “It was very disappointing that they were saying it’s a done deal,” Eisenhardt said. Emrick said the board of zoning appeals will not be discussing the entrance and exit at its meeting because he said the request is in regard to adding parking spaces. Eisenhardt said she thinks the parking spaces should be used as a bargaining tool to get the developer to change the entrance and exit location, but Emrick said that is not possible.

Discount retailer Dollar General said Thursday that it's cutting prices on hundreds of items across 2,000 stores. The strategy follows a similar path set forth by other chains such as Wal-Mart, Kroger and Trader Joe's. Cutting costs to get people in the door is a time-tested strategy, but it could mean slimmer margins for both grocery stores and suppliers. As it turns out, that could be a risky move. “Because you will not out-Wal-Mart Wal-Mart,” supermarket analyst David Livingston said. In fact, Wal-Mart recently announced its own plan to slash prices even more on high-traffic items, such as fresh fruit and laundry detergent.

(Credit: Reuters/Samantha Sais) This piece originally appeared on TomDispatch. At the federal courthouse, Ignacio Sarabia asks the magistrate judge, Jacqueline Rateau, if he can explain why he crossed the international boundary between the two countries without authorization. He has already pleaded guilty to the federal misdemeanor commonly known as “illegal entry” and is about to receive a prison sentence. On either side of him are eight men in the same predicament, all still sunburned, all in the same ripped, soiled clothes they were wearing when arrested in the Arizona desert by agents of the U.S. Border Patrol. Once again, the zero tolerance border enforcement program known as Operation Streamline has unfolded just as it always does here in Tucson, Ariz. Close to 60 people have already approached the judge in groups of seven or eight, their heads bowed submissively, their bodies weighed down by shackles and chains around wrists, waists and ankles. The judge has handed out the requisite prison sentences in quick succession — 180 days, 60 days, 90 days, 30 days. On and on it goes, day-in, day-out. Like so many meals served in fast-food restaurants, 750,000 prison sentences of this sort have been handed down since Operation Streamline was launched in 2005. This mass prosecution of undocumented border crossers has become so much the norm that one report concluded it is now a “driving force in mass incarceration” in the United States. Yet it is but a single program among many overseen by the massive U.S. border enforcement and incarceration regime that has developed during the last two decades, particularly in the post-9/11 era. Sarabia takes a half-step forward. “My infant is four months old,” he tells the judge in Spanish. The baby was, he assures her, born with a heart condition and is a U.S. citizen. They have no option but to operate. This is the reason, he says, that “I’m here before you.” He pauses. “I want to be with my child, who is in the United States.” It’s clear that Sarabia would like to gesture emphatically as he speaks, but that’s difficult, thanks to the shackles that constrain him. Rateau fills her coffee cup as she waits for his comments to be translated into English. Earlier in April 2016, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, still in the heat of his primary campaign, stated once again that he would build a massive concrete border wall towering 30 (or, depending on the moment, 55) feet high along the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexican border. He would, he insisted, force Mexico to pay for the $8 billion to $10 billion barrier. Repeatedly throwing such red meat into the gaping jaws of nativism, he has over these last months also announced that he would create a major “deportation force,” repeatedly sworn that he would ban Muslims from entering the country (a position that he regularly revises), and most recently, that he would institute an “extreme vetting” process for foreign nationals arriving in the United States. In June 2015, when he rode a Trump Tower escalator into the presidential campaign, among his initial promises was the building of a “great” and “beautiful” wall on the border. (“And no one builds walls better than me, believe me. I will do it very inexpensively. I will have Mexico pay for that wall.”)  As he pulled that promise out of a hat with a magician’s flair, the actual history of the border disappeared. From then on in Election 2016, there was just empty desert and Donald Trump. Suddenly, there hadn’t been a bipartisan government effort over the last quarter-century to put in place an unprecedented array of walls, detection systems and guards for that southern border. In those years, the number of Border Patrol agents had, in fact, quintupled from 4,000 to more than 21,000, while Customs and Border Protection became the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country with more than 60,000 agents. The annual budget for border and immigration enforcement went from $1.5 to $19.5 billion, a more than 12-fold increase. By 2016, federal government funding of border and immigration enforcement added up to $5 billion more than that for all other federal law enforcement agencies combined. Operation Streamline, a cornerstone program in the “Consequence Delivery System,” part of a broader Border Patrol deterrence strategy for stopping undocumented immigration, is just one part of a vast enforcement-incarceration-deportation machine. The program is as no-nonsense as its name suggests. It’s not The Wall, but it embodies the logic of the wall: either you crossed “illegally” or you didn’t. It doesn’t matter why, or whether you lost your job, or if you’ve had to skip meals to feed your kids. It doesn’t matter if your house was flooded or the drought dried up your fields. It doesn’t matter if you’re running for your life from drug cartel gunmen or the very army and police forces that are supposed to protect you. This system was what Ignacio Sarabia faced a few months ago in a Tucson court.  His tragedy is one that plays out so many times daily a mere seven blocks from where I live. Before I tell you how the judge responded to his plea, it’s important to understand Sarabia’s journey and that of so many thousands like him who end up in this federal courthouse day after day. As he pleads to be with his newborn son, his voice cracking with emotion, his story catches the already Trumpian-style of border enforcement — both the pain and suffering it has caused, and the strategy and massive build-up behind it — in ways that the campaign rhetoric of both parties and the reporting on it doesn’t. As reporters chase their tails attempting to explain Trump’s wild and often unfounded claims and declarations, the on-the-ground border reality goes unreported. Indeed, one of the greatest “secrets” of the 2016 election campaign (though it should be common knowledge) is that the border wall already exists. It has for years and the fingerprints all over it aren’t Donald Trump’s but the Clintons’, both Bill’s and Hillary’s. The wall that already exists Twenty-one years before Trump’s wall-building promise (and seven years before the 9/11 attacks), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began to replace the chain link fence that separated Nogales, Sonora, in Mexico from Nogales, Ariz., in the United States with a wall built of rusty landing mats from the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars. Although there had been various half-hearted attempts at building border walls throughout the twentieth century, this was the first true effort to build a barrier of what might now be called Trumpian magnitude. That rusty, towering wall snaked through the hills and canyons of northern Sonora and southern Arizona forever deranging a world that, given cross-border familial and community ties, then considered itself one. At the time, who could have known that the strategy the first wall embodied would still be the model for today’s massive system of exclusion. In 1994, the threat wasn’t “terrorism.” In part, the call for more hardened, militarized borders came in response, among other things, to a never-ending drug war.  It also came from U.S. officials who anticipated the displacement of millions of Mexicans after the implementation of the new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which, ironically, was aimed at eliminating barriers to trade and investment across North America. And the expectations of those officials proved well justified. The ensuing upheavals in Mexico, as analyst Marco Antonio Velázquez Navarrete explained to me, were like the aftermath of a war or natural disaster. Small farmers couldn’t compete against highly subsidized U.S. agribusiness giants like Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland. Mexican small business owners were bankrupted by the likes of Walmart, Sam’s Club and other corporate powers. Mining by foreign companies extended across vast swaths of Mexico, causing territorial conflicts and poisoning the land. The unprecedented and desperate migration that followed came up against what might be considered the other side of the Clinton doctrine of open trade: walls, increased border agents, increased patrolling and new surveillance technologies meant to cut off traditional crossing spots in urban areas like El Paso, San Diego, Brownsville and Nogales. “This administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders,” President Bill Clinton said in 1996. “We are increasing border controls by fifty percent.” Over the next 20 years, that border apparatus would expand exponentially in terms of personnel, resources and geographic reach, but the central strategy of the 1990s (labeled “Prevention Through Deterrence”) remained the same. The ever-increasing border policing and militarization funneled desperate migrants into remote locations like the Arizona desert where temperatures can soar to 120 degrees in the summer heat. The first U.S. border strategy memorandum in 1994 predicted the tragic future we now have. “Illegal entrants crossing through remote, uninhabited expanses of land and sea along the border can find themselves in mortal danger,” it stated. Twenty years later, more than 6,000 remains have been found in the desert borderlands of the United States. Hundreds of families continue to search for disappeared loved ones. The Colibri Center for Human Rights has records for more than 2,500 missing people last seen crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. In other words, that border has become a graveyard of bones and sadness. Despite all the attention given to the wall and the border this election season, neither the Trump nor Clinton campaigns have mentioned “Prevention Through Deterrence,” nor the subsequent border deaths. Not once. The same goes for the establishment media that can’t stop talking about Trump’s wall. There has been little or no mention of what border groups have long called a “humanitarian crisis” of deaths that have increased five-fold over the last decade, thanks, in part, to a wall that already exists. (If the people dying were Canadians or Europeans, attention would, of course, be paid.) Although wall construction began during Bill Clinton’s administration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) built most of the approximately 700 miles of fencing after the Secure Fence Act of 2006 was passed. At the time, Senator Hillary Clinton voted in favor of that Republican-introduced bill, along with 26 other Democrats. “I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in,” she commented at one 2015 campaign event, “and I do think you have to control your borders.” The 2006 wall-building project was expected to be so environmentally destructive that homeland security chief Michael Chertoff waived 37 environmental and cultural laws in the name of national security. In this way, he allowed Border Patrol bulldozers to desecrate protected wilderness and sacred land. “Imagine a bulldozer parking in your family graveyard, turning up bones,” Chairman Ned Norris, Jr., of the Tohono O’odham Nation (a Native American tribe whose original land was cut in half by the U.S. border) told Congress in 2008. “This is our reality.” With a price tag of, on average, $4 million a mile, these border walls, barriers and fences have proven to be one of the costliest border infrastructure projects undertaken by the United States. For private border contractors, on the other hand, it’s the gift that just keeps on giving. In 2011, for example, the DHS granted Kellogg, Brown and Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, one of our “warrior corporations,” a $24.4 million upkeep contract. In Tucson in early August, Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence looked out over a sea of red “Make America Great Again” caps and t-shirts and said, “We will secure our border. Donald Trump will build that wall.”  He would be met with roaring applause, even though his statement made no sense at all. Should Trump actually win, how could he build something that already exists? Indeed, for all practical purposes, the “Great Wall” that Trump talks about may, by January 2017, be as antiquated as the Great Wall of China given the new high-tech surveillance methods now coming on the market. These are being developed in a major way and on a regular basis by a booming border techno-surveillance industry. The 21st-century border is no longer just about walls; it’s about biometrics and drones. It’s about a “layered approach to national security,” given that, as former Border Patrol Chief Mike Fisher has put it, “the international boundary is no longer the first or last line of defense, but one of many.” Hillary Clinton’s promise of “comprehensive immigration reform” — to be introduced within 100 days of her entering the Oval Office — is a much more reliable guide than Trump’s wall to our grim immigration future. If her bill follows the pattern of previous ones, as it surely will, an increasingly weaponized, privatized, high-tech, layered border regime, increasingly dangerous to future Ignacio Sarabias, will continue to be a priority of the federal government. On the surface, there are important differences between Clinton’s and Trump’s immigration platforms. Trump’s wildly xenophobic comments and declarations are well known, and Clinton claims that she will, among other things, fight for family unity for those forcibly separated by deportation and enact “humane” immigration enforcement. Yet deep down, the policies of the two candidates are far more similar than they might at first appear. Navigating Donald Trump’s borderlands now That April day, only one bit of information about Ignacio Sarabia’s border crossing to reunite with his wife and newborn child was available at the Tucson federal courthouse. He had entered the United States “near Nogales.” Most likely, he circumvented the wall first started during the Clinton administration, like most immigrants do, by making his way through the potentially treacherous canyons that surround that border town. If his experience was typical, he probably didn’t have enough water or food, and suffered some physical woe like large, painful blisters on his feet. Certainly, he wasn’t atypical in trying to reunite with loved ones. After all, more than 2.5 million people have been expelled from the country by the Obama administration, an average annual deportation rate of close to 400,000 people. This was, by the way, only possible thanks to laws signed by Bill Clinton in 1996 and meant to burnish his legacy. They vastly expanded the government’s deportation powers. In 2013 alone, Immigration and Customs Enforcement carried out 72,000 deportations of parents who said that their children were U.S.-born. And many of them are likely to try to cross that dangerous southern border again to reunite with their families. The enforcement landscape Sarabia faced has changed drastically since that first wall was built in 1994. The post-9/11 border is now both a war zone and a showcase for corporate surveillance. It represents, according to Border Patrol agent Felix Chavez,  an “unprecedented deployment of resources,” any of which could have led to Sarabia’s capture. It could have been one of the hundreds of remote video or mobile surveillance systems, or one of the more than 12,000 implanted motion sensors that set off alarms in hidden operational control rooms where agents stare into large monitors. It could have been the spy towers made by the Israeli company Elbit Systems that spotted him, or Predator B drones built by General Atomics, or VADER radar systems manufactured by the defense giant Northrup Grumman that, like so many similar technologies, have been transported from the battlefields of Afghanistan or Iraq to the U.S. border. If the comprehensive immigration reform that Hillary Clinton pledges to introduce as president is based on the already existing bipartisan Senate package, as has been indicated, then this corporate-enforcement landscape will be significantly bolstered and reinforced. There will be 19,000 more Border Patrol agents in roving patrols throughout “border enforcement jurisdictions” that extend up to 100 miles inland. More F-150 trucks and all-terrain vehicles will rumble through and, at times, tear up the desert. There will be more Blackhawk helicopters, flying low, their propellers dusting groups of scattering migrants, many of them already lost in the vast, parched desert. If such a package passes the next Congress, up to $46 billion could be slated to go into more of all of this, including funding for hundreds of miles of new walls. Corporate vendors are salivating at the thought of such a future and in a visible state of elation at homeland security tradeshows across the globe. The 2013 bill that passed in the Senate but failed in the House of Representatives also included a process of legalization for the millions of undocumented people living in the United States. It maintained programs that will grant legal residence for children who came to the United States at a young age and their parents. Odds are that a comprehensive reform bill in a Clinton presidency would be similar. Included in that bill was, of course, funding to bolster Operation Streamline. The Evo A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse in Tucson would then have the capacity to prosecute triple the number of people it deals with at present. After taking a sip from her coffee and listening to the translation of Ignacio Sarabia’s comments, the magistrate judge looks at him and says she’s sorry for his predicament. Personally, I’m mesmerized by his story as I sit on a wooden bench at the back of the court. I have a child the same age as his son. I can’t imagine his predicament. Not once while he talks does it leave my mind that my child might even have the same birthday as his. The judge then looks directly at Sarabia and tells him that he can’t just come here “illegally,” that he has to find a “legal way” (highly unlikely, given the criminal conviction that will now be on his record). “Your son,” she says, “when he gets better, and his mother, can visit you where you are in Mexico.” “Otherwise,” she adds, he’ll be “visiting you in prison” — not exactly, she points out, an appealing scenario: seeing your father in a prison where he will be “locked away for a very long time.” She then sentences the nine men standing side by side in front of her for periods ranging from 60 days to 180 days for the crime of crossing an international border without proper documents. Sarabia receives a 60-day sentence. Next, armed guards from G4S — the private contractor that once employed Omar Mateen (the Pulse nightclub killer) and has a lucrative quarter-billion-dollar border contract with Customs and Border Protection — will transport each of the shackled prisoners to a Corrections Corporation of America private prison in Florence, Ariz. It is there that Sarabia will think about his child’s endangered heart from behind layers of coiled razor wire, while the corporation that runs the prison makes $124 per day for incarcerating him. Indeed, Donald Trump’s United States doesn’t await his presidency. It’s already laid out before us, and one place it’s happening every single day is in Tucson, only seven blocks from my house.

Last week it emerged that there’s a good chance that those soft fibres might have grown beside the Ganges, not the Nile. A string of top American retailers, including Walmart, JCPenney and Target, are investigating whether premium bed sheets and bath towels sold as Egyptian cotton were in fact phoney products supplied by their Indian manufacturer, Welspun. Egyptian cotton, which makes up only 0.3 per cent of global production, is the world’s finest — hand-picked and with unique properties of strength and softness. It attracts a fat premium that is apparently too tempting for some producers to resist exploring by attempting to pull the… Want to read more?

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds E-Edition log in 3 suspects sought in car burglary, use of stolen credit cards Sunday Aug 28, 2016 at 3:31 PM Aug 29, 2016 at 11:29 AM Winter Haven Police Department detectives are asking for the public to help identify suspects who used stolen credit cards and checks from recent vehicle burglaries. The Ledger WINTER HAVEN — Winter Haven Police Department detectives are asking for the public to help identify suspects who used stolen credit cards and checks from recent vehicle burglaries. On Aug. 5, three vehicles parked at the Palm Gardens Nursing Home, 1120 Cypress Gardens Blvd., were burglarized between 9 and 10:50 p.m. Between then and Aug. 9, credit cards and a check were cashed that was stolen from one of the vehicles. The credit cards were used at an ATM at Publix in Winter Haven and a bank ATM in Lake Wales and a Lakeland Wal-Mart. Surveillance footage captured one woman at two locations and two men who used the credit cards. There suspects are seen in two different vehicles — one light colored Dodge four-door truck, 2006 to 2008 with dents near the gas cap area and eye hooks on the back of the truck bed rim. The other vehicle is a gold colored four-door sedan. Anyone with information on the identity of any of the pictured suspects is asked to call Heartland Crime Stoppers at 1-800-226-TIPS (8477). Callers can remain anonymous and could be eligible for a cash reward.

Frank Ocean earns his first No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart with the arrival of Blonde. The set, which was released on Aug. 20, bows atop the list with 276,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending Aug. 25, according to Nielsen Music. Blonde logs the third-largest debut of 2016, behind only the arrivals of Drake’s Views and Beyonce’s Lemonade. Frank Ocean's 'Blonde' Poised for Big Billboard 200 Debut, But 'Endless' Will Be Absent -- Here's Why The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption, which includes traditional album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). The new Sept. 10-dated chart (where Blonde bows at No. 1) will be posted in full to Billboard’s websites on Tuesday, Aug. 30. Of Blonde’s start of 276,000 units, 232,000 were in traditional album sales, while the rest were SEA (44,000 units). Only two albums started bigger than Blonde in 2016: Drake’s Views (1.04 million units earned in its debut frame) and Beyonce’s Lemonade (653,000). Blonde also logs the third-biggest sales start -- behind, again, just Views (852,000 copies sold in its first week) and Lemonade (485,000). Blonde was available exclusively to stream via the Apple Music service and for sale through the iTunes Store (but only as a full album -- none of its tracks were sold a la carte). The songs on the Blonde album generated 65.4 million streams during the week. It was the second-most streamed album on the chart, behind only Drake’s Views, with 67.5 million streams. From Beyonce to Frank Ocean, Breaking Down the Mechanics, and Politics, Behind Streaming Exclusives Blonde arrived two days after Ocean released the long-form video Endless (which many have referred to as a visual album). It is available exclusive to stream via Apple Music. Both releases are Ocean’s first full-length offerings since his debut album, Channel Orange, which came out in 2012. The set debuted and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and sold 131,000 copies in its first week. It was released on July 10, 2012, initially exclusively through iTunes, and a week before its advertised street date of July 17. The bulk of Channel Orange’s first-week sales were digital, though there were some on physical CD, as brick-and-mortar retailers began selling the title mid-week following iTunes’ exclusive launch. Blonde is the third independently distributed No. 1 album in 2016. It follows Blink-182’s California and The Lumineers’ Cleopatra. California was released on Blink-182’s own Viking Wizard Eyes LLC, licensed to BMG and distributed by Alternative Distribution Alliance (ADA). Cleopatra was released on Dualtone Records, and the album was also distributed by ADA. Frank Ocean's Album Is the Straw that Broke Universal Music's Back (and It May Get Him Sued) Blonde is different from both albums in that it was released by Ocean himself directly to Apple and iTunes -- bypassing a traditional distribution company. The last set to reach No. 1 in the same manner was Garth Brooks’ 2013 box set, Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences. The hefty box (six CDs and two DVDs) was issued through Brooks’ Pearl Records and sold exclusively through Walmart stores. It debuted at No. 2 with 164,000 sold, and rose to No. 1 the following week -- for one frame -- selling 146,000. Before Brooks, Pearl Jam’s Backspacer also hit No. 1 (in 2009) without a traditional distributor. The set, which bowed with 189,000 sold, was released on the band’s Monkeywrench label, and initially sold exclusively through Target, iTunes, Pearl Jam’s website and independent retailers. Slightly less than two years earlier, Eagles flew in at No. 1 with its self-released Long Road Out of Eden, exclusively sold through Walmart. It debuted with 711,000 copies sold on the Nov. 17, 2007-dated chart. Back on the new Billboard 200 chart, Drake’s Views holds at No. 2 with 77,000 units (up 9 percent) and the Suicide Squad soundtrack falls from No. 1 to No. 3 with 76,000 units (down 18 percent). Tory Lanez arrives at No. 4 with his debut studio album, I Told You, earning 52,000 units (32,000 in pure album sales). The album follows a pair of top 10-charting singles for Lanez on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where he has reached No. 10 with “Say It” and No. 9 (so far) with the still-building “Luv.” Both cuts are available on the new album, which also starts at No. 2 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Billboard 200 Chart Moves: 'Stranger Things' Soundtrack Makes Strong Debut Lindsey Stirling claims her second top 10 album, as her new Brave Enough launches at No. 5 with 49,000 units (45,000 in traditional album sales). It follows the violinist’s 2014 effort, Shatter Me, which debuted and peaked at No. 2 with 56,000 copies sold in its first week. The new effort also leads the Classical Albums, Classical Crossover Albums and Top Dance/Electronic Albums charts -- her third No. 1 on all three lists. The classical-meets-EDM artist previously led all three charts with Shatter Me and her self-titled debut. Twenty One Pilots’ Blurryface dips 5-6 on the Billboard 200 (33,000 units; down 19 percent), Adele’s 25 rises one rung to No. 7 (28,000 units; down 1 percent), Rihanna’s Anti climbs 9-8 (just over 27,000 units; down 2 percent) and DJ Khaled’s Major Key slips 6-9 (27,000 units; down 19 percent). The original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton closes out the top 10, as it ascends 11-10 with 23,000 units (down 3 percent).

Once you sign up, you expect to pay the same rate every month. Yet that’s not the case at Amazon when you subscribe to its Subscribe & Save program, which automatically refills orders for household staples like instant coffee, napkins or trash bags. Amazon’s subscription program, which was introduced in 2007, lets consumers register to have their favourite consumables delivered regularly — monthly, for example — in exchange for a discount of at least 5 percent off each order. Buried in the e-commerce company’s terms and conditions is that the Subscribe & Save discount is applied to the price of the item at the time that the order is placed. And on Amazon, prices change frequently — including sometimes rising. I learned this the hard way while reviewing an email summary of my Amazon subscriptions. A pack of lint rollers that I had subscribed to for more than two years recently jumped to $18.04 (Rs 1,207) a pack, up from $12.44 (Rs 804) since the last delivery a few months ago, or almost a 50 percent increase. A quick web search revealed other consumers were also surprised by price jumps for Subscribe & Save items. One Amazon customer said he signed up for a $10 (Rs) box of chewing gum and was charged $100 (Rs 6,706) for the same product a month later. In Amazon’s online forums, dozens of people posted about prices of Subscribe & Save items fluctuating, with some calling the program a “bait and switch” subscription scheme. Amazon declined to comment. The company emails people 10 days before a recurring subscription delivery, when it informs customers of a new price of their item so they can change or skip the order. Any sticker shock, analysts said, may be the result of Amazon’s complex pricing system coming into conflict with consumer expectations of a traditional subscription. Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said of Amazon, “I think they’ve violated the psychological concept of a subscription with their customers in changing prices like this. When people think of a subscription, they think of locking in a set cadence of receiving a good.” Amazon’s dynamic pricing system, in which it frequently adjusts item prices based on a sophisticated set of variables like supply and demand, time of day and prices offered by competitors, is the company’s way of making it look as if you are always getting the best deal, Wiesel said. Prices of goods can also fall, of course. But even when prices decline, people need to beware because Amazon’s pricing tends to fluctuate more widely and more frequently than at your local grocery store or Wal-Mart, Wiesel added. In traditional retail, the major price changes typically happen during promotions, he said. To get a preliminary view into whether people can save — or not — with Amazon’s program, I plugged prices of 50 featured Subscribe & Save items into a spreadsheet and looked at their price histories during the previous six months. I compiled the results with the web tool Camel Camel Camel, an Amazon price tracker. Prices of items, including dishwasher soap and toilet bowl cleaner, changed frequently. As often as weekly, prices rose, dipped and rose again like a roller coaster. In extreme cases, prices for items like instant coffee and napkins jumped between 90 and 170 percent. In the end, whether you save money depends on when your subscription order is placed and what items you buy. The downside of buying through Amazon’s subscription program is the lack of predictability. Wiesel noted that it would be tough for Amazon to revise its subscription program to offer items at fixed rates. A majority of sales on Amazon are one-time purchases, and dynamic pricing is fundamental to how the company operates. If, for example, Subscribe & Save prices remained static, those customers could miss out when prices go down for one-time purchases of the same products. If you truly want to save money on Amazon, one approach is to sign up for price alerts on Camel Camel Camel to get an email when a price drops to a desired amount. When that happens, manually reorder your instant coffee or toilet cleaners. Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, an analyst for Forrester Research, said the retailer was probably pushing prices up to test how loyal customers are to products and how much more they are willing to pay for them. Yet the sharp price changes on Subscribe & Save items caught her by surprise. “It doesn’t seem as customer-friendly as Amazon typically is,” she said. “That’s what’s unusual.”   Tweet Go to Top Videos Debt traps threaten Nepal quake victims Girls ears cut off after she protested...

(NYSE: DG) and Dollar Tree Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR) both reported earnings before the markets opened on Thursday. The rivalry is continuing between these two, but there is no clear winner yet. Although Dollar Tree won the Family Dollar acquisition, it wasn’t enough to win the quarter. After the companies reported, analysts took the opportunity to reevaluate how they view these dollar stores, and the consensus was not exactly favorable. 24/7 Wall St. has included highlights from each of the earnings reports, as well as the analysts’ commentary after the fact. Dollar General said that it had $1.08 in earnings per share (EPS) on $5.39 billion in revenue. The consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters had called for $1.09 in EPS on $5.5 billion in revenue. In the same period of last year, Dollar General posted EPS of $0.95 and revenue of $5.1 billion. Same-store sales increased 0.7%, driven primarily by an increase in average transaction amount, offset by a decline in traffic. Same-store sales increases were driven by positive results in the consumables category, accompanied by results in the seasonal category that were flat when compared to the 2015 second quarter, offset by negative results in the apparel and home categories. In terms of guidance for the fiscal year, the company expects to have EPS growth in the range of 10% to 15% and capital expenditures in the range of $580 million to $630 million. The consensus estimates for the full year call for $4.64 in EPS (compared with $3.96 in EPS in the previous year) on $22.41 billion in revenue. Credit Suisse took an on-the-fence perspective and downgraded Dollar General stock to a Neutral rating and lowered its price target to $80 from $85. In the report the firm detailed: Dollar General’s impressive stock run looks to be over sooner than we anticipated, as Q2 results signal a material deceleration in earnings momentum. Bottom line performance was only a touch below consensus, but a comp miss on negative traffic was a clear disappointment. A solid gross margin, expense control and lower tax rate made up for most of the shortfall. The company highlighted weather, food deflation, and SNAP as the largest top line issues, but commentary about intensifying competition from other staples players (likely includes Wal-Mart) was notable and its clear underlying business momentum has slowed. Visibility on a reacceleration is low in our view, even with the company poised to react with its own price cuts. This development adds to the recently introduced incremental wage pressure from new overtime rules, and combined now creates visible downside risk to forward consensus estimates. We expect these headwinds to weigh on the stock, making Outperformance to the staples group unlikely. Merrill Lynch was more positive in its assessment. The brokerage firm maintained a Buy rating with a $95 price target, seeing this decline as an overreaction given that EPS grew by 13% and guidance was maintained. The firm argues that the miss on comps was driven by deflation, a reduction in SNAP, a mild spring and intense promotional environment. However the company did trim its EPS growth forecasts for 2016 to 2018, down to 17%, 12% and 14% respectively. A few other analysts also gave their two cents on Dollar General: BMO downgraded it to Market Perform from Outperform and cut its price target to $78 from $95. Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating and lowered its price target to $89 from $97. Jefferies has a Hold rating and cut its price target to $78 from $96. Raymond James cut its price target to $95 from $105. RBC has an Outperform rating and lowered its price target to $90 from $103. S&P Global maintained a Buy rating with an $85 price target. Telsey Advisory downgraded it to Market Perform from Outperform and cut its price target to $84 from $102. UBS has a Buy rating and lowered its price target to $92 from $101.

On Aug.19, the Minneapolis, Minnesota, retailer said that between 2014 and 2016, Welspun India supplied sheets saying they were made of Egyptian cotton, although they were not. “After an extensive investigation, we recently confirmed that Welspun substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016,” Target said in a statement. Target is contacting customers and offering a refund to those who bought these sheets, it said. The retailer has also removed the product — sold under the Fieldcrest label — from its stores. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” Target added. Some 750,000 such products were impacted over the two-year span, Molly Snyder, a Target spokesperson said in an email. Welspun India is one of the world’s largest textile makers and typically caters to the US, UK and European markets. Target is Welspun India’s second largest customer, behind American retailer Bed, Bath and Beyond, Bloomberg reported. J. C. Penney, Macy’s, Costco, Home Depot and Walmart also buy from Welspun India. The manufacturer also makes towels for the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Other products it makes include bath robes, bath rugs and mats, area rugs, carpets, bed sheets, utility bedding and fashion bedding. Shares of Welspun India fell as much as 20% on the BSE Aug. 22, and hit the lower circuit. The company said in a statement to stock exchanges that it has commissioned an audit. “We have initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor (one of the Big Four) to audit our supply and processes,” said Welspun India, part of the $3 billion Welspun Group, adding the issue is of “highest priority.” The textile maker — and its shareholders — have reason to be worried because it has a huge exposure to the US market. “Every 5th towel sold in the US is manufactured by Welspun India,” according to its annual report. The company depends on exports for 95% of its revenue. It earned a total revenue of Rs4,961 crore for the 2015-16 financial year. Future growth hinges on the US market where the company is targeting the hospitality sector, analysts have said. “Growth potential in the US hospitality and health care channels remains immense as Welspun sales from hospitality channel at $25-30 million (versus market size of $1.5 billion across both these segments). Welspun is in business development phase in its healthcare segment,” analysts Avi Mehta and Sameer Gupta of IIFL Institutional Equities, a brokerage, wrote in a July 27 research note. Welspun India didn’t immediate reply on the specific business impact of Target’s decision.

Other packaging materials produced by Octal are DPET (new benchmark for packaging the world’s first green plastic sheet), Amorphous Polyethylene Terephalate (APET), Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (RPET) sheet and printed PET packages. From a single PET resin and sheet production plant in Salalah in 2006, the company has grown to a four plant operation in Oman, Saudi Arabia and the USA, with a workforce of more than 600 people. This has cemented the company’s international reputation as an export powerhouse of high quality, technologically advanced and environmentally friendly packaging materials with the lowest carbon footprint in 75 countries. Diverse packaging Octal celebrated ten years of successfully driving wholesale conversion of diverse packaging lines to PET with Oman-made proprietary ‘DPET’ that serve the growing demand of Fortune 500 companies. “This celebration marks a 10 year journey of bringing innovation, environmental sustainability and cutting-edge packaging solutions from Oman to the world,” said Octal CEO, Nicholas Barakat. “Octal was conceived from the idea that the sustained growth of clear rigid packaging requires a strategic investment in capacity, proprietary technology and innovation. Our knowledge-based approach has enabled us to become the unanimous choice for reliable, clear rigid packaging with a wide range of applications for foods, liquids, consumer and industrial products,” he added. Over the last decade, Octal has risen to become a global technology leader developing new applications for PET, including injection-molding, high temperature as well as frozen applications and positioning it as the supplier of choice. This technology is critical to increasing the penetration of PET into high volume applications. The company’s unique PET resin and patented DPET sheet have gained critical acclaim for their superior mechanical and optical properties, while delivering the lowest carbon footprint compared to other PET sheet and the polymers for which DPET substitutes. Customer portfolio To date, Octal’s customer portfolio includes some of the largest brands in the region and the world such as Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Almarai, Nestlé and Lulu among many others, which represent a wide array of product end-uses. “Octal’s story of market success is about changing the equation for delivering value downstream, employing disruptive technologies that redefine PET’s capabilities, expanding the universe of applications for which it is the preferred packaging polymer. We only enter markets and businesses where we have a competitive advantage to ensure success driven by technology and product performance. As a result, Octal’s DPET has led the way in the wholesale conversion of entire product categories from other polymers to PET. With our ongoing product innovations, we will continue this trend, targeting large scale conversion opportunities with new performance features,” added William J. Barenberg, chief operating officer and executive vice president at Octal. “We have utilised innovation in material science to create a clear competitive advantage, setting the standard in PET packaging with high quality products that deliver yield and cost reduction benefits, increased productivity for thermoformers, and unmatched environmental advantages. This has translated to higher volumes, enhanced margins and expanded market applications by large multinational brands. We will continue to develop solutions for a world that demands greater performance from its packaging, earning profits for our partners who transform it and improving life for consumers who use it,” added Barenberg. Octal has significantly contributed to the Sultanate’s economic non-oil exports. The company also focuses on training many promising Omani professionals, with a number of staff posted to Octal’s other facilities around the world to gain international exposure. “What we have achieved so far is only the beginning of our legacy as there are vast opportunities and tremendous potential that can be harnessed from PET. Our investment in the downstream factories in the USA for recycling and Saudi Arabia for printed packaging material enable Octal to capture the entire value chain. Our ambitions are limitless and with the continued support of our employees, partners, customers and wider stakeholders, we are confident that we will make our shared vision a tangible reality,” added Barkat. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Market Rewind Markets stay perplexed with self-doubt Aarati Krishnan   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Headed In which direction? Cienpies Design/shutterstock.com Despite this, celebratory mood continued in the primary markets August 28, 2016:   Missed out on the hot debates in the market this week? Well, here’s a short wrap of interesting goings-on in the stock market that should add some zing to your weekend. Underwhelming earnings As the earnings season stretched on, the markets seemed to be sharply divided on whether we’re overdue for a correction or pausing for breath on the threshold of a bigger rally. Kotak Institutional Equities noted in a Strategy report on Q1 earnings that the aggregate net profits of Nifty and Sensex firms had mostly kept to expectations though the quality of earnings “was underwhelming”, as banking and metals contributed to most of the profit growth. After saying that it expected net profits of the Nifty firms to grow 14.4 per cent in FY17 and 20.7 per cent in FY18 led by ‘general economic recovery and normalization of profits’, it closed out its report with a cautionary note. “Our bigger worry would be the analyst community using inflated price, profitability and volume assumptions to model their bottom-up earnings numbers to justify target prices close to the current market prices of stocks. This can lead to disappointments later on if the ‘rosy’ assumptions of the Street turn out to be overly optimistic.” Things that suck Here, Capitalmind scored a point for the bearish camp by highlighting the growing disconnect between the pathetic earnings being delivered by Nifty firms and the current valuation of the index. As they pithily put it: “Things still suck, with the (Nifty) PE at nearly 24, while earnings (for the latest quarter) have grown at a minuscule 0.76 per cent.” You can read the full note here Gaga over RBL But if the secondary markets were assailed by self-doubt, the celebratory mood continued in the primary markets. RBL Bank closed its book-built offer for Rs 1211 crore with bids for 69.57 times the issue size. If you wonder why, when bank stocks in the listed space are a dime a dozen, attribute it to the bank’s ‘quality’ management, low NPAs and strong loan book growth when some PSBs are languishing on these very same parameters. Surprisingly though, retail investors proved to be most sober bidders of the lot, bidding for only 5.6 times the shares on offer. The real action was in the HNI category where bids were received for 198 times the shares on offer. For those who’ve been borrowing to punt on IPOs, good luck with this one! In a twist The Welspun saga unravelled in a rather nasty way for investors with the stock losing a mind-numbing 52 per cent over the week to close at sub-Rs 50 levels. The firm has been under fire ever since US retailing giant Target terminated a supply agreement with it, accused it of passing off inferior quality sheets as Egyptian cotton and decided to recall its own products from the market. As Wal-Mart and JC Penney jumped on to the bandwagon to review their own contracts with the Indian supplier, Welspun went into damage-control mode and announced an immediate audit into its supply chain and internal processes by a Big Four firm. But with over 90 per cent of the firm’s sales coming from overseas and the bottom dropping off the stock, the markets weren’t in the mood to listen. Moving In other news, Invesco Mutual Fund lost a seasoned money manager with its Chief Investment Officer Vetri Subramaniam joining UTI Mutual Fund. The 47-year old will take over as new Group President and Head of Equity at UTI AMC overseeing Rs 38,000 crore in assets. UTI has been on the hunt for an equities boss ever since Anoop Bhaskar, its popular Head of Equities headed to IDFC Mutual Fund in February this year. Vetri, who has had a long stint in the Indian markets has previously managed money for Kotak AMC and advised clients at Motilal Oswal. Vetri’s exit may be a loss to Invesco, which only recently acquired full ownership of its Indian mutual fund arm from the Religare group. But his conservative credo may fit in well with UTI Mutual Fund, which has taken a play-it-safe approach to its equity funds - even those with an aggressive mandate, in recent years.

At the time, vendors were furious with the parking ban saying it adversely affected their sales and some threatened not to return to future festivals. Visitors were also upset claiming off-Beeline parking was tough to find and spots available required long walks to the festival site. As it turns out, the controversy was much ado about nothing. That’s because Arts and Crafts member Catherine Hura reported this week that during a June 14 meeting with ADOT representatives, the parking restrictions were mostly removed, “Customers can now park on the street with the exception of the front of our white fence in front of the ramada and grounds, which is for handicap parking only.” Hura explained that last spring Guild representatives met with ADOT to get a permit to hold the Memorial Day festival, “They said we had to get rid of the parking on the street; it was a liability.” With that mandate in place, Memorial Day and the Fourth of July festival visitors parked in the Payson Concrete and Randall House lots. “Of course this created huge problems for many of our usual customers and was a concern for many of vendors who (thought) people would just drive by and not stop,” said Hura. ADOT also wanted the Guild to place traffic cones on Beeline that would remind drivers to use the parking areas or pass through Pine. “This had never happened in the 30-plus years that we have had shows in Pine,” Hura said. The Guild responded by asking ADOT to send representatives to the last two festivals to observe traffic flow and pedestrian traffic. Apparently, ADOT was satisfied with what they saw and, “Lifted the restrictions, parking is now allowed on the side of the street (Beeline),” Hura clarifies. With the parking issues resolved, Guild members are gearing up for the Labor Day Arts and Crafts Festival to be held Sept. 3 and 4. It will be open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday, Sept. 3 and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. the following day. Hura expects the festival to be a big hit saying, “There are more than 80 original hand-crafted juried art booths, food booths and entertainment ... it will be fun for everyone.” She also touts the holistic benefits of visiting the Rim Country, “Pure air, spectacular scenery amid ponderosa pines and friendly people.” Visitors are also being asked to visit the Arts and Crafts Guild Boutique on site to meet the local artists and review their work. A favorite of many locals and visitors are the $5 pancake breakfasts that include sausage, orange juice and coffee. The scrumptious breakfasts, served up by the Mountain Village Foundation, will be from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. both fair days. This year, Guild member Wendy Dravillas has added a new twist to the breakfasts. A Vermont Farmhouse Dollhouse, fully assembled, painted, wallpapered and furnished will be raffled. The dollhouse is estimated to be worth $400. Tickets are $1 each or six for $5 and the drawing will be held Sept 4. Hura also expects the very popular husband and wife musical duo Trouble in Paradise to entertain both days. All profits the sponsoring Pine Strawberry Arts and Crafts Guild earns at the holiday shows directly benefit those in the two communities. Those interested in joining the Guild should contact Gail atcoolpc680@hotmail.com or 928-978-0469. Food bank needs help Donations to the Pine Strawberry Food Bank have lagged over the summer months prompting the organization to make an urgent plea for more donations, whether it’s food products or monetary. Food bank volunteer Pat Impiccini calls the drive, “An opportunity to help the families we serve” which includes many seniors and their families who rely on the bank to stretch their monthly grocery budgets. The local bank serves an average of 85 families a month with meat, dairy, produce, bread, canned goods and other staples. “They are distributed once a month and the cart of groceries the clients receive augments their food purchases for three to four weeks, Impiccini said. But, he adds, “The food bank’s shelves are getting low while demand is increasing.” Call Marti Heinert at 480-296-4337 for information about donating or receiving food. Donation boxes can be found at various businesses in Pine and Strawberry including the Ponderosa Market. Monetary donations can also be sent to: Pine Strawberry Food Bank, P.O. Box 1534, Pine, AZ 85544. On to Oregon Tonto National Forest recreation officer Chelsea Muise is leaving Arizona for a new job in Oregon. But before she goes, her friends — including Mike and Janet Brandt and other members of the Pine Strawberry Fuel Reduction trails committee — are planning to fete her during a barbecue potluck following an 8 a.m. to noon trail work session tomorrow, Saturday, Aug. 27. The going-away party will be held at the Brandt home located a 3916 Pine Road. “We will smoke the meat, please feel free to bring a side (dish) or dessert,” the Brandts said. “We hope to see you all to wish Chelsea the best in her new job.” The trail improvement work will begin on the Mohawk Drive entrance into the Tonto National Forest in Pine. For those unsure of the location, a group from Payson is meeting at the Pine Trailhead and going on to the site. All volunteers are welcome to join them. Work will include building a new section of trail for the upcoming Fire on the Rim race that will bypass the spring area leading into town. “We can use all the help we can get for this project,” Mike Brandt said. “But if you can’t make trail work, please stop by the barbecue and let Chelsea know how much she will be missed.” County school superintendent Last week I crossed paths in Walmart with Gila County Schools Superintendent hopeful Roy Sandoval, also a longtime friend. Like retired teachers tend to do, we spent the better part of a half-hour mulling over public education. I left that conversation genuinely impressed with Roy’s vision for the future of education in Gila County. While some political candidates say only what constituents want to hear, Roy speaks openly and honestly about his plans, if elected, to set the direction and tone for county education. His background as a teacher, coach, curriculum director and principal gives him a unique insight into dealing with school board members, parents, district administrators and communities. Often in public education, those who leave the classroom for administrative positions lose perspective on what it takes for teachers to guide students into becoming successful in and out of the classroom. Roy has not lost that — he is a proven instructional leader, an effective communicator and a good listener. Gila Pioneers host dinner dance Just 10 years ago, following my retirement from teaching and during my full-time work at the Payson Roundup, I was asked to write stores about 11 men, most former standout athletes at Payson High, who had joined forces to do what the now-defunct Cowbelles once did each year. That was to honor Rim Country pioneers at a barbecue dinner, dance and auction. In covering those stores for about seven years, I gained huge respect for the group — Roy Haught, Tony McDaniel, Ronnie McDaniel, Will Davis, Billy Hardt, Albert Hunt, Tim Hughes, Lonnie Cline, Brian Jennings, Duke Wilbanks and Teddy Tomerlin — because without fanfare or much credit they were determined to keep an irreplaceable piece of Rim Country history alive for younger generations to enjoy. This year’s 10th annual celebration will be held at 3 p.m., Saturday, Sept. 24 in the Tonto Apache Gym. Raffle items will include a whole beef and a whole pig cut and wrapped. There will also be gun and pie auctions, quilts and much more, organizers promise. Ronnie McDaniel told me early on the festivities would be, “To honor the pioneers who 60 years ago were the backbone of the Rim Country.” The organizing committee has since its inception had a goal of making the events much like the socials held around the Rim Country decades ago. “Like we used to go to as kids,” Ronnie McDaniel once said. “We all remember those very well — they are some of our best memories.” For 23 years, the former Tonto Cowbelles hosted the events of honoring old-timers at annual dances and dinners. But, the Cowbelles disbanded in 2000. For the upcoming social, musicians will play for the dance a mix of country western tunes and waltzes. Haught, who is widely regarded as one of the finest cowboy cooks in Rim Country, traditionally prepares the barbecue dinner. Sides usually include cowboy beans, coleslaw and rolls. Tickets are only $10 at the door. Fire on the Rim ducats Remember to stop by Ponderosa Market from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays to purchase Fire on the Rim Mountain Bike Race raffle tickets, souvenir T-shirts and Italian Feast dinner tickets from Pine Strawberry Fire Reduction volunteer Katie Calderon and her crew. The race will be held Sept. 16-18. More madness The Isabelle Hunt Memorial Library’s Movie Madness events continue at 1 p.m. on Sept. 21, with the showing of Walt Disney’s “The Jungle Book.” It is 106 minutes long. As usual, children should bring their own pillow so as to be comfortable on the floor and refreshments will be served. Thought for the week “The difference between perseverance and obstinacy is that one comes from a strong will and the other from a strong won’t.” More like this story Arts and Crafts Guild does a lot for community P/S guild, ADOT resolve festival issues Finally, wet stuff comes to Rim Country Pine’s Labor Day Arts and Crafts Festival draws a happy crowd Time to sign up for summer arts and crafts festivals in Pine Comments Use the comment form below to begin a discussion about this content.

Give me a break!

Laura Harring and Naomi Watts in David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive, recently ranked 1st on the BBC’s list of 21st century films. Mulholland Drive (2001) Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn The BBC recently released a list of the “greatest films of the 21st century.” This kind of list immediately raises hackles and heckles all over the place. Unsurprisingly, a conventional kind of “safe,” respectably middlebrow cinema dominates the top 100. There are some exceptions. Mulholland Drive, which tops the list, is one of David Lynch’s best films and one of the most devastating explorations of the art of cinema in the medium’s history. Joshua Oppenheimer’s stunning The Act of Killing (number 14), Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master (no. 24), and Lars von Trier’s sentimental but effective Melancholia (no. 43) similarly deserve a place. Likewise, David Cronenberg’s A History of Violence (no. 59), and The Pianist (no. 90), which marked a return to form for legendary director Roman Polanski. I was perhaps most pleased to see Harmony Korine represented on the list. His delirious Spring Breakers (no. 74) is, I would argue, the best film of the 21st century. Spring Breakers - the best film of the 21st century? Spring Breakers Poster It is certainly far more stimulating, both intellectually and viscerally, than several films that featured higher on the list. This includes pretentious and laboured “indie” films like Boyhood (no. 5) and The Grand Budapest Hotel (no. 21), typical “Oscar” films like The Social Network (no. 27) and There Will Be Blood (no. 3), and flat, unimaginative action films like The Dark Knight (no. 33), Mad Max: Fury Road (no. 19) and Zero Dark Thirty (no. 57). In comparison to 20th century, pre-digital cinema, the most provocative aspect of 21st century films is in their engagement with and thinking about contemporary economies of spectacle and mass-mediation. Thus, my 21st century top ten would include: Spring Breakers (2012). Korine’s film is a fascinating, libidinous analysis of spectacle in digital culture. Kill List (2011). Ben Wheatley’s at times unwatchably brutal nightmare seamlessly combines kitchen sink social realism of the Ken Loach variety, British gangster cinema, and the occult horror genre. This is one of the strangest and most disturbing films I’ve seen. The Girl Next Door (2004). This homage to the “smart” teen comedies of the 1980s plays like a virtual remake of Paul Brickman’s Risky Business (1983), with porn substituted for prostitution as the obscene underside of the upper middle class American suburb. A brooding, deeply introspective – and funny – Bildungs-film. Shooter (2007). Directed by Antoine Fuqua, this uncompromising revenge film successfully affirms a seductive and mythical vision of rugged American individualism. A suitably paranoid, anti-establishment narrative supports a muscular, hard-boiled lead performance by Mark Wahlberg. Old School (2003). Todd Phillips’ frequently hilarious revision of college raunch comedies like Animal House (1978) and H.O.T.S. (1979) significantly revitalised comedy for the 21st century. Snowtown (2011) offers a brutal, mean-spirited vision of life in Australia’s destitute suburbs. A superbly low-key film that deserves multiple viewings, Snowtown is arguably the best Australian film of recent years. Gamer (2009) is a sleazy, over-the-top study of neoliberal capitalism set in a (near) future obsessed with media spectacle. Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor offer a cynical class critique of sorts – perhaps the only kind possible in the “post-ideological” 21st century. Mulholland Drive (2001). Lynch’s surreal vision of the underside of Hollywood’s glamorous screen culture is one of the most beautifully shot and scored films of the 21st century. Excision (2012). Richard Bates’ horror film gained notoriety in the US after it was banned from Wal-Mart. It is alternately funny and horrifying and contains some genuinely off-putting sequences. Nightcrawler (2014). Buoyed by a star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal as a ghoulish “stringer” who chases accidents and crimes in order to capture gruesome footage to sell to local news networks, Nightcrawler offers the most effective critique of mass-media since Sidney Lumet’s Network (1976). What else would feature in my list? The Hunt (2012), a brilliant film by Dogme 95er Thomas Vinterberg, would be near the top, as would Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark (2000). Snowpiercer (2013), Bong Joon Ho’s eco-thriller, and Lynch’s Inland Empire (2006) would similarly appear high on the list. Rampart (2011), a true crime neon-noir thriller written by James Ellroy would be in the top 50, as would the “man-boy” comedies Step Brothers (2008) and Role Models (2008), Jim Mickle’s chilling retro thriller about a 1980’s Texan snuff film ring, Cold in July (2014), and the charming and witty teen comedies Mean Girls (2004) and Easy A (2010). Tarantino’s blood ballet, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003), and Mike Binder’s hokey but sweet The Upside of Anger (2005) might also make it. In any case, this kind of project of canon formation rightly raises questions such as “according to whom?” and “so what?” It is critical to interrogate the motives underpinning any such presentations in the “best of” format, including my own. Aesthetic decisions are, after all, always (by definition) a matter of taste, and “taste” has contributed throughout history to the justification of all kinds of atrocities, colonial and otherwise. What kinds of power formations are privileged by assertions of canon? It’s perhaps worth remembering the religious connotations of the word… Of course, within certain aesthetic regimes, films can be objectively compared to the extent that they realise and commit to a form, style, or concept. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), for example, is an excellent film according to the conventions of 1970s and 1980s American horror cinema. It compares favourably with its sequels, and the films of several other horror “franchises.” It would similarly be difficult to argue that Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity (1944) isn’t a superb example of film noir, on the basis of its commitment to exploring an idea and style – that is, the darkness generated through the failing of American optimism in the aftermath of the Great Depression and the atrocities of World War Two. The same could be said for Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch (1969) and its post-Vietnam War blood-soaked version of American cynicism. The decision in the first place regarding which genres, ideas, and milieus to privilege and which to discredit – social realism is, for example, typically privileged over fantasy in middlebrow cultural criticism – is an act of assertion on the part of the critic, and thus reflects broader regimes of social power. Such canonical lists ultimately reflect little more than the desire of the viewer-critic regarding his or her interactions with cinema. Therefore you should ask yourself the following questions before buying into someone else’s canon. Do you hope to be shocked into a heightened state of sensitivity? Do you crave exposure to a new, exotic aesthetic ecology? Do you want cinema that offers sustained and measured conceptual explorations? Or do you, like most of us, merely desire efficient pharmacological reprieve from the brutal exigencies of day to day existence? Answers to these questions will help you determine your own canon.

Bannon, who had been publisher of the far-right website Breitbart, has called the pope a “commie” and said Catholics are trying to boost Hispanic immigration because their “church is dying.” He called Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman who was shot in the head, a “human shield,” and the mayor of London a “radical Muslim.” Hillary Clinton, in Bannon’s telling, is a “grifter” who would take the country to the “last days of Sodom.” The new Trump adviser calls himself a “populist nationalist” — his hiring has been cheered by white supremacists — and calls his fellow believers a “small, crazy wing” of the conservative movement. He has referred to the Civil War as the “war of Southern Independence” fought over “economic development.” He found “zero evidence” of racial motives in the Trayvon Martin shooting and warned that “cities could be washed away in an orgy of de-gentrification.” The Trump campaign’s chief executive believes the Obama administration is “importing more hating Muslims” and asks whether Clinton is “complicit in a fifth column.” He doesn’t think Huma Abedin, a Muslim aide to Clinton, should have a security clearance, and he has alleged that Clinton’s vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine, has an “affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood.” He argued that Gretchen Carlson’s sexual harassment case, which forced the ouster of Roger Ailes at Fox News Channel, was a “total dud,” and he alleged the existence of a “militant-feminist legal wrecking crew.” Fox News, in Bannon’s view, is a “centrist” outlet — and compared to Breitbart, it most certainly is. The site, which was closer to the mainstream under its late founder, Andrew Breitbart, has run these headlines under Bannon’s leadership: “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.” “Political Correctness Protects Muslim Rape Culture.” “Suck It Up Buttercups: Dangerous Faggot Tour Returns to Colleges in September.” “The Solution to Online ‘Harassment’ Is Simple: Women Should Log Off.” “Two Months Left Until Obama Gives Dictators Control of Internet.” “There’s No Hiring Bias Against Women in Tech, They Just Suck at Interviews.” “Trannies Whine About Hilarious Bruce Jenner Billboard.” “Khizr Khan Believes the Constitution ‘Must Always Be Subordinated to the Sharia.’” Bannon’s Breitbart said the gay-pride flag is viewed as a “symbol of anti-Christian hate” and said birth control makes a woman into a “slut” and a “hideous monster,” arguing: “Your birth control injection will add on pounds that will prevent the injection you really want — of man meat.” Trump echoes conspiracy theories proposed by Breitbart, and Breitbart has relentlessly promoted Trump. In short, Trump found in Bannon a character like himself: a bully who targets racial and religious minorities, immigrants and women. In his writings and broadcast commentary, Bannon, a veteran and former banker, has argued that immigrants — legal as well as illegal — are to blame for crime, terrorism and disease. He disparages “anchor babies” and says FBI Director James Comey’s recommendation not to prosecute Clinton is “inextricably linked” to anti-police violence. He speaks of Megyn Kelly’s “blonde ambition” and alleges that the military is trying to “eradicate Christianity.” Breitbart has a tag for “black crime” and stokes fear of race wars with headlines such as “Race Murder in Virginia,” “Black Suspects Stalk Robbery Victim in Philadelphia,” “Career Criminal Accused of Assaulting Victim, Calling Her ‘White Bitch,’” “Black Rape Gangs Violate Two Detroit Women” and “Black Mob Swarms Georgia Walmart to See ‘How Much Damage’ They Could Do.” The Southern Poverty Law Center protests that Breitbart “has been openly promoting the core issues of the Alt-Right, introducing these racist ideas to its readership.” Breitbart had a “lengthy defense” of white nationalists that ignored their openly racist views, the SPLC said. Breitbart likened Pamela Geller’s “Muhammad Cartoon Contest” to the Selma-to-Montgomery march. The outlet has gone after the “big gay hate machine” and suggested that “the next step for marriage equality” is “likely polygamy.” Breitbart ran a doctored photo showing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in a bikini on all fours with her tongue out. It reported that Planned Parenthood was “comfortably surpassing Hitler” in its “body count.” It said Trump’s bogus claim that thousands of New Jersey Muslims celebrated the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, had been “100 percent vindicated,” and it alleged a “smoking gun” connecting the 9/11 hijackers to a “Bush family friend.” There is more, but you don’t need to read it here. Just wait for Trump to say it.

But we must preserve the library spirit we already have. Let me explain. I started using the Main Library as a new mother. Every Saturday, I’d leave with a bag of picture books to supplement the ones at home. I quickly learned not to check out puzzles, since key pieces always seemed to vanish at home. We’d regularly attend story hour or research school projects and vacation destinations. The library hooked me by offering online holds. These days, if I read about an interesting book or get a friend’s recommendation, I can place a hold through the website and swing by to pick up my book when it lands on the reserve shelf. Whoever does the library book purchasing is amazing. Rarely has a book I want, even a new release, not been available. I read widely – science fiction, biography, young adult, non-fiction, how-to. Sometimes, the library is like the Hogwarts “room of requirement,” where items magically appear just when you need them. Sometimes, the books I get are very well-loved. Robin Hobb’s fantasy “Fool’s Assassin” came apart as I turned the pages, seemingly exhausted by so many readers. Some books reveal that they were once part of a beach vacation, the covers faded from sun and still gritty with sand. I’m not one for clothing discovered at thrift stores, but I love knowing that the book in my hands has enriched the life of others. We’re a kind of secret society of story, held together by our library. Among our members are the homeless people who show up when the Main Library opens and leave at closing. The library is safe and dry, cool in summer and warm in winter. It’s also a haven where they can immerse themselves in story or catch up on news. Like our schools and police, libraries are called upon today to provide services unthinkable even a decade ago. It’s not fair, but the staff and security seem uniformly patient and willing to go the extra mile to welcome all. But as anyone who regularly visits the Main Library knows, the physical building is a wreck. While the structure is sound, the interior is worn and outdated. The carpets are badly stained. The lights in the Main Library’s common room gray the skin of the healthiest patron. The teen room is too small for the kids who read, do homework or use the computers there. At a time when video games and social media consume the young, we need spaces to lure kids into the world of knowledge and books. We need to think big about what a new library could mean for all of our citizens, especially the youngest ones. Durham is booming, underscoring as never before the need to think big. A visionary facility could draw vitality east, creating a welcoming, accessible public space. Imagine a facility like Charlotte’s ImaginOn, a children’s library, with a soaring ceiling protecting lively, bright spaces that include a theater and coffee shop. Or the McAllen, Texas library, a former Wal-Mart that in 2011 opened with 123,000 square feet of books, computers and workspace. That’s almost triple the size of their former space (check it out online at http://www.mcallenlibrary.net/). In addition to dedicated teen and children’s areas, the McAllen Library has a cafe, auditorium, art gallery and used book store. The building is madly popular. Director Kate Horan told Slate Magazine that new registrations and book loans are through the roof. “We used to be really busy on Sunday afternoons,” she said. “Now, every day is a Sunday afternoon.” The new thinking about libraries assumes they must have more than books. I agree. Imagine a tool and seed library or a room dedicated to seniors. How about a services area for the homeless, with visiting doctors, dentists and services reps? A demonstration garden outside or a library with a theater able to mount productions, screen films and record podcasts? The Main Library is scheduled to close in May 2017 for renovations. But I’m afraid that the current plans are more about carpets than vision. Our library was the first free, tax-supported library in the state. We need to think big about what a new library could mean for all of our citizens, especially the youngest ones. The teen area, for example, is miniscule in the current renovation plans, a real missed opportunity. There’s no recognition of seniors, prime users of the space. I can already hear the country commissioners moaning. Money is tight. There are demands for affordable housing, infrastructure, schools, all worthy. But don’t forget the library. The Main Library provides a unique and vital service we desperately need. From what I can see, Durham dwellers truly love their books as well as the community we’ve built and continue to foster. Like the ballpark, DPAC and American Tobacco, it’s a place all of us meet and interact. We need new carpets, sure, but also a space that reflects us at our best. Robin Kirk will read from her new poetry book, “Peculiar Motion,” at at 7 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 1, at The Regulator Bookshop, 720 Ninth St. in Durham. Kirk is a writer who teaches human rights at Duke University.

Secretary of State John Merrill and lawmakers had disagreed over whether the measure's inclusion on the ballot. Merrill said the deadline for ballot additions had passed. Montgomery Circuit Judge William Shashy on Friday ordered Merrill to add it to the Nov.8 ballot. By Kim Chandler. SENT: 494 words. ALABAMA LOTTERY MONTGOMERY, Ala. — For the briefest moment, victory seemed within the governor's grasp. Then it all fell apart. Republican Gov. Robert Bentley had proposed starting a state lottery in Alabama, one of six states without such games. After clearing both chambers in the Alabama Legislature, the bill was overwhelmingly defeated in the final concurrence vote Friday, doomed by a fatal mix of a turf war over gaming machines, longstanding opposition to gambling from Republicans and perhaps legislative cold feet. By Kim Chandler. SENT: 803 words, photos. ADDICTION RECOVERY PROGRAM BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — UAB Hospital is adding beds for those struggling with opioid addiction. The hospital's Addiction Recovery Program will also add more nurses and technicians to better serve patients in outpatient treatment, Al.com reported. The increase of beds and staff will help better handle the influx of patients struggling with addiction to opioids and other IV drugs. SENT: 294 words. MAKING A DIFFERENCE CULLMAN, Ala. — Not very many years ago, a Cullman woman began volunteering one hour of her time each week at a local elementary school, working with a boy whose unstable family life gave him few opportunities to learn. Coordinating with teachers to carve out an hour of one-on-one time during the school day, she and the boy developed a bond that offered a piece of stability in an otherwise chaotic life. After that school year, the teachers at the school wanted her to come back and continue her mentorship when the boy began his next year of study. By Ben Bullard, The Cullman Times. SENT: 928 words. ALSO: — TODDLER DEATH-MOTHER CHARGED — A mother has been charged in the death of her son who drowned in the pool at a central Alabama apartment while she shopped at Walmart SPORTS: FBC--AUBURN-KERRYON'S TURN AUBURN, Ala. — Kerryon Johnson was a versatile playmaker who returned kicks, ran the Wildcat and caught some passes out of the backfield as a freshman. Now, his role is more defined: Auburn's featured tailback. The Tigers sophomore vaulted to the top of the depth chart entering next Saturday's opener with No. 2 Clemson following the dismissal of top returning runner Jovon Robinson during fall camp and two other departures.

Nobody was available on Saturday at the Country Fresh, Inc’s corporate office, located at 15479 Pin Oaks Dr., for comment regarding the recall 30,000 cases of various fresh-cut vegetable products shipped to retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. None of the products were shipped within Texas. The products have been recalled because they have the potential to be contaminated with listeria, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. A representative, who asked not to be named, said during a phone call the recall does not affect the Conroe community and referred the Courier to a press release for more information. The company’s community involvement includes food banks across the nation, according to its website. However the Conroe representative said the local food bank is not affected by this recall. Country Fresh originated from one processing facility and 50 employees in Houston, Texas and has grown to multiple facilities, hundreds of employees, and national distribution to some of the largest retailers in the country, including Walmart. It also has processing facilities in Grand Prairie, Orlando, South Carolina, and Houston. Recall Notice The recalled products were shipped under the Country Fresh and store brand labels described in the product listing. The product bears “BEST IF USED BY” dates between Aug. 7 through Aug. 19. It is in either a clear plastic container as labeled below or in Styrofoam trays overwrapped with clear plastic film as labeled below. No other products except those on this list are subject to this recall, according to the FDA who stated to date, no illnesses have been confirmed by public health authorities. “We are treating this incident very seriously because we want to ensure that our customers are provided with only the safest, most wholesome, and high-quality products available,” said Max Payen, Country Fresh’s director of food safety. The potential for contamination was uncovered as the result of a single routine sample taken at a retail store by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, which revealed the finished product tested positive for the bacteria, according to the announcement. The company has ceased distribution of the affected product as the FDA and Country Fresh continue their investigation as to what caused the problem. This recall is being undertaken with the knowledge of the FDA, the information stated. Consumers who have purchased any of these products are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 281-453-3305, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. CDT For more information visit www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls or www.countryfreshinc.com.

(Photo courtesy of Nadine Ramsey) Print Email Beau Evans, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Beau Evans, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author on August 27, 2016 at 9:18 PM comments The New Orleans Police Department nabbed nearly 170 firearms -- including five assault weapons -- during a gun buyback hosted at St. Stephen Missionary Baptist Church in Algiers on Saturday (Aug. 27). The event marked a first for New Orleans City Council member Nadine Ramsey, a main sponsor who called the event "a great success." "We know for certain that violence not only in our community and city but also throughout the nation, is mostly related to gun violence," said Ramsey, who represents District C and partnered with the Metropolitan Crime Commission to host the event. "This is the first of what we hope will be many steps to reduce gun violence in the city." On Saturday, gun owners eager to give up their weapons but previously unsure how best to do so began lining up at the church before the buyback had even begun at 9 a.m. Once the buyback ended five hours later, around 100 owners had relinquished 159 handguns, rifles and shotguns, as well as five assault weapons. They received $100 in Walmart gift cards for each handgun, rifle or shotgun, with a give-up limit of five guns per person, and $200 for each assault weapon. On the whole, gun owners participated in the buyback out of concerns that their weapons might fall into the wrong hands like burglars or their own children, Ramsey said. Most of them did not know any other safe way to give up their guns, and for that reason, Ramsey said, the event marked an important step toward reducing gun violence in New Orleans. @kjgroup2014 @nadineramsey @NOPDNews Getting guns off the street #GunBuyBack #Algiers pic.twitter.com/yJpIXECyXv -- Aylin Maklansky (@AylinMaklansky) August 27, 2016 Saturday's buyback was the first such event Ramsey has helped NOPD organize since being elected in 2014.

(Axel Drainville / CC 2.0) There are 16 wealthy donors behind New Yorkers for Independent Action, a super PAC that is spending millions to influence local campaigns in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Suffolk County. But none of these 16 donors lives in these places. Instead, writes George Joseph of the Village Voice, “those registered in New York list addresses on the Upper East Side and in midtown.” As for the others? Joseph reports: Most of the other donors outside New York list addresses in wealthy enclaves popular with Wall Street commuters, such as Greenwich and Westport, Connecticut. The address farthest away from New York belongs to Alice Walton, the Walmart heiress worth $35.3 billion, who listed a residence in Bentonville, Arkansas. According to Forbes, this is not the first time that Walton has donated to a political campaign—she has regularly donated to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaigns, giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to various Clinton PACs and fundraising committees. The super PAC, Joseph explains, is determined “to oust four labor-backed black and Latino state Democrats” from these local New York elections—which is particularly troublesome given that “all of the super-PAC’s donors appear to be white.” Joseph continues: The group’s main issue has been advocating for an education tax credit, which would give tax rebates to donors and companies for donations to private and parochial schools and has long been opposed by most state Democrats. … “The flood of big money into state legislative races has been happening over the last few cycles, especially from the hedge fund and real estate industries,” says Karen Scharff, executive director of Citizen Action, a group that advocates public financing of elections. “But this scale of involvement from super-PACs in Democratic primary races in less well-off districts is relatively new.” … The state teachers union’s affiliated PAC has given money to fend off some of the attacks, spending $85,048 in recent days to defend Brooklyn Assemblywomen Pamela Harris and Latrice Walker and Suffolk County Assemblyman Phil Ramos.

Photo: Photos Courtesy McDonald Observatory Buy this photo PBPA, McDonald Observatory work on curbing light pollution from rigs 1 / 5 Back to Gallery There has been a surge in oil activity in the Delaware Basin over the past few years, and pollution concerns have crept up, but not in an obvious place. Drilling rigs operate 24 hours a day in one of the darkest places on the planet, and their lights have hampered progress at the University of Texas at Austin’s McDonald Observatory, nestled in the Davis Mountains on the edge of the Permian. “We started seeing the glow from all of the oil and gas activity in the Permian Basin showing up around 2010,” McDonald Observatory public affairs specialist and veteran astronomer Bill Wren said in a phone interview. “We noticed that looking up the I-20 corridor northeast from where we are, the horizon was starting to brighten and realized there was a major boom going on.” Until recently, the only observable light was from El Paso and Juarez, Mexico, which are 160 miles away, well-beyond the visible horizon. “Now it is dwarfed by the Permian Basin,” Wren said. Light pollution on the horizon has made peering into deep space difficult for the astronomers at the observatory, and a few years ago, they reached out to local municipalities and oil industry organizations in an effort to find a resolution. The Permian Basin Petroleum Association has since informed its 900-plus members and is working with the observatory. “We’ve entered into a partnership and established an advisory group between members of the McDonald Observatory, the University of Texas at Austin and the PBPA to talk about ways to protect the dark-skies environment in West Texas,” PBPA President Ben Shepperd said. “We have an important asset in McDonald Observatory, but with the encroachment of not only oil and gas activity in the Delaware Basin, but the growth in population centers, we’re looking for ways that we can manage our activities that will decrease the lighting.” There is now an advisory group, and they met officially for the first time Tuesday at UT Austin to discuss the Dark Skies Initiative, which works to reach out to oil companies and inform them about light pollution and what steps can be taken to make life better for not only the observatory, but for rig operators and their crews. Among solutions that already have been implemented are putting shrouds on lights and pointing them down below the horizon. By doing so, “you actually gain light on the ground,” Wren said. “It’s a win-win deal.” Shepperd said shrouding and re-aiming lights is already apparent in other applications. “If you’ve ever seen a drilling rig at night, there’s light shining everywhere. Many of our companies have already taken steps to point their lights below the horizon. You’ve already seen this in a Wal-Mart parking lot. If the light is pointing downward, it just shines on the store and the parking lot. If it’s aimed at 90 degrees, it lights up the sky. Also suggested is replacing light fixtures with those using LED bulbs, which Wren said will have economic benefits in the long run. “If you modernize and you toss out your legacy fixtures -- old metal halide and high-pressure sodium lights -- and go to LEDs, you’re saving 80-plus percent in terms of fuel consumption. It has a snowball effect. If you’re consuming only 20 percent of the fuel you were before to light, you don’t have to truck in as much fuel as often, which means you don’t have to maintain the roads as much. You end up saving money in lots of ways that aren’t immediately apparent.” Wren said a lot of organizations are on board with the initiative. Culberson, Reeves and Pecos counties about three years ago issued letters to a few hundred operators who had drilling permits to inform them about McDonald Observatory and lighting ordinances designed to protect dark skies. The PBPA followed suit, as did the Railroad Commission in February. The advisory group agreed to meet three times a year: at UT Austin, in Midland in November and at the observatory in the spring. In the meantime, all involved will formulate recommended lighting practices. McDonald Observatory has about 45 employees, with about 80 people total when families are included. It’s a satellite campus of UT Austin and even has its own campus police. There are currently four resident astronomers who run the Hobby-Eberly telescope, the third-largest in the world. The observatory’s first telescope was built it 1939. It was a 2.1-meter telescope that didn’t have to compete much with lights in the Permian. The 10-meter Hobby-Eberly telescope, which came online in 1997, has greatly increased what astronomers can observe. “When it comes to cutting-edge astronomy, there’s no substitute for aperture in terms of light-gathering ability,” Wren said. Dark skies are needed, however. “We’re just trying to formally engage and work on these issues,” Shepperd said, adding that the observatory and West Texas’ dark skies are “a treasure worth saving.” Like Trevor on Facebook and follow him on Twitter at @HowdyHawes.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Thursday, Jan. 7, 2016 Florida's manatee population has recovered enough that the species no longer meets the definition of "endangered" under the Endangered Species Act. (AP Photo/John Raoux, File) Florida’s statewide alligator hunt is underway, and some heavy lizards have been banged by hunters chasing the water beasts, usually at night with specialized gear. The hunt has become hugely popular, with 13,000 people applying for permits this year and 6,000 receiving them. One of the biggest taken thus far is a giant 13-foot, 4-inch monster collected from Lake George, a widening of the St. Johns River near the town of Astor and a short drive south of Jacksonville. The weight of that gator was not reported by hunter Bill Moody, who hooked the creature near the mouth of Juniper Springs Run on the west shore of the lake. The spot is remote and wild, as it’s part of the Ocala National Forest, and is a well-known place for mega-lizards. The state record length for a gator is 14 feet, 3.5 inches from Lake Washington, a headwater region of the upper St. Johns River. The heaviest weight gator taken from Florida waters was a 1,043-pounder collected out of Orange Lake in Alachua County, not far from Gainesville. I remember that 13-foot gator being caught, and it was shortly after gator hunting resumed in the state. At over half-a-ton in weight, that beast was definitely in the water dragon category, just like the most recent one caught from Lake George. GLOWING REVIEW With archery and general hunting seasons soon approaching, some sportsmen may be looking for something to brighten up their hunting sights — particularly open iron sights on rifles, handguns and shotguns, as well as archery pin sights. Last spring I tried a not-so-new product called “Glow-On Super Phosphorescent” paint to brighten my turkey shotgun sights. I’d been having trouble picking up the front and rear sights in low light, and that led to some exciting and close encounters with gobblers. A little research led to the made-in-America “Glow-On Super Phosphorescent” paint solution, and it is truly awesome. It’s available in several colors, and just a dab or two on a sight makes it glow so even old eyes have no trouble seeing them in diminishing daylight. The phosphorescent paint needs a charge from a light source prior to it glowing. But a minute or so in a flashlight beam prior to dawn hunting has proven to be all that’s needed for the paint to glow for a couple hours. The phosphorescent paint also makes lures glow, which is a turn-on for many predator gamefish, especially at night. A bit of flashlight beam on a jig head or plug that’s painted, and the lure shines bright. Anglers should note that even during daylight hours sunlight penetration into deep, dark water is minimal, so phosphorescent paint may be a trigger that takes fish when nothing else will. PRIZE CATCH This may be a fishing tournament money win that puts every other event in the minor league realm. Naples angler Phil Heasley on the boat Kallianassa fished the White Marlin Open in Ocean City, Md., recently and won $2.8 million. His 76.5-pound white marlin caught the second day of the five-day event was the only white marlin taken that qualified for the event. Thus he won first, second and third place for the fish and pocketed nearly $3 million. BAIT MATTERS Recently a fishing friend asked why several boats of anglers anchored around his boat in the lower St. Johns River were catching bull redfish, yet he and his son were not. They were anchored on a river ledge dropping from 18 to 25 feet, and fishermen in other boats were catching-and-releasing reds one after another. Yet even though my buddy was using the same blue crab baits, they caught nothing. I learned they were using huge whole half-crab baits (with all legs still attached) with small 1/0 circle hooks. They had six hits, broke off two, and the hooks pulled on the other four. Further, they fished with large floats and 2-foot leaders over 20 feet of water. Using smaller 1/4 crabs with legs removed was the first step to success, he was told. Then increase the circle hook size to 4/0 to 6/0. This smaller bait and bigger hook allows for more sure barbing of taking fish. Next, redfish, like most deep-water residents, feed near the bottom. So ditch the floats, and use enough weight on the fishing line to hold bottom — usually 2 to 8 ounces, depending on depth and current. He did all this, and next outing they slammed fish, boating nine, including a 21-pound channel catfish. BIRDS, BAITFISH Local anglers are bird watchers, or at least they should be. Birds — gulls, terns, pelicans, ospreys, herons and others — commonly lead the way to where baitfish congregate, so anglers usually are attuned to watching for birds. The other morning I was fishing with a friend and spotted a mature bald eagle wing low over the water, around a dock, and land near a wooded shore at a tiny creek mouth. I figured the eagle had a dead fish or something, and it was there to feed. I eased my boat toward the eagle, watching it, and learned it was standing on a mud bar with several inches of water over it. The bird was wading, watching and looking at the creek as it spilled out of the woods and into the St. Johns. I’ve seen eagles to a lot of strange things, including eating carrion on a Florida rural road with buzzards, stealing fish from ospreys while airborne above the St. Johns, and feasting on dead and smashed pigeons in a Florida Wal-Mart parking lot. But never previously had I seen an eagle actively wading for baitfish swept by with creek current. MANATEE ASSIST Paul Misner, a regular in the local Florida Lure Anglers club, offers a tip that is so obvious I’m dumbfounded I’d not tried it previously in area waters. Misner was fishing the lower St. Johns, targeting trout, reds and flounder and was having only fair action. That’s when a pair of manatees showed, cruising along just outside a dock line — something that is a common sight among anglers working the river. On a whim, Misner fired a jig to the churned up water behind the manatees and instantly hooked an upper-slot redfish. He fought the fish to the boat, and with it was at least one other red. It’s a common fishing tactic in shallow water to cast behind sting rays and sharks when targeting flats fish such as bonefish, permit, snook, tarpon and — yes — redfish. The same holds true for manatees in local waters. The reason reds and other species follow manatees, rays and sharks, is the behemoths churn up the bottom, which dislodges baitfish, crabs, shrimp and other goodies on which the gamefish feed. Moral here is that when you see manatees in the shallows, make a few casts to the dark, churned water behind them.   bob@mcnallyoutdoors.com   Advertisement   View all Local Store Sales » Most Popular News Fri, 01/06/2017 - 13:12 2 shot near N.

This is a discussion I addressed several times during my tenure on the Select Board. I feel that many of the comments, and now the board's suggestions, confuse a conflict of interest with a common interest. The concept that a volunteer member of civic organization's board has a conflict of interest with the town is dreadfully ill conceived. The idea had been presented to me while on the Bennington Select Board; however, it is quite clear in state definitions that this is not the case. Imagine if Senator Leahy were to recuse himself from discussions in the US Senate which would affect Vermont because he was a resident and might see a benefit. The boards are made up of town residents working for the causes of the town of Bennington. The people of Bennington vote for their representatives because of the causes they represent; downtown, poverty, cultural enrichment, education and so on. These are the interests of all of Bennington. If a board member were to have to leave those boards, or recuse themselves anytime a discussion of those issues were introduced, who would represent those interests? Who would be on those boards, and why would we vote for them? The VLCT Select Board Handbook has a clear and thorough description of conflict of interest. Instead of adapting a new one, I suggest members of the board learn it and teach it to those who question it. It clearly states that it is ok to have a political prejudice in discussions of town business. This is politics, after all. The super Walmart opens today. We will see additional store closings downtown as shop owners decide not to compete with the new store while paying a tax premium to be in the downtown. Our downtown will need to experience a shift of focus if it is to survive. Removing the advocates of downtown from the Select Board, and the board's direct oversight of the taxpayer funds spent by the BBC is only going to add to the detriment. While I appreciate the discussion of the issue, I cannot stress how misguided and damaging this direction would be. — Greg Van Houten Bennington Print Email Tweet TALK TO US If you'd like to leave a comment (or a tip or a question) about this story with the editors, please email us.

Representatives of The Arbors at Russellville Assisted Living Facility gave a presentation on the facility they will build on Marina Way. They said they would build an upscale 75-bed assisted II facility similar to Fox Ridge Estates and Mount Carmel at Hot Springs Village. Plans call for a resort-style facility on a 20-acre lot with a scenic view of Lake Dardanelle. After someone has traveled to two gated entryways with a pond, plants and water feature, there will be a drive-thru with a lobby, beauty shop, game room, workout room and arts and crafts room. Other items mentioned included a large conference room, private dining room, chapel, movie theater, dining area, a 16-room memory care unit and independent garden homes. The facility would cover 69,000 square feet. A spokesman from The Arbors said they would like to rezone the area to planned unit development (PUD) because it "protects the city." "It will be a pretty special piece of property," they said, adding they wanted to bring a formal proposal to the Planning Commission in October and break ground around the first of the new year. Alderwoman Freddie Harris said she had a relative who lived in Mount Carmel and said there "is a crying need in our city for this type of facility." Commissioners also approved a large-scale development plan for the existing Wal-Mart Fuel Station No. 58 in front of the Supercenter on East Main Street. Plans called for adding four gas pumps, getting rid of the kiosk in the middle of the current station and add a convenience store. The city is going to try again with a right-turn-only entrance and exit for the expanded fuel station. When the supercenter originally opened years ago, it included a right-in right-out turn entrance and exit off East Main Street, but it was eventually removed after too many vehicles attempted to turn left using the center turn lane. One item taken off the original Planning Commission agenda was review of a final plat from CVS Pharmacy at the corner of North Arkansas Avenue and East Main Street. Chairman Dennis Boyd asked Kurt Jones about the item, and Jones replied he and Greg Walden, city planner, are working with the developer, Foresite Group Inc. Members of the commission include Shirley Hatley, John Whiteside, Peggy Stratton, Wendell Miller, Boyd, Doug Skelton, Mike Wilkins, Todd Meimerstorf, Nathan Barber and Freddie Harris. The Russellville Planning Commission meets at 5:30 p.m. the fourth Monday inside City Hall. The Board of Adjustments is scheduled to meet at 5.

Conroe, Texas-based Country Fresh Inc. said Friday that the recall involves its vegetable products shipped to retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

Despite this, Gov. Scott Walker and the Republicans who control our state legislature have put the education funds of our neighborhoods on the chopping block. Not only have they attacked teachers who serve our kids, but also they have stolen money from our schools to give to millionaires, billionaires, corporations and privatized, unaccountable schools. The Republicans have already slashed $1 billion from our public schools at the while giving out a tax break that hands millionaires $150 million every year. Even worse, they have placed our public school students at risk in order to advance their extreme right wing agenda and please their biggest donors, who want to see our public schools fail. They’re willing to rig the system and sacrifice our children’s futures to get what they want. They attack our public schools even though when public schools and taxpayer funded private operations are compared equally, public schools win the comparison. Private schools in the voucher program in Wisconsin will receive hundreds of millions of dollars from state taxpayers this school year. Yet they remain exempt from many of the performance and safety standards we put on public schools — even after studies showing lackluster performance and news reports of questionable uses of public funds. Instead of cracking down on subpar schools with fair accountability measures and standards, state Republicans are locking us into a system in which students that are in private voucher schools declared to be “chronically failing” can continue to use taxpayer funded vouchers to attend these schools. The issue here isn’t the availability of better choices for students in Milwaukee. The issue is ensuring those better seeming options actually are better. It is just common sense to require the people entrusted with educating the children at private voucher schools receiving tax dollars to be qualified, licensed professionals. After all, that’s what the law currently requires of our public schools. But that’s not currently the case for voucher schools. And Republicans don’t care. But that’s because of the political clout wielded by the school privatizers in Wisconsin. Gov. Walker’s campaign chair runs an $800 million right wing funding machine which has invested $100 million in propaganda attacking our public schools. The American Federation for Children, a front group overseen by former Republican Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen, has publicly bragged of pouring massive amounts of campaign cash to elect sympathetic legislators. And out-of-state millionaire and billionaires, including heirs to the WalMart and Amway fortunes, have consistently made large campaign contributions directly to voucher friendly Republican elected officials. Scott Walker has gotten $2 million alone in contribution to his political campaign account from school privatization supporters. It is important that we set expectations for the quality of education our kids receive in the schools that we pay for. It is reasonable to expect consequences if expectations are not met. Unfortunately the efforts of Walker and his Republicans fall woefully short of protecting our children and tax dollars, instead putting ideology and political payback before helping our schools be the best that they can be.

(WTNH) — It’s no secret that college students are usually broke. We all know the price of tuition is high but there other ways you may be overspending without realizing. Tuition is a huge expense and there are alternatives. You can go to a community college to start and then switch to a university when you have a bit more direction. If that’s not something you want to do, there are other ways to save a lot of money on campus. Students are getting ready to move back on campus. Where they’ll be calling home could be costing them more than they realize. Connecticut money school coordinator Esther Jean-Marie says rent is one of the top college money-wasters. “People don’t realize it but living on campus is more expensive than your actual tuition a lot of the time,” she said. Forbes found you can cut costs by 25 percent if you move off-campus and share space with a buddy. Food is another big one! If you have access to a kitchen, Forbes says you’ll save $10,000 over four years by skipping the meal plan and cooking on your own. Save money by avoiding the campus book store. Basic supplies will be marked way up there for convenience. Get your stuff at stores like Target, Walmart or the Dollar store and definitely don’t buy your books there. “I always say, look to see if there’s a used book or rent it, sometimes your school library will have that book so you can use it that way, the book might be in a PDF file online, it’s smart to look to alternatives and save yourself money that way,” Jean-Marie said. There are also apps designed to save college students money like campus books to help you shop for a deal, and campus Foodz to narrow down the deals near your school. Another easy way to stretch your dollar is don’t forget students and teachers get a number of special discounts and deals at some restaurants and retailers. I found some of them for last weeks Freebie Friday.

They also now have a better chance of getting a full-time job in the Grand Rapids-based retailer's supercenters. They can save more for retirement. More are eligible to earn paid time off. And, in an industry where long-time workers may not be able to count on two days off in a row, they have a better chance at obtaining that. Those are among provisions from a new four-year contract approved in mid-August by three groups of employees, a move that prompted company officials and union leaders to agree this week that the outcome touches not just workers but also store operations. A contract that increases opportunity and pay for retail worker is worth watching in Michigan because of scale of the company and the number of people in the industry at a time when the state's unemployment rate is staying below 5 percent, and stores and restaurants in many areas experience staffing pressures. "I think it positions Meijer well in recruiting and attracting good workers," said John Cakmakci, president of Local 951  of the United Food and Commercial Workers. He continued: "It's a very competitive market for workers right now." While Meijer didn't address that specifically, a spokesman did touch on the relationship between staffing and customer satisfaction. "The key to our sustained growth is investing in our team and taking care of our customers," Meijer spokesman Frank Guglielmi said in a statement for an earlier article on MLive.com. "This new agreement, along with our continued focus on winning with our team, will help us do both." Meijer, based in Walker, is the 19th largest private company in the U.S., according to Forbes, with annual revenue of $16.1 billion. It is expanding in five other Midwest states, but about half of its stores - which totaled 223 when the chain announced a $400 million growth strategy this spring - are located in Michigan. Cost estimates for the new labor agreement weren't available Friday. Meijer declined to discuss the new contract, and Cakmakci said starting wages vary across the state, based on location. He called the investment "significant." The contract, he said, "is fairly complicated." It affects workers in the retail stores and distribution centers, as well as skilled trades in the stores. However, one change that may be visible at the customer level is that Meijer no longer will have "pass-through" departments - like the deli or bakery - that hire entry-level staff. Those new hires typically eye  positions elsewhere in the store, like the produce department, that may have higher pay or more hours. "They'd have a hard time keeping people," Cakmakci said of those departments. Other factors pressuring the industry besides low unemployment - notably in Metro Detroit and Ann Arbor -  include the intense competition for grocery sales, which have a low margin but can account for more than 55 percent of sales at discount retailers. National retailers are responding, making moves like Walmart, which has closed stores to improve profits, and Target, which cut its profit forecast this month. Yet retail remains a force in the job market. There are about 4.6 million retail salespeople in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics from a May 2005 report.  Another 3.5 million people work as cashiers, according to the BLS Combined, those retail positions account for 6 percent of all jobs in the U.S. A diagram of the longevity of Meijer employees in Michigan would look like an hourglass, Cakmakci said.  That is one reason why the timing of the contract could work in Meijer's favor if the job market continues to tighten. "There are a lot of senior people," he said, estimating up to 7,000 with 15 years or more. Very few have been there 5-10 years, he said. "Then there's a bucketload" with less than two years, he said. Creating a job situation that fits employees is important to them, Cakmakci said.  And Meijer has been willing to experiment with two-week scheduling and letting employees with seniority have a role in when they work. Corporate executives, including new President Rick Keyes, were "more than willing to work with us on this," Cakmakci said. Beyond that, Meijer will be posting available full-time jobs so that part-timers can consider the stores part of a career path. About one-third of hourly employees in Michigan are full-time. Wages may be one of the biggest deterrents to retail jobs. Nationally, the median hourly retail wage is $10. 47, or  $21,780 on a full-time annual basis. The median income for cashiers is $9.28 per hour. The new Meijer contract means that employees will reach top of scale in a shorter timeframe, which Cakmakci offered with a three-year example. Part-timers will pay less for health care, which full-timers will pay a slight increase. And paid time off also will be earned in a shorter timespan. The glimpse into employment of Michigan's top non-automotive retailer indicates that Meijer "is putting value back in employees," Cakmakci said.

Roughly Speaking: What's new in Washington and Baltimore? A lot. News Opinion Op-Eds Seeing Baltimore through a plastic lens Rafael Alvarez Op-ed: Seeing Baltimore through the plastic lens of an $11 disposable camera. I am the Daguerre of the Disposable, the Taber of the Throwaway. For the past 25 years, probably longer, I have documented Crabtown and those who dwell here with cheap cameras, the kind once plentiful at drug stores and gas stations before the rise of the smart phone. Of his life's work, the American photographer Charles Harbutt (1935-to-2015) said: "I tried to be a witness." Harbutt taught the craft throughout his career, and his eye for working class brides, anonymous travelers and the architecture of cheap hotels once inspired a young attorney to swap the annotated code for a camera and "a life of adventure and poverty." I am about to attempt the same with a group of young Baltimoreans, pointing the way to adventure in their own backyard minus the specious appeal of poverty, a condition with which some of the students are already well acquainted. The call to the classroom came earlier this summer from the Baltimore Youth Arts Film Program of Johns Hopkins University. "Are you the disposable camera guy?" I brightened: "I believe I am." Which led to a course being offered this fall to locals between the ages of 16 and 29: "Seeing Baltimore through the plastic lens of an $11 camera." The class will meet at the Patterson Theater, the 106-year-old Highlandtown movie house where my parents had their first date, doing business since 2003 as the Creative Alliance. The other day, at Matthew's Pizza across from the theater, I was challenged by a skeptical high school teacher to explain the difference (and thus the crux of instruction) between taking pictures with a disposable camera and doing the same with a phone. Reluctant to defend my belief that most everything I do is art "because I say it is," I sputtered something about the warmth of 35mm film versus the chill of digital, and the constrictions of 27 exposures — not the freedom of unlimited choice, but the burden of discernment. But it wasn't enough. I didn't feel as though I had isolated the core of my obsession with disposable photography. By the time the waitress brought our meals, however, the answer had arrived: Anticipation. Anticipation made up of the wonder that comes with waiting and mystery. All of it the opposite of instant, the negative of our 21st century stride and strivings. In my house about a mile east of the Patterson is a porcelain enamel crab pot filled with a few dozen spent cameras, some more than a couple years old and possibly affected by age and heat. That's what happens when you shoot pictures more quickly than you can afford to have them developed. When a few extra dollars come my way, I fish a camera or two from the pot, blind to the images seared onto the celluloid inside. And then it's off to Walgreens where I buy the cameras for $11.99 each. They are apparently much cheaper at Walmart, but I don't shop at Walmart and thus the laughter that fell upon the Luddites might also be on me. I'm the fool who shells out $18 — about thirty bucks per roll when combined with the cost of the camera — for two sets of 4x6 inch prints and a CD of the pictures. As recently as last year, Walgreens also returned the negatives but no longer does. Again and again I return to the photo department, anxious to peek inside the thick cardboard envelope holding my pictures. And then: My goodness, what is that? Where is that? Most important: Who is that? Oh yeah, I remember. I recently lost a dear friend, a woodworker and National Parks Service employee named Wink Hastings. After he passed, a mutual friend told me she cherishes the photo I took of her and Wink one morning when I happened upon them with a disposable camera. Most likely I delivered the picture as is my custom, by putting a stamp on the back and addressing it with a quick note of affection. What will I teach my students? Wait and see. Rafael Alvarez is the author of "Tales from the Holy Land," a collection of short stories. Alvarez will read from his fiction at noon on Oct. 1 at the Creative Alliance on Eastern Avenue.

Because so many of the items being marked down are seasonal, it can be advantageous to shop early to have a bigger selection and to have the items you buy on hand to use during the Labor Day weekend, Shelton said. However, if you can hold out until Labor Day weekend, you’ll find the best sales, said Howard Schaffer, general manager of coupon and deal site Offers.com. Here are 17 things — from appliances to summer apparel — that you can get the best prices on during these Labor Day sales. Cars If you're in the market for a new car, you typically can find a great Labor Day car sales. Dealerships tend to offer a variety of deals — from cash-back rebates to zero percent financing — to move cars off their lots before new models arrive in the fall, according to Kelley Blue Book. For example, Toyota is offering $2,500 cash back on 2016 Camry purchases as part of its annual clearance event. Travel Travel sites are often the first to start offering Labor Day deals, perhaps to take advantage of people trying to book a late summer getaway, said DealNews editor Benjamin Glaser. For example, Hotels.com started offering 12 percent off bookings of $300 or more as of mid-August, he said. In general, fall is a good time to travel because it’s shoulder season in many parts of the country — the period after the peak summer travel season and the holidays when prices drop. How To: Get Cheap Airline Tickets Summer Apparel The best Labor Day sales are on summer apparel, which accounted for almost one-third of all Labor Day deals last year, Glaser said. “Look for up to 85 percent off at all your favorite brands and stores, especially department stores,” he said. In some parts of the country, you might be able to continue wearing warm-weather clothing for a couple of months. Or take advantage of sales to stock up for next year. Avoid the temptation to buy fall fashions because they’ll be at their highest prices of the season, Schaffer said. Wait until Black Friday sales to save up to 30 percent or hold off until December to save as much as 80 percent. Shoes Retailers will be marking down shoes along with summer apparel. Some of the best discounts are on running shoes from brands such as Nike, Reebok and Sperry, according to DealNews. Also look for deals from online retailers such as 6pm.com and higher-end brands such as Cole Haan and Kenneth Cole, which offer discounts of up to 70 percent. School Supplies Labor Day sales offer a great chance to get pens, pencils, notebooks and other school supplies at low prices. “It's a good time to stock up for back-to-school as retailers are trying to clear their stock,” said Amy Chang, lifestyle savings expert for Slickdeals. You might find items such as packs of crayons or pens marked down for a limited time to just one cent at office supply stores, she said. You also can expect retailers to mark down some school supplies to just $1 during Labor Day sales, Shelton said. Backpacks Your kids will need something to carry all those school supplies in, too. Labor Day is a good time to get a great deal on a backpack. Expect to find backpacks marked down more than 60 percent, Shelton said. For example, Best Buy marked down a Targus Shasta Laptop Backpack from $29.99 to $9.99. Laptop Computers You’ll find deals on Apple computers — just not at the Apple store, according to DealNews. The best sales will be at other retailers, such as Best Buy. Plus, Best Buy offers even deeper discounts for students who sign up for its College Student Deals. Currently, it’s offering $150 off MacBook and iMac purchases. Major Appliances During September and October, manufacturers release new models of major appliances, Schaffer said. To clear the way for the latest products, retailers will mark down stoves, refrigerators, washers and dryers by as much as 40 percent during Labor Day sales. Check out sales at Sears, Best Buy and Home Depot — which had the best discounts on appliances last year, he said. Grills With summer coming to an end, retailers will mark down seasonal items such as grills. It’s typical to find discounts of 20 percent to 30 percent during Labor Day, Shelton said. However, some retailers will discount grills by as much as much as 80 percent, Schaffer said. You’ll see some of the best grill deals at retailers such as Sears, Home Depot and Walmart, Schaffer said. Patio Furniture “As with grills, demand for patio furniture wanes after Labor Day,” Schaffer said. So retailers mark down outdoor dining and leisure furniture as much as 70 percent to clear it out of stores. You’ll likely find some of the best deals at Home Depot and Target, according to DealNews. Mattresses You can save up to 60 percent on mattresses during Labor Day sales, Shelton said. If you can find coupons, you might be able to save even more. Offers.com expects the best Labor Day mattress sales to be at Macy’s, Sears Outlet, JCPenney and Overstock. Lawnmowers You'll find great discounts on push mowers and riding mowers during home improvement store's outdoor equipment clearance events over Labor Day weekend — with some deals already available, Shelton said. "Expect between $50 to $100 off regular prices, including the newer cordless lithium powered push mowers from brands like Greenworks and Kobalt," he said. Gardening Supplies As the summer heat eases, it can be a good time to get some yard work done. You can get the tools you need at a discount during Labor Day sales. In general, expect to find lawn and garden supplies marked down 25 percent to 75 percent, depending on the quality and brand, Shelton said. Cordless yard tools — such as trimmers, edgers and hedge cutters — will also be discounted up to 50 percent, he said. It might be better to buy many of these items after Monday when “extended” Labor Day coupons are released and prices are lowered even more, Shelton said. Be aware, though, that some items sell out of inventory during the holiday sales. In that case, ask a sales clerk where you're shopping to check if another store has it in stock and can ship it to the store where you are — while still honoring the clearance pricing, Shelton said. Swimwear The end of summer might not seem like the best time to buy swimwear. Despite not being able to use it for several months, it’s the ideal time to get a deal — and pick up a suit for next summer if your current one is showing signs of wear and tear from this summer. For example, Roxy is offering an extra 40 percent off sale items, with some suits just $11, Chang said. Televisions You don’t have to wait until Thanksgiving or Black Friday to get a good price on a TV. In fact, some of the lowest prices of the year on big-screen TVs, 55 inches or larger, can be found during Labor Day sales, according to DealNews. And you can expect Best Buy and Walmart to mark down 40-inch TVs below $200. Swing Sets If your kids have been begging for a swing set, Labor Day weekend is a good time to buy one. You’ll find a fairly large selection of lower-cost wooden swing sets and select higher-cost models marked down 10 percent to 20 percent during Labor Day — many with free delivery, Shelton said. A big selection of metal and plastic swing sets can be found on sale for as much as 50 percent off. “Shopping around a bit for these items can offer some significant savings,” he said. In particular, though, look for the best sales at home improvement and big-box retailers. Pools You’ll also find deals on above-ground pools during Labor Day sales at home-improvement stores and big-box retailers such as Walmart. The average discount will be 20 to 30 percent. However, there will be some pools marked down as much as 50 percent, but they will sell out quickly — especially smaller models priced below $150, Shelton said.

The theme for this year was “Circus, Circus.” MECHANICSVILLE — Clowns with red noses, a ringmaster, a man dressed as a lion and other circus-themed participants were in the Avenues’ 10th annual cruise Friday. “Everybody looks forward to it every year,” Rachael Sowers, an employee with Avenues, said. The Avenues is a human service organization that helps those with developmental and acquired disabilities. In all, 28 people participated. The theme changes from year to year, and the theme for Friday’s cruise was “Circus, Circus.” The cruise was started by staff member Gerry Suzadail. He liked the idea of the Great Pottsville Cruise and wanted to replicate it on a smaller scale. “I had no idea it would take off like it did,” he said. Jacquie Bell, site supervisor with PossAbilities Central, one of the Avenues sites, agreed the event is something everyone, from the families of those who use the services to spectators and staff, can enjoy. “The staff got very involved. The creations have gotten larger and more creative,” she said. Participants from the Avenues walked and rode their creations. Children from the Avenue Day Care also walked in the cruise. Family members cheered nearby. All participants received a certificate of participation. There were winners and runners-up in each of the three categories: best design, most original and best use of theme. Winners received a $50 Wal-Mart gift card while runners-up got a $25 gift card. An award also was given for best dressed staff. Rita Gallagher, 52, of Pottsville, wore large, pink sunglasses, an orange wig and a large multicolored tie. She seemed to be having fun, and Kristina Joy said events like the cruise allow those at the Avenues to see friends they might not usually have a chance to visit. The cruise had a time for socializing, games, face painting, a dunk tank and other fun events. Marty Rice was dressed as a ringmaster and walked inside a leopard cage during the cruise. Pearl Pominville, 62, of Shenandoah, was dressed as a bearded lady from Australia. She even had a long, gray beard to show off as one of the sideshow acts in the circus. “She was a big hit today,” Dana Breininger, a staff member, said. The following people won the costume contests: • Best design, Aly Sieck. Runner-up, James Biro. • Most original, Pearl Pominville. Runner-up, Cyprian Yablonsky and Jack Delano. • Best use of theme, Marty Rice. Runner-up, Rita Gallagher. • Best dressed staff, Patty Hartman.

This makes Asian Paints India’s most innovative company for 2016.  Only four other Indian companies including Hindustan Lever and Tata Consultanty Services were among the top 100 world list. Scoring is based on investors perception of which company they feel will come up with the next best innovation. According to Forbes release, the World’s Most Innovative Companies list were ranked on the basis of creative disruption and how new players come in, innovate and garner the attention of investors. As per a release from Forbes, “World’s Most Innovative Companies list demonstrates creative disruption and how new players come in, innovate and garner the attention of investors. Innovation upstarts Under Armour Inc. (No.6) and Monster Beverage Corp. (No. 7) are dethroning former innovation leaders in their field like Nike and Coca Cola (No. 93). The same could be said for Amazon (No. 11) outdistancing Walmart”. A nominated firm in the index needs seven years of being in business alongwith a market capitalisation of $10Billion.  The innovation premium, which is the ranking base, is the difference between the market cap and NPV of cash flows from existing businesses, which is calculated using HOLT, a proprietary algorithm from Credit Suisse.
