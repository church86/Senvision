File photo. Cambrian College business professor Brian Vendramin isn't surprised that a public dispute between retail giant Walmart and credit card collusus Visa has come to a close. But he is surprised by the timing. "I expected a resolution in early to mid November, before the start of the holiday shopping season," said Vendramin, an expert in retail business and marketing. He believes the announcement by Visa that the feud had ended was likely the result of sobering financial figures. "The Christmas numbers came in and there was a gap," said Vendramin. Walmart Canada officials said its spat with Visa was in response to the company's demands for lower service rates than what is charged to other businesses.  In July 2015, the retailer stopped accepting Visa payments at its Thunder Bay stores. Walmart's stepped up the dispute in October, expanding the no-Visa policy to its 16 stores in Manitoba, and warning it would phase out Visa all together at all of its 400 stores in Canada. The dispute quickly became a public feud between the two companies, with Visa firing back by offering cardholders in Manitoba a reward for buying their groceries somewhere other than Walmart.  This is currently no information on what led to the resolution. "We may never know the details of the agreement," said Vendramin. "But somebody blinked." Vendramin was markedly critical of both parties in the dispute, saying in the era of social media, the optics of airing dirty laundry in public are not good. "They'll try to paint the situation as David versus Goliath, but really it's Goliath versus Goliath." The statement by Visa indicated that Walmart would resume honouring their credit cards today.

Timothy Blake is charged with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking, CBS News says, and he has been booked without bond.  IN-STORE BEATING: Houston-area man accused in Walmart slaying CBS News says a woman told police on Nov. 2 that a man at Walmart, whom she described as "creepy" and "seemed to be lingering around her," walked up behind her and she felt something wet on her back and foot.  The woman then went into the bathroom, where she discovered it was a "sticky" substance, the report says. Ohio police got a similar call on Dec. 28 and noticed the same white pickup truck in the parking lot in surveillance video, the report says. Officers interviewed Blake, the owner of the truck. He allegedly told them that he threw egg yolks at the women, but he later admitted to masturbating into a syringe in his truck or in the Walmart bathroom, CBS News says.  YIKES!: Florida man accused of looking up women's skirts at Walmart   The affidavit obtained by CBS states Blake is married and that his wife was unaware of his actions. Blake reportedly told police that he blames his parents and said they molested him as a child.  He was charged on Dec. 30.

Holiday season is officially over. Schools, stores, bars — everything is open again and everybody is back to work. Not exciting? Indeed, I mean who wouldn’t want to stay at home for another week and unpack all the presents or watch more Christmas movies, even though we have seen them a hundred times already? Well, watching movies is fine, but I wouldn’t rush to unpack all of the presents. Did it ever happen to you, that after holidays you end up with two exactly identical coffee makers or pajamas that don’t fit you? It happened to me, and that was the time when I had to learn which stores have the best gifts return policy and how I can utilize this! In fact, 10 to 15 percent of holiday sales and merchandise are returned or exchanged, and millions of dollars are coming back on the shelves, according to the National Retail Federation. So to help you not to get stuck with unwanted gifts, here is the list of stores with their gifts return policy. 1. Wal-mart Even though by their official rules, they only accept returns within 90 days of purchase, you can still get your money back even after that date. As their main rule — a customer is always right. Another great part about their gifts return policy is that they don’t need receipts. Of course, Wal-mart would prefer you to have one, but again customer is always right. So, without a receipt, you will be able to get an even exchange, a cash refund, or a Wal-Mart gift card, depending on the amount of the purchase. However, be aware that it doesn’t always apply to returns of electronics. groceries, and some other items. [Image by NoDerog/iStock] 2. Nordstrom Officially, Nordstrom return policy is on a case-by-case basis “with the ultimate objective of making our customers happy.” In reality, though, they have one of the best return policies ever. Receipt or no receipt, they don’t care as long as you bought it at Nordstrom. They don’t have customer service or return counter; you can approach any sales associate and they would be happy to assist you. The only exception they have is regarding evening gowns because people used to utilize their kindness too much. So if you got your gift from Nordstrom and it doesn’t fit, don’t be scared to go there and take advantage of their great gifts return policy! 3. Macy’s Another department store which cares about its customers, by offering competitive gifts returns policy. They have posted their gift return policy online for better convenience. However, you should be aware that they have made some significant changes to it. For instance, Macy’s now requires all returns to be made in one year. They had to tighten their unlimited returns due to a high volume of fraud. Another catch is that you can’t return gifts for cash; you will be issued a gift card for the corresponding amount of money, if you have a gift receipt. If you don’t you still get a credit but it will be for the lowest selling price of the last 180 days. jetcityimage/iStock 4. Kohl’s Kohl’s refers to its return policy as “Hassle-Free Returns.” The same as in Wal-mart if you don’t have the receipt and paid in cash, you will receive a store credit, and the amount will be based on the lowest 13-week sale price. However, if you paid with a credit card they will refund the full money amount. Also, there are no time restrictions on your returns and refunds, so don’t be ashamed to take that extra coffee maker back! 5. Target Target’s policy is the strictest one on this list. Also, it varies depending on what you have purchased and its condition. For example, Target brand items unopened and unused can be returned within one year; music, video games, and movies cannot be returned but may be exchanged. The most important rule in their gifts return policy is that items purchased between November 1 and December 25 are subject to a 30-day return period that starts Dec. 26. So hurry up if you got something from Target. I hope this guide will help you to save some money and get rid of the unwanted gifts!

Details of the agreement, which was announced Thursday and ended a months-long dispute between the two corporate behemoths, have not been provided by the companies. But Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the CFIB, says he suspects Walmart was able to negotiate a reduction in merchant fees—a move that could impact smaller merchants. “Typically whenever there is a special deal created for one large merchant, it happens at the expense of smaller merchants,” he said, explaining that credit card companies and banks customarily look for different ways to make up lost fee revenue. “We’re going to have to watch this really closely to see if this special deal for Walmart comes with higher prices for other smaller merchants.” Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said the company’s agreement with Walmart is specific to that retailer and doesn’t affect other merchants. “As previously announced, we have implemented rate changes aimed at lowering costs for businesses in Canada several times,” Hindman said in an email. MORE FEES: Where Will Credit Card Fees Go From Here? » In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba, where it has 16 stores. The retail giant had been planning to phase out the cards at all of its 400 stores in Canada. But after reaching a deal with the credit card company, Walmart resumed accepting Visas at its Thunder Bay and Manitoba stores on Friday. Kelly says CFIB, which represents over 109,000 business owners across the country, will continue to lobby Visa and other credit card companies for lower merchant fees for small- and medium-sized companies. “Small firms have complained for many years about the high cost of credit card processing fees, just like Walmart has,” Kelly said. On average, interchange fees in Canada are 1.5%, according to the Retail Council of Canada, which represents retailers including Walmart. “It is a significant cost for the merchant community,” said David Wilkes, the council’s senior vice-president of government relations and the grocery division. “Those costs have an inflationary impact on product costs and consumer purchases.” The Canadian fees are much higher than they are in many other jurisdictions, said Wilkes, citing France as an example. There, merchants pay interchange fees of around 0.3%, he said. The Finance Department has said it’s reviewing merchant fees to determine whether the costs and benefits are appropriate. In 2014, Visa and MasterCard agreed to limit interchange fees to an average of 1.5% for five years.

ShoeBuy’s inventory includes more than 1 million items across 800 brands. (Bigstock Photo) Walmart is already using its deep pockets to help recent acquisition Jet.com compete with Amazon in online apparel. Walmart on Thursday announced it acquired Boston-based ShoeBuy, a competitor of Amazon-owned Zappos, for $70 million to help Jet beef up its shoe game. ShoeBuy, which was founded in 1999 as one of the first companies to sell shoes online, will remain independent and CEO Mike Sorabella will stay on. Prior to the purchase, ShoeBuy was owned by IAC, a New York-based media company whose chairman is Expedia chairman Barry Diller. Walmart purchased Jet in August for $3.3 billion.The deal combined an ambitious e-commerce startup with a physical retail giant, both of whom have struggled to dent Amazon’s online business on their own. ShoeBuy’s inventory of more than 1 million items spread across 800 brands, including shoes, clothing, accessories and bags, will help bolster Jet’s presence in the apparel arena. The clothing market is highly fragmented, with 45 percent of all sales coming from outside the top 15 players in the industry, according to a recent report from Cowen & Co. That leaves room for Walmart-Jet to make a move in the industry, but Cowen sees Amazon becoming the top clothing retailer in the U.S. this year. Just in the last couple days, it has come out that Amazon is looking at creating its own line of activewear, and the online retail giant is among those interested in acquiring bankrupt retailer American Apparel.

In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba.  (Toronto Star File)   By The Canadian Press Fri., Jan. 6, 2017 The head of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says he is concerned that a deal struck between Walmart Canada and Visa over merchant fees could lead to higher costs for smaller businesses. Details of the agreement, which was announced Thursday and ended a months-long dispute between the two corporate behemoths, have not been provided by the companies. But Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the CFIB, says he suspects Walmart was able to negotiate a reduction in merchant fees — a move that could impact smaller merchants. “Typically whenever there is a special deal created for one large merchant, it happens at the expense of smaller merchants,” he said, explaining that credit card companies and banks customarily look for other ways to make up lost fee revenue. “We're going to have to watch this really closely to see if this special deal for Walmart comes with higher prices for other smaller merchants.” Article Continued Below CFIB, which represents over 109,000 business owners across the country, will continue to lobby Visa and other credit card companies for lower merchant fees for small- and medium-sized companies, Kelly added. In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba, where it has 16 stores. As of Friday, Walmart resumed accepting Visa at those stores. Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said the company's agreement with Walmart is specific to that retailer and doesn't affect other merchants. “As previously announced, we have implemented rate changes aimed at lowering costs for businesses in Canada several times,” Hindman said in an email.

According to CBS News, Timothy Blake was charged December 30th with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of menace by stalking.  Officials say they first received a report on Nov. 2, from a woman who said she was shopping at Walmart when she noticed a man she described as “’creepy,’ who seemed to be lingering around her,” according to an arrest affidavit obtained by CBS News.  She said the man walked to within a few inches behind her and she then felt something wet on her lower back and foot. She “began to panic” and rushed to a bathroom where she discovered the substance was “sticky,” when she left the bathroom, she allegedly saw the man continuing to watch her. Police said surveillance video from the store showed the man squirting the woman. On Dec. 28, police received a similar report from a different woman. Surveillance video from both incidents showed the suspect driving away in a pickup truck that was spotted two days later by Marietta Police. Officers approached the vehicle’s owner, Blake, and asked to question him. The 26-year-old at first allegedly told police he had thrown egg yolks at the women, but when an officer told him they had tested the material, he allegedly admitted it was semen.  He then said he had used syringes to spray egg, spit or semen on women on a dozen occasions, according to the affidavit. Blake allegedly said that before each incident, he masturbated into the syringe either in his vehicle or in the Walmart bathroom. He allegedly said he aimed for the buttocks of his victims. In the case of the victim on Nov. 2, Blake allegedly said he targeted her because he believed “she displayed exhibitionist characteristics and wanted to be noticed,” according to the affidavit. “The defendant stated maybe it was his way of having sex with these women,” police wrote in the affidavit. Blake is married, according to the affidavit, but said his wife was unaware of these incidents. Police said he also blamed his parents, who he said molested him when he was a child. Blake was booked into jail without bond, pending his arraignment. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Brewer, 54, has been with Wal-Mart since 2006 and has been Sam’s Club CEO since 2012. She first worked for Wal-Mart as a regional vice president of operations in Georgia, and would be promoted to president of what was then designated Walmart East. Prior to Wal-Mart, Brewer worked as a scientist with Kimberly-Clark Corp. for 22 years, eventually becoming president of the Global Nonwovens Sector. She earned a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Spelman College. The retirement agreement shows that Brewer will remain a Wal-Mart employee through January 2019. She will receive $1.9 million in several payments for the next two years, and almost 30,000 in restricted shares will be made available to Brewer when she leaves the company in 2019. The value of those shares in current dollars is around $2 million. As part of the agreement, Brewer turns back to Wal-Mart 145,733 shares. She is also prevented from participating in a business “that competes with the Company that exceeds certain revenue thresholds, and from soliciting the Company’s associates for employment,” according to Wal-Mart’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Furner, 42, who has served as chief merchandising officer for Wal-Mart Stores, now manages all merchandising for Sam’s Club including global sourcing, packaging and private label products. He joined Wal-Mart as an hourly employee in 1993 and worked his way up from management intern to a divisional merchandise manager in 2006. His travels through the corporate ranks included being senior vice president and chief merchandising officer for Walmart China. Furner has a bachelor’s degree in marketing management from the University of Arkansas. Brewer’s Struggles, Technology Push Brewer has been a champion for diversity in the workplace in a sector that is still largely male in top executive roles. Brewer noted in the release she is seeking “a new challenge” with this move. Brewer was also able to shepherd in technology throughout the club shopping experience working with Walmart.com’s team in San Bruno and eventually getting their own digital executive in Jamie Iannone, president and CEO of SamsClub.com, the e-commerce business for Sam’s Club since 2014. Since that time, Sam’s Club has leaped ahead of Walmart in terms of technology applications used in clubs. Sam’s offered Click and Collect – online orders picked up in clubs – several years before Walmart U.S. The scan and go application that allows Sam’s members to shop and skip the checkout line was rolled out nationally last year. Walmart U.S. is still testing scan and go in some stores, but it’s not part of the Walmart app and requires customers to use another device and still go through a checkout process. Alan Ellstrand, associate dean of academic programs and research at the University of Arkansas, was not surprised to hear of Brewer’s exit. He said when Walmart promoted Brewer, a black female, to a top executive post the world took note, but the luster wore thin over the years as the retailer struggled to move the needle to Wal-Mart’s satisfaction. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said multiple times in recent years that Sam’s Club would need to do better with comp sales and overall performance. ‘Good Test’ for Furner Ellstrand said Walmart has looked at its Sam’s Club CEO position as a stepping stone in its larger executive trajectory. Because of that, the CEO post at Sam’s Club has been a revolving door of sorts and five years is about as long as anyone holds that post. Given that Brewer is not circulating back through Wal-Mart’s executive ranks likely indicates the retirement was not solely her idea, he added. When Charles Redfield, the chief operating officer for Sam’s Club under most of Brewer’s tenure as CEO, returned to Walmart to lead the retailer’s grocery division in 2016, Furner was brought in to Sam’s Club. Ellstrand said Furner is seen as an up and comer in the Wal-Mart corporate ranks and he’s taking over Sam’s Club at a time when the bar is low, unlike Brewer who came at a high bar, left by Brian Cornell. Then the 51-year-old Cornell exited Sam’s Club in 2012 to take a similar post with PepsiCo Americas and in 2014, the 54-year old Cornell became CEO for Target, a position he still holds. “It’s a great opportunity for Furner to demonstrate his ability to lead and if he succeeds in this post, there are bigger jobs to be had at Walmart,” Ellstrand said. “Running Sam’s Club is a good test for future leaders at Walmart. It’s like being governor before serving as president.” Wal-Mart made the announcement public on Friday and sent an internal memo to its employees. In the memo, McMillon had this to say about Furner: “In John, we see someone who loves the company and our associates, has learned the business from the bottom up and across, and has the desire to lead change which is so necessary in today’s environment.” Sam’s Club is a members-only warehouse club that posted fiscal 2016 revenue of $57 billion and has around 110,000 employees in more than 650 stores. The smallest of Wal-Mart’s three business units, Sam’s Club business accounted for about 12% of the company’s fiscal 2016 net sales.

Brewer, the first woman and the first African American to run a top Wal-Mart business, will leave on Feb. 1 to take on a "new challenge", according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Brewer, 54, a champion of diversity within the workplace, came under fire after she alluded that she saw a problem with an all Caucasian male staff at a Sam's Club supplier. The comments, made during a CNN interview in December, was seen by some critics as promoting workplace racism, triggering hashtags "#boycottsamsclub" and "#boycottracistsamsclub". Under Brewer's five-year tenure as CEO, Sam's Club's sales rose 5.6 percent to $56.2 billion. The unit's same-store sales growth beat analysts' estimates in the past three quarters. Furner, currently the chief merchandising officer at Sam's Club, joined Wal-Mart in 1993. Furner, 42, has served in various capacities, including as the chief merchandising officer of Walmart China. "In John, we see someone who loves the company and our associates, has learned the business from the bottom up and across, and has the desire to lead change which is so necessary in today's environment," Wal-Mart's Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in the memo. Sam's Club, the smallest of Wal-Mart's three business units, operates membership-only warehouse clubs in 48 states in the United States and in Puerto Rico. The business accounted for about 12 percent of the company's fiscal 2016 net sales. The world's biggest retailer's shares were down 1.3 percent in afternoon trading on Friday and was the top percentage loser among Dow stocks.

(NYSE:WMT), intent on competing with Amazon, has acquired a major online shoe retailer via a subsidiary, it announced yesterday. Walmart-owned Jet.com bought ShoeBuy for $70 million, in a move that mirrors Amazon’s big acquisition of Zappos several years ago. That purchase put Amazon front-and-center in the online shoe world, and WMT is now clearly wants to enjoy similar positioning. From CNET: Jet said it bought ShoeBuy through its parent Walmart from media and internet company IAC, in a deal that closed Dec. 30. It said ShoeBuy is a leading online seller of shoes, clothes and accessories, stocking more than a million items. ShoeBuy will operate as a standalone site, but its suppliers have the option of expanding to sales on Jet too, the company said. ShoeBuy CEO Mike Sorabella, his executive team and the company’s more than 200 employees will continue to be based in Boston, Massachusetts. Walmart acquired online retailer Jet.com last year for $3.3 billion, proving that online expansion was its main priority. It plans to invest billions more into e-commerce, while correspondingly slowing its new store openings. Wal-Mart shares were unchanged in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, WMT has gained 0.13%, versus a 1.28% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. WMT currently has an StockNews.com POWR Rating of B (Buy), and is ranked #5 of 20 stocks in the Grocery/Big Box Retailers category. This article is brought to you courtesy of StockNews.com.

(Jeff Walters/CBC) Related Stories Walmart to lift ban on Visa after settling of fee dispute 'They're going to war' — Thunder Bay, Ont., ground zero in Visa vs. Walmart fight Walmart's staredown with Visa gets real today, as cards no longer accepted at 3 Ontario stores Walmart in Thunder Bay, Ont., will no longer accept Visa come Monday Walmart no longer taking VISA cards at Thunder Bay stores New front open in Walmart's war with Visa, as cards will soon be banned in Manitoba The Walmart-Visa standoff: Who's winning? Walmart ban on accepting Visa won't last, expert says Goliath vs. Goliath: consumers caught in middle of high-stakes fee fight between Visa and Walmart Thunder Bay's Walmart stores will once again Visa cards starting this morning. The world's largest retailer and the world's biggest credit card company reached an agreement that would see stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., once again accept the cards. The announcement came as a surprise to many shoppers outside one of the city's three Walmarts. "I thought they were trying to make a point of trying to get rid of Visa, so it's kind of funny that Visa's back," said Rebecca Taddeo as she loaded groceries from her shopping cart into her car. "I honestly use debit most of the time, I try not to use credit. But, I do have a Visa and I did find it quite inconvenient when they didn't offer it. I mean, it didn't stop me from coming here, but we do get a lot of rewards and points with our Visa." At the heart of the dispute were the fees charged by Visa to retailers like Walmart. The big box store said Visa's fees were too high. Visa told Walmart that the 'interchange fees' charged to the retailer were some of the lowest on all its cards. One of dozens of Visa billboards in Thunder Bay, Ont., is located right next to the city's largest Walmart store. The two retail and credit card giants were locked in a battle over interchange fees. (Jeff Walters/CBC) "It was kind of a silly idea I guess for them to drop it, I try not to use mine as much as I can," said Brian Neureuther. "But, I'm sure there's a lot of people that have only have a Visa or use it a lot for groceries and stuff." The impact of the spat between Walmart and Visa is difficult to quantify, but the credit card giant took out ads in local newspapers, as well as many billboards around Thunder Bay to promote the card. "I noticed there's lots of signs all around Thunder Bay saying 'we accept visa, use your visa,' or even at Toys R' Us they were offering extra bonus bucks if you used your Visa."

Customers in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario, will be able to use their Visa credit card starting January 6, 2017," Wal-Mart echoed in a statement on their website. HAVE YOUR SAY: Are you more likely to shop at Wal-Mart now that its dispute with Visa has been resolved? https://t.co/LAN4yaQXOK — BusinessNewsNetwork (@BNN) January 6, 2017 That set off a widely watched battle within the retail sector that intensified in October, when Wal-Mart expanded its policy of rejecting Visas to its 16 stores in Manitoba. The retail giant had said it was planning to expand its phase-out of Visa to all of its 400 stores in Canada. The months-long dispute became so heated that at one point Visa offered its cardholders in Manitoba a reward for buying their groceries somewhere other than Wal-Mart. It launched an advertising campaign in November offering Manitoba Visa cardholders a $10 credit if they spent $50 or more at grocery stores. The campaign didn't explicitly mention Wal-Mart or the fee dispute, but a Visa spokeswoman said at the time that the company was hoping to ease any inconvenience for Visa cardholders who can't use their cards everywhere that they want to. Visa ran a similar ad in Thunder Bay, promising cardholders there with a $25 credit for every grocery purchase of $75 or more. Visa previously said it had offered Wal-Mart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country, and that if it gave in to the retailer's demands then other merchants would want a reduction in their fees, as well.

Wall Street isn't optimistic about either retailer right now, and that could spell opportunity for long-term investors. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 5, 2017 at 9:07PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) each have a nagging growth problem. For Wal-Mart, its customer traffic trends consistently trail rival Costco's (NASDAQ:COST). Lowe's, meanwhile, can't seem to break Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) tight grip on the home improvement market. However, investors shouldn't ignore retailers simply because they are outshined in some areas by rivals. In fact, these out-of-favor stocks tend to be available at attractive valuations that leave plenty of room for market-beating gains. With that in mind, let's look at these two companies as potential buy candidates. Here are a few key statistics to get us started: Metric Wal-Mart Lowe's Market cap $212 billion $62 billion Sales growth 1.4% 3.9% Net profit margin 3% 3.9% Dividend yield 2.9% 2% Return on invested capital 15% 13.6% Price-to-sales ratio 0.45 1 Price-to-earnings ratio 15 26  52-week price performance 13% (5%) Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Sales growth and return on invested capital are for the past nine months and exclude fuel sales and exchange rate changes.  Growth slowdown Wal-Mart's biggest achievement over the past few years has been a steady rebound in its customer traffic trends. Shopper transactions ticked higher for the eighth consecutive time last quarter, and while its 0.7% increase trailed Costco's 2.4% jump, Wal-Mart clearly has momentum on its side. Improved average spending per visit and e-commerce sales both contributed to a near-3% revenue boost in its U.S. stores last quarter, which equates to $2 billion of extra revenue. Image source: Getty Images. Lowe's is enjoying faster growth, but only because its industry is in a sharp upswing. Comparable-store sales are up 3.9% through the first three quarters of 2016. Home Depot enjoyed nearly twice that growth pace, which is one reason why Lowe's management isn't happy with its recent performance. "Traffic slowed more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October," CEO Robert Niblock told investors. Unlike Home Depot and Wal-Mart, Lowe's is getting help from a growing store footprint that pushes sales higher. Yet its latest results suggest it is losing more ground to rivals while Wal-Mart is winning back some share. Profits heading lower Wal-Mart's 3% profit margin makes it significantly more profitable than Costco. However, its earnings power is under considerable pressure that could stick around for years. Over the short term, profits have plunged as the retailer plowed cash into initiatives aimed at improving the customer shopping experience through higher employee wages and better stocked shelves. Rising shopper satisfaction scores and increased customer visits are the key benefits of those moves, but they came at a significant cost. Operating income fell 11% over the last full fiscal year. Lowe's isn't faring any better. In fact, its profitability has slumped as the retailer increasingly turns to price cuts to protect its sales growth. Its 3.9% net margin is less than half of Home Depot's. LOW Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. The better buy Investors can buy Lowe's at about 1 times sales, or well below Home Depot's ratio of 1.8. Similarly, Wal-Mart is available at 0.45 times the past year of revenue, compared to 0.59 times sales for Costco. While both valuations represent significant discounts, I'm more optimistic about a Wal-Mart purchase today. The retailing titan appears to have a good plan in place for protecting market share from traditional rivals and from e-commerce threats. Lowe's, on the other hand, has only seen its market share losses accelerate on challenges from a competitor that seems to have a much better read on its industry. Neither company is likely to wow shareholders with market-thumping operating results anytime soon. But Wal-Mart's sturdier traffic and profitability trends make it the better buy in this match up, in my view. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.

Timothy Blake has been charged with pandering obscenity, sexual imposition and two counts of “menace by stalking”. “The defendant stated maybe it was his way of having sex with these women,” a police affadavit seen by CBS News reportedly stated.  The first reported incident came in early November.  Mr Blake was allegedly spotted in his oilfield company's branded truck Getty A woman shopping in a Walmart, in Ohio, West Virginia, told investigators that a “creepy” man was “lingering around her”. She claimed he walked within a few inches behind her before she felt something wet on her lower back and foot. She “began to panic”, rushed to the bathroom, found a “sticky” substance.

Details of the agreement, which was announced Thursday and ended a months-long dispute between the two corporate behemoths, have not been provided by the companies. But Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the CFIB, says he suspects Walmart was able to negotiate a reduction in merchant fees  a move that could impact smaller merchants. Typically whenever there is a special deal created for one large merchant, it happens at the expense of smaller merchants, he said, explaining that credit card companies and banks customarily look for different ways to make up lost fee revenue. Were going to have to watch this really closely to see if this special deal for Walmart comes with higher prices for other smaller merchants. Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said the companys agreement with Walmart is specific to that retailer and doesnt affect other merchants. As previously announced, we have implemented rate changes aimed at lowering costs for businesses in Canada several times, Hindman said in an email. In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba, where it has 16 stores. The retail giant had been planning to phase out the cards at all of its 400 stores in Canada. But after reaching a deal with the credit card company, Walmart resumed accepting Visas at its Thunder Bay and Manitoba stores on Friday. Kelly says CFIB, which represents over 109,000 business owners across the country, will continue to lobby Visa and other credit card companies for lower merchant fees for small- and medium-sized companies. Small firms have complained for many years about the high cost of credit card processing fees, just like Walmart has, Kelly said. On average, interchange fees in Canada are 1.5 per cent, according to the Retail Council of Canada, which represents retailers including Walmart. It is a significant cost for the merchant community, said David Wilkes, the councils senior vice-president of government relations and the grocery division. Those costs have an inflationary impact on product costs and consumer purchases. The Canadian fees are much higher than they are in many other jurisdictions, said Wilkes, citing France as an example. There, merchants pay interchange fees of around 0.3 per cent, he said. The Finance Department has said its reviewing merchant fees to determine whether the costs and benefits are appropriate. In 2014, Visa and MasterCard agreed to limit interchange fees to an average of 1.5 per cent for five years.

Details of the agreement, which was announced Thursday and ended a months-long dispute between the two corporate behemoths, have not been provided by the companies. But Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the CFIB, says he suspects Walmart was able to negotiate a reduction in merchant fees — a move that could impact smaller merchants. “Typically whenever there is a special deal created for one large merchant, it happens at the expense of smaller merchants,” he said, explaining that credit card companies and banks customarily look for different ways to make up lost fee revenue. “We’re going to have to watch this really closely to see if this special deal for Walmart comes with higher prices for other smaller merchants.” Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said the company’s agreement with Walmart is specific to that retailer and doesn’t affect other merchants. “As previously announced, we have implemented rate changes aimed at lowering costs for businesses in Canada several times,” Hindman said in an email. In July, Walmart began refusing Visa credit cards at its three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont., citing excessive fees. In October, it extended that ban to Manitoba, where it has 16 stores. The retail giant had been planning to phase out the cards at all of its 400 stores in Canada. But after reaching a deal with the credit card company, Walmart resumed accepting Visas at its Thunder Bay and Manitoba stores on Friday. Kelly says CFIB, which represents over 109,000 business owners across the country, will continue to lobby Visa and other credit card companies for lower merchant fees for small- and medium-sized companies. “Small firms have complained for many years about the high cost of credit card processing fees, just like Walmart has,” Kelly said. On average, interchange fees in Canada are 1.5 per cent, according to the Retail Council of Canada, which represents retailers including Walmart. “It is a significant cost for the merchant community,” said David Wilkes, the council’s senior vice-president of government relations and the grocery division. “Those costs have an inflationary impact on product costs and consumer purchases.” The Canadian fees are much higher than they are in many other jurisdictions, said Wilkes, citing France as an example. There, merchants pay interchange fees of around 0.3 per cent, he said. The Finance Department has said it’s reviewing merchant fees to determine whether the costs and benefits are appropriate. In 2014, Visa and MasterCard agreed to limit interchange fees to an average of 1.5 per cent for five years.

(WMT) Stock Is a Long-Term Risk With BIG Upside This perceived threat to Walmart stock actually presents a potentially appealing opportunity By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Jan 4, 2017, 11:10 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 7 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks That Are Dead Weight Right Now Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(HOV) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks Don’t Sweat Analysts’ Unenthused Response to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Battery Factory Bank of America Corp (BAC) Q4 Justifies Months of Buying View All Posts Although most stocks have mustered big gains since Trump was elected President in early November, a handful of names have largely been left out of the rally. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of those laggards. Since Nov. 9, the S&P 500 has advanced an impressive 5.8%, while Walmart stock is down just a bit, and testing the waters of lower lows. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr The culprit for the weakness from WMT stock (while everything else did well) is mostly rooted in concerns that Trump’s campaign promise to impose sizeable tariffs on foreign-made goods imported into the United States … Chinese-made goods in particular. Such a move would hit Walmart right in the proverbial breadbasket, since it relies on inexpensive imported goods to provide low prices for its patrons. What if, however, the potential impact of a tariff war wasn’t likely to make as big of an impact on the per-share profitability of WMT stock as many have said it might? As it turns out, the worst of the concerns may be considerably overblown. WMT Stock: Higher Tariffs Loom The quick philosophy: If it costs more for Walmart to buy goods from overseas suppliers, the retailer will either pass those higher costs along to its shoppers, or be forced to simply “eat” the difference (or a combination of both). The former will crimp sales, as shoppers look elsewhere or do without those goods. The latter crimps net profit margins. Neither bodes well for the future value of Walmart stock. The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017 The precise size of any new tariff — if imposed — hasn’t been decided yet. At one point Trump had mentioned a tariff as high as 45% on any Chinese-made imports, though now with Peter Navarro tapped to head-up the National Trade Council and plans starting to solidify, the more plausible tariff on imports from China is apt to roll in somewhere between 5% and 10%. Those are more palatable numbers than the previously suggested 45% tariff, though it remains to be seen who exactly will shoulder the burden of the added costs; consumers don’t always respond as expected. Either way, even to the extent a new White House administration can impose tariffs on any and all imports from China, most critics and pessimists are overestimating the potential impact such a move may have on WMT stock. Conversely, they may be underestimating the headwind that may be created by a more global tariff. Fortunately, it may all be mostly irrelevant. Breaking Down the Numbers for Walmart Stock Although the debate over the potential fallout of new tariffs has been vigorous, little of that discussion has clarified that the looming tariffs would be imposed at the wholesale level rather than based on retail prices, and would only apply to foreign-made goods … and the difference is significant. While the exact figure isn’t known, experts believe WMT imported roughly $50 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2013. It’s unlikely that figure has changed much in the meantime. That’s not chump-change, but for perspective, over the course of the last twelve months, Walmart has driven company-wide sales of $484.6 billion. During that time, it spent a total of $360.5 billion to purchase the merchandise it sells. That’s right — only about 14% of the amount of money spent by WMT on its inventory comes from China. If that portion of its costs rises by a full 10%, then Walmart stock’s total cost of goods sold will rise by only 1.4%. That’s manageable. It’s perhaps even negligible. As they say though, there’s more to the story. If Trump’s import tariffs start and end with China, Walmart can blow it off. If instead the President-elect tacks on even a mere 5% tariff on any imports coming into the United States, a huge chunk of its inventory could become considerably more expensive. The specifics: Right now, two-thirds of its inventory in its U.S. stores — the bulk of its business — is made, sourced or grown domestically. The numbers aren’t perfectly clear, but the costs on the non-U.S.-made portion of its inventory subject to a new tariff of only 5% would raise its total cost of goods sold to 2% or more than its current merchandise costs as a percentage revenue, ramping it up from 74.4% of sales to something closer to 76.4% of sales — at least. That presents a considerable challenge. See, while most retailer’s profit margins are paper-thin, WMT’s are even thinner than usual. Over the course of the last four quarters, the company has only converted 3% of its sales into net income. Unless Walmart is able to cut costs elsewhere and/or pass those tariff costs along to its shoppers, per-share profits of WMT stock would be whittled back to little more than a breakeven. In other words, Walmart stock’s future largely depends on how far Trump is willing to go in his quest to put America first. Or, maybe it isn’t.

Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and its prized e-commerce subsidiary Jet.com have acquired Boston-based ShoeBuy for about $70 million from IAC. The deal was announced Thursday, but closed on December 30. Founded in 1999, ShoeBuy was one of the early companies to sell shoes online, along with competitors like Zappos.com, which was acquired in 2009 by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) for $1.2 billion. ShoeBuy founder Scott Savitz led the company until its 2006 sale to IAC. Savitz remained involved with ShoeBuy until 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile, and he is now managing partner at Data Point Capital in Boston. ShoeBuy has grown to more than 200 employees, who will remain based in Boston. ShoeBuy will continue operating as a standalone site that complements Jet’s website, according to a press release. ShoeBuy CEO Mike Sorabella and the rest of the management team will remain with the company, the release said. Jet—whose website sells a wide assortment of products—said the deal gives it access to an experienced e-commerce player with a large mix of products and “strong industry relationships,” among other benefits. ShoeBuy’s website carries more than 800 brands and over 1 million products, including shoes, clothing, and accessories, according to the press release. The release didn’t share ShoeBuy revenues. Scott Savitz speaks at a 2013 Xconomy event. Photo by Keith Spiro Photography. Although Savitz is no longer involved with ShoeBuy, Xconomy reached out to get his thoughts on the deal and what it means for his former company and the retail industry overall. “There are probably very good synergies with this,” Savitz said in an e-mail. “Jet.com gets access to the amazing representation of brands (and the relationships) Shoebuy.com has, and Shoebuy.com will get even wider distribution and other cost savings by partnering up with an 800-pound gorilla in Jet.com/Walmart.com.” For Walmart, ShoeBuy adds to its growing mix of e-commerce subsidiaries and technologies. In recent years, Walmart has spent billions on its online shopping strategy, which includes building its own data centers, increasing its online grocery offerings, and acquiring companies. Walmart’s most significant e-commerce move so far was its purchase of Hoboken, NJ-based Jet in August 2016 for $3.3 billion. The deal was seen as a way for the big box retailer to be more competitive with Amazon, but it was a big bet—Jet’s site had launched just a year earlier. Now, we’ll see if Jet and smaller acquisitions like ShoeBuy pay off. Walmart’s e-commerce efforts come during a challenging period for the company—its annual sales declined in 2015 for the first time since the retailer went public 45 years earlier. (Full-year financial results for 2016 haven’t been released yet.) Savitz thinks the ShoeBuy acquisition shows Walmart’s “commitment to the Internet and how people like to shop today,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see them buy more category leaders as they compete against Amazon and a changing retail environment.” Savitz is glad the ShoeBuy deal is structured so that his former company “will still enjoy enough independence” and that its employees will remain in Boston. “When you start these companies you hope they will create significant value for your employees, shareholders, and ultimately acquirers, and be very sustainable, real businesses,” Savitz said. “I couldn’t be prouder that ShoeBuy continues to do all these things and continues to have great impact on Boston … and in shaping Internet retail.” Jeff Engel is a senior editor at Xconomy.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More Walmart shopper injured while chasing ‘unsafe’ shopping cart sues for $500,000 Douglas Quan  01.05.2017 Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, with Walmart on the right and a parking garage on the left. ShareAdjustCommentPrint A Walmart shopper in Ontario who tripped and fell while chasing after a shopping cart that rolled away from her in a parking garage is seeking half a million dollars in damages. Sandra Cartini was returning to her car on Feb. 12, 2013, at the Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, after shopping at Walmart, according to court records. The parking garage consists of multiple “tiered slopes.” Cartini had her young son hold on to the cart while she opened the trunk. Her son let go of the cart and it began to roll away. Cartini alleged that as she ran after the cart, she tripped on “uneven pavement” and fell, hitting her head on the cart, causing permanent and serious injuries. Her statement of claim, which seeks $250,000 in general damages and $250,000 in special damages, lists Walmart Canada Corp., property manager OPGI Management GP Inc., and landlord Square One Property Corp., as defendants. According to court records, Cartini’s original lawyer initially put forward an argument that the defendants were negligent in the design, construction and maintenance of the parking garage (the “unsafe parking lot theory”). We’re not saying every Walmart should have shopping carts with a locking mechanism. But engineers hired by the defence said the parking garage complied with industry standards and showed no signs of disrepair. The defendants filed a motion asking for summary judgment — a quick resolution that saves everyone from going to trial. During a hearing on the motion, Cartini’s new lawyer put forward an alternate argument — the “unsafe shopping cart theory” — that contends Cartini would never have been hurt if the Walmart cart had stayed in place. Faranaz Siganporia argued that common sense dictates a shopping cart on any sloped surface poses an inherent risk and that it was foreseeable that a shopper could lose control of her cart. On Dec. 29, Ontario Superior Court Judge David Corbett dismissed the claim on the basis of the “unsafe parking lot theory” but allowed Cartini the opportunity to amend her claim to argue the “unsafe shopping cart theory,” agreeing that shopping carts without brakes “are an obvious hazard to ‘get loose.’ ” “On the face of it,” the judge said, “there is some argument for the plaintiff that there may be some liability” on the part of the defendants for her injuries. “I will grant the plaintiff one more opportunity to present a case that there is a triable issue. This will require (the plaintiff) to bring Walmart into the fray, and to obtain expert evidence in respect to this theory.” The plaintiff was given until the end of January to submit an amended claim. “We’re not saying every Walmart should have shopping carts with a locking mechanism,” Siganporia said in an interview Thursday. “But obviously Walmarts located where carts can be taken on inclined surfaces, they definitely should have a locking mechanism.” Walmart declined to comment, as did the lawyer representing the other defendants. • Email: dquan@postmedia.com | Twitter: dougquan Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon A Walmart shopper in Ontario who tripped and fell while chasing after a shopping cart that rolled away from her in a parking garage is seeking half a million dollars in damages. Sandra Cartini was returning to her car on Feb. 12, 2013, at the Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, after shopping at Walmart, according to court records. The parking garage consists of multiple “tiered slopes.” Cartini had her young son hold on to the cart while she opened the trunk. Her son let go of the cart and it began to roll away. Cartini alleged that as she ran after the cart, she tripped on “uneven pavement” and fell, hitting her head on the cart, causing permanent and serious injuries. Her statement of claim, which seeks $250,000 in general damages and $250,000 in special damages, lists Walmart Canada Corp., property manager OPGI Management GP Inc., and landlord Square One Property Corp., as defendants. According to court records, Cartini’s original lawyer initially put forward an argument that the defendants were negligent in the design, construction and maintenance of the parking garage (the “unsafe parking lot theory”). We’re not saying every Walmart should have shopping carts with a locking mechanism. But engineers hired by the defence said the parking garage complied with industry standards and showed no signs of disrepair. The defendants filed a motion asking for summary judgment — a quick resolution that saves everyone from going to trial. During a hearing on the motion, Cartini’s new lawyer put forward an alternate argument — the “unsafe shopping cart theory” — that contends Cartini would never have been hurt if the Walmart cart had stayed in place. Faranaz Siganporia argued that common sense dictates a shopping cart on any sloped surface poses an inherent risk and that it was foreseeable that a shopper could lose control of her cart. On Dec. 29, Ontario Superior Court Judge David Corbett dismissed the claim on the basis of the “unsafe parking lot theory” but allowed Cartini the opportunity to amend her claim to argue the “unsafe shopping cart theory,” agreeing that shopping carts without brakes “are an obvious hazard to ‘get loose.’ ” “On the face of it,” the judge said, “there is some argument for the plaintiff that there may be some liability” on the part of the defendants for her injuries. “I will grant the plaintiff one more opportunity to present a case that there is a triable issue. This will require (the plaintiff) to bring Walmart into the fray, and to obtain expert evidence in respect to this theory.” The plaintiff was given until the end of January to submit an amended claim. “We’re not saying every Walmart should have shopping carts with a locking mechanism,” Siganporia said in an interview Thursday. “But obviously Walmarts located where carts can be taken on inclined surfaces, they definitely should have a locking mechanism.” Walmart declined to comment, as did the lawyer representing the other defendants. • Email: dquan@postmedia.com | Twitter: dougquan Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

ON AIR NOW6:00 PM - 7:00 PMHealthworx Radio Walmart and Visa settle payment dispute Don Mitchell January 05, 2017 03:10 pm Walmart Canada and Visa have come to an agreement ending their six month dispute which saw some stores stop accepting Visa cards. Last July, Walmart shut down Visa payments at three stores in Thunder Bay, eventually spreading the practice to all their stores in Manitoba. This was the first step in a plan to discontinue accepting Visa cards across Canada over a dispute related to interchange fees. Interchange fees are an amount deducted from each purchase by the card-issuer (Visa) in a transaction executed by the participating retailer. Typically, consumers never see the fee since the retailer works it into the cost of products. In the feud, Walmart took a stand on Visa’s interchange fees believing they were too high stating that paying in excess of $100 million a year in fees was not fair. No terms of the new deal on interchange fees was disclosed on Thursday by either party, but the two companies did confirm cards would once again be accepted in Manitoba and Thunder Bay on Friday. Visa cardholders can once again use their Visa credit cards at all Walmart stores across Canada. https://t.co/MSqHXyoSNM — Visa News Canada (@VisaNewsCA) January 5, 2017 Trending More Latest More Vancouver Traffic Tweets by @AM730Traffic Current Traffic Incidents You May Also Like More News WATCH: Vancouver man lives in storage locker for two months 2 hours ago   It's not cheap to live in Vancouver, and many people have started to get creative with cost-saving...

Yet Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has been able to buck the trend. Then again, the company has massive scale and has also been investing aggressively in its e-commerce platform. As a result, Walmart stock has logged a decent 7% return during the past 12 months. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr So might there be more gains? Well, for the most part, there are still major headwinds – and one is downright tough to gauge. That is, Donald Trump’s trade policies. So far, it looks like there could be a tariff of 5% to 10% on imports, which could be done fairly quickly with an executive action. The goal is to help spur manufacturing and promote an “America first” policy. But it will likely make Walmart stock far from first. According to InvestorPlace.com’s James Brumley, the company imports about $50 billion in Chinese goods. While a tariff of 5% to 10% may not seem like a lot, it could still come to $5 billion. This leaves WMT in a tough position, such as to make a decision on raising prices or take a hit on margins. And of course, the company’s margins are already razor-thin, with the net income representing about 3% of overall revenues. 7 Cheap Stocks to Buy That Could Double in 2017 It is not clear-cut if anything will happen, however. Let’s face it, the Republican party has a long history of being pro free-trade. So there will likely be considerable pushback. Oh, and there are many U.S. companies that will ramp up their lobbying efforts. Regardless, all this uncertainty will probably be a negative for Walmart stock. If anything, expect lots of headlines that will cause anxiety for investors. Other Problems With Walmart Yet this is not the only nagging issue with Walmart stock. Keep in mind that growth has been lackluster. From 2012 to 2016, there was a mere 8% increase. Furthermore, during this period WMT was only able to churn out a gain of 16%. By comparison, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) logged a return of 47% and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) posted nearly a 100% increase. Part of the problem for WMT is that the revenue base is already massive, representing 7% of retail sales in the U.S. So it is downright tough to find revenue. It also does not help that about 55% of U.S. revenues for WMT comes from the groceries. The business has suffered from deflationary pressures as well as tough competitive forces — with fierce rivals like Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) — as the industry has consolidated.

(Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes) Share Written by Marc Bain Obsession Fashion January 07, 2017 Clothes took over as the top-selling category online in the US, and Amazon is cornering the market. Owner of sites such as Zappos, it’s set to become the largest apparel retailer in the US in 2017. Given that its apparel margins are higher than most other categories, according to analysts, that bodes well for future profits. Jet.com, the Walmart-owned, rapidly growing competitor, isn’t daunted. The company announced Jan. 5 that it has acquired ShoeBuy.com, a Zappos rival with more than 800 brands and a product assortment that also includes clothes and accessories. The $70 million deal closed at the end of 2016. The move lets Jet quickly establish a presence in that valuable online market for shoes and apparel, even if it won’t dethrone Amazon anytime soon. ShoeBuy will continue to operate as a standalone site, according to Walmart’s press release, and brands will have the option to sell through Jet directly, giving it a potentially profitable foothold in a high-margin space. And Jet gets those 800 brand relationships. Marc Lore, Jet’s cofounder, told Recode it’s a safe bet that Jet and Walmart will look for other acquisitions of this sort “in the categories where they are long-tail, high-margin products and harder-to-crack brands.” The $70 million price tag looks low, given ShoeBuy’s estimated revenue of $315 million in 2013, suggesting sales are down or the company isn’t very profitable. But Lore believes Walmart’s relationships and logistics operations can give ShoeBuy’s business a boost, helping it to grow more valuable despite a market filled with competitors. An earlier version of this article misidentified Marc Lore as ShoeBuy’s cofounder instead of Jet’s cofounder. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search Post to Cancel

Take the Pledge to stop distracted driving. Courtesy of Fanelli, Evans & Patel, P.C. By Frank Andruscavage / Published: January 7, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     SAINT CLAIR — A 4-year-old boy died from injuries he suffered in a crash in Saint Clair on Thursday afternoon. The crash occurred about 12:15 p.m. at the intersection of Route 61 and Terry Rich Boulevard, the entrance to the Wal-Mart plaza, and also caused injuries to three other people, all adults. Saint Clair police Sgt. Joseph Leskin Jr., the investigating officer, on Friday released the names of those involved. Leskin said the investigation indicates that Franklin Krammes, 36, of Pottsville, was driving a Nissan minivan and attempted to make a left turn from Route 61 south to enter the Wal-Mart plaza. Leskin said the Krammes vehicle was struck on the passenger’s side by a northbound Ford F-150 truck driven by Maryann Rhody, Schuylkill Haven. The impact happened in the middle of the intersection and both vehicles sustained extensive damage, Leskin said. Leskin said Krammes and a front seat passenger in his vehicle — Brenda Covach, 54, of Saint Clair — along with Rhody were taken to a Pottsville hospital by Schuylkill EMS for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries. Issac Krammes, 85 Macomb Street, New Philadelphia, who was a back seat passenger in the Krammes vehicle, was flown from the scene by helicopter to Lehigh Valley Hospital, Cedar Crest. Leskin said the child was pronounced dead at 5:24 p.m. at Lehigh Valley Hospital from blunt force back and neck injuries, according to Lehigh County Coroner Scott Grim. Assisting at the scene were Port Carbon police, state police from the Frackville station, and Saint Clair firefighters and fire police. Leskin said the investigation is ongoing and asks that anyone who may have witnessed the crash to call Saint Clair police at 570-429-3050.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

She was just one of the many volunteers who helped raise more than $360,000 surpassing the army's goal. JUSTIN PARSONS/St. Albert Gazette Donations are up and still rolling in after a successful Salvation Army holiday kettle drive. The Salvation Army campaigns rolled out across the region on Nov. 14 and the local branch surpassed its fundraising goal of $350,000 by more than $10,000. During the holiday season the local office, which includes St. Albert, Spruce Grove and Stony Plain, collected $360,911. This is up from last years total of $324,560. Donations are way up considering they keep telling us the economy is really bad, Maj. Terry Cook, pastor and core officer at the Salvation Army said. The people of St. Albert must have really dug deep. I suspect that when the economy goes a little bit south, people know that there are more people hurting so they are just a little more generous. In total the organization had nine kettles out in St. Albert to raise money, but they had trouble finding the volunteers to staff them. There were days when the organization could not put out all of their kettles because of volunteer shortages. The group had particular trouble filling the shifts in Stony Plain and had one kettle only sporadically manned during the season. The group had arrangements at other locations but were not able to set up due to a lack of volunteers. I dont know if the people realize the money raised there, stays there, said Kellie McTaggart, Community Services Coordinator for the Salvation Army. In a typical day each kettle requires five two-hour shifts, running from Monday to Saturday. McTaggart said there were a lot of volunteers who did a lot of shifts but they needed more manpower. All the money raised over the holiday season will go into the community and family services budget which goes directly towards community programs and services. The money will also help support clients in St. Albert and surrounding areas. The fundraising dollars were especially needed this year. The organization just started the Feed the Lambs program, which provides breakfast for students in need at 14 elementary schools in the community. The Salvation Army is looking to expand the program next fall and will need more donations to expand into more schools. The organization is also supporting 1,300 members of the community through direct client assistance, which is higher than in previous years. The Salvation Army accepts cash donations year-round. To donate mail a cheque to the local branch or stop by and give cash, debit or credit. The Salvation Army is located at 165 Liberton Drive in St. Albert and they can be reached at 780-458-1937.

St George News+ 45 53/33 Mon 47/30 Tue 50/32 News short: Man found dead in his truck at Wal-Mart identified Written by Ric Wayman January 3, 2017 Washington police officers found a man deceased in his car Tuesday afternoon at Wal-Mart. Washington, Utah, Jan. 3, 2017 | Photo courtesy of Holly Blaha, St. George News WASHINGTON — Officers responded to the Washington Wal-Mart Tuesday afternoon and found a man dead in his vehicle. A man was discovered dead in his truck Tuesday at the Washington Wal-Mart. Washington, Utah, Jan. 3, 2017 | Photo courtesy of Matt Thompson, St. George News “There was a male adult found deceased in his vehicle,” Washington City Police Public Information Officer Ed Kantor said. “(There were) no indications of foul play, and until the medical examiner’s report is completed we won’t know the cause of death.” Kantor said there was no indication of any kind what could have caused the man’s death. Officials were called to the scene between 4-4:30 p.m. and found the man inside a gold truck with a black camper shell on the back. “(No) evidence of any violence or anything like that. It could have been medical, natural causes, we don’t know,” Kantor added. The man has been identified as James Garlick, 40, of Mona. His sister Carol Bullard of Washington confirmed to St. George News Tuesday night that Garlick was the man found in the truck. “Actually it was weird,” Bullard said in an internet chat. “We had been looking for him for days and my daughter happened to be at Walmart picking up a prescription and saw the cops in the parking lots with the caution tape around a vehicle that looked like my brothers so she immediately called me and I told her to go over and ask if it was him so she did and it was so she ended up telling me then I rushed down there.” Bullard said she has notified the rest of the family about Garlick’s death. He is survived by his parents, 6 children and 8 brothers and sisters. Bullard had posted on her Facebook account that Garlick was missing since Sunday and had asked for help in locating him. This report is based on preliminary information provided by law enforcement or other emergency responders and may not contain the full scope of findings.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Court: Apple Valley Town Council violated Brown Act in 2013 with Wal-Mart MOU Friday Jan 6, 2017 at 6:15 PM Jan 6, 2017 at 6:21 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — An appellate court in Riverside has upheld, in part, a previous ruling that a ballot measure passed to authorize siting and construction for a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Apple Valley was illegal. The ruling nullifies and voids the town’s Measure D — commonly known as the “Walmart Initiative Measure” — which voters passed during a special election held in November 2013. Additionally, the court reversed another previous ruling that the initiative violated the California Constitution, court documents show. In a statement released Friday, town officials said they were “not able to offer comment at this time, but will be glad to do so once we have time to fully review the ruling.” The Brown Act violation, upheld in the 4th District Court of Appeal by a three-judge panel on Thursday, relates to a memorandum of understanding between the town and Wal-Mart that the Town Council approved during its Aug. 13, 2013, meeting. The MOU allowed the town to accept an offer from Wal-Mart to pay for the special election, according to Town Manager Frank Robinson during the meeting; however, the MOU was not agendized. Court documents: “In none of the documents was the ‘item of business’ that Town council was going to accept a gift from Walmart in order to pay for a special election to pass the Initiative.” Cory Briggs, of Briggs Law Corp., told the Daily Press on Friday he believed the gifted amount was around $250,000, but he added, “it has been so long that I do not recall for sure.” Briggs represented the plaintiff — town resident Gabriel Hernandez — in the case. He said the Brown Act violation resulted in the initiative being illegal. “The MOU was the critical factor establishing the Brown Act violation, according to the court, because the public was not told about it,” Briggs said via email. “At the oral argument the justices repeatedly asked the other side questions like: ‘Don’t you think that someone paying for the election would be information that the public would want to know?’ ... That’s why the town lost. It must fully disclose all potential actions in advance. As this ruling shows, secrecy – if discovered – is fatal.” In February 2015, San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge David Cohn ruled that the voter-approved initiative was illegal under the Brown Act. Cohn also ruled the initiative was unconstitutional under the California Constitution because it granted “special privileges on the ‘owner’ of the property, which is Wal-Mart,” despite Wal-Mart not being named specifically as the owner. In their appeal, the town and Wal-Mart insisted the trial court “erred by looking outside the Initiative to the ballot materials to ‘identify’ Walmart as the beneficiary of the Initiative.” Subsequently, the appellate court ruled that because Wal-Mart could sell the property, “it would have no superior right over the subsequent owner or developer of the property” and ruled that the initiative did not violate the state’s Constitution. Still, Briggs pointed out that “illegal is illegal,” referencing the Brown Act violation. “So my client won and the initiative — including the outcome of the election — is null and void,” he said. According to court documents, another initiative will be considered by the Town Council in the future, and “will be possibly adopted at a later date after appropriate public comment.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

Members of the flight crew said they noticed the pilot behaving oddly after boarding a Sunwing flight in Calgary last weekend. It was to fly to Cancun, Mexico by way of Regina and Winnipeg with 99 passengers and six crew members on board. Pilot Miroslav Gronych, from Slovakia on a work visa in Canada, was arrested for being three times over the legal driving limit for alcohol consumption, police said. In Canada, it is against the law for pilots to consume any alcohol within eight hours of flying and individual airlines often have stricter rules. Sunwing’s Jacqueline Grossman said the airline has zero tolerance on drinking within 12 hours of duty. Transport Minister Marc Garneau told commercial air carriers he is “very concerned” about the incident and wants them to outline and confirm their safety protocols. “There is the need to ensure that protocols are up to date and are being implemented with all the required resources, including measures designed to confirm pilots’ fitness to fly,” he said. ––– Walmart and Visa have ended a six-month disagreement over credit card fees at its Canadian stores. The retailer is again accepting Visa cards in all its stores after reaching a deal on fees charged by the credit card company. No details were given. Walmart stopped taking Visa cards in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario last July and threatened to extend the ban across Canada, seeking lower fees. It said it was paying more than $100 million a year for the service, far more than for other cards or payment methods. News in brief ▪ Tens of thousands of customers were without power in parts of Quebec at mid-week after a storm brought freezing rain and snow across much of the province. Ice accumulated on tree branches and wooden poles, causing them to fall and take down power lines. The hardest hit regions were the Outaouais, the Laurentians and the western part of the Monteregie. ▪ Investigators have concluded a massive gas explosion that destroyed a house and damaged 70 others in Mississauga, west of Toronto, last June was a double suicide. The residents of the house, Robert Nadler and wife Diane Page, were found dead among the debris. Police said the house’s natural gas line had been dismantled, leading to the explosion. Facts and figures The Canadian dollar has risen to 75.54 cents U.S. while the U.S. dollar returns $1.323 Canadian, before exchange fees. The Bank of Canada’s key interest rate is steady at 0.5 percent while the prime-lending rate is 2.7 percent. Stock markets are higher, with the Toronto exchange index at 15,505 points while the TSX Venture index is at 790 points. The average price for gas in Canada has risen to $1.14 a liter or $4.33 (Canadian) for a U.S. gallon. Lotto 6/49: (Jan. 4) 2, 11, 13, 23, 35 and 48; bonus 30.

Regional briefs ▪ The British Columbia government is making $50 million available to immediately hire about 1,100 teachers as ordered by the Supreme Court. A law that blocked the B.C. Teachers’ Federation from bargaining class sizes was ruled unconstitutional, ending a 14-year legal battle. There is also $100 million in a “learning improvement fund” for teachers and education assistants. ▪ A shortage of real estate listings and low interest rates pushed the average price of a house sold in the Greater Toronto Area to $730,472 last month, up 20 percent from a year ago. The record high reported by the Toronto Real Estate Board contrasted with a 2.2-percent price drop to $897,600 on average in the last six months in Greater Vancouver. ▪ Moosehead Breweries cites costs in scrapping plans to build a small-batch brewery on the waterfront in Saint John, New Brunswick. The company, with a large brewery in the city and Hop City Brewing in Brampton, Ontario, is now developing “alternate plans,” said CEO Andrew Oland.

Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp, CFP (TMFAlison) Jan 6, 2017 at 5:17PM In this episode of Motley Fool Answers, Alison and Robert take their fans behind the scenes at a special Motley Fool member event in Boston. Tune in as David Gardner, Raj Sisodia, and Morgan Housel share their insights on investing, conscious capitalism, and the nature of innovation. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Nov. 29, 2016. Alison Southwick: This is Motley Fool Answers. I'm Alison Southwick and I'm joined, as always, by Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at The Motley Fool. How ya doing, Bro? Robert Brokamp: I'm splendid. How are you, Alison? Southwick: I'm good. In today's episode, we are sneaking our listeners into a recent member event in Boston so that you can eavesdrop on some of the highlights. We'll also answer your question about how we, personally personal finance. All that, and more, on this week's episode of Motley Fool Answers. __ Southwick: It's time for Answers, Answers and today's question comes from Albert. He writes: "I am starting to get proactive about my expenses, but I feel I am still a newcomer. Can you provide advice on what inspires you both to think high-level about your finances in life? I haven't had much guidance growing up and just want to hear what any of your long-term goals are and how you build your plans to achieve them." Any personal examples and obstacles along the way Albert would also like to hear about. Do you want to go first? Brokamp: I'll go first. It's a very interesting question. I was thinking about how I created my beliefs about money in general, because he talked about expenses, and I've always been someone who was frugal. I was never comfortable spending a lot of money and I guess that comes from my parents, although looking at some of the expenses from other people in my family ... my sisters! Southwick: Do they listen to the show? Hope not. Brokamp: I doubt it. A couple of them are more comfortable with spending money than I am, so I don't know if it came from my parents. But we all did go through an experience in high school when my dad's business went belly up and we went through some hard times. I think that was very informative for me. So when I think of my goals as a father, it is to have financial security for my family and that really breaks down into two main categories: college and retirement. Those are the things that motivate me. Those are the things that whenever ... It was my funny. We were sitting around the table and my wife said, "What if you won the lottery?" She's asking everyone at the table, "What if you won the lottery? What would you spend the money on?" And then she looked at me and said, "You can't say retirement and college. Choose something else." And how I stay on top of them is basically I do run my numbers at least once a year in terms of whether we're on track to have enough money to do those things. In terms of obstacles, it's really time. So having the time, on the weekend or whatever, to do all the little, silly personal finance stuff that you probably should do to make your life a little better. Southwick: So I am also a naturally frugal person. Most of my money lessons I learned from my mom and my dad, of course, and they are both completely different. I think I said this before on the show. My mom used to like to say, "Alan, you're good at making money and I'm good at saving money." I think that's what she used to say. Because my dad is very good at making money, but he's also very good at spending money. He came from a family that didn't necessarily have a lot of money, and rather than becoming frugal as a result, he ended up being the "Who knows about tomorrow? Let's have a good time today and have all these good experiences and spend money." And for most of his life he was very good at making money so it wasn't an issue. My mom, on the other hand, came from a fairly wealthy family. She was just naturally frugal and I think often lived under the fear that you may not have money tomorrow. And one of her stories that I will retell to you all, and now Mom gets to hear one of her stories told back to her, was that her mother, my grandmother, once joked that she was down to her last $20. My mom, as a child, heard this and got very worried. And, of course, it wasn't her last $20. Maybe she was just saying it was the last $20 she had in her wallet. It was not their last $20, but for some reason my mom, as a child, thought, "This is our last $20 and we're going to be out on the street." And she was terrified. I think that was kind of an offhanded comment that her grandmother made, but it really affected my mom long-term. So I learned most of my frugal habits from my mom, but I also think I learned from my dad to also spend money and enjoy yourself, so Ron and I will not hesitate to spend an insane amount of money on a really nice meal, which is probably one of the most ridiculous things you can spend a lot of money on next to like a boat. But that's what we enjoy doing, so we're not afraid to treat ourselves now and then. That's how both my parents influenced my thinking on money. I'm naturally frugal and scared of not having money. I like having money. Also I would point out that Ron and I have both been very lucky that we've always been employed and we have good health. I think if either one of those went away, we would be in such serious trouble ... not because we didn't make good, sound financial decisions, but just because that can absolutely sink you. Brokamp: Right. That's true. One of the biggest causes of people who go into bankruptcy is because of medical issues. Southwick: Right. So on the one hand we try to make a series of one good decision after another. Not spend too much. Live within our means. Brokamp: And you've been planning for a while. I know both of you have been saving for retirement for a while. Southwick: Yeah. And I'm not particularly worried, but as far as goals go, I think just not being out on the street is a pretty good one. I guess I was saying that we make one good decision after another and to just be thankful for what we have. That we've been set up to also succeed, as well, thanks to our parents, and our decisions, and luck. I don't know. I don't know what else to say. I mean, we don't buy anything until we have the money for it. I know that sounds dumb and not terribly profound, but we've been saving up for a new car for like 10 years now. That comes after everything else. The new car fund doesn't get money into it until everything else has money in it, including college fund, retirement fund, blah, blah, blah. Brokamp: That's impressive, actually. Southwick: That what? Brokamp: That you do that. I know it's a crazy thing in America to say this, but that you save until you have the money to pay for something to buy it, as opposed to going into debt to get it. Southwick: I don't know. Rick, how about you? Rick Engdahl: I am not on that side of the glass because I am not a frugal person, not particularly disciplined, and I don't have a lot of inspiration when it comes to personal finance. It's not a subject that interests me. Which is why I wholeheartedly believe in automation, because I can set it up so that my check comes in and savings automatically drips into all my various accounts, and that's that. And then whatever is left over I can spend. Southwick: And do. Engdahl: And do. Once I paid off my credit card years ago, my rule has just been that when the bill comes in, I pay it in full and that's it. Brokamp: And you've been an investor for years, and we know, now, that you are saving for your kids' college education, so that's good. Engdahl: I've always been saving for their educations, but now I'm saving by way of a 529 ... whatever that thing's called. Brokamp: Yes, right. Yes, that thing. That's the thing you're doing. Engdahl: But investing for years means I automated that. That's automated, too. Everything is automated, because I don't like to think about it. Brokamp: That's good advice. Southwick: I wouldn't say that Ron or I do anything necessarily that's terribly sophisticated or complex. It's just like make money. Be sure you're making money. And then spend less than you're making. And try to make the most out of what you didn't spend. Brokamp: That's actually a pretty good formula though. Southwick: We'll see. Brokamp: We'll see. Southwick: We've got a few years ahead of us in retirement, so we'll be OK. Villages, here we come. Brokamp: Here we come. __ Southwick: For today's episode we're doing a little eavesdropping on a member event that we just held in Boston for our ONE members. But, even though you're not a member, you're going to get to sneak into the room. It's cool. You're with me. We're highlighting three speakers from the event. Bro, you attend a fair number of member events. Can you set the stage? What's it like? Brokamp: Well, it's usually in a nice place in a nice city. We often have keynote speakers and then breakouts. We try to bring in prominent thinkers about investing or some aspect of society, so it's not always investing-related. We try to bring in some executives, particularly if it's the executives and companies from recommendations in any of our services. And really the great thing is just to meet all the people who are Motley Fool members. Southwick: Yeah, they're great. Brokamp: They are. They're the best. Southwick: So let's start with a familiar voice. David Gardner was interviewed by Chris Hill, and Chris asked him for some investing tips. David talked a bit about how winners tend to keep winning, so you shouldn't sell your stocks that have experienced huge gains just because the media tells you they can't possibly keep on winning. And then David continued with some additional advice. __ David Gardner: I think most people are looking, understandably, at near-term results, both for their own investment portfolios and at the businesses that they own. Looking at the near-term results when, of course, it's the long term that matters for both of those things. I think people are often looking at the wrong things that way. Another example is for people -- and we all do this -- each of these things is natural. It's also just natural to look at the win-loss record. It's also very natural to look at what's not working and to think that the stock that just lost 25% yesterday is much more important than the stock that you might have purchased 10 years ago and has been a good holding and went up only 3% yesterday. But often the math works out really well. I think you should be focused on your winners, so learning lessons from our winners and not too many lessons from our losers. Psychologists, too, remind us that the pain of loss is three times the joy of gain, so again it's understandable why people care so much about something that's down, but I much prefer to focus on what's up. And then maybe a third and final example (I'm going to say these words carefully, just because they matter) is I think most people, again, are looking at the wrong thing. I think many people are looking at the valuations of beaten-down also-rans; and that's where they're fishing, often, for their next investment. And by direct contrast, looking at the right things, I prefer to look at not the valuation but the performance of not beaten-down also-rans, but the performance of innovative leaders. Those are a few examples. Chris Hill: The last time you and I were onstage talking, it was FoolFest. You had just had your 50th birthday. Here we are, now. Your service, Rule Breakers, has just had a birthday -- much younger, though -- 12 years. When you think back over the last 12 years, two questions. First, what are one or two lessons that you have drawn from 12 years of rule breaking investing? Gardner: I think probably the most important lesson that I've learned -- and that we've all learned if you're a rule breaker, or if you followed our scorecard of what we've done -- is learning to fail. In fact, I bounced away from my talk this morning to see a local university that my son is applying to, and one of the things they say at this school is "we're looking for 'risk-takers' willing to fail." And I think that we have failed grandly and far more often in Motley Fool Rule Breakers than I think any other service at The Motley Fool. And I don't like that. We have 48 stocks that have lost 50% or more of their value. I've picked, with the help of my team, two stocks every single month since we launched in October, 2004, so 12 years ago this month that's 288 stocks. Forty-eight of them have lost 50% or more of their value. But we're a winning service, and so the important statistic that you need to know, I think, is that the 48th best stock that we've selected as of this morning (pre-market open ... I haven't updated my numbers) is Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which is up 187.4%. So if you do the math with me, I hope you're willing to lose 50% or more 48 times in order that your 48th best pick would be well above 100% gain. If you do the math with me, you'll see that that's a game you want to play every time, but it's very hard for many people, especially who have just joined Motley Fool services, and that's not true of this august crowd. But many people come and when their first stock drops 10% if it has bad earnings, that's very upsetting for them. So I think we've learned that lesson. If you're a rule breaker you know it. You're a risk-taker willing to fail, and the good news is our top two picks, alone, have wiped out all of those losses from all the other 48 worst picks we've ever made. Hill: This may be an unfair question, but I'll ask it anyway. Gardner: Go for it. Hill: Go back 12 years in time and think about your mentality, your approach as a rule breaker. Has your approach stayed the same throughout, and if not, in what ways has the rule breaker approach changed for you? Gardner: Well, ostensibly the rule breaker approach is the same. I mean, of course we're all adapting and evolving constantly, so it doesn't matter whether you're 70, 50, 30, or younger than that. You're going to change again and your mentality will. I can say, ostensibly, we haven't changed because the bedrock of what I wrote in the book Rule Breakers, Rule Makers -- that Tom and I wrote in 1998 -- those six traits that I wrote about then are exactly what we use today in 2016. The world may have changed some in the last 18 years, but we're still doing the same Fool thing in that way. But at the same time, yeah, my mentality 12 years ago was I didn't quite as much value the importance of culture at companies, where today I know I'm not the only one at the Fool. When I talked about how you're in a room full of people and you're hearing from people today who understand what matters, I think the culture of the institutions matters a great deal; much more than I appreciated 12 years ago. And I hope I was generally consistent with this 12 years ago, but I am only reminded, more and more today, of how important it is for me that the companies that I recommend in Rule Breakers do things that improve the world. That are admirable companies. When they succeed, I want us all to feel great about it. I want to feel great about that company succeeding. One thing that I wrote a couple of years ago, which is one of my favorite things that I've written, is just make your portfolio your best expression of your hopes for our future. I think that should be true of the things that you're invested in. When they win, we all win and you feel great about what happened. Southwick: I love that so much I want to embroider it on a pillow. Isn't it the best? It is. "Make your portfolio your best expression of your hopes for our future." I love that. Brokamp: My hopes for our future are that everyone goes out and gets Starbucks coffee while they're visiting a Home Depot because those are stocks in my portfolio. And they get surgery from a robot through Intuitive Surgical. Southwick: Buying some Disney products on Amazon Prime. Brokamp: There you go. Make sure you check your Facebook. Engdahl: It sounds like we're going to need a disclaimer this episode. Brokamp: Every company I just mentioned I personally own. Southwick: You're making fun of me in seeing this is like a very nice, motivational thing, but I do think it's nice. Like I do like the idea of living in a world where Disney movies exist. I don't know. Brokamp: That's what's really exciting about David's style. I mean, he really is looking for trends and the ways that the future will change compared to the other companies he mentioned -- the beaten-down has-beens or something along those lines. It can be a successful way of investing, but it's certainly not as exciting as what David does. Southwick: You're making fun of me for being a little schmaltzy. Whatever. Brokamp: I'm sure I'll love your pillow. Southwick: All right. Next up Tom Gardner interviewed Raj Sisodia. He's the co-founder of the Conscious Capitalism movement and author of the book, Firms of Endearment. Raj started off researching marketing and looking at effective ad spending, but he noticed something ... that some companies didn't have to spend much on advertising at all. Hm! Why was that? He spoke with Tom Gardner about what he learned about the common characteristics of conscious companies and how that equates into higher performance. Raj Sisodia: Well, what about the companies that don't spend a lot and yet have extremely high loyalty and trust? What are they doing? And what can we learn from them? And to me that constitutes marketing excellence. That's the holy grail -- customer loyalty and trust. And so when we started to identify companies just based on that simple lens, we started to find companies like Whole Foods, for example. Whole Foods, at the time, was spending only 10% of the industry average on marketing. They didn't have a chief marketing officer. They didn't have an ad agency. Ninety percent of what they did spend was spent at the store level, not at headquarters. Ninety percent of that related to their community activities, so they somehow thought of marketing as that. I said, "That's not what we teach. That's not supposed to be marketing." But marketing was almost an afterthought. Starbucks had never advertised once in their history at that point. I don't think they have even now, as far as I can tell. There was very little of that. So we started to find these companies. What we soon discovered was it wasn't about the marketing. That for these companies, even their employees were highly loyal and trusting. Their communities deeply embraced these companies and welcomed them. In fact, people waited and camped out in the parking lot before there were new stores or locations opening for some of these businesses. We found that their suppliers had long-term, stable relationships with these companies. So they were really in a stakeholder frame of operation. In other words, they were looking after the well-being of all of their stakeholders. Not just customers, but employees, suppliers, communities. Even the environment, etc. So we saw they were treating everybody the way customers should be treated. Understanding their needs and really creating value consciously for all of their stakeholders. And then beyond that, we found that they had a reason for being. It's not just another airline, or just another retailer, or just another furniture shop, or CarMax. They were trying to reinvent, or change the way something was being done. They had a purpose. So it's not a business with a mission. This was like a mission with a business. Whole Foods was trying to change the way people eat and think about food, and change the way we run our food system, and the health of the planet, and all of that is impacted by the way that they define their business. The Container Store is trying to help you get organized so you can feel less stressed out and more relaxed. Southwest was trying to bring freedom to the skies and enable more people to travel. Make it fun. Make it affordable. Make it accessible. So they all have a reason for being. CarMax was trying to reinvent the used car selling business, which of course, as we know, you feel like you walk in there and you're going to get victimized. So there was a purpose -- a higher purpose. We discovered that these businesses have a higher purpose. They're stakeholder oriented. And then we also discovered their leaders were different. They're typically, in many cases, still the founders. Even if it's not the founder -- if it's a 100-year-old company -- somebody who has a passion for what this business is about. What they're trying to do. They're driven by service to the purpose and service to the people -- and not so much about power and their own personal ego and enrichment. They're much more, I would say, down to earth. More like servant leaders than your command-and-control, top-down, almost like a legal type of leader. And then lastly, we found the cultures. The Motley Fool has a fantastic culture. You only know them as clients, but if you go and visit them, they pay a lot of attention to the culture. It's a lot of fun. There's a lot of trust, there's a lot of transparency, and there's caring. There's authentic caring for human beings at the heart of these companies. [Northwest] Airlines -- the stock market symbol is LUV. L-U-V, right? What they talk about is we love our customers. We love. We love everyone to death. It's all rooted in that. And most businesses, unfortunately, are rooted in fear and stress. They think the way to get people to perform is to just constantly put pressure on them. Carrots and sticks. Think about that. What animal belongs between a carrot and a stick? A jackass -- not a human being. And yet we use that kind of language and people start behaving that way. They're still trying to get the carrot and avoid the stick. So that's the big difference and those are the four pillars. Let me now describe Conscious Capitalism but they were really uncovered in that book. Halfway through I said it's not about marketing. We're discovering all these people talking about love, and care, and trust, and compassion, and all of that. So I was calling it "Share of Heart" for a while. And I said, "You know in marketing, we used to talk about share of market and then we had share of wallet." And our editor said, "So now you're talking about share of heart? What comes next? Share of soul?" A cynical view of marketing. Fortunately we didn't stick with that and we ended up calling it Firms of Endearment. Companies that are loved by everybody and how you do that. And the icing on the cake -- at the end of all of our research and selecting the companies based on these criteria -- we did the financial analysis. And we said, "You know, these companies are paying their people better." Certainly at the front lines. Costco pays double of Wal-Mart. The Container Store pays double the prevailing wage in the industry. They provide much better benefits. Starbucks provides generous healthcare even to part-time employees, for example. They're taking care of their customers. Providing great customer care. They're not squeezing their suppliers. Suppliers are profitable, and innovative, and healthy. They're investing in their communities. They're investing in the environment. They're paying taxes at an average rate of 34% -- that sample of companies. We said, "Maybe investor returns are good but nothing phenomenal because they are spending in all these other areas." What we found actually stunned us -- that these companies outperformed the market 9 to 1 over a 10-year period. That would have been 1996 to 2006 because the book came out in 2007. We had 18 public companies in that. We thought we had made a mistake. We went and redid the analysis. How can this be? Because we still had that zero-sum mentality. That if you need to do more for employees you'll have to take it away from investors. If you want to pay more, maybe your margins will have to suffer. Well, no. Business is not a zero-sum game. It's the ultimate positive-sum game on this planet. I don't think anything else comes close. You create extraordinary amounts of value when you align everybody together around a shared sense of purpose. So you're excited to go to work on Monday. You don't say, "Thank God it's Friday." Do you know that heart attacks are highest on Monday morning, by the way? Twenty percent higher. Monday morning at 4:00 a.m. is the peak. That's the state of affairs we have. So what we found is that these companies have broken that trade-off mentality, and when you align everything together you create this virtual cycle of higher performance. And nobody has to suffer in that. Everybody matters, and everybody can win when you do business in the right way. And it's not about making money, and having a bunch of side effects. These businesses are able to operate with a spectrum of positive effects. It's not just financial. It's intellectual capital. It's social capital. It's emotional well-being. It's spiritual well-being. Physical well-being. Ecological well-being. It has a positive impact on the culture, and those are all the consequences of how we choose to operate. So as I said, that book turned my life around, because until then I just had a job and a bit of a career in marketing, and now I had a calling. And I still remember sitting in Pennsylvania in the Poconos at some writing retreat and I had tears in my eyes as we were writing some of the stories about these companies, and the deep humanity that exists inside corporations, or can exist if you allow it to. Because human beings are wired to care and corporations are designed to snuff that out for the most part. You're supposed to leave that at the door. Put on your mask and armor and show up for battle. It doesn't have to be that way. Why can't we combine love and work? Those are the two aspects of being human. Southwick: As part of my job here at The Motley Fool, I also do media relations and so sometimes that means getting our analysts out there talking about investing. Sometimes it means talking about workplace culture at the Fool. And it's funny to me how there's this tone, generally, that work sucks. Brokamp: Right. Southwick: And I guess that it does, and it historically has, really, been hard and difficult work; but many people today, including all of us here at The Motley Fool, have the opportunity to have really rewarding work. And work doesn't have to suck -- but it does suck for many people. I don't know how to reconcile that. Someone's got to clean toilets and I love them for that. Brokamp: I want a pillow that says "make love and work." That's all I'm saying. Southwick: You be careful. Christmas is coming up. Be careful what you wish for. Brokamp: I look forward to it. Southwick: Love and work on a satin pillow. A gift for you and Mrs. Brokamp. All right. Finally friend of the podcast Morgan Housel gave a speech titled, "You Are Not Too Late." He begins by showing the audience an iconic photo of one of the most momentous events in human history. Morgan Housel: This is Wilbur and Orville Wright on December 17, 1903. This picture is the first second of the first flight in human history. And we know, in hindsight, that this is one of the most important events in human history. If you go to the Library of Congress, where I found these papers, you'll find two things that I think are pretty astounding. One is that the first passing mention of the Wright brothers in The New York Times was 1906, three years after their first flight. Even more astounding, I think, is in 1904 (so one year after their first flight) The New York Times interviewed a European count who was a hot air balloon tycoon of sorts. And they asked him if human flight -- what they called back then the flying machine (that's what they called them back then) -- if flying machines would ever become a reality. And this is what he said. He said, "In the very, very, far future," said the Count, with a crescendo accent on the "very" and a shoulder shrug that suggested an eternity, "there may be flying machines, but not now. Not now." This was a year after the Wrights' first flight, in the nation's newspaper of record. There are so many interesting stories that come from the Wright brothers, but to me the most fascinating is this five-year gap between when they changed the world and they convinced people that they changed the world. And I think what's really important is that if you look into it, this is an extreme example, but almost every innovative product throughout time (every big invention that really changes the world and goes on to be one of the most impactful inventions or innovations) is almost never understood at first. The products that are instantly adored are adored because they're familiar, and they're familiar because they're usually just slight improvements over what's already available. But when you have products that are totally transformational, almost nobody gets it at first. And that process between inventing it and getting people to understand it isn't something that takes months or years. It can take decades. We know in hindsight that the car was one of the most transformational inventions of the 20th century, but it took us a quarter of a century to figure that out. This is true for TV, too. This is The New York Times in 1927 talking about the first use of television. It says: "Pictures are Flashed by Wire and Radio Synchronizing with Speaker's Voice." That's the clunky way of describing what a TV is. This is a little different. They were really excited about the TV when it first came out, because it was amazing to watch. But you see this line here: "Commercial Use in Doubt." And here, too, the first TVs came around in the mid-1920s. It wasn't until the 1950s that it was a pretty viable, sustainable commercial enterprise. It took a quarter of a century to get there. This is really interesting. It was true for penicillin, as well. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin pretty much by accident in 1928. And if you had to make a list of the most important discoveries or inventions of the 20th century, penicillin would be at or near the top. Depending on whose estimates you use, penicillin saved between 80 to 200 million lives since it was put into practice. It's a huge gap, but whatever the number is, it's enormous. It wasn't until 1942 -- so 14 years after discovery -- that Merck, the pharmaceutical company, made 10 doses of penicillin and realized that it was actually pretty great. And the first mass-scale production actually came for D-Day in 1944. They made 2 million doses. But that was 16 years after we first discovered it. Here, too, we have more than a decade between discovering something that changes the world and convincing people that it's actually going to change the world. With any big breakthrough technology I, at least, want to think in hindsight (and I think it's common to think in hindsight) that the gap between invention and adoption is quick. And it almost never is. I think every big innovative technology follows an eight-part path that goes something like this. First when it's invented people say, "I've never heard of it. Nobody knows about it." And then after a while, they say, "I've heard of it, but I don't understand it." And then after a while they say, "I understand it, but I don't see how it's useful." And then as time goes on, they say, "I see how it could be fun for rich people, but not for me." And then they say, "I use it, but it's just a toy. It's not practical. It's just fun to play with." And then they say, "It's becoming more useful for me." And then they say, "I use it all the time." And then they say, "I could not imagine life without it." I think every innovative product goes through this cycle, and the important thing to understand is that this cycle can take decades and it rarely, if ever, takes less than five years. So what does that mean for you as an investor? That's why you're all here. I have two things for you to think about. The first is that when innovation is measured generationally, results should not be measured quarterly. You can imagine in hindsight going to Wilbur and Orville in 1904, a year after their flight, and saying, "How's revenue? How's net income? How did you perform in the last 90 days?" You can imagine going to Bill Gates in 1979 and saying, "It looks like your growth in the last quarter is kind of slowing down. This is really concerning to me." It sounds ridiculous in hindsight, because it is ridiculous in hindsight. But people do that today with companies like Google and Facebook -- that are really doing big, innovative things -- but are still judged by quarterly results. A lot of what we call "pessimism" is just impatience in disguise. This headline I found two days ago. It was perfect timing. It says: "Why the next 20 years will see a lot less technological disruption than the past 20 years." I'm not saying this is wrong. This might very well be true. But this headline is ubiquitous across time. You could go back 20 or 40 or 50 or 100 years and find the same kind of pessimism. We're always kind of stuck in this idea, this trap that we used to innovate in the past, but we don't anymore. That idea has been around for hundreds of years. It's almost always present. And I think the reason that it feels like we haven't innovated in 20 years is because it takes 20 years for us to notice what we've innovated. Marc Andreessen, who is a famous venture capitalist who started Netscape (one of the first internet browsers), told a fascinating story recently. He went to Silicon Valley in, I think, 1992. It was really early on in the internet days. And he said that even in the early '90s, there was a palpable sense in Silicon Valley that they missed the internet. That it was too late. That it was something that happened in the previous years, but if you got there in '92 or '94 or '95 it was too late. You missed it. And in hindsight, we know that's ridiculous because even in 1995 and even in 1999, that was just the early seedling days of the internet. But at the time they had this sense that it was something in the past. That the things that we're making now are not that important. Not having that much impact. That they were too late. About one year ago, Kevin Kelly, who is the executive editor of Wired magazine (Wired is a big technology magazine) was asked basically that same point ... whether we're too late to invest in technology. We've made so much progress over the last 50 years and built so many great companies: companies like Google, and Facebook, and Amazon. But is it too late? We've missed the boat and it's too late. And he gave a great three-sentence answer that I'd love to wrap up with today. He said: "The greatest products of the next 25 years have not been invented. If they have, you might not even know about them yet. You're not too late." Southwick: I remember when I bought Amazon -- way back in 2014 ... Brokamp: Wow! Southwick: ... yeah. I had this fear that I was too late and that I'd already missed my chance. But it's doubled since then! And, of course, for every Amazon in my portfolio I can show you three companies that have tanked, but that's my best example of thinking I was too late and I wasn't too late. Brokamp: That's a good one. Southwick: [00:34:25] Brokamp: That goes back to one of David's points -- that in your portfolio you're going to have losers. You're going to have losers. That's just part of what happens. But ideally you also have the Amazons. I think it was Buffett who said that he thought he was too late to buy Wal-Mart many years ago, and I think he said that he was instead sitting around sucking his thumb because he got around to it too late. He never bought it, and he totally regrets it. And Wal-Mart, at that point, had already been around for probably 25 or 30 years. He said he thought it was too late and he was wrong. So even Buffett does it. Southwick: We could also put that on a pillow. That's the show. It's edited doggedly by Rick Engdahl. For Robert Brokamp, I'm Alison Southwick. Stay Foolish everybody.

Tonight Mostly cloudy with periods of light freezing rain after midnight. Low 19F. Winds light and variable. Chance of precip 40%. Updated: January 15, 2017 @ 7:55 pm Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Jan 6, 2017 0 ___ US adds 156K jobs; unemployment rate ticks up to 4.7 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, capping a year of slower but solid hiring. Friday's report from the Labor Department portrayed a job market that remains durable 7½ years after the recovery from the Great Recession began. Though the unemployment rate rose to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent, it did so for an encouraging reason: More people began looking for work. Because not all of them found jobs immediately, more people were counted as unemployed in December. Hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the sharpest increase in more than seven years. ___ Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. ___ US trade deficit climbs to $45.2 billion in November WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit in November rose to the highest level in nine months as imports of oil and other foreign goods increased, while American exports fell for a second month. The trade deficit jumped 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion, the largest imbalance since February, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Exports edged down 0.2 percent to $122.4 billion, reflecting lower overseas sales of American-made airplanes, autos and farm products. Imports rose 1.1 percent to $231.1 billion, led by a 7.6 percent jump in oil. ___ US factory orders drop 2.4 percent but investment up WASHINGTON (AP) — Orders to U.S. factories fell for the first time in five months in November, but much of the weakness reflected a swing in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. A key category that tracks business investment spending posted an increase. Factory orders dropped 2.4 percent after a 2.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the first decline since June but the weakness was led by a 73.8 percent plunge in demand for commercial aircraft following a 94.5 percent surge in October. ___ US approves fix for some Volkswagen diesels DETROIT (AP) — Volkswagen will soon be able to repair some of its diesel cars so they meet U.S. emissions standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board said Friday that they have approved a fix for around 67,000 of the 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-liter diesel engines that were programmed to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. The German automaker acknowledged the cheating in 2015. The remedy will fix 2015 models of the Volkswagen Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Golf, Golf SportWagen, Jetta and Passat as well as the Audi A3. ___ Jamie Oliver to shut 6 UK restaurants in tough Brexit market LONDON (AP) — Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is shutting six of his 42 Jamie's Italian restaurants in Britain amid tough trading conditions and a lower pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group said Friday that five restaurants in England and one in Scotland would close in the first quarter of 2017. The company has been stung by the slide in the pound, which has increased the cost of buying ingredients from Italy. Despite the pressure on prices triggered by the pound's fall, Britain's economy has outperformed many economists' expectations since the June vote. ___ Wal-Mart names John Furner as Sam's Club next CEO NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart says it named John Furner as CEO of its Sam's Club stores to replace Rosalind Brewer, who is retiring next month. Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart says he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position February 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam's Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago. ___ SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Tilikum the orca has died after more than two decades at SeaWorld Orlando, where he gained notoriety for killing a trainer in 2010 and was later profiled in a documentary that helped sway popular opinion against keeping killer whales in captivity. Sea World officials said Friday that Tilikum died but didn't give a cause of death. They said Tilikum had faced serious health issues including a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection. He was estimated to be 36 years old. The 2010 death of the SeaWorld trainer shocked the public, led to a downturn in SeaWorld's attendance and reshaped its future. ___ The Limited to close all brick-and-mortar shops WASHINGTON (AP) — More grim news for malls came Friday as apparel retailer The Limited said it will close all its brick-and-mortar stores at the end of this weekend. The company says it will continue to operate online only after the Jan. 8 closures. A spokesman said the New Albany, Ohio-based chain operated about 250 retail stores in 2016 and that about 4,000 jobs, including seasonal and temporary ones, would be lost. The announcement comes on the heels of Macy's and Sears announcing store closures and job cuts. ___ APNewsBreak: L.L. Bean heiress in trouble over pro-Trump PAC AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — The Federal Election Commission told L.L. Bean heiress Linda Bean that she made excessive contributions to a political action committee she created to support Republican President-elect Donald Trump. According to a Wednesday letter obtained by The Associated Press, federal regulators say Bean's Making America Great Again LLC was limited to individual contributions of $5,000 in a single year— and Bean contributed $60,000. The group spent $66,862 supporting Trump. The FEC letter says the group could face punitive action or an audit if it doesn't respond. ___ Starbucks to stop selling alcohol at more than 400 US stores NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will stop selling beer and wine at hundreds of U.S. stores next week as it ends its "evenings" program. The coffee chain says the "Starbucks Evenings" program in 439 company-owned stores in the U.S. will end Jan. 10. It said the program may continue in some of the nine licensed stores where it is offered, or overseas. The program, first tested in 2010, was later expanded as a way to drive sales beyond the morning rush. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The office of Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion said it had no immediate information about Canadian citizens being among the five people reported dead or eight injured after a gunman opened fire. Air Canada and WestJet had said all their passengers and employees at the Fort Lauderdale airport were accounted for and safe. ——— TRADE TRIBUNAL FINDS CANADIAN SOFTWOOD HURT CANADIAN PRODUCERS: The American International Trade Commission says there is a reasonable indication that softwood lumber products from Canada materially injured U.S. producers, setting the stage for the imposition of preliminary duties. The trade commission announced Friday it made a preliminary determination of harm from Canadian lumber that is "allegedly subsidized and sold in the United States at less than fair value." The finding could result in duties that Canadian softwood producers say would result in job losses and plant closures north of the border. ——— WALMART REACHES DEAL WITH VISA: A business group is expressing concern at a truce in a war between Walmart Canada and Visa over merchant fees could result in higher costs for smaller businesses. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business says it suspects Walmart negotiated a reduction in merchant fees, which could effect small merchants. CFIB President Dan Kelly says whenever a large merchant comes up with a special deal, it's at the expense of smaller merchants. The companies have not provided any details of the agreement announced on Thursday. ——— CANADA'S JOBS PICTURE SLIGHTLY IMPROVED: Canada's job market had a promising end to 2016, albeit due to an increase in part-time work. Statistics Canada's year-end employment review Friday said the country added 153,700 net new part-time jobs last year and just 60,400 full-time positions — a number so low it was statistically insignificant. The agency reported gains of 156,000 full-time jobs in 2014 and 147,000 in 2015. ——— POLICE CONFIRM NOVA SCOTIA DEATHS A MURDER SUICIDE: Autopsies confirm the deaths of four members of a Nova Scotia family were a murder-suicide. RCMP Cpl. Jennifer Clarke says the wife, daughter and mother of Afghan veteran Lionel Desmond died of gunshot wounds and Desmond died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Clarke told reporters Friday it's a very tragic and disturbing case. Desmond was diagnosed with P-T-S-D after a tour in Afghanistan in 2007. ——— HEALTH CANADA TO SEND RAPE KITS TO NORTHERN ONTARIO RESERVES: Health Canada is responding to complaints from indigenous leaders that they lack the resources to deal with sexual assault cases. The government is sending rape kits to reserves in Northern Ontario. Rape kits are a vital forensic tool for investigating assaults. Nishnawbe Aski police Chief Terry Armstrong says the shortage of such kits has meant victims have had to be sent to hospitals in outlying areas such as Sioux Lookout and Thunder Bay. ——— REPORT SAYS PUTIN ORDERED EFFORT ON US ELECTION: A new declassified report says Russian President Vladimir Putin "ordered" an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. The report says the Russian government developed a "clear preference for President-elect Donald Trump." It says the goal of Moscow's meddling was to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Hillary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency. U.S. intelligence officials released the 25-page public version of the report Friday, after they briefed Trump and top lawmakers on Capitol Hill from a longer, classified version. ——— AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO OTTAWA RESIGNS: The U.S. ambassador to Canada is stepping down. Bruce Heymen was forced out of his post alongside other political appointees as president-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. Heymen will step down effective Jan. 20, the day Trump is officially sworn in as president. The New York Times reported this week that Trump's transition team had issued a blanket request that ambassadors appointed by President Barack Obama surrender their posts by inauguration day. ——— TRUDEAU TO FREQUENT A COFFEE SHOP NEAR YOU: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is about to launch a campaign-style tour to try to touch base with ordinary Canadians amid accusations last year of being cozy with wealthy donors at elite Liberal fundraisers. Trudeau plans to talk to people at coffee shops and church basements across the country. The first leg of the tour is to start at the end of next week in southern Ontario with Trudeau travelling from Ottawa to London. ——— PM SPENDS CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WITH AGA KHAN: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family were guests of the Aga Khan over the holidays on the wealthy religious leader's private Bahamian island. A spokesman for the prime minister confirmed a published report that the Aga Khan invited the Trudeau family and a few friends to join him on Bell Island. The Aga Khan is the hereditary spiritual leader of the world's approximately 15 million Ismaili Muslims and a renowned philanthropist. Trudeau's office noted that the Aga Khan and Trudeau "have been close family friends for many years." ——— © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

(Photo: Elise Amendola, AP) Sears is  closing  150 stores and selling its vaunted Craftsman tool brand, but those steps may not be enough to stop the unraveling of the American icon. With Sears' announcement Thursday coming only a day after rival Macy's said it would close 68 locations, the department store concept itself is looking like an endangered species. In a retail landscape now dominated by online sellers like Amazon and big-box chains like Walmart and Home Depot, Sears finds itself in a search for a reason to exist. "The brand has lost relevance,  it’s lost customers and it’s lost its real reason for existence on the American retail scene,'' says Neil Saunders, CEO of Conlumino, a retail consulting firm. Following "the trajectory they're on, there are no real signs of them turning it around to profitability.'' Related stories: DETROIT FREE PRESS Kmart to close 10 Mich. stores, including original one in Garden City DETROIT FREE PRESS Eastland, Westland Macy's among 68 to be closed USA TODAY Expect more store closings despite big holiday sales Sears has more than 1,300 stores remaining in its portfolio, so its demise could be prolonged. But if the retailer is unable to stem its financial bleeding and is forced into bankruptcy or perhaps a final assets sale, its loss would be akin to that of dominating American companies like airline Pan Am or five-and dime F.W. Woolworth. "I honestly don’t see a spot for Sears long-term," says Van Conway, CEO of Van Conway & Partners, who has advised retail companies and other businesses on reorganization and insolvency. "My mom shopped at Sears. That was the only place she could go. Now you have 50 choices, and Sears is outdated.’’ Founded in 1886, Sears launched its first large, general catalog a decade later and for generations was the go-to source for products ranging from watches to washing machines. Though it lost its place as the nation's biggest retailer to Walmart in the 1990s, Sears enjoyed a renaissance during that decade under the helm of then-CEO Arthur Martinez, who pushed a greater focus on apparel sales and other initiatives. The company faltered in the 2000s, selling its more than $30-billion credit portfolio to Citibank in  2003 and merging the Sears brand with Kmart, another struggling big-box chain. CEO Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager who shepherded the Sears tie-up with Kmart, initiated his own turnaround strategy, loaning the company cash, spinning off parts of the business and putting Sears' Kenmore, Diehard and Craftsman brands up for sale. Sears' travails are part of a broader struggle that has engulfed many traditional retailers trying to compete in an environment in which consumers can buy virtually any item by browsing online and without setting foot in a store. "One thing people used to use department stores for was wide choice and selection,'' Saunders says. "There's no wider choice than on the Internet, so a lot of the reason for going to those department stores just doesn't exist the way it once did.'' In addition to Sears, many retailers, including Kohl's and JCPenney, have failed to innovate in ways that will continue to woo shoppers. “We're seeing now in retail a lot of legacy players that are dead, dying or in danger of dying because of their inability to do that,'' says Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School,  who is the former CEO of Sears Canada. The flurry of steps taken in recent days by Sears is a stark illustration of the moves it is making to try to survive. In addition to the store closures, Sears announced Wednesday that it had obtained a $500-million loan commitment backed by mortgages on 46 properties belonging to its subsidiaries. That adds to its long-term debt, which had ballooned from $2.2 billion at the end of January 2016 to $3.7 billion at the end of October. "From what I can see, these are very intelligent financial maneuvers to raise money,’’ says Conway. “But the whole issue is, is the core business of the retailer viable?" 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2jcQc3K

I'd like to admit that point I'm looking at it and I think you're gonna go and it out. You know the crowd and Bob if you had equal players the way it wanted to black but it probably gotten them. Currently. I don't mind that. I just you what you want the best player first of all. It's what don't you want to not going to be equal and I. I'm going to be equal you're gonna find you're gonna find a difference in the two in the two players you're gonna find the difference that you're gonna take the best player or you're going to have. Eight debate with somebody say I think player one is better than player to cannot get to sit there it's like I'm taking a white guy. Thought I mean you know nobody politically yup courses are unique to you how you want your race represented. If you that's that it happens all the time may be in basketball. Because they're you know. Majority of the players are African American. The numbers pretty high in in football. Maybe there is some of that but. I mean when we're talking about. Players right now. You wanna get the best player but it keeps on bringing a bird okay. Bird McHale Ainge ceased being Wal-Mart white guys on that team but even the best team in the history of the game. If those guys weren't good players do you think people even back then and Boston would be cynical I don't care. I just wanna have they done the white guys bird McHale I don't care how bad they are I don't want magic I don't want that you know those guys on. A Korean of those guys on on the lakers. It's all about the best players Burton was the best player that's why they wanted to be here. They don't let let me give meaning they are I know that you are black guys are black woman and and they're you know two actors opt for tech sector herb wrote an op there's one black and one look like I think most black people credit to the black person get the out there don't you. That's then you're due plan race. I'm not I'm up late race I'm glad I'm I'm gonna know wanted to make a decision on who I'm gonna make that okay that you plain rice. OK maybe you think that we're seeing do you think that what. You think that we think that's you know that's on Cuba. That's on you. I'm not here to tell you exactly how I feel I'm not scared of done this for a long time I've never been scared okay. Look at we have to believe me. Now I'm not will be but again he's really kind of talk to different things here one you're talking about retirement city overall. Being racist. You're talking about individuals you know pulling for someone of the same color Bluetooth. That's a yeah they'll do I can't do it. Because you won sixteen of everything so much all over the I'm a I don't do that big out abate LO more before we have sevens in New Hampshire hi Kevin. Good morning again I'm a quick comment about how absurd it is for. People to assume that Curt Schilling the Nazi sympathizer with it because it's not a memorabilia it's a very good friend of mine has an amazing collection of models. Bill spoke to German warm. The chairman had by far the best engineers. And the best. German best war machines of production in the. All they ended up running our our space program if you remember after the war. Exactly. Have a would have made it to the moon we never would have been the first bout with a nuclear bomb. There's so many things had changed history in a positive direction. Because. We cannot forget that you booming and now it doesn't it doesn't loud boom and to collect. Of product that the German people manufactured but what I wrote I like it out people. Can overcome good people and control what people and should never expert yeah. These are great thing which should be collected and preserved. A future generations understand. How good people control. I'd listen it's it's a war war to collection. Apparently there were 200 pieces I'm looking in every relics are there any job is artifacts I don't know I don't know because every story was so fixated on the fact that there were. SS division agent and he or seen anything like that Clooney severed heads it was personal notes every pill boxes or anything like that none and bill boxes. Including Hitler's personal bodyguards or whatever but like three dozen of the 200. Apparently were Nazi stuff the rest was all you know US stuff from whatever Warwick to pull off. I mean forward tube up you rooted. For the thirteen you know like at her and Hillary and aid abroad and like Dolly today Kemp hit a liberal but I can Bobble head doll she would descend until this morning. City College bubble. On the belt 6177797937. Mike Florio will join us on today's a program. A Devin according will join us as well so we'll talk we'll get it seriously gonna get some football will talk football whiner line. At 140 plenty of material there 6177793535. You can caller right now 6177797. When they sent its its excellent seven sevenths and acts that's wrong with you until age thirty yet I think what I've been here forever just to. Akamai and Big Bang I'm out they come out. My big amount I love that may amount amount. There's Eric down the key player. The Eric. Overnight. I think I mean I'll play. And you gadget definitely. And at the did you yank cats which I loved. It's a way do we steal everybody's little thinner ice would they give it all along collaborating we Porsche gave sharing. But a lot of love it out of and you're doc but I'm gonna talk on the boutique Crowder. At the compliment they'll expand respective. I laughed that the situation because that you guys that we'll look at it in saying oh you know it it Kevin Durant. And I look at that that pat history Brett even accept them at the player that he wouldn't use it whereas you know in college. And it is a good relationship with them they had a chance we get them on the scene. To weather phenomena which aired form of course we do need another good player not another distraction which I think that it's become and backpackers and that on. He did you know I eat yet when he. I added don't see. You know that a Christian would say he's generally had any trophy just kind of dumping pollution now. Yeah but part of the connection wasn't what you what you say that that that that the Boston fans knew the connection. Brad Stevens. Anyway. I mean there are some people like it's amazing that this is the Genesis of this. Did I a couple of guys go people and wasn't that how to wasn't Kevin Durant asked. What this crazy you don't just fire hours going often let's let's let's show all that we will him. We will do anything you ask. The same day. I was there and it was and it was like during the game or can we touched the ball he got to know all this applause knows just the opposite matter fact that the win the game. Went on and crowded had to suffer too risky game the fans were all over in a positive way. They love them and nobody was cheering at that point for Gordon Hayward he got like Gordon Hayward in the you know here's Bob and a car next company EI a book. They guys fatal Greg. Now I'm a born to you know armed subject the ball he memorabilia. All we're watching memorabilia. Armed region being noble PE problems. Not cheap. German memorabilia. Com and you talk about Japanese. Memorabilia. That they didn't doubt. I mean you walk already dates all the German memorabilia caution or more on Japanese. I thought it was fan I thought it was banned on EPA didn't they tell us what that ruling. I didn't try to Bellini you you can you can find it. I don't know about this we like these or Nazi memorabilia okay and in perfect condition. On the they shot her condition but that's why I interpret ignition it's kind of street battles on the couch when they thought the car that collect there are problems. You know to get a collector shows are common to talk. So maybe that's why in all our courage alone when you saw our. You don't stick to what he chairman memorabilia and other than any other and the other. Good point he did lose a little bit money and yes so gaga might be some auto racing channel on eBay right now yes it's not a lot of minutes cloying some you know some articles and stand Somali. You know nothing crazy there's no no uniforms no metals I don't think. IDB I was just this just points on the north coins and stamps. And I'm very exciting so nothing from the actual war in other words uniforms Casilla uniforms. And things yet that anybody being hit by a rumor on there I would think so here's said Jim I know Sarasota Florida punch him. Aikman regarding. Cycle inject collide it's Armisen. Rodman and AM also out burden net play off. Other Isiah Thomas the piston Isiah Thomas. He's the young people lead in the back that. Yeah our Larry and have a conference on that at all what do you put that switched. And Larry was the one that made those caught. Larry did have towels or did have chemistry at a press conference because of that if you get together so that people who weren't around or or haven't read about it. I Dennis Rodman came up bird had a terrific game. Believe it was a playoff game against Detroit and Rodman came out and basic in basically said. You know always be if you were if you weren't white you just be another players something like that and then Isiah Thomas doubled down on that said that he's absolutely right or whatever. And it became a big huge issue to the point where the NB yet. Force them to have a press conference. At the at the the you know they playoff site. And in that press conference Larry Bird did just the opposite said that he loved Isiah Thomas. Get his mother got involved at Larry's mom got involved and called Isiah they had a great conversation. Larry let him off the hook. Because Larry did not believe announced that he did not believe it was an issue he didn't have a problem with the saying. It did. Deco still wouldn't say anything at all but I do remember. It did happen there Larry didn't say anything right after so our leader foursome that you don't want to make another automatic line. I sort of used to me and it sports and play each site within every single game. Back in the day and I audit states which they were covering. At the time and you always cordial. And nice it was quote to talk like. If I doubt it like Christian. Fauria like I had a credible. Ludicrous and had a yeah see them trapped in its success is there anyplace Chris is that who you know I would you should focus to turn around walked. Don't bottom line. My view and I otherwise I probably you know you. I write my buddy was gonna say that you had announced he collection you know and actually you know the conventions do a moment ago cool now. The I don't buy that I can tell you this I've seen among public and especially to women he's very nice. Topic wasn't a guy in our move along move. I'm gonna ask you didn't. Here or is she feared her parents know what New Hampshire hello Joseph. Cargo and Dario great show. Meg glad a couple of things and then a question at first that I can't believe it deck I wouldn't talk to Kurt because that would have made a tremendous radio. Yeah I'm looking at great radio he's looking at protecting. His image. And you know you can get away with a that when you play that game when you see you'll yourself off from the public or anybody who wants to dissent. Something you're saying that the problem I have with a it is if you're going to do. And this is where ESPN is going right now they want more opinions stuff more opinion radio. More opinion TV everything is going that way now you gonna seaport TV locally in this market. They're going opinion then you've got to keep a message well and you gotta keep the gates open and you got a lot of people come back edge use so you can't have they debate. If that is we have the same issue Dan dockets the same issue when I first did this for their dockets. A routine of what you were and how does Iowa that was extremely rude but he was at least. Who he there was a Smart thing. C he'd let me on. But he did what you have been doing so much lately is using to build the volume control so whenever I was speaking over him army you know calling amount. He just turned the volume down we've got the boys in Boston community calls we're doing our part we got this got built pol chart here. How do you see aids they are TI ER. Analyzing these is a guy who are different station and capitalizing. The F bomb as he drops in on me in time we've got him rattled too. Our data I don't like employ your radio. It has more emphasis the book those people that they do everything that we do everything in capital that's that's off but when you do. You know after you when you do that that it it has a little bit and do you think it's better when people like at ten exclamation points or does that really drive it home. Capitalize it and like ten exclamation points. So. You all want to know is still on courses on. So my question has all the debate every time something like this comes up ought in the races. Glenn went to that end and and how is there any way you can make its stop now now you quoted as number of athletes. Glenn is right is gonna tell you when I don't go out and how much stock. I Joseph it's a stereo guy you get out is very self I don't know how old you are how long you've lived in the area I Wear it okay do or it is there were issues as you know. Years ago in the in this part and a big part of it was. A very small African American population was one of the smallest the top thirty cities and American Axle weeks it was the only other city. That they could match even now it's what 8% with the rest of the country's thirteen or 14%. That was part of the problem. And it was not a real friendly place. Especially in sports for African Americans and I can recall stuff at Fenway Park it was not a friendly place for them ago. And we're living with that you know bit the the nightmares of the past. I don't think that exist right now I'm not gonna tell you that there isn't a racist among the bunch are fueled home you're gonna get that every city. I don't think Boston is any different now than any major city in America. We've come a long line. Let me with that it the stereotype. It's just clinging on its hanging on and we got lazy people like Beaumont Jones who throws it out there and then won't even discuss it wont to. It's the air is actually the actually reached out to Goodyear's right but he he responded. Right it was like we have the email they rank right up and he said he said he had some personally on a doorknob and I didn't anyways I on like around the horn. The guy got some personal issues right after I dropped them. Howard that you don't want if you don't have national shell. It's easy to dump on Boston it's easy to dump on the wing wing especially when you don't sports. Beacon I can tell you this from doing national shows for company yours. They're two people are very jealous of the success. It is in the sports world in Boston and one so it's fashionable. To do it on a national show just dump on Boston. It's easy and everybody's agreeing with you so you've got 95%. Of the. Like I like that was like. You know Gutierrez and Beaumont it was almost like. It was like the cool thing to do to pick on it affected. Are just whoever be a bully writes obviously something you're gonna see some facility ball and it and if you will would go back to listen to it. And the usual problem would policy you know it's harder or done it's it sounded really exists lazy and that's really what it always comes down to its slate. I don't know I don't know I don't want to dispute dismiss it entirely not only because there are always wise it's not always lazy there are some racist acts appearance over. I don't I don't under understood my ideas it. I guess yes but they're hiding behind. Those and I think it in in the long run. They end up hurting the book cause because what happens as you say it so often. But after while people sit there and sell c'mon you we go again you gonna call Murray's failure. Armories it's like used in the hole it's like easily you know A they tape their practice it's like the whole spy gate situation all over again I'd take a practice. We champions they cheated how did you like that tee when the when people are talking about the patriots you start talking bull run in these guys again. But guys like rob Parker. Fault all these guys who just cannot gather heads. But the reality is and and a bit even compared to the perception we're gonna get the body rob Parker a little bit later on because he. He came on that and all over again people you know he hears they were rob Parker. He was. I'm Max Kellerman before Max Kellerman. The whole cliff thing with Brady so we had Brady here is called optical file odd years ago six years ago that work out I am he's a market at that point he had won a super ball a bit old and one element of Scott and a car hit a Scott. Yeah I mean there are about that. And so ugly and personal and a command eucharist. Obviously racism is a big issue and in an America today and I if you keep religion out trying to fight against the article that the screener. I think that there's a difference between being a racist and playing rates. And you Muzak I'll explain it I may 26 year old like god. Transport with played sports my whole life I think it's different. Speaking of you know likes all the lights and of Austin I think it's different scene in white kid in bashful. Good you know we could play a perennial all he could be also. So I don't think it's racist to cheer him to want a white guy on the scene they're not that they don't want black guys. What they're saying that it's cool you know it's been called a senior white guide to basketball. Because there are so there are so hold on because there's so few of them correct. Well guys I mean there on I think it's fair to say they're on as many as there are. Great black. Us audio recited close. And and now if you look at American white players in the NBA what is that percentage usually do that most of the yeah last year also the white players right off owners. Reacting to I think it's unfair to themselves I don't think like that to generalize and say that is great and not release. Yes I could technically they were playing the race but we're not being racist to want the white garlic seem to be good you know. Yeah but I'd I don't think that was what happened with Jake crown here. Remember this all skimmed off the G-8 Crowder incident and the white chick crowded never brought it up as a race. Something Jakarta was talking about race was. Just so upset I was upset that they are here at a player. I don't know that's the problem I have with the story is that the media people outside this home. Made it erased or Jae Crowder didn't make it to restore and an incident where Jae Crowder a blocked nine playing at a let's he's a look if you're cheering for the white can tell you know it's a balls he do you know all does resemble. There are. Of the Adam. That's out that's how it all started. That's all I've been that there have been mentioning race and racism arm. Playing the race card actually. I hear you are not here I I get. I get the point and I I would say that that they have the better argue. Bringing up the Brian Scalabrine. You know Rudy is coming into the game with your form you have a better shot at doing that the Scalabrine can do some stuff from the court. There were certain he had a skill set certain things that they could use him that there were limited. Walter McCarty was that guy for little but he played a bad team any you know he can't play a little bit and then I love Walter we have some of that. And it just happened to be. Black but I would give it to you that. At least if you going to argue. The Scalabrine issue once they want the fans get all excited when this white kid with the ginger hair when he came into the game and America. You got one of the bags is that like the other kind of like a fifth of Sesame Street episode don't have a better argument there. I mean that's the Rudy thing right. Affected you talked about scalp he's gonna kill me. Though you know you actually you were trying you I didn't I don't really pay attention to go to new orders for it ends at times it didn't seem to get a lot of energy. Did he yeah. I'd and it has yet it it's a skill set about the completion defense etiquette. Get spot up three it wasn't that he was that an awful player he was a guy in certain instances. That really could help you but it didn't start to become the reds' victory cigar outages go to Dave. Motorcade let's go to private number make money Jones case and hey it bought it look up pigs in Brooklyn hello Dave. You know and I I I think our defenses. That's we have a African Americans who actually could rip offs were. A white guy. This say well you know racism that it's our. Optimism balked and then you know at the time that changed. You know it's not over now it's called Europe whether or not it over it but it I mean it really. Gets me. Angry at what what are you quite accurate well. I'm not really in some ought to. Maybe I can edit I didn't say that now he said yeah and is so obviously obviously you're you're taking. Now we don't I. I don't take anything good that's a super human like qualities a hall of fame voters and he said they've like I said here incentive and ability. On this planet and it happens to be this part of the planet. Heard quite a few years so I have seeing the bad evil days I don't know how old you wore. But certainly there were some issues in this town. In which this town deserves some of the reputation that they got because there were some serious racial problems. I RD sat it we had a very small African American population is still do in comparison to all of these of the city's major cities in in America. The one point of bringing up this. That this city has come an awful long way. And so yes I am I'm a little sensitive. Because I've seen the changes the progress that's been made. If you'll let me finish in my election talk ala to talk. Now he sees progress to Portman married. And I've come to the point now where a much in their art. Racist in Boston. I'm not saying and there are still aren't people live look at the color of the skin and may be the same thing exist for black people looking at the color of the skin a white people wanna say is. I don't think we're a much different. Then all of the other major cities in America I don't think you could save that fifty years ago. You may your figure your comments section says Boston is racist so you believe boss and as a CD is racist. I believe that there's a lot in arteries as. You leave America's what do you what do you think about let me let let me speak. That's all I believed that. They're a lot a lot of racism within me. Fought in the area would that meet great about area not a lot that it what what I grew up in what I was part of the opting. Crowd now it's not a bad then putted it is very great as it bosses at cricket and on talk radio. Racism. And corporate America any. Into you can check out not that bad. I didn't say is it any different than any other major city in America. Really I go to war and I I I go to Chicago and they are you there. Downsizing I don't look at almost any scrutiny of travel I disagree if you want it. A secret eyes only you know even accuse us of being white. And so it's very easy for us to say because you were like we don't get that we don't understand it I'm telling you I've seen the odds are all I do get the idea again I. It would went would you get pregnant woman giving birth now so so you really don't understand how I have an American in Boston real. Buehrle thought. Not seen the ups in the deep brown KFC some bad cases in this town and just because I happen to be white doesn't mean that. I don't feel empathy and don't understand the history of what happened in the city. On ansari did that those individual things happened to me no you probably were treated differently. Years ago which is said on the on the streets of Boston and I was a tip all of what I'm saying is usually easier to do my a lot of he she's talked about the idea of I wasn't like it was like humanity and let's make yeah all of saying is that we're living in in the that the stereotypical. Image of Boston that existed many many years ago and that's why the ball money Jones in the so the com is Jake O'Donnell just figure all gonna write because Boston is racist. You're living in didn't end and an old world you living in a world that is much much different. Are there incidents showed their rents and it's put periods and as we read your bottom. Everywhere else did we not just hear about this incident. Race right now that we're they're debating whether it's a hate crime in in Chicago I mean. It's happen I don't think we're that much different now and I think he could make a serious argument years ago that we were different and it wasn't pretty. I search wants have a sub seven on seven under threesome. Yeah me luck around and sees two groups here white collar blue collar but I don't see it that way no one not. Because I am colorblind.

Posted 06 Jan 2017 22:35 Updated 07 Jan 2017 01:15 Rosalind Brewer, president and chief executive of Sam's Club, speaks about leadership at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in Laguna Niguel, California October 2, 2012. REUTERS/Alex Gallardo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wal-Mart Stores Inc said Rosalind Brewer, the longest-serving CEO of its warehouse chain Sam's Club, would retire next month, and would be succeeded by company veteran John Furner. Brewer, the first woman and the first African American to run a top Wal-Mart business, will leave on Feb. 1 to take on a "new challenge", according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Brewer, 54, a champion of diversity within the workplace, came under fire after she alluded that she saw a problem with an all Caucasian male staff at a Sam's Club supplier. The comments, made during a CNN interview in December, was seen by some critics as promoting workplace racism, triggering hashtags "#boycottsamsclub" and "#boycottracistsamsclub". Under Brewer's five-year tenure as CEO, Sam's Club's sales rose 5.6 percent to US$56.2 billion. The unit's same-store sales growth beat analysts' estimates in the past three quarters. Furner, currently the chief merchandising officer at Sam's Club, joined Wal-Mart in 1993. Furner, 42, has served in various capacities, including as the chief merchandising officer of Walmart China. "In John, we see someone who loves the company and our associates, has learned the business from the bottom up and across, and has the desire to lead change which is so necessary in today's environment," Wal-Mart's Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in the memo. Sam's Club, the smallest of Wal-Mart's three business units, operates membership-only warehouse clubs in 48 states in the United States and in Puerto Rico. The business accounted for about 12 percent of the company's fiscal 2016 net sales. The world's biggest retailer's shares were down 1.3 percent in afternoon trading on Friday and was the top percentage loser among Dow stocks.

Police are now asking for help from the community to find the hit and run suspect. Around 8 p.m. on Dec. 17, the woman was hit at the Walmart on 2701 S Interstate 35. Surveillance video from the store captured the suspect speeding off after hitting the pedestrian. Jaymie Clark was picking up last minute Christmas items from Walmart, but all it took was a second, walking out to the parking lot, for her world to change. KXAN spoke with Clark, who is recovering from her injuries. “Half of the kneecap was crushed,” she said, recalling a “flash of white” and hearing someone scream. “My front and back pelvis was broken as well, and bruising along the right side of my rib, bruising on my arm.” Looking down at her injuries served as a reminder for the moment she looked up, asking for more time. “I started praying. Cause we’re believers and I just started going, ‘God, I’m not ready to home yet. And I just was praying, and I have two grandsons that I love and I have family here and I just kept saying please, I’m not ready to go. I love you, I want to be with you, but not now,” Clark said, tearfully. Clark told KXAN with three children and two grandchildren, there’s too much she still wants to be able to see. When asked what she would say to the person who hit her and drove away, if given the opportunity, she said. “That I forgive you. But it’s changed my life and I know it’s changed that person’s life forever.” Clark is grateful to be alive. She’s also still human. “I had a little meltdown this morning from it,” Clark said, tearing up. “I made it across the living room on my walker but it’s just like, it shouldn’t be that hard. Just to do that.” Clark and her family now just want closure. “I wish that their conscience or something would just go okay, I know I need to do the right thing and turn myself in.” A witness told police the car has temporary dealership license plate tags.

 Walmart acquires ShoeBuy for $70M BI Intelligence Jan. 6, 2017, 11:48 AM 1,826 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Jet.com gets a lift in holiday sales RETAIL FORECAST: U.S. consumers will spend $632 billion online by 2020 E-Commerce & Online Payment Technologies Overview & Trends This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walmart has acquired e-commerce pureplay ShoeBuy for $70 million in a bid to bolster inventory on Jet.com and help boost overall online sales growth, reports Recode. While the acquisition has the potential to breathe new life in Jet.com's wavering performance, the marketplace's struggles with customer loyalty in the past could minimize ShoeBuy's contribution. Jet.com's sales soared during the holidays, but maintaining this growth will be challenging. Jet.com has had trouble breeding customer loyalty and encouraging shoppers to return for future purchases. As of February 2016, 70% of all sales were from first-time buyers, according to Slice Intelligence, meaning just 30% of purchases were from loyal shoppers. Even with new inventory from ShoeBuy, Walmart could continue to see limited returns from Jet.com if consumers fail to come back for future purchases. Looking ahead, Jet.com will need to focus on engaging consumers and encouraging them to return via initiatives like loyalty programs, or by expanding inventory and product categories. E-commerce has been on the rise in the last several years, thanks in large part to titans in the industry such as Amazon and Alibaba. E-commerce will truly become the future of retail, as nearly all of the growth in the retail sector now takes place in the digital space. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, forecasts that U.S. consumers will spend $385 billion online in 2016. Moreover, BI Intelligence predicts that number will grow to $632 billion in 2020. This is hardly surprising considering e-commerce's healthy growth. Though the U.S. retail average growth rate in the first half of 2016 was just 2% for total retail, it was 16% for e-commerce. The number of online shoppers has grown by nearly 20 million from 2015 to 2016. And these 224 million shoppers are spending more, as the total amount spent online grew from $61 billion in the first quarter of 2015 to $68 billion in Q1 2016. Finally, these customers are transacting more frequently, as the number of online transactions has risen by 115 million from 2015 to 2016. But all of this shopping online creates its own set of challenges, both for consumers and the companies that are trying to get their products onto shoppers' screens and into their shopping carts. In short, you need a plan. And to create your ultimate e-commerce battle plan, you need the right intel. BI Intelligence is here to help. Our team of industry experts has you covered on topics such as: Shopping cart abandonment Marketing effectiveness Merchandise returns Customer satisfaction Social media monetization Mobile payments Accommodating shoppers at the 11th hour And much more Interested in getting the full bundle of nearly 80 reports?

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Jan 07, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp World Business Quick Take Agencies POLITICS Trump still anti-AT&T bid US president-elect Donald Trump remains opposed to AT&T Inc’s planned US$85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc, Bloomberg reported, citing people close to the president-elect. Trump, who has been silent about the transaction for months, told a friend in the past few weeks that he still considers the merger to be a bad deal, Bloomberg reported. He believed the deal would concentrate too much power in the media industry, Bloomberg said. Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is also opposed to the deal, Bloomberg reported, citing another person. RETAIL Wal-Mart reaches Visa deal Wal-Mart Stores Inc reached an agreement to continue accepting Visa Inc credit cards in Canada, ending the retailer’s threat to bar the world’s largest payments network from its 409 stores in the country. Customers in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario, would be able to use their Visa cards from yesterday, Alex Roberton, a spokesman for the retailer, said on Thursday in a statement. Wal-Mart’s Canadian unit threatened in June last year to expel Visa from all of its stores nationwide unless the network agreed to lower the amount it charges for credit-card transactions. CYPRUS Bank says it repaid bailout Bank of Cyprus, the Mediterranean island’s largest lender, on Thursday announced it had paid back in full the 11.4 billion euros (US$12.07 billion) in Emergency Liquidity Assistance it received in an international bailout. The bank said in a statement that it was “another significant milestone in the journey back to strength since 2013.” In March 2013, Cyprus clinched a 10 billion euro loan from the EU and IMF to bail out its troubled economy and oversized banking system. Under the terms of the deal, the government was required to close the island’s second-largest bank, Laiki, and impose a 47.5 percent haircut on deposits above 100,000 euros at Bank of Cyprus. PORTUGAL Lone Star ‘most promising’ Portugal’s central bank said on Wednesday an offer from US private equity firm Lone Star is the most promising bid to buy Novo Banco SA, the so-called good bank salvaged by the Portuguese government from the collapse of major lender Banco Espirito Santo SA. The Bank of Portugal said it has invited the fund, based in Dallas, Texas, to “deepen negotiations” over the possible purchase, though it said rival bidders have expressed a willingness to improve their offers and would not be excluded. The statement gave neither price tag nor date for a final decision. It did not name the other bidders. SERVICES UK sees 17-month high A survey of Britain’s services sector, which accounts for the bulk of the economy, shows it grew at a 17-month high at the end of last year. The purchasing managers’ index, a gauge of business activity, rose for a third month to 56.2 points last month from 55.2 in November. The index, published on Thursday by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, is on a 100-point scale, with figures above 50 indicating growth. The improvement was due to an increase in new work and comes despite uncertainty over the country’s decision to leave the EU. Britain says it will trigger the two-year Brexit process by the end of March. This story has been viewed 1929 times. Comments will be moderated.

Strength trainers wander through the gym, hopelessly searching for the matches to lone dumbbells, while yogis abandon their zen in a race for the last remaining mat. Regulars get flustered after being displaced from “their” treadmills, which are now occupied by people with fitness-related New Year’s resolutions poking at the machines’ foreign buttons in confusion. Gym rats congregate in corners of the gym like a true colony, overlooking their newly overcrowded territory as if it has been unjustly invaded by a rebel group led by Instagram fitness models. Meanwhile, intimidated newcomers to the fitness world quiver with intimidation as a nearby hunk of muscle zealously grunts through a set of sit-ups. This tension turns a space that is peaceful and sacred into yet another that is segregated and stressful. Making a resolution to be more physically active is a decision that should be praised and supported, not ridiculed as a temporary, bandwagon decision that hinders the workouts of gym regulars. The benefits of exercise resemble those of a “miracle cure” or “wonder drug,” according to a 2015 report by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, an institute comprised of 21 medical colleges and faculties in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The report said exercise has a dual functionality, providing prevention and prescription for an infinite assortment of both mental and physical ailments. For college students, such benefits can be essential to counteracting a deskbound life of studying and the unhealthy behaviors associated with it, including poor eating choices, lethargy, binge drinking, drug use and a lack of sleep. Because of the drastic impact that exercise can have on wellness, we should view it the same as classes and extracurriculars: something obligatory that is scheduled inflexibly into our week. Sedentary lifestyle increases all causes of mortality and doubles the risk of developing serious medical conditions, according to the World Health Organization. Physical activity can reduce these risks and reverse these symptoms, thus why it has been praised as a “wonder drug.” But taking responsibility of one’s health by engaging in regular exercise does not stop at the individual level. Preventable, obesity-related illnesses come at an unsettling economic cost to taxpayers and employers. About 68 percent of adults in the United States are considered to be overweight or obese, according to a report by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases. This adds to already existing costs that account for 21 percent of annual medical government spending, according to a study published by the Journal of Health Economics. If more people take responsibility for their health at younger ages, fewer medical claims may be made and the cost of health care could plateau or even decline as fewer individuals lead sedentary lifestyles. Therefore, an overall increase in activity level would yield a happier, healthier society. The sight of Halas swarming with new faces shouldn’t be irritating. It should be exciting. It’s a sign that people are taking care of their minds and bodies. Talking smack about resolution-makers won’t alleviate the issue of limited gym space; it merely threatens to make exercising a negative experience for some people. So what if a pithy flip of a calendar page inspires people to be more physically active? Motivation can be difficult to come by — it’s even more difficult to maintain — so there should be no shame in jumping on the New Year’s resolution bandwagon. We must use the annual fitness craze as a catalyst for creating and sustaining healthy lifestyles. Those who already have a regular fitness routine ought to welcome newcomers, abstain from complaining about the great gym migration in January and find energy amid the anarchy. With acceptance and encouragement, this year’s New Year’s resolution-ers could be next year’s gym rats.

(CARLOS BARRIA/REUTERS) Wal-Mart unit Sam’s Club chief executive to retire next month Add to ... Siddharth Cavale Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 06, 2017 10:08AM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 06, 2017 12:27PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Wal-Mart Stores Inc said Rosalind Brewer, the longest-serving CEO of its warehouse chain Sam’s Club, would retire next month, and would be succeeded by company veteran John Furner. Brewer, the first woman and the first African American to run a top Wal-Mart business, will leave on Feb. 1 to take on a “new challenge,” according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Brewer, 54, a champion of diversity within the workplace, came under fire after she alluded that she saw a problem with an all Caucasian male staff at a Sam’s Club supplier. The comments, made during a CNN interview in December, was seen by some critics as promoting workplace racism, triggering hashtags “#boycottsamsclub” and “#boycottracistsamsclub.” Under Brewer’s five-year tenure as CEO, Sam’s Club’s sales rose 5.6 per cent to $56.2-billion. The unit’s same-store sales growth beat analysts’ estimates in the past three quarters. Furner, currently the chief merchandising officer at Sam’s Club, joined Wal-Mart in 1993. Furner, 42, has served in various capacities, including as the chief merchandising officer of Walmart China. “In John, we see someone who loves the company and our associates, has learned the business from the bottom up and across, and has the desire to lead change which is so necessary in today’s environment,” Wal-Mart’s Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in the memo. Sam’s Club, the smallest of Wal-Mart’s three business units, operates membership-only warehouse clubs in 48 states in the United States and in Puerto Rico. The business accounted for about 12 per cent of the company’s fiscal 2016 net sales. The world’s biggest retailer’s shares were down 1.3 per cent in afternoon trading on Friday and was the top percentage loser among Dow stocks.

According to Marietta police, 28-year-old Timothy D. Blake man was arrested after several incidents going all the way back to January of 2016. In the first case, reported on January 19, 2016, an anonymous woman reported that someone threw a suspicious ‘mayonnaise’ substance on her back while she was shopping. Police were able to pull surveillance images, but the victim was unwilling to go public or pursue charges. In November of 2016, another woman contacted police directly. A test on the substance sprayed on her determined that it was semen, according to police. On December 28, a Walmart employee reported a similar incident. On December 30 at a local restaurant, an off-duty police officer spotted a company truck that matched a truck linked to the suspect. Blake is accused of masturbating in parking lots, then putting the semen in a syringe. Blake admitted to having a fetish and spraying women with his semen from a syringe he carries with him, according to police. He also said that he used egg yolks and flour or spit in the past. According to WTAP, Blake is facing charges of pandering obscenities, misdemeanor menacing by stalking and misdemeanor sexual imposition. Blake was arraigned in Marietta Municipal Court on Tuesday and bond was set at $11,000. He was ordered to wear a GPS ankle monitor. “It’s not something that we’ve encountered before and after we arrested Mr. Blake, we asked him about it, and he said it was something that he had discovered on the internet and decided to try it,” Washington County Sheriff Larry Mincks told WTAP. Police believe there may have been more victims, given the 10-month span between reported cases. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

Plus, for "Flashback Friday," a look back at a time when fears over mad cow disease hit Canada. If you're looking for a newscast to catch up on the morning's top stories, watch CTV News On the Go. 1. Runners-up: Team Canada finished second at the world junior hockey championships after blowing a two goal lead to the United States.  2. Report coming: President-elect Donald Trump is set to receive a long-awaited report from U.S. intelligence officials about concerns that Russia interfered in the U.S. election this year. The report comes a day after senior intelligence officials said Russia clearly meddled in the election and helped its outcome.  3. Visa ban lifted: Walmart's ban on Visa cards at Canadian locations was suddenly lifted yesterday. Both Walmart and Visa Canada confirmed that shoppers at 16 Manitoba stores and three in Thunder Bay could resume accepting the payment form.  4. Helping vets: Canada's military watchdog says injured soldiers are being forced out of the military before they're ready, and need more support for treating post-traumatic stress disorder. The comments come after a veteran killed his family and himself in Nova Scotia. 5. Flu activity: Doctors and experts say Canada is in the midst of a terrible flu season, with the worst yet to come. New data is expected to be released today, but the last most recent data from the Public Health Agency of Canada recorded an increase in outbreaks and admissions to hospitals in mid-December. And one more thing for "Flashback Friday": On this day in 2004, DNA tests confirm that a Holstein infected with the first case of mad cow disease in the U.S. came from a ranch in Alberta.

Waterford Des Martin @DublinGlobe January 06, 2017 05:25 AM 550SHARES / How much do you know about the quiet revolution currently underway in Co. Waterford?Dublin Globe When people think of the technology that is transforming the world around us, they think Silicon Valley and innovative startups. Few have Tramore, Co. Waterford on their radar. But before we get into the story of nearForm, the Tramore-based company winning huge enterprise customers, let’s look at the changing tech landscape. Enterprise software development is facing some challenges. Large monolith software systems are increasingly difficult to update. Think of online banking apps with poor user experience and well-known eCommerce websites with painful purchase processes. In this environment, a small change can take months to implement. 9-month release cycles, stressful working environments and an IP that stays with the employer complete the not-so-pretty picture. Once upon a time software was only necessary for SaaS companies. Now every company on the Fortune 500 needs to be a tech company with cutting edge software at its core. Hotel Groups, Cruise Liner Companies, Media Conglomerates and more all need to center their entire experience on the customer. Think apps, booking engines, mobile experience, and in-store technology. These days the customer experience needs to be seamless. As customers we expect this and if the enterprise cannot deliver we will find an alternative. That is where the open source revolution comes into play. Passionate people work on open source projects for little or no pay, driven by the knowledge that there is a better way, a brighter future. Three emerging trends have a significant impact on enterprise software: Node.js, Containers, and Micro-Services. In layman terms, this turns monolithic software systems into a necklace with hundreds or thousands of parts. Each part can be swapped out or upgraded in a short space of time allowing rapid development and response to customers needs. 2 nearForm in Tramore. Back to nearForm, a global company with its HQ in Tramore. Founded in 2012 nearForm were the first company outside of Silicon Valley to focus on Node.js consulting for the enterprise. To date, nearForm have done more Node.js deployments for enterprise than anyone else globally. To understand the impact, take Walmart as an example. The software development team there transformed the US retail giant’s mobile e-commerce platform to Node.js, which contributed to two extremely successful and uneventful Black Fridays. The man who ran that team was Eran Hammer, a high-profile member of the global Node.js community. After he left Walmart, he joined nearForm in Tramore as a senior architect. The conventional wisdom is that a company like nearForm needs to be based in Silicon Valley and secure large funding rounds to be successful. Surely that is how you attract the superstars? Bucking this trend nearForm are based in an Irish seaside village with a decentralized team of engineers from across the globe. The nearForm ethos puts developers and their families first and allows staff to retain their IP. This ethos enabled nearForm to attract the superstar names in the world of Node.js and Micro-Services such as Eran to work for the company and in many cases live in Tramore. These engineers are attracted by the opportunity and quality of life on Ireland’s copper coast. Great to see further expansion of #Tramore firm @NearForm with the hire of @eranhammer http://t.co/fOF2BMDnSl via @IrishTimesBiz — Kevin Mitchell (@kevin7mitchell) June 11, 2015 nearForm’s customers include Intel, Ancestry.com, Conde Nast, Fandango and DPD to name a few. This year the company opened up offices in London and New York to keep up with growing demand. This story is about more than nearForm. It’s about changes in the way people work and how corporations treat their employees. People can now work and make a decent living in the town where they grew up. Or escape cities and migrate to the country to bring up a family. The relationship between corporations and their employees is rebalanced in favor of the family. That is huge news for Ireland’s diaspora and people pressurized to move away from their hometown. Keep an eye on towns like Tramore, where the next generation of Ireland’s talent is building world-beating companies. --- Des Martin recently joined nearForm as CMO.

This is a violation of Section 493(34) of the Liquor Code, according to the report. These charges will be brought before an Administrative Law Judge who has the authority to impose penalties ranging from $50 to $1,000 for minor offenses and up to $5,000 for more serious offenses. In addition, the judge can also impose a license suspension or revocation of the license based on the severity of the charge brought.

Orwigsburg man faces theft charge CRESSONA — A man from Orwigsburg stole a pair of boots from the Goodwill Store at Cressona Mall in North Manheim Township on Dec. 26, state police at Schuylkill Haven said Wednesday. Then the man, Dean Elliott, 57, returned to the store on Dec. 30 wearing the stolen boots, and he was recognized by staff, police said. On Dec. 30, the store manager approached Elliott and asked him about the boots, and Elliott admitted he stole them. When state police arrived and took Elliott into custody, they found he was in possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia, police said. Retail theft and Act 64 charges were filed in the office of Magisterial District Judge James R. Ferrier, Orwigsburg, police said. Police investigate theft of vehicle A 22-year-old Minersville man was committed to prison after being arrested by Pottsville police after officers were called to 400 Main St. about 12:20 a.m. Dec. 30 for a report of a motor vehicle theft. Responding officers were told that a Pottsville man’s Dodge Neon was just stolen in that area and was driving away along with a dark green mini van that dropped off the suspected thief. Police said state police subsequently found the Neon and the van in the parking lot of the Sheetz store at routes 209 and 901 and a check of the license plate on the van determined that it had been stolen from Newark, New Jersey. Police said that officers then saw Gavin Heim and an unidentified black man flee the parking lot into the woods across Route 901 and crossing the Schuylkill River. Pottsville officers, along with state police from the Schuylkill Haven station, Schuylkill Haven, Saint Clair and Minersville, searched the area and found the two on the railroad tracks where they again entered the river. Heim was taken into custody but the other man was able to flee, police said, adding that the investigation into identifying him is ongoing. The investigation determined that Heim was the driver of the mini van that was reported stolen in New Jersey on Dec. 29 and a criminal complaint was prepared, charging him with felony receiving stolen property, unauthorized use of an automobile and theft. He was arraigned by Magisterial District Judge James K. Reiley, Pottsville, and committed to Schuylkill County Prison unable to post $20,000 bail. Police said that investigators are actively working with other law enforcement agencies concentrating on the vehicle theft in the city as well as several others that are believed to be linked to the actors in this incident and accomplices in the state of New Jersey.

By Frank Andruscavage / Published: January 6, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     ANDY MATSKO/STAFF PHOTO A two-vehicle collision occurred Thursday at Route 61 and Terry Rich Boulevard in Saint Clair. Four people were injured. SAINT CLAIR — A child suffered life-threatening injuries, and three other people were hurt Thursday afternoon in a crash at Route 61 and Terry Rich Boulevard, the entrance to the Wal-Mart complex. Saint Clair police Patrolman Joseph Leskin Jr., the investigating officer, said the crash occurred about 12:15 p.m. Leskin said the preliminary investigation indicated that a Nissan minivan was attempting to make a left turn from Route 61 south to enter the Wal-Mart plaza when it was struck on the passenger’s side by a northbound Ford F-150. The impact occurred in the middle of the intersection, and both vehicles sustained extensive damage. Leskin said two people inside the Nissan — a man driving the vehicle and a woman who was a front seat passenger — were both taken to a Pottsville hospital by Schuylkill EMS. A 4-year-old boy inside that vehicle was flown to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest, Allentown, with life-threatening injuries, Leskin said. The driver of the pickup truck, a woman, was also taken to a Pottsville hospital by Schuylkill EMS for treatment. Leskin said the identities of those involved in the crash are not being released pending the ongoing investigation and notification of family members. Assisting at the scene were Port Carbon police, state police from the Frackville station, and Saint Clair firefighters and fire police. Leskin said the investigation is ongoing. Anyone who may have witnessed the crash is asked to call Saint Clair police at 570-429-3050.

Customers in Manitoba and Thunder Bay, Ontario, will be able to use their Visa cards starting Jan. 6, Alex Roberton, a spokesman for the retailer, said Thursday in an e-mailed statement. Wal-Mart’s Canadian unit threatened in June to expel Visa from all of its stores nationwide unless the network agreed to lower the amount it charges for credit-card transactions. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, stopped accepting Visa at its three Thunder Bay outlets on July 18, and followed up three months later with a ban at 16 stores in Manitoba. “We have come to an agreement with Wal-Mart through which Visa credit cards will be accepted at all Canadian Wal-Mart stores,” Carla Hindman, a Visa Canada spokeswoman, said in a statement. She declined to elaborate. Walmart Canada, which has said it pays more than C$100 million ($76 million) annually on credit-card transaction fees, called the amount Visa charges “unacceptably high” in a June 11 statement on its website.

(Al Hartmann | The Salt Lake Tribune) The old Granite High School at 3300 S. 500 E. in South Salt Lake remains boarded up Tuesday July 26. A prominent developer's deal to buy the old property has been extended and a new development plan is in the works. Garbett Homes and Wasatch Property's previous plan included 78 homes and a retail center anchored by a neighborhood Wal-Mart grocery store and would have put $10.6 million in Granite School Districtís coffers. Development » Some residents fear big-box presence, want whole parcel planned. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) South Salt Lake • A planning commission took a big step toward approving lots for 76 single-family homes on the old Granite High property Thursday night. Despite objections from community members who want the entire 27 acres of the former campus to be plotted, the South Salt Lake Planning Commission voted unanimously to give preliminary approval for Garbett Homes to build on the 16 southernmost acres of the property. The company's Jacob Ballstaedt said that after it closes with property owner Granite School District this month, the school district would have six months to tear down the buildings that comprised the school until it closed in 2009. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Some residents and alumni, along with the Utah Arts Alliance, had hoped to preserve some or all of the school buildings. Left up in the air was what will happen to the 11 acres on the north side of the property. Community members are concerned that a big-box commercial store might be built there. "For us, Wal-Mart is not off the table," said Ballstaedt. "We don't decide. Anything other than single-family homes is up to the council. That is one of many options for us in a continuing resolution. The opposition to Wal-Mart is not universal. We need to take time to find a solution. We will move forward with what we have." Commercial development on the remaining 11 acres would require a zoning change, according to Commission Chairman Jeremy Carter, with the input of new residents in the subdivision considered. Merili Carter, who leads an alumni group that wants to save the buildings, said the city was rushing its decision. She presented a petition to save the buildings, which one plan says could be used for an arts complex. Aaron Metcalf, of Centerville, said he worked for a large contractor that does historical renovations and that the buildings could be saved in a cost-effective manner. Commissioner Rachael Lauritzen, who made the motion to approve the residential plat plan, said she saw no grounds to delay the project. Her motion did include a requirement that the city — not a homeowners association — manage a proposed two-thirds-acre open space on 500 East. wharton@sltrib.com Twitter @tribtomwharton   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS Kirby: Wait'll you see how much the Mormon church pays me How much do top Mormon leaders make?

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)    4443001 Video footage taken from a Florida Wal-Mart shows a shopper literally jumping the gun. The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Wall Street isn't optimistic about either retailer right now, and that could spell opportunity for long-term investors. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Jan 5, 2017 at 9:07PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) each have a nagging growth problem. For Wal-Mart, its customer traffic trends consistently trail rival Costco's (NASDAQ:COST). Lowe's, meanwhile, can't seem to break Home Depot's (NYSE:HD) tight grip on the home improvement market. However, investors shouldn't ignore retailers simply because they are outshined in some areas by rivals. In fact, these out-of-favor stocks tend to be available at attractive valuations that leave plenty of room for market-beating gains. With that in mind, let's look at these two companies as potential buy candidates. Here are a few key statistics to get us started: Metric Wal-Mart Lowe's Market cap $212 billion $62 billion Sales growth 1.4% 3.9% Net profit margin 3% 3.9% Dividend yield 2.9% 2% Return on invested capital 15% 13.6% Price-to-sales ratio 0.45 1 Price-to-earnings ratio 15 26  52-week price performance 13% (5%) Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Sales growth and return on invested capital are for the past nine months and exclude fuel sales and exchange rate changes.  Growth slowdown Wal-Mart's biggest achievement over the past few years has been a steady rebound in its customer traffic trends. Shopper transactions ticked higher for the eighth consecutive time last quarter, and while its 0.7% increase trailed Costco's 2.4% jump, Wal-Mart clearly has momentum on its side. Improved average spending per visit and e-commerce sales both contributed to a near-3% revenue boost in its U.S. stores last quarter, which equates to $2 billion of extra revenue. Image source: Getty Images. Lowe's is enjoying faster growth, but only because its industry is in a sharp upswing. Comparable-store sales are up 3.9% through the first three quarters of 2016. Home Depot enjoyed nearly twice that growth pace, which is one reason why Lowe's management isn't happy with its recent performance. "Traffic slowed more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October," CEO Robert Niblock told investors. Unlike Home Depot and Wal-Mart, Lowe's is getting help from a growing store footprint that pushes sales higher. Yet its latest results suggest it is losing more ground to rivals while Wal-Mart is winning back some share. Profits heading lower Wal-Mart's 3% profit margin makes it significantly more profitable than Costco. However, its earnings power is under considerable pressure that could stick around for years. Over the short term, profits have plunged as the retailer plowed cash into initiatives aimed at improving the customer shopping experience through higher employee wages and better stocked shelves. Rising shopper satisfaction scores and increased customer visits are the key benefits of those moves, but they came at a significant cost. Operating income fell 11% over the last full fiscal year. Lowe's isn't faring any better. In fact, its profitability has slumped as the retailer increasingly turns to price cuts to protect its sales growth. Its 3.9% net margin is less than half of Home Depot's. LOW Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. The better buy Investors can buy Lowe's at about 1 times sales, or well below Home Depot's ratio of 1.8. Similarly, Wal-Mart is available at 0.45 times the past year of revenue, compared to 0.59 times sales for Costco. While both valuations represent significant discounts, I'm more optimistic about a Wal-Mart purchase today. The retailing titan appears to have a good plan in place for protecting market share from traditional rivals and from e-commerce threats. Lowe's, on the other hand, has only seen its market share losses accelerate on challenges from a competitor that seems to have a much better read on its industry. Neither company is likely to wow shareholders with market-thumping operating results anytime soon. But Wal-Mart's sturdier traffic and profitability trends make it the better buy in this match up, in my view. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.

Expat in mexico. "Gasolinazo" We live in the Estado de Mexico (Edomex) minutes from the boundary with Mexico City (Lindavista) and for 2 days we have been experiencing fallout from the protests of the 20% increase in gas prices. Yesterday, I went to the CFE office in Lindavista (Mexico City-CDMX) to reconcile an issue with our latest billing. It seems like payments made on Oct 27th did not get all credited to your account. I took a taxi to avoid parking issues but had to wait more than normal as very few Edomex taxis were out. Many of the stores in Lindavista had one or more of their entrances closed and a very heavy police presence was out. Returning home I took a CDMX taxi to the Walmart shopping center but it was completely closed - Walmart-Suburbia-Sams. Absolutely no Edomex taxis at the sitio or on the street so I walked home. This morning an Aurrera store 20 minutes north of us in Ecatepec was looted as the police stood by. Still no Edomex taxis on the street or sitios-only a few Mexico City taxis. The Walmart shopping center remains completely closed as well as most of the shops. Only a very few small shops remain open. Trash pick-up occurred but no mail service. There were a few construction trucks but no gas deliveries in our fraccionamiento today My wife who works as a supervisor for a home nursing service reports that many of her nurses called in as unavailable today. Her travels to clients was better than yesterday but still small issues in Mexico City especially at the open Pemex locations which are very crowded. Overall, it seems that the Estado de Mexico is experiencing more problems than Mexico City. On today's, Televisa Foro news channel the lead off story was about problems with coral reefs in the Yucatan. Harding any mention was made on the 1:30 PM broadcast of the "gasolinazo" protests and looting.   #2 (permalink)   5th January 2017, 10:22 PM Gatos Member   Join Date: Aug 2016 Location: mexico Posts: 560 Rep Power: 3530 135 likes received Originally from usa.

I read this morning that there is another 8% increase (across the board) scheduled for Feb 3rd.   #3 (permalink)   6th January 2017, 01:35 PM ojosazules11 Member   Join Date: Nov 2013 Location: Toronto & Tepoztlan Posts: 922 Rep Power: 127 732 likes received 696 likes given Originally from canada. Expat in mexico. I've been hearing from family in Mexico that the violence and looting is being fomented by provocateurs (state agents acting as if they are independent civilians) in order to distract people from the gasolinazo, as well as to create an atmosphere of fear and insecurity so that people are less likely to participate in legitimate, peaceful protests. Check out the graphic in this article which shows an analysis of social media to determine how widespread across the country the calls to peaceful protest have been, vs the centralized nature of the calls to vandalism. (I also learned a new word in Spanish from this article: zafarrancho, meaning havoc or chaos in this context.) Â¿QuiÃ©n infundiÃ³ miedo en redes y WhatsApp y llamÃ³ al saqueo?

Identifican âacciÃ³n coordinadaâ Sin Embargo is a great site, ojosazules, thanks for the tip! In Colima, nothing but legitimate protests, a burning in effigy of EPN, and the liberation of a caseta on the cuota. No saqueos that I'm aware of. The gasolinazo has struck a nerve in Mexico, and the people have figured the government isn't being square with them. Through it, I'd strongly discourage my fellow expats from the urge to get involved in protests unless you're already a Mexican citizen---and maybe not even then. The powers that be would love nothing more than to very publicly toss a few extranjeros under Article 33 as yet another distraction and an appeal to ever-present nationalism. It happens every time there's domestic trouble.

Expat in mexico. Here’s an article in English about the social media bots. It looks like the government wanted (wants) to take advantage of protests against the gasoline price rise by converting mere demonstrations and marches into riots and looting. Then they could use the ‘riots and looting’ as justification for coming down with a heavy hand. The provocateur tactics appear to have been, so far as I have seen: • on social media, sharing and resharing photos of people looting to make it seem widespread. Are these photos even from current events? • creating bot twitter users to share these and to recruit provocateurs • seeding marches and demonstrations with provocateurs Isla Verde and ojosazules11 like this.   #6 (permalink)   6th January 2017, 05:42 PM perropedorro Member   Join Date: Mar 2016 Location: El Lay ----> Playas Colimenses Posts: 308 Rep Power: 0 226 likes received 229 likes given Originally from usa.

To summarize, it appears that this particular botnet all originates with one guy. I'm guessing he's something like a sociologist with tech skills, which is pretty scary. So, the question is: Who is he working for? ojosazules11 likes this.   #7 (permalink)   7th January 2017, 02:04 PM ojosazules11 Member   Join Date: Nov 2013 Location: Toronto & Tepoztlan Posts: 922 Rep Power: 127 732 likes received 696 likes given Originally from canada.

I am still not convinced that those groups are directed by the government itself, , part of the PRII , I believe but I am not convinced otherwise.. Also people down there immediately blame the grupos de choque for just about every problem, again , I m not convinced..   #9 (permalink)   7th January 2017, 04:17 PM perropedorro Member   Join Date: Mar 2016 Location: El Lay ----> Playas Colimenses Posts: 308 Rep Power: 0 226 likes received 229 likes given Originally from usa. Expat in mexico. In Guadalajara for the weekend and family tells me it's been fairly calm with peaceful marches, a few Pemex stations being blocked and, curiously, some threats of saqueos (WalMart) that didn't materialize, although I can't find much in the news regarding the nature of those threats. Looks like some looting plans were bounced around the nets, and stores reacted by temporarily closing, but not enough people showed up to get the show started. The most positive thing I saw was a few players from Chivas who attended a march on bicycles and encouraged the citizenry to bike-up as a way of telling Pemex to shove it. mr_manny likes this. vBulletin Message   Cancel Changes Quick Reply The following errors occurred with your submission Okay Message: Options Quote message in reply?

The three Wise County bell ringing locations collected a total of $42,672. Bell-ringers in front of Wal-Mart in Decatur raised $35,209, up from $28,000 in 2015, and the bell-ringers at Lowe’s and Brookshire’s in Bridgeport raised $7,463, up from $6,207 in 2015. Wise County Kettle Chairwoman Tana Fedric attributed the up-tick in donations to increased advertising, more volunteers and good weather. “We had someone out there ringing almost every day,” Fedric said. Fedric said the donations will mainly be used to help Wise County residents in need pay their utility bills. In the case of an emergency, like a tornado or flood, the Salvation Army may also provide relief. Fedric said that the combined Decatur and Bridgeport service units serve roughly 600 to 700 people a year. “Of course, now with more money we’re going to be able to serve more,” she said.

The Root Deadspin Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root The Grapevine Journal-isms The Root TV News Politics Culture History Lists Photos Sam’s Club’s 1st Black CEO, Rosalind Brewer, Steps Down The Root Staff1/07/17 1:56pm Filed to: News African American CEOs Black CEOs Rosalind Brewer Sam's Club Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Rosalind Brewer in 2010 Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Rosalind Brewer, the first woman and the first African American to head Sam’s Club, stepped down from her position Friday, reports Fortune. Advertisement After five years at the helm of Sam’s Club, Brewer will be replaced by John Furner, Sam's Club’s chief merchant. Although Brewer said she is leaving the $57 billion-a-year company because “she wants a new challenge,” the word is that she is leaving because Sam’s is lagging behind its main competitor, Costco. Her last day on the job will be Feb. 1. Under Brewer, Sam's Club has made large strides in e-commerce, says Fortune, but the 650-store chain has struggled to narrow the sales-growth gap with Costco, whose growth rates have been several percentage points higher than Sam's in recent years. Fortune also reports that the average household income of a Costco member is about $120,000, making it much less vulnerable to downturns in consumer spending. Advertisement Brewer joined Wal-Mart in 2006 as regional vice president, overseeing operations in Georgia. She climbed the ranks to become division president of the Southeast, and later Wal-Mart East. She became CEO of Sam’s in 2012. Brewer sparked some controversy last year when she recounted a meeting with a supplier who had no representation of women or people of color on his team during a CNN interview. “My executive team is very diverse, and I make that a priority. I demand it within my team,” Brewer shared during the interview about diversity. “Just today we met with a supplier, and the entire other side of the table was all Caucasian males. That was interesting.” Sponsored The Root contributor Charles Ellison said that the backlash Brewer faced on social media for her comments was “merely the latest in a nauseating trend of mythical white victimology. Rather than a sensible exploration of Brewer’s point, the country club went ballistic, perhaps its buttons pushed to the outer limits of what white privilege could absorb.” Brewer, No. 19 on Fortune's Most Powerful Women in business list, was one of the few top African-American executives in retail. In fact, black CEOs represent barely 1 percent of Fortune 500 company heads, even as African Americans are a little over 13 percent of the U.S. population.

It’s important to care for the piercing as you would any wound. A stainless steel needle was pushed through your skin and it’s important to treat your new navel ring as such. After you’ve waited the recommended 6 to 12 months for your new piercing to heal, you’re probably ready to shop for some new belly button rings. They are available online, in piercing and tattoo salons, and at mall kiosks. Sometimes belly rings are available at department store jewelry counters or even discount stores like Wal-Mart and Target. No matter where you get your new body jewelry, you must follow these rules for clearing and changing your belly button rings. Before you even purchase the rings, check that they are made from a reliable material that won’t irritate your skin. Even after the piercing is healed, it may still be tender and prone to infection. The best materials for navel rings are 316L surgical steel (a form of stainless steel), titanium, Bioplast or Bioflex, 24K plated gold and 14K real gold. These materials are sanitary and strong and belly button rings made from these things are least likely to chip or break. Before inserting the belly ring, sterilize each product with warm soapy water to remove any dirt and oil. You may also autoclave your belly button rings, which is a sterilization process that uses extreme heat to rid things of any germs that can cause pain and infection. Generally, you will have to visit a tattoo or piercing salon if you want your navel rings autoclaved. When changing a ring, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you begin. If you have medical gloves available, you could wear those for added protection. Be sure to set your new belly ring close to where you are working so you can spend as little time as possible without anything in the piercing. Unscrew the top ball from the new belly ring that you want to insert and set it aside. On some belly button rings, only the top ball is removable, on some only the bottom ball is removable and on some both balls are removable. For ease and comfort, it is recommended that you remove the top ball. Gently grasp the bottom ball of the belly ring you are wearing firmly between your thumb and forefinger. Gently twist the top ball of the navel ring you are wearing to remove it from the barbell. Slowly pull the belly button ring down and out of your navel piercing. Immediate grab the replacement belly ring and position the ball-less part of the barbell near the inside of your belly button (where the piercing hole is). Slowly and gently apply pressure and continue until the barbell pokes through the top hole of your piercing. If this is your first time changing belly button rings, it may take a couple of tries to push it all the way through. Grab the top ball of your new ring and gently screw it on while holding the barbell still with your thumb and forefinger. After that is complete, immediately wash your hands, as well as the old belly button ring. If you follow these steps carefully, you’ll be able to change belly button rings frequently and easily.

Paint, of course. Doesn't everybody? I have four jobs. Most important to me, my main job, is about a 50-60 hour job on most weeks. Some weeks aren’t like that but the majority of my weeks are, and that’s ok because I love the pace. My other jobs require about 5-10 hours a week total, depending on how much extra income I want, as two of them are direct sales companies. Then I have this blog; which although it’s a source of income is more of a therapeutic outlet for me to vent and talk through my crazy life. I tell you all this because normally, I have 80 hours per week devoted to “stuff.” Don’t forget I’m also a single momma to Big and Little, so reallyyyyy, I have no time for really anything.  The week between Christmas and New Year’s is historically a week off for me. This year was no different but the exception was that I had no plans. NONE. Little was at home with me. I got into a really silly argument with my best friend, and had a lot on my mind in other regards. A lot; and more than normal. One morning, I woke up and decided I wanted to paint an accent wall. I went to Wal-Mart and stood at the paint swatches while Little and his “girlfriend” screamed through the aisles. The man next to me at the paint swatches asked if they were my children. I looked their direction and looked back at the man and shook my head no. I denied even knowing them. It was after Christmas; Santa had already been to see me, so I figured I was safe! I picked a dark charcoal color for an accent wall, and then got another gallon of an accent color for my kitchen. In true Holli fashion, before painting, I had taken it to Facebook for everyone’s opinion. People were encouraging the kitchen to be a variety of colors ranging from terra cotta, turquoise, to eggshell. If you are someone who uses these terms, stop it. Just say red, blue and white. It’s annoying. My mother told me that I needed to be “hip” and pick a jewel tone. I chose a color called “Caribbean Sea.” Maybe, I thought, a super-hot muscular man in a swimsuit would pop out of the pantry when I searched for pasta. Maybe a beach would magically appear outside over the Chihuahua poop covered dead grass in the backyard. You never know.  Before painting I took Little and his girl to see “Sing” at our movie theatre. I’m actually not even sure what that movie was about. My mother went with us and I could tell that within two minutes she wanted to get out of the theatre. She’s hyper-sensitive to sick people; she really should have worked for the CDC. I feel like she would really have enjoyed that job because she’s a little obsessed about researching every latest sickness out there. Anyway, the whole theatre was hacking and coughing and every time they did, she would shift uncomfortably in her chair. By hour TWO of this horrific movie with singing animals, I had enough. When I got home, I didn’t think that painting with two 4-year old’s at home would be difficult. ERROR. Don’t do this. EVER. First of all, I don’t tape things; who has time for that, for real. So I thought I could easily “stay within the lines” with my hip jewel tones except I was so incredibly stressed out about painting with children at the house that instead of an accent wall, I started painting like everything in my kitchen. Side note: one time my bestie and I drank a bottle of wine and thought my bedroom needed to be the color of the merlot we were drinking. We also didn’t tape. I woke up the next morning with red on the carpet, in my hair, on the ceiling; everywhere. I should have learned then; but didn’t. I painted jewel tone Caribbean Sea all over the kitchen, not knowing when to stop. When I thought I found a good spot, Little’s girl came in and touched the wall to see “if it was dry,” and then twirled around to “dance” and to balance herself, she touched an unpainted wall. Mmmkay. Now I had to paint THAT wall. So, in the end, not so much an “accent wall,” but really a whole complete kitchen overhaul.  The living room would be different, I thought. I had just one specific wall to paint charcoal grey. Again, without taping, I painted. I did great; in my opinion. However! My mother came over to look at the work. She walked in and squinted her little beady eyes at the wall. She made light conversation. She avoided the topic of the wall. She almost avoided the Caribbean Sea too, but finally complimented it. But the grey she said, “so, are you done with that wall?” I erupted into a major fit of rage and screamed at her about how inconsiderate and insensitive she was; and she tried to leave to go home. No! I followed her out, gently prying her for more information without leading her to believe that she was right. Also a side note: do you know you have muscles in your body called Painter’s Muscles? Yes. It’s true. They only get worked during painting. They reside in every area of your entire body; but you don’t usually feel them. Lemme tell ya; after two days of accent wall painting, I felt them.  On day 3 of the accent wall painting, I woke up barely able to get out of bed. My Painter’s Muscles were throbbing. There’s no way I’d let my Mothership win the paint war. She was wrong! My house looked great. Little’s girl came over for another play date; and I slowly dragged all the paint supplies back out again. I now have charcoal grey walls on six of my living room walls (again, not an accent) and light grey (that I miraculously had in my garage) on nine walls/space. My mother won. The two children stayed far away from me during these three days; and my Painter’s Muscle group have been restored to normal usage. We cleaned all our closets and rearranged all the furniture. Are you truly aware how dirty your home looks after you paint? Ugh, so gross. I spent the remaining days of my “vacation” and time away from work bleaching the house, doing all the laundry, and peeling candy wrappers off Big’s floor from Halloween. I was genuinely excited to return to my four jobs away from my house. I couldn’t punch any more hours into my timeclock at the house! It made my “real” work seem easy, in comparison. I give all you housewives and stay at home mothers huge props; this is a full time job that I do not want!  Tweet Related items Lipstick and Legos – Holiday Cheer (Mostly) Lipstick and Legos – The Simple Truth About Divorce Lipstick & Legos: Shopping and Carpet Stains Lipstick and Legos – A Series of Unfortunate Events Lipstick and Legos: Fido?

BY Seth Kershner Share TweetReddit2 StumbleUpon8EmailPrint Email this article to a friend your email your name recipient(s) email (comma separated) message captcha The drumbeat of anti-unionism typically begins as soon as new employees begin their training. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)   Retail is the nation’s largest employer. Since 1980, the number of jobs in retail has reportedly grown nearly 50 percent, from 10.2 to 15.1 million. At the same time, real wages for retail workers have fallen by 11 percent while on-call scheduling, involuntary part-time work and “clopening”—where workers are required to lock up the store late at night and reopen the next morning—have wreaked havoc with workers’ lives. Not surprisingly, the retail sector also has one of the lowest rates of unionization in the economy—around the 5 percent mark under which unions have virtually no influence. It didn’t used to be this way. Retail had 15 percent union density in the 1970s, according to sociologist Peter Ikeler, with the density rate in grocery stores surpassing 31 percent at its peak in 1983. But, as with the rest of the labor movement, retail unionism has taken a steep fall since the early 1980s. How did it go so wrong? “There are a lot of parts to that puzzle,” says Ikeler, a sociologist at the State University of New York College at Old Westbury and author of the book, Hard Sell: Work and Resistance in Retail Chains.  Ikeler cites the general trend towards de-unionization of the U.S. workforce and the hollowing out of the National Labor Relations Act system through case law and employer challenges. But the most important factor in the fall of retail unionism, Ikeler argues, has been employer hostility. “The climate for labor organizing in retail is pretty explicitly negative,” Ikeler says. In a case Ikeler describes in his book, the public was able to get a glimpse of Target’s anti-union strategies—including mandatory film screenings and employees threatened with dismissal for talking about the union—during a highly publicized 2011 campaign to keep the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) from organizing one of its stores on Long Island. And across the retail industry, Target is far from unique. The drumbeat of anti-unionism typically begins as soon as new employees begin their training. New worker orientations at Walmart, the nation’s leading retailer, used to include a video that featured lines like: “The truth is unions are businesses, multimillion-dollar businesses that make their money by convincing people like you and me to give them a part of our paychecks.” According to The Atlantic, labor experts who had examined the entire video after it was leaked to the press found that it contained “blatant untruths in many of the video’s pro-company and anti-union statements.” Even smaller, regional chains invest in anti-union propaganda for new hires. According to internal documents provided to In These Times by an employee of Big Y, the Massachusetts-based grocer warns new hires about signing a union authorization card since the company’s “continued success” would be “jeopardized through third party involvement.” To research his book, Ikeler interviewed workers at Macy’s and Target stores in the New York City area. Many reported knowing that managers disapproved of unions. Several Target workers told Ikeler they were sure their jobs would be in jeopardy if they advocated for unions and reported that they knew people who’d been fired for union activity. When contacted for comment, a Target spokeswoman said that the company “believes in solving issues and concerns with the help and input of our team.” “At Target we have a longstanding commitment to our team that we will work together to create an environment of mutual trust between Target and our team members,” wrote Molly Snyder. Unions’ strategic missteps While employer resistance played the biggest role in the decline of retail unionism, Ikeler believes that unions also share part of the blame. Specifically, he thinks that unions have done a lousy job of keeping workers engaged. Ikeler points out that surveys indicate that around 13 percent of grocery store workers in the New York City area say they belong to a union. This is in contrast to the unions themselves, which say they represent a much larger share of such workers in the Big Apple. “What I think this huge disparity demonstrates,” Ikeler tells In These Times, “is that there are a fair number of workers who aren’t aware they’re in a union—it’s just something that comes out of their check every month. Sure, they might be organized in some bureaucratic sense—just not in any meaningful fighting capacity.” In Ikeler’s view, labor unions need to step up their organizing and “get back to what unions were in their early New Deal days: more worker-based rather these large staff-run, top-heavy entities that give lots of money to Democratic candidates every few years with relatively little payback.” A construct that can be challenged Ikeler also sees a lot of potential in the worker center model. Worker centers like the Retail Action Project, which Ikeler has studied extensively, give workers a place to go to form communities, talk about work conditions and plan campaigns. Another clear benefit is that worker centers help cultivate a sense of occupational identity in a sector of the economy known for deskilling workers in order to make them more easily replaceable. “A strong occupational identity—where workers are very committed to a craft, to an occupation—this has often been a source of collective identity and resistance,” Ikeler says. “If workers see themselves as part of an occupational community they may be more likely to form organizations together and put up collective resistance.” Worker centers can’t replace unions, but the two types of organizations can work together. “To see success,” Ikeler says, “to see large-scale organizing and an advance for the low-wage service sector, we’re going to have to see greater synergy than we’ve previously seen between worker centers and national unions that are actually willing to take risks and use some of their treasury by going on strike.” When asked if he saw any bright spots on the retail scene today, Ikeler pointed to a recent victory by Stop & Shop workers in New England. After threatening to strike in February, the UFCW negotiated a favorable contract for its 35,000 members in the region, including a quicker route to a $15 hourly wage and a promise from the company to add 480 new full time jobs over the next three years. The victory calls to mind an uplifting passage from Hard Sell, where Ikeler writes that “bad” service jobs are “not an unalterable fact of life but a social construct that can be challenged.” Never has independent journalism mattered more.

America’s Tween Soldiers View Comments "recent victory by Stop & Shop workers" Great to learn retail workers can win. Seems the great challenges to food retail unionization would be a) rapid turnover - students going to school, or workers looking for jobs that are more challenging, or that have higher status, or higher pay - and b) ease of replacing workers by drawing on a 'short-term' labor pool. On the other hand, retail food services cannot be moved out of the country, carried out via internet, nor - despite some self-service machines in some retail outlets - significantly automated. The food industry in particular needs a sizable worker base. Union outcomes may depend on particular factors: anti-union business practices are a given that may vary from state to state; but, on the other hand, politicized support groups (political parties, civic organizations, unions, newspapers) may strengthen negotiation and strike actions. The above also goes for unionism in the building trades, where outsourcing and automation are - outside of science fiction scenarios - not possible. Spontaneous strike-action-support-groups - students w/spare time, retirees, teachers between classes, spouses not working - could look at a single 'strike actions in your community' website to join up with particular actions. Posted by abramawicz on 2017-01-10 16:52:14 Unions mainstay for years has been people with tax funded jobs. - before that they were for the laborers in the factories. They turned their backs on retail workers and minimum wage earners - guess why - they don't make enough to pay dues. Now their need to replenish and build new Political Action Committees Funds(PAC's) is driving them into every niche of society/work force. Unions have provide a much needed voice for workers in America. They brought the steel mills and auto industries throughout the 1950-2000! Now its almost all been automated - dues paying members replaced by robotic machines. What will they do for minimum wage and retail sales workers ? Just askin ?

By JeffReeves Columnist In December, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time since the Great Recession and added the expectation of a 2017 interest-rate hike to its forecast. And just a few days ago, the much-awaited minutes from the latest Fed meeting showed the most hawkish tone from the central bank in two years. At the same time, Europe has been plunged into political turmoil after last year’s Brexit vote and the more recent resignation of Italy’s prime minister. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan continues down the path of negative rates and aggressive bond buying. Add it all up, and it isn’t surprising that the U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.10%  is up against 14-year highs. Investors may have missed all this talk thanks to chatter about the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  once again nearly hitting 20,000. But regardless of your allocation to stocks or your investment horizon, this kind of big-picture trend in the dollar means now is the time to position your portfolio to profit — and, perhaps most important, to avoid some of the pitfalls that can come from a strong domestic currency. So what dollar trades should you consider? Here are a few ideas: Domestic plays over multinationals There’s a lot of hope for consumer stocks in 2017 thanks to an improving labor market and hopes of a stimulus under a GOP-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump. However, keep in mind that not all retailers are created equal — particularly those with overseas operations that are negatively impacted by the wide disparity in currencies right now. For instance, retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.24%  said unfavorable currency exchange rates shaved almost 2.5% off earnings per share in the second quarter of 2016. Or consider that in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, athletic apparel giant Nike Inc. NKE, +0.99%  saw its revenue growth cut in half thanks to forex pressures, from 12% year-over-year in constant currency measures to just 6% including actual currency changes. To make the most of the “reflation” trade that many investors are banking on in 2017, you have to account for the headwinds that a strong dollar are creating for multinationals right now. The best way to do that is to consider consumer plays that do the vast majority of their business here in the U.S. — for instance, Foot Locker Inc. FL, +0.28% which has been a rare bright spot in retail over the last few years. Hedged-currency ETFs Of course, if you want a stable portfolio, you can’t simply buy only domestic-focused equities. Geographic diversification is just as important as diversification across sectors and asset classes. So many investors continue to hold global plays in the interest of a well-rounded portfolio, even if it means fighting an uphill battle because of a strong dollar. CES 2017: In search of the future (3:41) Self-driving cars, wall-sized TVs, driveable luggage? In a jam-packed day, WSJ's Joanna Stern takes you through the innovation and absurdity of the massive tech tradeshow. (Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal) The good news, however, is that you don’t have to resign yourself to suffering through a strong dollar and a weak euro when you invest in Europe. Nor do you have to worry about the yen-dollar exchange rate when you invest in Japan. That’s because there’s a whole family of currency-hedged ETFs to allow investors to put their money in foreign markets but avoid forex problems. Consider that Japan’s Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.76%  index is up about 25% from its July 2016 lows. The WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund DXJ, +0.54%  is up 35% in the same period thanks to protection from forex problems and a slightly better-performing list of stocks — while the non-hedged iShares MSCI Japan ETF EWJ, +0.63%  is up just 10% in the same period thanks to fighting an uphill battle against a strong dollar. If you want to diversify your portfolio globally, you should consider hedged funds that include the Japan-focused DXJ, the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund HEDJ, +0.38%   to play Europe or the iShares currency Hedged MSCI EAFE ETF HEFA, +0.41% for emerging markets. Dollar index ETF If you are looking for a direct play on a rising dollar instead of investing in stocks, learning how to trade foreign exchange can seem like a daunting task. Thankfully, there’s the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP, -0.11% What is the future of bitcoin?(2:59) Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss run a bitcoin exchange on which investors trade on average $1 million in bitcoin per day. But is this cryptocurrency safe or a fad? This ETF is tied to the U.S. Dollar Index, which is a measure of the greenback against a basket of other global currencies including the yen and the euro. It’s a straight currency play, but that doesn’t make it simple or risk-free. If the dollar weakens, you’ll lose money just as if you’re investing in a stock that has fallen on hard times. And, of course, PowerShares takes a small cut of your investments along the way that adds up to 0.8% annually, or $80 a year on every $10,000 invested. Still, if you want to speculate on the dollar or hedge against a strong U.S. currency holding back other global investments on your list, it’s perhaps the easiest way to do so for most investors.

In a jam-packed day, WSJ's Joanna Stern takes you through the innovation and absurdity of the massive tech tradeshow. (Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal) The good news, however, is that you don’t have to resign yourself to suffering through a strong dollar and a weak euro when you invest in Europe. Nor do you have to worry about the yen-dollar exchange rate when you invest in Japan. That’s because there’s a whole family of currency-hedged ETFs to allow investors to put their money in foreign markets but avoid forex problems. Consider that Japan’s Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.76%  index is up about 25% from its July 2016 lows. The WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund DXJ, +0.54%  is up 35% in the same period thanks to protection from forex problems and a slightly better-performing list of stocks — while the non-hedged iShares MSCI Japan ETF EWJ, +0.63%  is up just 10% in the same period thanks to fighting an uphill battle against a strong dollar. If you want to diversify your portfolio globally, you should consider hedged funds that include the Japan-focused DXJ, the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund HEDJ, +0.38%   to play Europe or the iShares currency Hedged MSCI EAFE ETF HEFA, +0.41% for emerging markets. Dollar index ETF If you are looking for a direct play on a rising dollar instead of investing in stocks, learning how to trade foreign exchange can seem like a daunting task. Thankfully, there’s the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP, -0.11% What is the future of bitcoin?(2:59) Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss run a bitcoin exchange on which investors trade on average $1 million in bitcoin per day. But is this cryptocurrency safe or a fad? This ETF is tied to the U.S. Dollar Index, which is a measure of the greenback against a basket of other global currencies including the yen and the euro. It’s a straight currency play, but that doesn’t make it simple or risk-free. If the dollar weakens, you’ll lose money just as if you’re investing in a stock that has fallen on hard times. And, of course, PowerShares takes a small cut of your investments along the way that adds up to 0.8% annually, or $80 a year on every $10,000 invested. Still, if you want to speculate on the dollar or hedge against a strong U.S. currency holding back other global investments on your list, it’s perhaps the easiest way to do so for most investors.

CHEERS: To a fresh start.  The new year brings a chance for everyone to start off with a clean slate and a set of new goals. In the past few days we've seen government leaders -- at the county and local level --  hold their reorganization meetings and choose their new leaders and lay out goals. School boards, took, have met and reorganized, welcoming in new members, selecting their own leaders and looking ahead to how best serve students in this ever-changing world. We wish them all the best. The pay is little or none and the decisions are momentous. We ask all to do what they believe is best for their constituents and check politics or personal agendas at the door. Those who elected you will be watching. CHEERS: To Monroe Township Police for saving a local family's Christmas. A woman reported on Christmas Eve morning that someone stole more than $200 in unopened Christmas gifts from her car and returned them to a store for cash. After an investigation, police charged her boyfriend, Michael R. Jefferson II, 33, of Williamstown, with the crime. Some of these gifts were for her child. Officers working on Christmas Eve wanted to lend a hand, so Monroe Township FOP Lodge 125 bought this mom a $200 gift card from Walmart and presented it to her that day. The woman reported that the card was put to good use, according to Detective Kevin Bielski. What an outstanding gesture following a heartbreaking crime. CHEERS: To welcoming a disabled veteran to the neighborhood. Timothy Birckhead currently lives in Philly, but a non-profit group that provides houses for vets with disabilities plans to build him a new, handicapped-accessible home in Gloucester County. Homes for Our Troops has built around 230 houses around the nation and will officially welcome him to his new community with an event this Saturday morning in Glassboro. Homes for Our Troops is an important organization making a real difference in the lives of the men and woman who serve our country. If you have time this weekend, stop out at Masso's on Delsea Drive around 9:30 a.m. and help welcome him to our community. JEERS: To a troubling coincidence. We've received word that a house was shot at in Millville just before the end of year. While such an action is a cause for concern, it's even more so now that we learn the home is where a city police officer formerly lived. The house is empty now and no one was hurt, but was this a coincidence or something more sinister? Police put their lives on the line every day when they put on their uniforms and head out on duty to protect us. They face enough danger on duty, especially with the lack of respect for authority many people show them. CHEERS: To befriending felines. Exactly one year ago, we accompanied an animal rescue organization's nighttime trip into Camden City to, of all things, feed stray cats. We believed in the mission so we went along for the ride and walked away with deep remorse for these unloved creatures born into an uncaring world. Earlier this week, the Camden County Animal Shelter announced it had received a $30,000 grant from the Petco Foundation that will help it treat cats -- particularly the ones living outside in Camden City. We've been to the shelter many times and can't think of a more deserving organization nor noble cause. If you own a pet, please spay and neuter them. The exponential increase of offspring is what forces shelters across the country to euthanize animals at an alarming rate. If you do your part, shelters like Camden County's will keep doing theirs. JEERS: To the opioid epidemic. Out of all New Jersey counties, Camden County saw the highest number of fatal heroin and fentanyl overdoses in 2015. At 191 people dead, county officials and medical professionals all recognized the need to offer resources for those deep in addiction. Earlier this week, the Camden County Police Department said it has saved the lives of 260 drug overdose victims with the anti-opioid medication Narcan. Conversely, the department revealed it encountered 40 fatal overdose victims in 2016. We've worked with the county's addiction awareness task force and know the good they do.

Donald Trump has been forced to distance himself from the family firm since winning the US election. He even said: “I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it.” It is perhaps an extreme example of the pressures that swirl around the businesses at the heart of many economies, but it does signal the unique pressures which come to bear when trying to sustain an organisation through the generations. Family businesses cross a variety of cultures, religions and backgrounds. The chocolate manufacturers Rowntree’s, Fry’s and Cadbury’s, the shoemakers Clarks and the bankers Barclays and Lloyds all became large businesses after being started by Quaker families. They went into business in part because they were excluded from other aspects of public life in the 18th and 19th centuries, and along the way earned a reputation for looking after their workforces. More recent examples include small, local family retailers set up by South Asian immigrants in the UK who want to support the next generation either in the business or in another profession. Crash Family businesses can last a long time. While trying to make gold from base metals, an Armenian alchemist discovered a different type of “gold” – a metal alloy that had outstanding sound quality and power when made into musical cymbals. A few years later, in 1623, the Zildjian Cymbal Company was founded, and can be traced through 16 generations and nearly four centuries to today’s firm in Massachusetts. Many key family businesses have survived the test of time after opening ownership beyond the family, although often the original families still control a significant stake in the company. The list includes modern-day giants like Wal-Mart Stores and Ford Motors in the US, L’Oreal in France, Benetton in Italy, Samsung in Korea, Sainsbury’s in the UK and Siemens in Germany. The Indian company Tata has, however, recently been suffering in the media glare due to an acrimonious falling out between family members in senior positions. The fact is that most businesses are family owned. In the UK some 71% of all small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which employ up to 250 people are family owned. Given those multinational success stories above, it might be surprising to learn that up to 95% do not survive in family ownership by the third generation. Some reasons for this may lie in the common criticisms of family businesses. They have been accused of sometimes having poor management and discipline, inadequate funding to support growth, differing incentives between family members and a lack of formalised practices and procedures. They can fall foul of time consuming family conflict, slow decision making, risk avoidance, limited innovation and a strategy which favours the status quo rather than change. Multiple motivations So how do you build a sustainable family businesses? First, it is important to consider how the rationalities underpinning the behaviours and strategies of family firms vary from those of others, especially small businesses. Let’s assume that a well-run SME is driven entirely by “market rationalities” which focus entirely on business needs and without the interference of motivations linked to the family ownership. It can be argued then that family businesses are more likely to be profit satisficers (balancing other objectives with achieving a minimum level of profit) rather than profit maximisers. Relationships between family members – both good and bad, or short and long term – can carry over into the business and influence how things are decided. These challenge assumptions of purely economic rational decision making in family firms, particularly when combined with cognitive and behavioural biases such as preferring those who are like us, or feeling that the value of a loss is much more than that of an equivalent gain. One way of looking at family firms suggests that we should accept that the family, business and social lives of those running a company must be seen as operating together: relationships overlap; family, friends and business logic or rationalities combine to influence behaviour and decision-making. Fundamentally, family aims and values can result in business decisions that differ from non-family firms. They may be reluctant to hire people from outside the family or they may adopt technology in a less flexible way as they are tied to existing ways of doing things and to existing staff and other assets. Supporting family businesses One implication is that support for small businesses, and companies with high growth potential, should not assume that family and other firms are identical. It may be that policies need to be carefully adapted for family firms. Support such as stimulating demand, changing public attitudes towards entrepreneurship, supporting research and development and the take-up of new technology, as well as providing training, advice and financial assistance all need to be adapted to take account of the differences between family and non-family firms. Emphasis also needs to be placed on developing partnerships and engagement with others, including family members and employees.   Success for family businesses should not be considered just in terms of survival. A few family businesses will develop into future market leaders even if their ownership changes, and these need to be nurtured. As family businesses make up such a crucial part of both everyday and high growth firms, research and policies need to consider those more rounded perspectives that incorporate the complex bonds and motivations that mark family firms out from the rest. Fortunately, not all will have to factor in a startling political rise that leaves the owner preparing to move into the White House amid a media furore about many potential conflicts of interest.

Donald Trump has been forced to distance himself from the family firm since winning the US election. He even said: “I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it.” It is perhaps an extreme example of the pressures that swirl around the businesses at the heart of many economies, but it does signal the unique pressures which come to bear when trying to sustain an organisation through the generations. Family businesses cross a variety of cultures, religions and backgrounds. The chocolate manufacturers Rowntree’s, Fry’s and Cadbury’s, the shoemakers Clarks and the bankers Barclays and Lloyds all became large businesses after being started by Quaker families. They went into business in part because they were excluded from other aspects of public life in the 18th and 19th centuries, and along the way earned a reputation for looking after their workforces. More recent examples include small, local family retailers set up by South Asian immigrants in the UK who want to support the next generation either in the business or in another profession. Crash Family businesses can last a long time. While trying to make gold from base metals, an Armenian alchemist discovered a different type of “gold” – a metal alloy that had outstanding sound quality and power when made into musical cymbals. A few years later, in 1623, the Zildjian Cymbal Company was founded, and can be traced through 16 generations and nearly four centuries to today’s firm in Massachusetts. Many key family businesses have survived the test of time after opening ownership beyond the family, although often the original families still control a significant stake in the company. The list includes modern-day giants like Wal-Mart Stores and Ford Motors in the US, L’Oreal in France, Benetton in Italy, Samsung in Korea, Sainsbury’s in the UK and Siemens in Germany. The Indian company Tata has, however, recently been suffering in the media glare due to an acrimonious falling out between family members in senior positions. The fact is that most businesses are family owned. In the UK some 71% of all small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which employ up to 250 people are family owned. Given those multinational success stories above, it might be surprising to learn that up to 95% do not survive in family ownership by the third generation. Some reasons for this may lie in the common criticisms of family businesses. They have been accused of sometimes having poor management and discipline, inadequate funding to support growth, differing incentives between family members and a lack of formalised practices and procedures. They can fall foul of time consuming family conflict, slow decision making, risk avoidance, limited innovation and a strategy which favours the status quo rather than change. Multiple motivations So how do you build a sustainable family businesses? First, it is important to consider how the rationalities underpinning the behaviours and strategies of family firms vary from those of others, especially small businesses. Let’s assume that a well-run SME is driven entirely by “market rationalities” which focus entirely on business needs and without the interference of motivations linked to the family ownership. It can be argued then that family businesses are more likely to be profit satisficers (balancing other objectives with achieving a minimum level of profit) rather than profit maximisers. Relationships between family members – both good and bad, or short and long term – can carry over into the business and influence how things are decided. These challenge assumptions of purely economic rational decision making in family firms, particularly when combined with cognitive and behavioural biases such as preferring those who are like us, or feeling that the value of a loss is much more than that of an equivalent gain. One way of looking at family firms suggests that we should accept that the family, business and social lives of those running a company must be seen as operating together: relationships overlap; family, friends and business logic or rationalities combine to influence behaviour and decision-making. Fundamentally, family aims and values can result in business decisions that differ from non-family firms. They may be reluctant to hire people from outside the family or they may adopt technology in a less flexible way as they are tied to existing ways of doing things and to existing staff and other assets. Supporting family businesses One implication is that support for small businesses, and companies with high growth potential, should not assume that family and other firms are identical. It may be that policies need to be carefully adapted for family firms. Support such as stimulating demand, changing public attitudes towards entrepreneurship, supporting research and development and the take-up of new technology, as well as providing training, advice and financial assistance all need to be adapted to take account of the differences between family and non-family firms. Emphasis also needs to be placed on developing partnerships and engagement with others, including family members and employees.   Success for family businesses should not be considered just in terms of survival. A few family businesses will develop into future market leaders even if their ownership changes, and these need to be nurtured. As family businesses make up such a crucial part of both everyday and high growth firms, research and policies need to consider those more rounded perspectives that incorporate the complex bonds and motivations that mark family firms out from the rest. Fortunately, not all will have to factor in a startling political rise that leaves the owner preparing to move into the White House amid a media furore about many potential conflicts of interest.

The two sites are within a block of each other near the intersection of West Elk Avenue and Bemberg Road. Hartman said Big Lots is the first business to commit to locating in the former Magic Mart building. Big Lots already operates a business in a 30,000-square-foot building on the other side of town and Hartman said he has not heard from the company on whether its future plans are to have two stores in Elizabethton, or to consolidate their operations at the West Elk Avenue location. The 100,348-square-foot Magic Mart building was originally built as a Wal-Mart. The Nashville corporation called Bemberg Center Partners paid $1,175,000 to acquire the building in 2016, with the intent of attracting retailers to the property.  Hartman said Big Lots received a permit from the city’s building codes office in December and work on renovating the Big Lots portion of the building may begin at anytime. While no work has yet begun on the Magic Mart property, demolition work is already well underway on the former Firestone Tire store, 100 Bemberg Road. The building was demolished on Tuesday by Mill Creek Construction and cleanup of the debris should take about a week, according to Chris Deaderick, general manager of Mill Creek. The company is very familiar with the location, having previously worked on the Citizens Bank Stadium, just across the street from the current construction. Deaderick said American Environmental Corporation will then work on the site of the former auto repair building. Once the environmental work is completed, Deaderick said Mill Creek will fill and grade the site. Hartman said he is not at liberty to name the future restaurant that will occupy the site. The property is in a high traffic area, with Elk Avenue listed as one of the busiest streets in the Tri-Cities. The property is also crossed on the northern boundary by the Tweetsie Trail.

Located within the Snohomish County cities of Arlington and Marysville, Smokey Point is a community that’s experienced a tremendous surge of growth in the past decade. What started as a census-designated place named after an outdoor barbecue restaurant from the 1950s has become a thriving residential community and commercial center that’s virtually exploded with new apartment buildings as well as shopping, dining and health care options. Much of the retail and residential development has centered around the I-5 interchange at Highway 531. The area boasts big-name national retailers, such as Walmart, Target and Costco, in addition to several newer retail and health care developments. One such development is Smokey Point Plaza, a 24,180 square foot, mixed-use retail center made up of restaurants and specialty stores, and anchored by Rite Aid. The Marketplace at Smokey Point is an exciting new shopping center with 910,000 square feet of retail space. Anchored by Dick’s Sporting Goods, other Marketplace tenants include Party City, Hobby Lobby, Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish, Hop Jack’s restaurant, Qdoba Mexican, Aveda Hair Salon and T-Mobile. The development also includes The Lodge, an apartment complex with 182 units. Developers Steve Malsam and Len Evans – who built Snohomish Station and Mill Creek Town Center – are the masterminds behind the Marketplace. Another newer residential development, Vintage at Lakeway, is a 187-unit luxury apartment community that caters to active seniors age 55 and older, and includes state-of-the-art, resort-style amenities such as a clubhouse, lounge, fitness center and private movie theater. The Arlington Planning Commission is also in the process of reviewing design plans for a new 48-unit multi-family apartment complex called 31st Avenue Apartments. Amenities will include a more than 6,200-square-foot park and an additional 3,305 square feet of open space. The nonprofit Housing Hope will also bring its latest project, called Twin Lakes Landing, to the area. According to the plans, the development will house up to 50 homeless families and feature amenities like a community building, a playground, a central courtyard and sports courts. Recent health care facilities include The Everett Clinic Smokey Point Medical Center, which houses a variety of medical specialists. For more information on new developments in Smokey Point, call the Arlington Planning Commission at (360) 403-3551, email planning@arlingtonwa.gov or visit www.arlingtonwa.gov/index.aspx-?page=262.   Most Read Everett man allegedly threatens 2 with machete EVERETT — An Everett man landed in jail after allegedly striking two… Jan 14th, 2017 by Eric Stevick Seattle Seahawks vs. Atlanta Falcons: Game Day preview Saturday’s game between the Seattle Seahawks (10-5-1) and the Atlanta Falcons (11-5)… Jan 14th, 2017 by Nick Patterson Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Editorial cartoons for Saturday, Jan. 14 Jan 14th, 2017 Flu death toll rises to 8 in Snohomish County EVERETT — This year’s influenza epidemic has now killed eight people in… Jan 14th, 2017 by Sharon Salyer Illegal parking lot highlights silt problems in area streams KENMORE — As Eric Adman paddled a canoe into the mouth of… Jan 15th, 2017 by Noah Haglund © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

For those who are still under the illusion that our economy is great and prosperity is nigh, you might want to consider the massive loss of jobs that will be forthcoming as stores across the country go into damage control mode to try to stop the hemorrhaging from lackluster holiday sales. Thousands of non-seasonal jobs are being cut as retail stores across the country close down or slash expenditures. If December is the most wonderful time of the year, then January is the most dismal. The beginning of the first quarter is the most common time to announce store closures and assess budgets. The start of the year is a popular time to announce store closures. Nearly half of annual store closings announced since 2010 have occurred in the first quarter, CNBC reports. (source) Last year, Wal-Mart stunned the country when they closed 269 stores in January. Macy’s The department store chain blames online sales for their woes. Macy’s said Wednesday it has either closed or will shutter 68 stores and cut an additional 6,200 positions at a time when shoppers are going online to buy everything from scarves to lipstick. Of the 68 stores out of 730 in total, nine closings had been previously announced and three locations have already shut down. But the retail giant revealed the locations of the remaining 59 stores, which will be shuttered by the middle of this year and affect 3,900 employees, some of whom may be offered jobs at other locations… …Additionally the retail giant says that it will be cutting “layers of management” at its central operations, and paring the number of managers supporting stores, making up the bulk of 6,200 jobs that will be lost. “We continue to experience declining traffic in our stores where the majority of our business is still transacted,” Terry Lundgren, Macy’s CEO said in a statement.  In regard to the store closings he added, “we are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape. . . .These are never easy decisions.” The news did not seem to sooth investors, with Macy’s shares plunging 8.7%, to $32.70, in after hours trading. (source) Here are the Macy’s stores that will be closing. Additionally, about 30 other stores are scheduled for closure at some point in the near future. The locations of these stores have not been disclosed. The company will close about 30 additional stores over the next few years as leases or operating covenants expire or sale transactions are completed, the company said. “We are closing locations that are unproductive or are no longer robust shopping destinations due to changes in the local retail shopping landscape, as well as monetizing locations with highly valued real estate,” Lundgren said, in a press release. “These are never easy decisions, and we are committed to treating associates affected by these closings with respect and transparency.” (source) Sears and K-mart Sears and K-Mart are both part of the same company, Sears Holdings. They’ll be shuttering 150 stores across the country, putting an undisclosed number of people out of work. They’re also selling Craftsman Tools to Black and Decker. Sears CEO Eddie Lampert said in a statement that the company was “taking strong, decisive actions…to stabilize the company and improve our financial flexibility in what remains a challenging retail environment.” The company noted that while the 150 stores collectively reported sales of $1.2 billion over the past 12 months, they also lost about $60 million. Sears has to stop the bleeding somehow, because the entire company is losing money. “The decision to close stores is a difficult but necessary step as we take actions to strengthen the company’s operations and fund its transformation,” Lampert said. “Many of these stores have struggled with their financial performance for years and we have kept them open to maintain local jobs and in the hopes that they would turn around,” he added. Here’s a list of Sears and K-Mart stores that will be closing. Kohl’s Kohl’s hasn’t announced any store closures, but they’ve dramatically cut their projections for the year ahead. First, it was Kohl’s, which announced it was slashing its full-year forecast, and now sees FY2017 adjusted EPS of $3.60-$3.65, down from $3.80-$4.00 less than two months ago, in the day after the election (ironically). It wasn’t just the future: the company revealed that comp sales were also down 2.1% y/y in fiscal months November and December combined. As Kohl’s CEO Kevin Mansell said, “sales were volatile throughout the holiday season. Strong sales on Black Friday and during the week before Christmas were offset by softness in early November and December.”  (source) CVS The popular pharmacy chain will be closing the doors in 70 locations and will be taking new measures for “efficiency” that are sure to please remaining employees. (Because what pharmacist doesn’t dream of doing data entry?) Speaking at its analyst day event Thursday, CVS Health executives outlined their long-term strategy for growth, which includes closing 70 stores in the coming months. The drugstore retailer’s overall cost-cutting plans aim for $3 billion in savings from 2017 to 2021. In addition to store closures, CVS Health CFO Dave Denton said the company is finding efficiencies in corporate shared services that promise to drive down labor costs by 15% to 20%. For retail, that might include instructing overnight pharmacists to provide data entry during the slow hours, he said. (source) Aeropostale, American Eagle, Chicos, Finish Line, Men’s Wearhouse, and The Children’s Place Many smaller stores are shutting down as well. Mall stores like Aeropostale, which filed for bankruptcy in May, American Eagle, Chicos, Finish Line, Men’s Wearhouse, and The Children’s Place are also in the midst of multi-year plans to close stores. Many more announcements like these are expected in the coming months… …In addition to closing stores, retailers are also looking to shrink their existing locations. “As leases come up, you’re going to see a gradual rotation into smaller-footprint stores,” Hottovy said.  (source) Obviously, this affects the malls, too. When major stores begin to close, it starts a chain of events. As stores continue to close, many shopping malls will be forced to shut down as well. When an anchor store like Sears or Macy’s closes, it often triggers a “downward spiral in performance” for shopping malls, Morningstar analysts wrote in the report from October. The malls don’t only lose the income and shopper traffic from that store’s business. The closure often triggers “co-tenancy clauses” that allow the remaining mall tenants to exercise their right to terminate their leases or renegotiate the terms, typically with a period of lower rents, until another retailer moves into the vacant anchor space. To reduce losses, malls must quickly find a replacement tenant for the massive retail space that the anchor store occupied, which is nearly impossible  — especially in malls that are already financially strapped — when every major department store is reducing its retail footprint. (source) Some businesses that leave when a mall begins to decline don’t reopen, leaving even more people without jobs. How can you protect yourself in this economy? When businesses begin closing en masse and thousands become unemployed, it has a domino effect. Nearly everyone will notice the pinch in some way or another. There are a few things you can do to provide some stability. Get out of debt. Here’s a way to pay it off as quickly as possible. If you find yourself without a job, here are the first steps you should take to survive the aftermath. Reduce your fixed expenses. Build an emergency fund. Get prepped. Keep abreast of the news that could directly affect you. Sign up here for free daily tips and updates. It’s extremely important to prepare ahead of time. Once it all comes crumbling down, supplies will be more expensive and more difficult to acquire. Have your umbrella well before the rainy day arrives.

One of the main thrift shops in town brought in a bit over a million a few yrs. back. Real thankful for other options other than retail.

The company said it will operate online only after the Jan. 8 closures. The Limited closed its store at Hamilton Place Mall in Chattanooga on Dec. 22. A spokesman said the New Albany, Ohio-based chain operated about 250 retail stores in 2016 and that about 4,000 jobs, including seasonal and temporary ones, would be lost. The announcement came on the heels of Macy's and Sears announcing store closures and job cuts earlier this week. Aldi hiring fair set for Saturday Known for offering wages and benefits that are higher than the national average for the retail industry, Aldi will host a hiring event for its Chattanooga stores from 8 am. to 2 p.m. next Saturday, Jan. 14, at Hilton Garden Inn, 2343 Shallowford Village Drive. Opportunities within Aldi include store associate, shift manager and manager trainee positions. Aldi said it pays $11.50 per hour for store associates and $16 per hour for store managers, Store managers have a chance to earn up to $85,000 a year. Applicants must be 18 years or older, have at a high school degree and be available to work anytime between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m., Monday-Sunday. Retail experience preferred. Indian Point plant to close in 4 years The aging Indian Point nuclear power plant just north of New York City will close within four years under a deal with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has long argued it should be shuttered to protect the millions of people living nearby. Under the arrangement plant owner Entergy Corp. will shut both reactors at the Westchester County facility by April 2021. A person familiar with the agreement, but not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed the agreement on the condition of anonymity to The Associated Press on Friday. It remains to be seen how the state would make up for the loss of electrical generation once the plant, which supplies a quarter of the power used in New York City and Westchester County, closes. The facility's reactor units began commercial operation in 1974 and 1976. More than 17 million people live within 50 miles of the facility, which sits alongside the lower Hudson River about 30 miles north of New York City, the nation's biggest city. Cuomo, a Democrat, has long argued that operating a nuclear plant so close to a major population center poses a potential safety hazard. Fiat Chrysler recalls 100,000 trucks, SUVs Fiat Chrysler is recalling more than 100,000 older trucks and SUVs worldwide to replace potentially dangerous Takata air bag inflators. The recall includes mainly passenger, but some driver, air bags in certain 2009 Chrysler Aspen and Dodge Durango SUVs, some 2010 Ram 3500 chassis cabs, and certain 2005-2009 Ram 2500 pickups. Takata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to cause a small explosion designed to inflate the air bags in a crash. But Takata inflators can explode with too much force when exposed to prolonged heat and humidity and hurl shrapnel into vehicles. As many as 16 people have been killed worldwide and about 180 have been injured. Fiat Chrysler said it knows of no injuries involving this group of recalled vehicles. Dealers will replace the inflators with parts made by another company. Fiat Chrysler said the parts are now available. Owners will get letters starting Jan. 12. iPhone sales drop cuts pay for Apple CEO Tim Cook Apple penalized CEO Tim Cook for the iPhone maker's first sales slump in 15 years with a 15 percent pay cut. Cook still made out well with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple's fiscal year that ended last September. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, Calif., company cited in regulatory documents filed Friday downturns in Apple's revenue and operating profit as the main reason for reducing the pay of Cook and other top executives. Apple's revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion, largely because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday season. Wal-Mart names Furner as Sam's Club next CEO Wal-Mart says it named John Furner as CEO of its Sam's Club stores to replace Rosalind Brewer, who is retiring next month. Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart said he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position Feb. 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam's Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago. Starbucks stops selling alcohol at 400 stores Starbucks will stop selling beer and wine at hundreds of U.S. stores next week as it ends its "evenings" program. The coffee chain said the "Starbucks Evenings" program in 439 company-owned stores in the U.S. will end Jan. 10. It said the programs may continue in some of the nine licensed stores where it is offered, or overseas. The program, first tested in 2010, was later expanded as a way to drive sales beyond the morning rush. Trade deficit climbs to $45.2 billion The U.S. trade deficit in November rose to the highest level in nine months as imports of oil and other foreign goods increased, while American exports fell for a second month. The trade deficit jumped 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion, the largest imbalance since February, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Exports edged down 0.2 percent to $122.4 billion, reflecting lower overseas sales of American-made airplanes, autos and farm products. Imports rose 1.1 percent to $231.1 billion, led by a 7.6 percent jump in oil. Factory orders drop but investment rises Orders to U.S. factories fell for the first time in five months in November, but much of the weakness reflected a swing in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. A key category that tracks business investment spending posted an increase. Factory orders dropped 2.4 percent after a 2.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the first decline since June, but the weakness was led by a 73.8 percent plunge in demand for commercial aircraft following a 94.5 percent surge in October.

Jan 6, 2017 Chetumal in Protests Over Fuel Hike; How Will it Affect Belize? The New Year has been greeted with protests in Mexico against a government price deregulation that sent the price of fuel there up by as much as twenty percent over the weekend. The Mexican government said the deregulation had long been planned, but unfortunately coincided with rising world oil prices. While prices are still relatively cheaper than in Belize, Mexican nationals are up in arms that the price hike affects their standard of living. There are also effects for Belize, as bus companies that have taken advantage of the cheaper fuel prices over the border may now think twice. But the greatest concern at the moment is whether Mexico is safe for travellers. By the thousands Belizeans cross the northern border looking for goods and services at better prices. In neighbouring, Chetumal popular stores such as Walmart, Chedraui and Aurera Bodega have been looted. Police are at this time preparing for further violence tonight as nationals stack up supplies to keep out of harm’s way. Aaron Humes and Jorge Tabora have been following the story and have this report.   Aaron Humes, Reporting On Thursday night coming into Friday, Chetumal, capital of the neighboring state of Quintana Roo, according to the website sipse.com, was wracked by looting of stores and gas stations by protesting citizens. Elsewhere there was blocking of roads as Mexicans protested the sudden arrival of a de-regulated fuel industry, promised by their president, Enrique Pena Nieto, two years ago. The deregulation is aimed at ending subsidies that the government says largely benefit wealthier Mexicans and at attracting interest in private participation in the newly opened fuel market. But protesters, who say their standard of living will be greatly changed, are planning a second night on the streets, according to Belizean living in Mexico, Jorge Tabora.   Francisco Sanchez Francisco Sanchez, Mexican National “The situation is critical not only for the workers but also for the store owners. This is vandalism. This is not what we expected. It’s no longer fighting against the government.  It’s a festive day and it’s sad that we cannot do what we usually do each year with the children. We need to be more careful when we go out since it’s my understanding that worse things will happen starting tomorrow Saturday.”   It is well-known that local bus drivers, especially in the North, have been buying their fuel in Mexico instead of Belize because of higher taxes here. That may continue, as according to the Embassy there are no restrictions on doing so and prices for premium fuel remain at least two dollars cheaper than Belize’s prices. But could there be potential impacts for the sole Mexican operator in Belize, ADO? This afternoon, their local agent told us that one of the buses returning to Belize was stopped at the Northern Border and at last report was expected to reach late, and he is awaiting details as to the schedule for the coming days. However, he said that he did not expect ticket prices to go up due to higher fuel costs. Tabora shares the view from other Mexican residents.   Francisco Sanchez “What has happened is that the price of gasoline has gone up. This is why all these problems are taking place. It’s not peaceful right now. There is too much vandalism. This is what has us very concerned right now.”   While Ambassador of Mexico to Belize Carlos Quesnel Melendez is back in his native country attending a diplomatic conference, information from the embassy here is that according to latest reports, the tension is cooled down and the protests have been contained, so that it is now safe to travel to Mexico. But the usual precautions apply, including keeping careful watch on one’s surroundings. Aaron Humes reporting for News Five.   With regard to the fuel price situation and a Mexico and Belize comparison, according to the Ministry of Finance, almost four of every ten dollars paid at the pumps goes to taxes for the Government, a rise of ten percent from the previous July. At the start of 2016, Prime Minister Dean Barrow announced a rise in import duties on fuel to combat a fifty-million-dollar revenue shortfall particularly and ironically coming from ever-reducing earnings from locally produced crude oil. It resulted in wild shifting of prices between January and July as the economy adjusted. And in an update to this story, at news time, ADO Belize City agent Fakhrul Amin informed that the second ADO bus was released by border authorities and arrived at five-thirty in the evening, and that tonight’s schedule from Belize City to the northern border, proceeding on to Merida and Cancun, is per normal with two buses. Again, there are no expected price increases for tickets. Be Sociable, Share! Tweet Viewers please note: This Internet newscast is a verbatim transcript of our evening television newscast.

(WKRN) – Two senior care facilities in Franklin became the target of a brazen thief. According to Franklin police, the suspect disguised herself as an employee on Jan. 2 and knocked on several residents’ door. If they answered, the woman talked her way into the room and then stole from them. She spent a total of 40 minutes in one of the facilities. During that time, she reportedly took cash, credit cards, and prescription drugs from four people. One victim’s credit card was used to buy a flat screen television at the Nolensville Road Walmart shortly after the suspect left. Another victim even woke up to find the suspect standing next to her bed. Anyone with information about the crime is urged to contact Crime Stoppers at 615-794-4000.

Jade McDowell East Oregonian Published on January 6, 2017 7:48PM Last changed on January 6, 2017 9:39PM A final replat for a planned Ranch & Home store is on the agenda for Hermiston’s city council on Monday night. George Dress, owner of Tri-Cities retailer Ranch & Home, plans to build a Hermiston location on an 18 acre piece of property on South Highway 395 near the Wal-Mart Distribution Center. The property is currently made up of three separate lots; the replat would reconfigure the lines between those lots. The agenda also includes an item to “consider authorizing the city manager to sign the development agreement with George Dress for development of a Ranch & Home store.” On Monday the council will consider a recommendation from city manager Byron Smith to petition the county to rename East Airport Road. The Eastern Oregon Trade and Event Center is located on the road, and Smith said in a memo to the council that since the event center opened many delivery drivers and visitors have ended up lost on the neighboring Airport Way. Renaming East Airport Road to something less similar could alleviate some of the confusion, Smith said. He did not make a recommendation for what the new name might be. Mayor David Drotzmann, municipal judge Thomas Creasing and at-large city councilors Manuel Gutierrez, Doug Primmer, John Kirwan and Rod Hardin will be sworn in on Monday night and the council will be asked to elect a new council president for the year. Before the regular 7 p.m. meeting, the council will hold a work session at 6 p.m. with city staff on the subject of downtown parking. The meeting will be at city hall, 180 NE 2nd Street. The full agenda can be found online at hermiston.or.us/citycouncil-meetings. ——— Contact Jade McDowell at jmcdowell@eastoregonian.com or 541-564-4536.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah Homes expected to replace Granite High after 7-year saga, but officials have mixed feelings By Ben LockhartDeseret News@benlockhart89 Published: Jan. 5, 2017 10:20 p.m. Updated: Jan. 6, 2017 10:08 p.m. 11 Comments SOUTH SALT LAKE — For 102 years, Granite High School was the picture of constancy for South Salt Lake students. But since the school closed its doors in 2009, citing declining enrollment and prohibitive costs associated with safety upgrades, the future of the vacant property has been anything but certain. City officials initially talked of plans to build a large arts and recreation center there, but the proposed $25 million bond for that project failed by just five votes in 2011. In 2012, Woodbury Corp. and Redman Movies and Stories announced their intentions to coordinate on an ambitious TV and film studio on the property that promised to bring along with it about 1,000 jobs and a $40 million investment. That idea fizzled when the businesses announced they no longer had enough money for the project. Then in early 2016, South Salt Lake Mayor Cheri Wood vetoed the City Council's approval of a Garbett Homes plan to put a Wal-Mart or potentially another grocery store on the property. After seven years without a resolution, the new fate of much of the unused property appears as assured as ever after the South Salt Lake Planning Commission unanimously approved Thursday a proposal from Garbett Homes to build single-family homes there. "We really don’t have any grounds to delay this any further," planning commissioner Rachael Lauritzen said, conceding she gave her vote of approval "reluctantly" because it would mean not preserving the area. About 16 of the 27 acres that housed Granite High will contain new homes. Pending mostly routine approvals and finalizations by city staff, about 76 homes are expected be built there. "We think this will be an awesome subdivision for the city of South Salt Lake. It will attract families," Jacob Ballstaedt, Garbett Homes spokesman, told the planning commission. "This will be a community where they’ll want to stay and raise their family." Garbett Homes plans to purchase and develop the remaining 11 acres, but left that northern part of the property out of the specific proposal discussed Thursday. Ballstaedt said the business wants to move quickly with its plans on the approved portion. Residents angry Thursday's vote followed a contentious public hearing in which several residents expressed their opposition to the Garbett Homes development. Three of the old high school's four main buildings will be demolished as a direct result of the pending purchase, a sore spot for many residents who spoke. Some residents criticized Garbett Homes for only submitting details for one portion of the property, saying the company was purposefully leaving the planning commission with limited information to work with. "Without the totality of that plan  I would urge you to vote against it until there’s a total plan for the whole lot, because we don’t want to end up with another vacant lot for years," resident Kevin Miller told the commission. Ballstaedt said the company is still working on a proposal for those acres and is open to various retail or mixed retail and residential options. He insisted that getting the property development approved in two parts is not an end-around because the city would have to approve a zoning change for the northern parcel in order for commercial developments to be put in place. "Really what it comes down to is trying to determine what the city wants" in that area, Ballstaedt told the Deseret News. School district satisfied Granite School District thought highly of South Salt Lake's plans to purchase the property for its own purposes in 2011, said district spokesman Ben Horsley. But since those plans never materialized, he said, they're pleased to make a sale to Garbett Homes. "While that would have been in our opinion the best option, moving forward it is no longer feasible and this is the next best option," Horsley said. The sale of the southern portion of the property is expected to be finalized by Jan. 23. The minimally maintained property has become a magnet for crime, drawing more than 200 calls to Granite School District police alone over the past year because of trespassing and other issues, Horsley said. "We continue to have squatters, copper theft, drug deals and even young people entering the property to explore and do all manner of vandalism," he said. "It is an attractive nuisance." Last ditch efforts A permanent resolution appears to be right around the corner for the old Granite High, but one organization hopes to make a last-minute bid for the property and keep the buildings standing. Merili Carter, a former fourth-generation Granite High student and project manager for the Utah Arts Alliance, said her organization has been in contact with Garbett Homes and made a preliminary $11.5 million offer for the property in December. Carter hopes the developer will turn around and sell their newly purchased property to the Utah Arts Alliance, which she said wants to preserve the existing buildings and transform them into a community arts and theater campus and one or two small shops. The organization would buy the property using grants and donations, she said. 11 comments on this story Carter said it would be "a shame ... to lose the buildings and lose the open space." Ballstaedt confirmed the Utah Arts Alliance has been in touch with Garbett Homes, but described any sale to the organization as a longshot. He said that's especially true as Garbett Homes ramps up more and more of its own financial resources behind plans to build single family homes on the property. While some residents may want to see the seven-year saga end with their old high school standing, Ballsteadt said it is doubtful that the Utah Arts Alliance's last ditch effort to buy the property will be successful. "The biggest challenge is ... they haven't demonstrated the ability to perform and actually buy the property," Ballstaedt told the Deseret News. 11 Comments Like that? Read this.

Calling from a high-rise building in a suburb of Mumbai, they told her, in tones that were alternately earnest and melodramatic, that they wanted to share the details of a sprawling criminal operation targeting Americans. Ms Broder, who was no stranger to whistle-blowers, pressed the young men for details. “He said his name was Adam,” she said, referring to one of the pair. “I said: ‘Your name is not Adam. What does your grandmother call you?’ He said, ‘Babu.’” This is a foreign media report about how Indian call centre talent was used to swindle Americans and the subsequent actions by the authorities.  Babu was Jayesh Dubey, a skinny 19-year-old with hair gelled into vertical bristles, a little like a chimney brush. He told her that he was working in a seven-story building and that everyone there was engaged in the same activity: impersonating Internal Revenue Service officials and threatening Americans, demanding immediate payment to cover back taxes. If they reached a person who was sufficiently terrified or gullible — this was known in the business as a “sale” — they would instruct that person to buy thousands of dollars’ worth of iTunes cards to avoid prosecution, they said; the most rattled among them complied. The victim would then send the codes from the iTunes cards to the swindlers, giving them access to the money on the card. As it happened, the United States government had been tracking this India-based scheme since 2013, a period during which Americans, many of them recent immigrants, have lost $100 million to it. Though India had no reputation as a large-scale exporter of fraud in the past, it is now seen as a major centre for fraud, said Suhel Daud, an FBI agent who serves as assistant legal attaché at the embassy in New Delhi. Several trends have converged to make this happen, he said: a demographic bulge of computer-savvy, young, English-speaking job seekers; a vast call-centre culture; super-efficient technology; and what can only be described as ingenuity. “They have figured all of this out,” Daud said. “Put all of these together, with the Indian demographics in the US, and it’s a natural segue. Whatever money you’re making, you can easily make 10 times as much.” Pawan Poojary and Jayesh Dubey, best friends and college drop outs, were impressed with the Phoenix 007 call centre in Thane, a suburb north east of Mumbai. The interviewer carried an iPhone; there were racing sport bikes parked outside, and, as Poojary put it, “girls roaming here and there.” The monthly salary was average for call centres, 16,000 rupees (about $230), they said, but the bonuses were double or triple that, based on sales. The two friends had been playing a video game for up to eight hours a day, pausing occasionally to eat. They wanted in. “At that time, in my mind is that I want money,” Poojary, 18, said. “That’s it. I want money. That’s why.” They said they showed up for training in a room of young Indians like themselves, the first in their family to be educated in English. They were a slice of aspirational India: Poojary’s father, who owned two welding shops, was adamant that his son would rise to a higher place in society, an office job. Poojary was afraid to tell him he had dropped out of college. The trainer assigned them names, Paul Edward and Adam Williams, and handed out a six-page script that started out, “My name is Shawn Anderson, with the department of legal affairs with the United States Treasury Department,” the teenagers said. “We read the script, and I asked, ‘Is this a scam?’” Poojary said. “He said, ‘Yes.’” “At that time I am money-minded. I thought, ‘OK, I can do this,’” he said. Poojary was excited and nervous about speaking to an American for the first time, and he was alarmed by the resulting bursts of profanity. Dubey said he tried to commit the entire experience to memory, in case he and Poojary someday decided to start a business of their own. “I just wanted to become a great scammer,” Dubey said. “Everyone was scamming around me. I thought, ‘I will also become a great scammer.’” The key to the whole thing, Dubey decided, was a psychological fact: Americans fear their state.  “I think they actually are really afraid of their government,” he said. “In India, people are not afraid of police. If anyone wants to come and arrest, they say, ‘Come and arrest.’ It is easy to get out of anything. But in America they are afraid. We just need to tell them, ‘You are messing with the federal government,’ and that is all.” Inaben Desai, of Sugar Land, Tex., came home from grocery shopping, and her mother handed her the phone, eyes wide with alarm. Someone was on the line from the government, her mother said. They had called three or four times while she was out. Ms. Desai, 56, worked as a cashier at Walmart. When she picked up the phone, a gruff-voiced man told her that she had failed to pay fees when she got her United States citizenship, in 1995, and that unless she did so she would be deported back to India, she said. When Ms. Desai said she needed to call her husband, a woman got on the phone, speaking sympathetically, in her native Gujarati. “She said, ‘If you involve your husband, there’s going to be more problems,’” Ms. Desai said. “‘Your husband is going to get in trouble, too. Don’t involve your husband.’” Ms. Desai had begun to cry. Still on the line with the woman, she took all the cash she had on hand and drove to a nearby grocery store, where she bought $1,386 in prepaid debit cards. Then the woman instructed her to go to her bank, transfer close to $9,000 to the account of someone named Jennifer, in California, and then fax confirmation and confidential details about her account. “The bank lady tried to stop me, and she said, ‘This is your personal information,’” Ms. Desai said. “But I’m scared, and I faxed it to them because I’m scared of what would happen to my family.” The swindlers, who now had access to her bank balance, called back to demand another sum close to $9,000. Ms. Desai had to drive to another bank branch to make the transaction. The total amount she transferred, $17,786, was nearly all her savings. Mr. Poojary was not the person who called Ms. Desai, whose case dates to 2014. But a similar conversation prompted him to contact the United States government. He recalled the woman’s name as Regella, and said that when she begged him to give her a little time, Mr. Poojary felt so sorry for her that he went to his supervisor, who told him to push harder. “I just feel guilty at that time,” he said. “We are also Indians. We also don’t have money. They also don’t have money.” A few days later, he called the main switchboard at the I.R.S. and said he wanted to pass on information about a crime. “They are not listening, they are just laughing at me,” he said. Finally, he was transferred to Ms. Broder, the Federal Trade Commission’s counsel for international consumer protection. “He was fairly insistent,” she recalled. “He was determined. The number of times he called me was overwhelming. I would guess that is why he was reaching out to me, because he wanted some form of law enforcement to take it down.” The Phoenix 007 call centre initially occupied a floor of this high-rise on Mira Road in Thane, but it eventually filled the entire building. The risk of expanding a fraud aggressively is that the range of potential informants also expands. Supervisors may humiliate employees in front of their peers; paychecks may arrive late or not at all; ringleaders may spend so freely that they attract tax officials’ gaze. The so-called Mira Road scam, named for the building’s neighborhood, had moved into a single floor of the seven-story high-rise in early 2016. By summer it filled the whole building. “It got big,” said Mr. Daud, the F.B.I. agent. “And when it gets big, you leave bread crumbs.” Nitin Thakare, a senior police inspector at the crime branch in Thane, will not say much about the person who contacted him in September with a tip. But he will describe the raid, in loving, cinematic detail: How at 10 p.m., after the last of the call centre staff had arrived for the night shift, 200 police officers streamed up the main staircase, blocking every exit and detaining all 700 people who worked inside. As morning approached, the street outside filled with the workers’ parents, wives and girlfriends, said Amar Verma, who sells tea on the corner. “There was lots of sobbing,” he said. “There was one mother who came with her car. She was crying alone, the poor thing. She was sitting on the pavement in front of me, crying. Her child had not come home.” Inside, the police cut the phone lines. Under interrogation, the suspects, one after another, insisted that they had been planning to quit just as soon as they collected their next paycheck, Mr. Thakare said. But the money made it hard to walk away, and after a few pay cycles, their qualms had faded. He felt for them. “These are the youth of our nation,” he said. “They were misguided. For the first few days it seems glamorous. Someone is teaching them an accent, people are smoking, there are women. There’s freedom and night life. The youth love that.” The police said that others, like the landlord who had rented the building to the swindlers, wondered why the authorities cared in the first place. “He said, ‘What happened?’” said Parag Manere, a deputy commissioner of police. “‘We are not cheating people in India! We are cheating people in the U.S.! And the U.S. cheats the whole world!’” The officers interviewed and released 630 of the call-centre workers, arresting the 70 highest-ranking employees. What they had stumbled on, it became clear, was a branch of a much larger network, the police said. Five days later, the police organized a second raid, of facilities in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, which they believed to be a nerve centre. The Justice Department had come to the same conclusion: It has since released an indictment tracing 1.8 million calls targeting American residents to five call centres in Ahmedabad that used various schemes to defraud more than 15,000 people out of hundreds of millions of dollars. By the time the police arrived at the Ahmedabad location, though, the syndicate was gone. “The place where we raided, it was a thousand-seat call centre,” Mr. Manere said. “When we got there it was empty. Empty. Nothing. Not a piece of paper. Empty halls.” Mr. Poojary said he happened to be at a job interview when he learned that the call centre in Mira Road had been raided. It was an honest, mundane customer service job, advising the customers of Delta Air Lines on such matters as lost baggage and frequent-flier miles, for a mediocre monthly salary of $150. He was sitting on a waiting room sofa when he picked up The Times of India and read that 700 of his co-workers had been detained the night before. The first person he contacted was Ms. Broder, to tell her that the raid had hit the same operation he had described to her. That night, he and Mr. Dubey, who had left the Mira Road centre after contacting Ms. Broder, celebrated over drinks. “We brought it down,” Mr. Dubey said. “It started out as fun, then it got boring, then we truly understood the good and dirty parts of the job. Then we decided to bring it down.” Whistle-blowers’ motives are often murky, and in their early conversations, Ms. Broder wondered fleetingly whether the two friends were calling on behalf of the scheme’s organizers to determine what American investigators knew. In an interview with The New York Times, the two men acknowledged being fired from the call centre after getting into an altercation with co-workers. Their claim to have brought down the centre is unfounded, according to Indian and American investigators, who said that the raid in Thane was carried out entirely by the local police, without assistance from American officials. The Thane police said their informant was not employed by the swindlers. The raid was international news, and in the weeks that followed, the number of fraudulent I.R.S. calls to Americans dropped 95 percent, according to the Better Business Bureau. But those who believe that the drop is permanent should consider this: In the weeks after Mr. Poojary and Mr. Dubey left the centre, several lucrative job opportunities were presented to them. Each involved a phone scheme targeting Americans, they said. There was the Viagra scam, in which callers offered to sell cut-rate Viagra; there was a low-interest loan scam, in which people were asked to deposit $1,000 as proof of income. There was a tech scam, which warned Americans that their computer had been infected by a virus, and an American Express scam, which involved gathering personal information to break through security barriers on online accounts. “Even if you shut down 400 buildings in India, it will not stop,” said Mr. Dubey, now known by his Delta clients as Jacob Davis. The two friends say they have given up on the notion of getting rich quickly, or of being paid by the United States government for the information they provided. It has been replaced by a new hope — that, perhaps as a result of the public service they have provided, they will be granted visas to the United States, the home of so many of their favorite things: “The Fast and the Furious,” Vin Diesel and Robert Downey Jr. “I’ve spent so much time getting to know it, familiarizing myself with its states, talking to its people,” Dubey said. “I feel a bond.”     0 0 Indian call-centre talent used to swindle American was posted in Islamabad of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 07, 2017 and was last updated on January 07, 2017.

News Weather Historic Triangle preps for winter's first significant snowfall JCC Snow prep Salt and sand are on the roads and sidewalks and people are ready with soup, sleds and shovels. Salt and sand are on the roads and sidewalks and people are ready with soup, sleds and shovels. Wesley WrightContact Reporterwwright@vagazette.com The first significant snow of this winter season is barreling down on the Historic Triangle, making it a good weekend to stay home.  The National Weather Service predicts 6-8 inches of snow will fall on the Historic Triangle beginning late Friday and lasting through most of Saturday. The snow is expected to hamper travel throughout coastal Virginia all weekend. And temperatures will remain in the 20s and 30s through Sunday, leaving little chance for the snow to melt before the workweek returns Monday. Wind gusts are expected to intensify up to 35 mph on the backside of the storm, said Scott Schumann, of the National Weather Service's Wakefield office. "It's a storm that's going to intensify as it comes up the coast ... ," he said. "That wind will start to howl on the backside of this storm." Heavier snowfall totals are expected to fall farther south into Hampton Roads and the North Carolina border as a front pushes northward, according to the National Weather Service. A winter storm threatened the Virginia Peninsula with another round of snow January 2017. View photos from this storm and others in this gallery of snow and winter weather photos from 2017 and years past. (Daily Press) A blizzard warning is in effect for Hampton, Poquoson, Norfolk and Virginia Beach until 10 p.m. Saturday because the combination of snow and wind could create near-whiteout conditions, according to the weather service. The Richmond metro area is expected to see closer to 4-6 inches, according to the weather service. "This isn't an unusual system," Schumann said. "It's not a classic superstorm, but it will dump a good amount of snow on the area." Treacherous travel State and local public works crews will maintain roads throughout the weekend. Photos of snow from the recent winter storm. (Virginia Gazette) Williamsburg Public Works employees plan to work 12-hour shifts this weekend to plow every city street, city spokeswoman Lee Ann Hartmann said. "We plow every inch of those nine square miles within the city," she said. During the storm's height, city crews may need to focus on clearing primary and secondary streets and hold off on lesser-traveled residential streets, she said. VDOT is responsible for plowing public roads within James City and York counties. The state started pre-treating roadways in the Hampton Roads region — which includes the Peninsula and Southside cities — to help prevent icing, according to a news release. VDOT has close to 550 pieces of equipment in our region that are ready to respond to the storm. "If people aren't sure about who to contact if their roads aren't plowed, I can certainly be an advocate for them," James City County administrator Bryan Hill said. "If they call me (253-6602) or email me (bryan.hill@jamescitycountyva.gov), I'll know who to call or how to contact them to make sure any issues are addressed." Hill said he will try to deploy personnel on Sunday to clear parking lots and sidewalks around county facilities and schools so those buildings can open Monday. "If I can get out there Sunday, then we're clearing empty parking lots, instead of having to go around cars," said Hill, who urged residents to stay home and off the roads both during the storm and afterward while crews are working. Residents unsure about whether state or city plows will come down their road can simply look to their tax bill for guidance: people who pay taxes to the city receive city services, regardless of whether they have a Williamsburg mailing address. A private contractor may be in charge of clearing private roads and entrances for people who live in private communities and apartment complexes. "We're stocked up and ready to go," Hartmann said. For residents who consider the cold and snow a dangerous situation, help might be a bus ride away. Free warming shelters are set up throughout James City County and Williamsburg. Snow can complicate use of the warming shelters, which is something Kathleen Hale, James City County coordinator of emergency management will remain wary of as winter wears on. "One thing that could affect that is how heavy the snow is coming down, and how quickly (workers) can get out to it," Hale said. "Usually they're up early and it's not an issue. Otherwise, the county will make (a point) to get information out." An important take-away from officials: Call ahead to your destination before you leave home. Stores, offices and attractions may have made last-minute decisions to close. Colonial Williamsburg is already in its seasonal shutdown, although carriage rides may not be available if streets become hazardous, spokesman Joe Straw said. Anyone who wants to skate at Liberty's Ice Pavilion should call 855-296-6627 ahead of time to check if it's still open. A week preparing Lin Bell, a dairy clerk at the Richmond Road Food Lion, was bracing for a storm both inside (in the form of customers) and outside the store. "It started a little earlier this week," he said of shoppers grabbing supplies. "In the mornings, you'll see retirees and some older folks. Once the workday ends, people made a beeline for this store, trying to find adult beverages and all that." Bell said in the grocery industry, the concept is called a "snow scare." Food Lion staff expect to see milk, bread and water fly off their shelves. "Sometimes it'll even effect the toilet paper and pet food," he said. "That just depends on the severity of the storm." You see just a little bit of panic so people end up in here," Bell said. "We would have had a busier spike anyway, because it's Friday and the end of the work week. The storm coming just adds to it." Victor Martinez, a customer associate at the Walmart on East Rochambeau Drive, said the saw substantially more people on Friday afternoon than usual. "They've been buying propane, snow plows, ice melt, you name it," he said. "We're almost out of ice scrapers too." Though he noticed an uptick in patrons, Martinez himself does not necessarily plan on buying too much heading into the weekend. The main change he makes when snow hits the area is a logistical one. "My girlfriend, her car sits a little higher off the ground than mine does," he said. "Once winter comes, we don't use mine nearly as much." Charles Johnson was unfazed by the impending snow while shopping in Walmart on Friday. "I'm not really preparing too much," he said. "I really don't think it'll be that bad." He makes sure his vehicle is ready to move in case of an emergency, but he doesn't feel like this weekend could turn into one. "We've had some bad snows out here," he said. "I didn't think this one will be that big of a deal." Kevin Deaver owns Ace Peninsula Hardware on Richmond Road where shoppers have been buying snow shovels, ice melt and sleds since Tuesday. "In '98 or '99 we had some bad snowstorms," said Deaver, who recalled that 2003 had been a snowy year as well. "We had maybe three snowstorms in the span of a month. This part of Virginia isn't used to getting that much snow." Ice storms are what really concern Deaver because of the havoc they can wreak on the area. "What happens is the rain or snow falls into trees and it freezes, then the trees fall and break," he said. "They bring down power lines, and now you don't have any power." Lighter snowfall is easier to handle, Deaver said. "It's a little more fun for people." Wright can be reached by phone at 757-345-2343.

MMCT Venture, the Mashantucket Pequot-Mohegan partnership intent on developing a casino near Hartford, announced Friday afternoon that it had narrowed a field of five municipalities that filed site proposals, eliminating East Hartford, Hartford and South Windsor. Windsor Locks’ entry includes locations at Bradley International Airport, while East Windsor has offered parcels off Interstate 91 that currently are occupied by a former Showcase Cinemas building, a former Wal-Mart and an existing Big Y supermarket. In a statement, Kevin Brown, chairman of the Mohegan Tribal Council, thanked the three eliminated towns for their interest. “They could not have been better partners,” he said. “But despite a willingness to work together and a real belief in the value of this large investment, we couldn’t find a location that met our criteria.” He said the three towns still would benefit from the proposed casino, which would provide “a boost for the entire region.” Rodney Butler, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council chairman, said East Windsor and Windsor Locks “align best with our development models and preserve more jobs and revenue for the state.” The tribes, respective owners of Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun, hope a third Connecticut casino will lessen the impact of MGM Springfield, the $950 million resort casino being built in Massachusetts and scheduled to open in September 2018. Recently, the tribes noted, the state’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis found that the MGM project would cost the state nearly $70 million in its first year of operation. A study commissioned by the tribes found that more than 9,000 jobs could be lost if the state does nothing to counter MGM Springfield’s effect. Once the tribes settle on a casino site, they are expected to pursue legislation authorizing them to operate a commercial casino on nonreservation land. The tribes’ existing casinos are located on their reservations, where they are subject to federal regulation. MGM Resorts International, the Las Vegas-based company developing the Springfield casino, has opposed the tribes’ third-casino efforts at every turn. Friday’s announcement prompted another response. “As we have been saying all along, this isn’t a process, it’s a sham,” Alan Feldman, an MGM Resorts executive vice president, said in a statement. “... The tribes tell towns they’re in, then they’re out. ... This is not the right way for a state to enter into its first commercial casino. The right way is what we’ve been suggesting all along: The state should scrap the current law and adopt a new one that guarantees a fair, open, transparent, and most important, a competitive process — one that allows all qualified bidders to compete. ...” The rejected proposals include one a development group aggressively had pitched for a site off Interstate 84 in East Hartford. The group’s managing member, Tony Ravosa, declined to comment on the tribes’ announcement, saying he would have something to say next week at a news conference. South Windsor’s bid involved a development zone along I-291 between I-84 and I-91. No specific location was ever publicly linked to Hartford’s proposal, though the tribes have indicated they reviewed several potential sites there. MMCT Venture accepted an initial round of site proposals in 2015 and then reopened the process in the fall. East Windsor, eliminated after the first round, refiled with a new site in the second round. Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks has remained in the running despite the Connecticut Airport Authority’s withdrawal of sites it initially proposed on airport property. An authority spokeswoman confirmed Friday that the authority still is interested in hosting a casino at Bradley. b.hallenbeck@theday.com Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

The video, which was posted on Facebook Thursday, shows Nikki Smith sliding dramatically when she notices there is no bread. She said the video is simply meant to bring humor to the situation. “I just wanted to do something funny about how everyone reacts to the snow in South Carolina,” Smith told WHNS. “I went out to see if there was any bread and it was all gone. Not even any hot dog buns.” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

WASHINGTON (AP) " U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, capping a year of slower but solid hiring. Friday's report from the Labor Department portrayed a job market that remains durable 7 years after the recovery from the Great Recession began. Though the unemployment rate rose to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent, it did so for an encouraging reason: More people began looking for work. Because not all of them found jobs immediately, more people were counted as unemployed in December. Hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the sharpest increase in more than seven years. ___ Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 NEW YORK (AP) " So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. ___ US trade deficit climbs to $45.2 billion in November Continued below. Related Content Your views: Readers' letters National election promise to create recreational fishing-only zones running behind schedule Cartoon: Another Kiwi classic - Household debt WASHINGTON (AP) " The U.S. trade deficit in November rose to the highest level in nine months as imports of oil and other foreign goods increased, while American exports fell for a second month. The trade deficit jumped 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion, the largest imbalance since February, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Exports edged down 0.2 percent to $122.4 billion, reflecting lower overseas sales of American-made airplanes, autos and farm products. Imports rose 1.1 percent to $231.1 billion, led by a 7.6 percent jump in oil. ___ US factory orders drop 2.4 percent but investment up WASHINGTON (AP) " Orders to U.S. factories fell for the first time in five months in November, but much of the weakness reflected a swing in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. A key category that tracks business investment spending posted an increase. Factory orders dropped 2.4 percent after a 2.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the first decline since June but the weakness was led by a 73.8 percent plunge in demand for commercial aircraft following a 94.5 percent surge in October. ___ US approves fix for some Volkswagen diesels DETROIT (AP) " Volkswagen will soon be able to repair some of its diesel cars so they meet U.S. emissions standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board said Friday that they have approved a fix for around 67,000 of the 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-liter diesel engines that were programmed to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. The German automaker acknowledged the cheating in 2015. The remedy will fix 2015 models of the Volkswagen Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Golf, Golf SportWagen, Jetta and Passat as well as the Audi A3. ___ Jamie Oliver to shut 6 UK restaurants in tough Brexit market LONDON (AP) " Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is shutting six of his 42 Jamie's Italian restaurants in Britain amid tough trading conditions and a lower pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group said Friday that five restaurants in England and one in Scotland would close in the first quarter of 2017. The company has been stung by the slide in the pound, which has increased the cost of buying ingredients from Italy. Despite the pressure on prices triggered by the pound's fall, Britain's economy has outperformed many economists' expectations since the June vote. ___ Wal-Mart names John Furner as Sam's Club next CEO NEW YORK (AP) " Wal-Mart says it named John Furner as CEO of its Sam's Club stores to replace Rosalind Brewer, who is retiring next month. Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart says he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position February 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam's Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago. ___ SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) " Tilikum the orca has died after more than two decades at SeaWorld Orlando, where he gained notoriety for killing a trainer in 2010 and was later profiled in a documentary that helped sway popular opinion against keeping killer whales in captivity. Sea World officials said Friday that Tilikum died but didn't give a cause of death. They said Tilikum had faced serious health issues including a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection. He was estimated to be 36 years old. The 2010 death of the SeaWorld trainer shocked the public, led to a downturn in SeaWorld's attendance and reshaped its future. ___ The Limited to close all brick-and-mortar shops WASHINGTON (AP) " More grim news for malls came Friday as apparel retailer The Limited said it will close all its brick-and-mortar stores at the end of this weekend. The company says it will continue to operate online only after the Jan. 8 closures. A spokesman said the New Albany, Ohio-based chain operated about 250 retail stores in 2016 and that about 4,000 jobs, including seasonal and temporary ones, would be lost. The announcement comes on the heels of Macy's and Sears announcing store closures and job cuts. ___ APNewsBreak: L.L. Bean heiress in trouble over pro-Trump PAC AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) " The Federal Election Commission told L.L. Bean heiress Linda Bean that she made excessive contributions to a political action committee she created to support Republican President-elect Donald Trump. According to a Wednesday letter obtained by The Associated Press, federal regulators say Bean's Making America Great Again LLC was limited to individual contributions of $5,000 in a single year" and Bean contributed $60,000. The group spent $66,862 supporting Trump. The FEC letter says the group could face punitive action or an audit if it doesn't respond. ___ Starbucks to stop selling alcohol at more than 400 US stores NEW YORK (AP) " Starbucks will stop selling beer and wine at hundreds of U.S. stores next week as it ends its "evenings" program. The coffee chain says the "Starbucks Evenings" program in 439 company-owned stores in the U.S. will end Jan. 10. It said the program may continue in some of the nine licensed stores where it is offered, or overseas. The program, first tested in 2010, was later expanded as a way to drive sales beyond the morning rush. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Updates On Finding A Nintendo NES Classic Posted: Jan 9 2017, 11:41am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Jan 9 2017, 2:40pm CST, in News | Technology News   Photo Credit: Getty Images/Nintendo   The Nintendo NES Classic Edition is still hard to find after the Holidays. Here are the best ways to find a NES Classic in stock. Updated. The Nintendo NES Classic Edition console is still very much in demand in the first days of 2017. The reseller prices of the NES Classic have come down a bit after the Holidays, are still very high with $170.99 plus shipping. Don't Miss: The Hottest CES 2017 Highlights Updates: Jan. 9: The week kicks off with low inventory levels of the NES Classic at Target and Walmart. Brickseek reports 5% and 1% respectively across all stores of the two retailers. Online availability of the NES does not exist since days. Some fans are already suspecting that Nintendo is not working on a new shipment of the NES Classic, because of the upcoming Nintendo Switch. We do not think that is the case, but it would be time for Nintendo to make an announcement regarding the NES Classic supply situation. In an new development, GameStop is reportedly receiving new NES Classic shipment on January 11. Amazon has the Nyko MiniBoss Wireless Controller for NES Classic Edition in stock in select Zip codes for $17.95. The 8Bitdo NES30 Classic Edition Wireless Controller Set with Bluetooth Retro Receiver is also in stock for $39.99. Jan. 7: The inventory situation of the NES Classic have not changed. Some Target stores have the NES in stock, but the BrickSeek inventory score of the NES at Target is still at a very low 5%. The NES Classic is though becoming more versatile. Hackers opened up the retro console to allow owners to upload more games. The hack comes out of Russia. The instructions to hack the NES Classic Edition are available. Select stores are receiving a limited numbers of NES Classic on a daily basis. The online availability of the NES Classic is dire. Shopko has sold the NES on the last day of 2016. The NES Classic was available at Best Buy online on Jan. 4 around 4pm ET. This marked the first time that the NES was sold online in days. It is time again to keep zoolert or nowinstock open in your browser and switch on the audio alerts, but there has been no new online availability.  GameStop sold some NES Bundles on December 29. Amazon has sold the NES in very limited quantities in select cities in the past days as well. Amazon has though not made any announcements about the NES Classic availability. Nintendo has not resupplied retailers with the NES Classic in a significant way. The in stock level of the NES at Target stores is at 5% according to BrickSeek. Chances that your local Target has the NES in stock are very low right now. NES hunters check the BrickSeek data of their local Target stores before midnight to see if a store will sell NES the next morning. In the unlikely case their is a NES in stock, buyers have to get to the store still early before the doors open. The demand is still extremely high. Resellers offer the NES on the Amazon marketplace are $170 and up. People report to have found a NES Classic in stock at stores including Target and Walmart. The tool of choice to spot the limited NES inventory is as always Brick Seek. The SKU for the NES is 207-29-0180. The service is working best for Target stores. The reported numbers are always to be taken with a grain of salt. The discussion group at InStockNow's NES tracking page is a good starting point ot find leads to stores that have the NES in stock.  Nintendo is under criticism for bad demand forecasting since years. Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. Even NES accessories are hard to come by. Resellers offer the NES on the Amazon marketplace are $170 and more. On launch day Nintendo said: "The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check availability." The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The NES Classic Edition comes only with a single wired controller. There are 3rd party controllers and accessories that make the NES more fun to use. Gamers can get additional controllers and even wireless controllers. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. In a short three months the new Nintendo Switch will go sale and Nintendo fans brace for the worst. We at I4U News have already pre-ordered the Nintendo Switch at Europe's largest consumer electronics chain. Find out everything we know about the Nintendo Switch launch.

UNCENSORED Why Traditional Companies Are Racing to Acquire Tech Startups Tune into this week's podcast to hear about how buying tech startups is now a strategy for traditional companies to stave off disruption. By Will Yakowicz Will Yakowicz is an award-winning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for Inc. magazine. Before Inc., he reported from the West Bank and Moscow for Tablet Magazine; he covered business, crime, and local politics for The Brooklyn Paper; and he was the editor of Park Slope Patch. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. @WillYakowicz Staff writer, Inc.@WillYakowicz WRITE A COMMENT Walmart acquired e-commerce company Jet.com for $3.3 billion in 2016. But the big box store company's acquisition of a tech company is not unique, last year traditional companies outpaced larger tech companies in tech startup acquisitions. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Welcome to the 98th episode of Inc. Uncensored podcast, hosted by Inc. editor Jim Ledbetter. This week, senior editor Danielle Sacks talks about how 2016 marked the first year that traditional companies outpaced tech giants in acquiring tech startups. In 2016, Google, IMB and Facebook didn't spend a substantial amount of money to acquire tech companies while Walmart, GM and Scotts Miracle Grow all spent billions each acquiring tech startups. Sacks explains how in 2012, traditional companies spent $20 billion on acquisitions compared to last year when traditional companies spent $125 billion on acquisitions, many of which were tech companies. Companies like Campbell's Soup and JetBlue both launched their own venture capital arms in an effort to survive in the long run. Sacks says the acquisition strategy by traditional companies should not be surprising as small startups like Amazon have turned into disruptive superpowers. Jim Ledbetter swaps spots and does his own segment about how mobile game apps use the warped economics of casino games to convince players to spend money on in-app purchases that do not have value except for a short thrill. Ledbetter explains that he believes mobile games, which are free to play, urge players to spend money on things like longer game-play time or digital goods, warps "kids' understanding of basic economic ideas." Tune in to learn about the ethics of design and how the freedom model could be distorting society's sense of value and how money should be spent. Lastly, the crew interviews Jeff Lawson for the podcast's Exit Interview segment. Lawson talks about how he co-founded Twilio, built the communications platform to power the likes of Uber and Airbnb and brought it public in 2016.

The latest season will premiere on Jan. 2, 2017. ... more Photo: Paul Drinkwater, Associated Press The Dow, Yahoo Finance, and Trump all miss their targets 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Party like it’s 19,999 The Dow Jones industrial average flirted with the 20,000 mark for most of Friday, getting as high as 19,999.63 before falling back to close at 19,963.80. If you’re looking for someone to blame, try Walmart and Verizon, two components of the index that fell in the day’s trading. The Nasdaq composite index and S&P 500 also posted record finishes. Yah-oh-no! Yahoo Finance got roundly mocked on Twitter after it made a really bad mistake when it pushed out a story about President-elect Donald Trump’s military plans. It was supposed to say, “Trump wants a much bigger navy,” only with the worst possible typo instead of “bigger.” And no, it wasn’t “Tigger.” And no, we don’t think Yahoo can blame hackers for this one. The company apologized for the “spelling error.” Today in Trump tweets “Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got ‘swamped’ (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for ...” Yes, that was about “Celebrity Apprentice,” and it even drew a response tweet from California’s former governor: “I wish you the best of luck and I hope you'll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings.” The Daily Briefing is compiled from San Francisco Chronicle staff and news services.

Considering this accelerating reality, organizations need to transform their business models to keep pace or they will fall prey to today's digital elite. In The Network Imperative, Barry Libert, Megan Beck, and Jerry Wind demonstrate how incumbent (non-digital, non-network, non-platform) organizations can grow and profit by shifting their capital (time and money) from tangible, physical, firm-based offerings to embracing intangible, digital, network-based business models. The authors provide 10 levers every organization can pull and a 5-step process to pivot toward greater growth and profits in today's hyperconnected world. The author believes that today's digital network businesses--best exemplified by Amazon, Alphabet (aka Google), Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft--deliver far greater growth, profits, and value than traditional, incumbent firms like Walmart, GE, GM, and Boeing. However, the best practices they have implemented in their firms are available to every organization. They include: 1. Recognizing the value of digital networks and platforms. Organizations that invest their resources in digital platforms and virtual network business models outpace the market by growing faster, scaling with lower marginal costs, and generating greater value. Leaders, partners, and customers of network organizations also benefit from the fulfilling, mutually rewarding relationships that successful network organizations create. 2. Developing digital strategies and platforms to create network effect. Network and platform organizations operate with a different mindset than traditional organizations. They see excess capacity and under-utilization (homes, friends, knowledge, and capabilities) where others see limited opportunity and full utilization. They focus on "access" versus assets. 3. Implementing customized network and platform business models. Business leaders can customize their growth and profits by identifying their current business models, evaluating all their assets (especially intangibles), envisioning their new digital business models, building the right team and board, and measuring the right metrics using today's machine learning and big data. 4. Becoming network leaders in every sector. Top-performing business leaders are adaptive. They invert their old beliefs, take in new ideas, and adjust their mental models to operate in new ways that focus less on what they have or do and more on what the network has, can do, and can offer. In addition, they are open to exploring new ventures and business models as market needs change.

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, capping a year of slower but solid hiring. Friday's report from the Labor Department portrayed a job market that remains durable 7½ years after the recovery from the Great Recession began. Though the unemployment rate rose to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent, it did so for an encouraging reason: More people began looking for work. Because not all of them found jobs immediately, more people were counted as unemployed in December. Hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from a year earlier, the sharpest increase in more than seven years. ___ Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. ___ US trade deficit climbs to $45.2 billion in November WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit in November rose to the highest level in nine months as imports of oil and other foreign goods increased, while American exports fell for a second month. The trade deficit jumped 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion, the largest imbalance since February, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Exports edged down 0.2 percent to $122.4 billion, reflecting lower overseas sales of American-made airplanes, autos and farm products. Imports rose 1.1 percent to $231.1 billion, led by a 7.6 percent jump in oil. ___ US factory orders drop 2.4 percent but investment up WASHINGTON (AP) — Orders to U.S. factories fell for the first time in five months in November, but much of the weakness reflected a swing in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. A key category that tracks business investment spending posted an increase. Factory orders dropped 2.4 percent after a 2.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the first decline since June but the weakness was led by a 73.8 percent plunge in demand for commercial aircraft following a 94.5 percent surge in October. ___ US approves fix for some Volkswagen diesels DETROIT (AP) — Volkswagen will soon be able to repair some of its diesel cars so they meet U.S. emissions standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board said Friday that they have approved a fix for around 67,000 of the 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-liter diesel engines that were programmed to cheat on U.S. emissions tests. The German automaker acknowledged the cheating in 2015. The remedy will fix 2015 models of the Volkswagen Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Golf, Golf SportWagen, Jetta and Passat as well as the Audi A3. ___ Jamie Oliver to shut 6 UK restaurants in tough Brexit market LONDON (AP) — Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is shutting six of his 42 Jamie's Italian restaurants in Britain amid tough trading conditions and a lower pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group said Friday that five restaurants in England and one in Scotland would close in the first quarter of 2017. The company has been stung by the slide in the pound, which has increased the cost of buying ingredients from Italy. Despite the pressure on prices triggered by the pound's fall, Britain's economy has outperformed many economists' expectations since the June vote. ___ Wal-Mart names John Furner as Sam's Club next CEO NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart says it named John Furner as CEO of its Sam's Club stores to replace Rosalind Brewer, who is retiring next month. Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart says he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position February 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam's Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago. ___ SeaWorld: Tilikum, orca that killed trainer, has died ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Tilikum the orca has died after more than two decades at SeaWorld Orlando, where he gained notoriety for killing a trainer in 2010 and was later profiled in a documentary that helped sway popular opinion against keeping killer whales in captivity. Sea World officials said Friday that Tilikum died but didn't give a cause of death. They said Tilikum had faced serious health issues including a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection. He was estimated to be 36 years old. The 2010 death of the SeaWorld trainer shocked the public, led to a downturn in SeaWorld's attendance and reshaped its future. ___ The Limited to close all brick-and-mortar shops WASHINGTON (AP) — More grim news for malls came Friday as apparel retailer The Limited said it will close all its brick-and-mortar stores at the end of this weekend. The company says it will continue to operate online only after the Jan. 8 closures. A spokesman said the New Albany, Ohio-based chain operated about 250 retail stores in 2016 and that about 4,000 jobs, including seasonal and temporary ones, would be lost. The announcement comes on the heels of Macy's and Sears announcing store closures and job cuts. ___ APNewsBreak: L.L. Bean heiress in trouble over pro-Trump PAC AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — The Federal Election Commission told L.L. Bean heiress Linda Bean that she made excessive contributions to a political action committee she created to support Republican President-elect Donald Trump. According to a Wednesday letter obtained by The Associated Press, federal regulators say Bean's Making America Great Again LLC was limited to individual contributions of $5,000 in a single year— and Bean contributed $60,000. The group spent $66,862 supporting Trump. The FEC letter says the group could face punitive action or an audit if it doesn't respond. ___ Starbucks to stop selling alcohol at more than 400 US stores NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will stop selling beer and wine at hundreds of U.S. stores next week as it ends its "evenings" program. The coffee chain says the "Starbucks Evenings" program in 439 company-owned stores in the U.S. will end Jan. 10. It said the program may continue in some of the nine licensed stores where it is offered, or overseas. The program, first tested in 2010, was later expanded as a way to drive sales beyond the morning rush.

January 6, 2017 City Psychiatric Examiners Disagree Over Competency of Alleged Walmart Murderer By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs | January 6, 2017 LikeTweet EmailPrint More More on City Subscribe to City Follow this author Two psychiatric examiners came to opposite conclusions after evaluating the Ithaca man who said he “shot and killed Donald Trump purposely, intentionally and very proudly,” and who is facing a murder charge for allegedly shooting and driving over a UPS driver in the Ithaca Walmart parking lot. One of the examiners who evaluated Justin Barkley, 38, determined that he would be able to understand the court proceedings and assist in his own defense, while the other declared him incompetent to do so, Tompkins County Judge John C. Rowley said in court on Friday. When two examiners disagree, a third psychiatric examiner must evaluate the defendant “to determine if he is an incapacitated person,” according to New York State law. The third examination will begin next week, Assistant District Attorney Eliza Filipowski said. Rowley also scheduled a hearing for later in January to discuss the “conflicting reports.” Leaderboard 1 <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=74458bb90a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538220187&cs=74458bb90a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=8cd4e36b59&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873873&cs=8cd4e36b59&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Police say Barkley used a .30-06 caliber rifle to shoot William Schumacher, 52, of Candor, in the chest on Dec. 8 before driving over the victim and fleeing to his residence on Dryden Road. Trailed by police, Barkley fired what he called a “sound shot” at officers to keep them from exiting their vehicles as he entered his home, commencing a nine-hour standoff with authorities from several departments. Barkley ultimately surrendered peacefully after police used a robot to communicate with him, Ithaca Police Chief John Barber said. He is charged with murder in the second degree — a class A-1 felony — and menacing a police officer or peace officer — a class D felony — and is being held in Tompkins County Jail without the option for bail. Barkley appeared in court Friday wearing an orange jail jumpsuit marked 2XL with his hands and legs shackled. He scanned the gallery briefly before taking a seat next to his attorney, James Baker.

Baker and Van Houten both declined to comment on whether they believe Barkley is competent to stand trial, noting that the determination is up to the experts. Rowley set a tentative court appearance for Jan. 19 relating to the conflicting reports and said the psychiatric examiners may be present for the appearance. Van Houten said it hasn’t yet been determined whether that hearing will be open to the public. The examiners’ evaluations are currently sealed under Judge Rowley’s orders.

January 6, 2017 Editorial By Eduardo Landeros Eduardo Landeros MBA In business, having a competitive advantage is one of the most important things you can have if you want to succeed. A competitive advantage is something that differentiates your business from the rest and makes you stand out. Entrepreneurs should always be asking themselves the following question: “what is the one thing customers like about my business that other businesses don’t have?” If it’s nothing, then you have some re-structuring to do.  It sounds simple, and there’s more beneath the surface, but it does apply to every business? Whether you are a small business owner or a large global corporation, the principle is the same.  This is how some businesses have been able to survive for many years and have succeeded in today’s very competitive and evolving business world. McDonald’s is a good example of having a strong competitive advantage.  If you look at the fast food industry, particularly in the burger arena, you’ll see that the brands that have survived over the years are the ones that have a clear competitive advantage. McDonald’s doesn’t have the best quality food out there, although their fries in my opinion are one of the best, but they do have something that others don’t:  the best meals and play areas for kids. As a parent myself, I use to go to McDonalds periodically because it was an experience for my children.  Not because their food was great or even because their service was fast, but because my children wanted a toy from the latest movie out there and wanted to spent a couple of minutes running around in their play area.  Even though my wife hated it, we would still do it for the kids. When analyzing McDonalds’ successful marketing efforts it is very clear that they are targeting the decision makers in the family which are not the parents. McDonald’s is still the number one burger chain in the U.S., and probably in the world. Other fast food restaurants have tried to compete with McDonald’s over the years by establishing a competitive advantage and offering something different.  The Six Dollar Burger comes to mind when I think of Carl’s Jr.  When their commercials use the sex appeal of  models washing cars, it’s obvious they’re trying to market to men in general who want a big meal.  Value menus or 99 cents items come to mind when I think of Jack in the Box.  In analyzing their commercials, Jack in the Box is trying to compete by offering low price items and targeting the price sensitive market such as college students. Retail stores also come to mind when analyzing competitive advantages.  It is obvious that Wal-Mart competes with low price items, but what about Costco? What Costco’s competitive advantage? Costco is unique in that they offer high quality products at very reasonable prices if you’re willing to pay for quantity. However, this advantage might not appeal to all; not every family needs 20 lbs of rib eye steaks or 30 rolls of toilet paper. Costco is able to compete with Wal-Mart and other grocery stores because they do things a little different.  Instead of spending money in a good looking store, or a million dollar marketing campaign, they spend their money taking care of their employees and negotiating good prices for their consumers.  So when it comes to quantity buying, they are usually cheaper than many retailers out there.  But all in all, it’s not that Costco is better than Wal-Mart.  They’re just different and they’re able to differentiate their companies by establishing a good competitive advantage. So what makes your business different than the rest? Many like to compete by offering low prices, but they need to be careful and make sure the numbers work out.  If you are able to compete with low prices, make sure you’re making money at the end of the day.  In my career, I’ve seen many businesses fail because they end up decreasing their margins and working for free.   How about competing with something different like better service, better products, or more convenience?  Maybe you’ll be the only one that offers free delivery or a loyalty program. However you choose to compete, make sure you have a clear understanding of what you want to accomplish, analyze the numbers, and stick to it!   Be Sociable, Share!

Sam’s Club CEO Exiting As Company Moves To Win Over Costco Shoppers Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Sam’s Club CEO Exiting As Company Moves To Win Over Costco Shoppers Image courtesy of Mike Mozart January 6, 2017 2:55 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler See Ya Later costco sam's club retail ceo rosalind brewer Stepping Down retiring groceries In recent years, Sam’s Club CEO Rosalind Brewer has led the warehouse store’s efforts to compete for Costco’s more affluent shoppers, but as sales at the Walmart-owned chain remain unremarkable, Brewer will soon retire. Sam’s Club announced Brewer’s impending departure in an SEC filing [PDF] Friday, noting that she would retire from the company effective Feb. 1 after spending five years at the helm of the retailer. Brewer will be replaced by current Sam’s Club chief merchant John Furner. Under Brewer’s lead, Sam’s Club has implemented several initiatives intended to undercut its rival Costco. For example, last summer, the company took advantage of Costco’s switch from an American Express-branded store card to Visa by parodying the other company’s signage and offering Costco card holders the opportunity to enter the store and browse. For its part, Sam’s Club began accepting both Visa and American Express cards in early 2016. (Related — Costco Vs. Sam’s Club: Which Warehouse Club Should You Choose?) In Feb. 2016, Sam’s Club made plans to overhaul its biggest-selling category — groceries — by focusing on just one house brand, Member’s Mark, as well as adding more organic and specialty fine foods to its aisles. At the time, Brewer told Fortune that the changes were a “reset for our business,” noting that the company knows that in order to compete with Costco and other retailers it must “win in food.” Still, Fortune reports that despite the initiatives Sam’s Club continues to struggle to close the gap, as its recent 1.4% growth wasn’t enough to meet Costco’s sales.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 6, 2017: 12:02 PM ET See how Amazon packages ship with less than :60 in human hands Did you buy nearly all your presents for the holidays at Amazon? I did. And I must not be alone. Jeff Bezos is the new Santa Claus. But to the rest of retail, Bezos is the evil Krampus that's punishing them all for their naughty behavior. Consider this. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) is now worth more than these 10 well-known retailers combined: Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Sears (SHLD), JCPenney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN), Best Buy (BBY), Barnes & Noble (BKS), Dillard's (DDS), Gap (GPS) and Target (TGT). In fact, it's not even close. Related: Macy's is closing 68 stores, cutting 1,000 jobs Amazon's market value is just north of $370 billion. These other retailers are collectively worth a little less than $95 billion. And a big chunk of that is from Target, which has a market value of $40 billion. Amazon also is worth significantly more than other global retail giants. Its market value is about $135 billion higher than Alibaba's (BABA, Tech30) and $160 billion more than Walmart (WMT). Amazon is worth more than twice as much as Home Depot (HD), and six times as much as Lowe's (LOW). The company is much more valuable than another famous retailer based in the state of Washington too -- Costco (COST). That warehouse giant, which is increasingly competing with Amazon in the grocery business, is worth about $300 billion less than Amazon. Related: Sears and Kmart closing 150 stores Traditional retailers are doing all they can to compete with Amazon. But it looks like they are going to have to use the old Avis (CAR) rental car motto and try harder. JCPenney joined Macy's and Kohl's Friday morning by reporting disappointing results for the holidays. "Brands like Macy's, Sears, and Kmart are struggling to evolve their brands and stay relevant for today's digitally-savvy and dynamic shopper," said Forrester retail analyst Brendan Witcher. No kidding. And the stock performance of all these retailers clearly show that many retailers are also to struggling to remain relevant with digitally-savvy and dynamic investors as well. Amazon, for better or worse, is the only major retail stock that Wall Street wants to put in its shopping cart.

Video posted to Facebook shows Nikki Smith reacting to an empty — completely empty — bread aisle at Walmart, wailing and sliding dramatically when she notices there is no bread. She said the video is simply meant to bring humor to the situation. “I just wanted to do something funny about how everyone reacts to the snow in South Carolina,” Smith told WHNS. “I went out to see if there was any bread and it was all gone.

U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Posted: Friday, January 6, 2017 11:39 am | Updated: 7:27 am, Sat Jan 7, 2017. Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That's because workers are being paid more, but the report won't push the Fed to raise rates quickly in order to stave off inflation. "Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more," he said. "But ... people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes." At about 12:40 p.m. the Dow peaked at 19,999.63, but later lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, which was solid but slightly disappointing. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest monthly increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.77, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs jumped $3.58, or 1.5 percent, to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged the market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.50. Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $3.80, or 2.5 percent, to $156.78 while Regeneron slid $22.24, or 5.8 percent, to $358.68 and Sanofi lost $1.18, or 2.8 percent, to $40.32. The dollar rose to 117.02 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0532 from $1.0590. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $7.90 to $1,173.40 an ounce. Silver sank 12 cents to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.55 a pound. The FTSE 100 index in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It's risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 of France rose 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay © 2017 The Associated Press.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 6, 2017: 12:02 PM ET See how Amazon packages ship with less than :60 in human hands Did you buy nearly all your presents for the holidays at Amazon? I did. And I must not be alone. Jeff Bezos is the new Santa Claus. But to the rest of retail, Bezos is the evil Krampus that's punishing them all for their naughty behavior. Consider this. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) is now worth more than these 10 well-known retailers combined: Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Sears (SHLD), JCPenney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN), Best Buy (BBY), Barnes & Noble (BKS), Dillard's (DDS), Gap (GPS) and Target (TGT). In fact, it's not even close. Related: Macy's is closing 68 stores, cutting 1,000 jobs Amazon's market value is just north of $370 billion. These other retailers are collectively worth a little less than $95 billion. And a big chunk of that is from Target, which has a market value of $40 billion. Amazon also is worth significantly more than other global retail giants. Its market value is about $135 billion higher than Alibaba's (BABA, Tech30) and $160 billion more than Walmart (WMT). Amazon is worth more than twice as much as Home Depot (HD), and six times as much as Lowe's (LOW). The company is much more valuable than another famous retailer based in the state of Washington too -- Costco (COST). That warehouse giant, which is increasingly competing with Amazon in the grocery business, is worth about $300 billion less than Amazon. Related: Sears and Kmart closing 150 stores Traditional retailers are doing all they can to compete with Amazon. But it looks like they are going to have to use the old Avis (CAR) rental car motto and try harder. JCPenney joined Macy's and Kohl's Friday morning by reporting disappointing results for the holidays. "Brands like Macy's, Sears, and Kmart are struggling to evolve their brands and stay relevant for today's digitally-savvy and dynamic shopper," said Forrester retail analyst Brendan Witcher. No kidding. And the stock performance of all these retailers clearly show that many retailers are also to struggling to remain relevant with digitally-savvy and dynamic investors as well. Amazon, for better or worse, is the only major retail stock that Wall Street wants to put in its shopping cart.

But unlike Santa, this one was more into taking than giving, authorities said. Gawad Dalia, 31, of North Bergen, was arrested shortly after 1 a.m. on Dec. 25 and charged with attempting to burglarize a storage trailer in the superstore's parking lot - after several previous attempts were reported, Secaucus police said. "We had several other burglaries on different dates into those trailers, and on this particular date (Dalia) was observed by (security guards) in the area ... breaking into the trailers," police Capt. Dennis Miller said. Security personnel had called Secaucus police on Dec. 23 after recognizing Dalia's vehicle on two prior occasions, but he fled before police arrived, Miller said. Fortunately for police, Dalia decided to come back to the trailer to try again, Miller said. He was arrested Christmas morning and enough evidence was obtained - a crow bar, pliers and a flashlight - to charge him with the burglary of the trailer, according to Miller. Dalia was charged with burglary, hindering apprehension, possession of burglar tools and criminal mischief. His bail was set at $30,000 with a 10 percent cash option. He was later remanded to the Hudson County jail. Four days later, another arrest was made at the Walmart - this time for shoplifting in the store. William Velez, 29, of East Orange, was arrested and charged with shoplifting after attempting to walk out of the store with $1,072 worth of electronics, according to Miller. He was also charged with a prescription drug offense when he was found to be in possession of six Xanax pills, Miller said.

BY Seth Kershner Share TweetReddit2 StumbleUpon8EmailPrint Email this article to a friend your email your name recipient(s) email (comma separated) message captcha The drumbeat of anti-unionism typically begins as soon as new employees begin their training. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)   Retail is the nation’s largest employer. Since 1980, the number of jobs in retail has reportedly grown nearly 50 percent, from 10.2 to 15.1 million. At the same time, real wages for retail workers have fallen by 11 percent while on-call scheduling, involuntary part-time work and “clopening”—where workers are required to lock up the store late at night and reopen the next morning—have wreaked havoc with workers’ lives. Not surprisingly, the retail sector also has one of the lowest rates of unionization in the economy—around the 5 percent mark under which unions have virtually no influence. It didn’t used to be this way. Retail had 15 percent union density in the 1970s, according to sociologist Peter Ikeler, with the density rate in grocery stores surpassing 31 percent at its peak in 1983. But, as with the rest of the labor movement, retail unionism has taken a steep fall since the early 1980s. How did it go so wrong? “There are a lot of parts to that puzzle,” says Ikeler, a sociologist at the State University of New York College at Old Westbury and author of the book, Hard Sell: Work and Resistance in Retail Chains.  Ikeler cites the general trend towards de-unionization of the U.S. workforce and the hollowing out of the National Labor Relations Act system through case law and employer challenges. But the most important factor in the fall of retail unionism, Ikeler argues, has been employer hostility. “The climate for labor organizing in retail is pretty explicitly negative,” Ikeler says. In a case Ikeler describes in his book, the public was able to get a glimpse of Target’s anti-union strategies—including mandatory film screenings and employees threatened with dismissal for talking about the union—during a highly publicized 2011 campaign to keep the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) from organizing one of its stores on Long Island. And across the retail industry, Target is far from unique. The drumbeat of anti-unionism typically begins as soon as new employees begin their training. New worker orientations at Walmart, the nation’s leading retailer, used to include a video that featured lines like: “The truth is unions are businesses, multimillion-dollar businesses that make their money by convincing people like you and me to give them a part of our paychecks.” According to The Atlantic, labor experts who had examined the entire video after it was leaked to the press found that it contained “blatant untruths in many of the video’s pro-company and anti-union statements.” Even smaller, regional chains invest in anti-union propaganda for new hires. According to internal documents provided to In These Times by an employee of Big Y, the Massachusetts-based grocer warns new hires about signing a union authorization card since the company’s “continued success” would be “jeopardized through third party involvement.” To research his book, Ikeler interviewed workers at Macy’s and Target stores in the New York City area. Many reported knowing that managers disapproved of unions. Several Target workers told Ikeler they were sure their jobs would be in jeopardy if they advocated for unions and reported that they knew people who’d been fired for union activity. When contacted for comment, a Target spokeswoman said that the company “believes in solving issues and concerns with the help and input of our team.” “At Target we have a longstanding commitment to our team that we will work together to create an environment of mutual trust between Target and our team members,” wrote Molly Snyder. Unions’ strategic missteps While employer resistance played the biggest role in the decline of retail unionism, Ikeler believes that unions also share part of the blame. Specifically, he thinks that unions have done a lousy job of keeping workers engaged. Ikeler points out that surveys indicate that around 13 percent of grocery store workers in the New York City area say they belong to a union. This is in contrast to the unions themselves, which say they represent a much larger share of such workers in the Big Apple. “What I think this huge disparity demonstrates,” Ikeler tells In These Times, “is that there are a fair number of workers who aren’t aware they’re in a union—it’s just something that comes out of their check every month. Sure, they might be organized in some bureaucratic sense—just not in any meaningful fighting capacity.” In Ikeler’s view, labor unions need to step up their organizing and “get back to what unions were in their early New Deal days: more worker-based rather these large staff-run, top-heavy entities that give lots of money to Democratic candidates every few years with relatively little payback.” A construct that can be challenged Ikeler also sees a lot of potential in the worker center model. Worker centers like the Retail Action Project, which Ikeler has studied extensively, give workers a place to go to form communities, talk about work conditions and plan campaigns. Another clear benefit is that worker centers help cultivate a sense of occupational identity in a sector of the economy known for deskilling workers in order to make them more easily replaceable. “A strong occupational identity—where workers are very committed to a craft, to an occupation—this has often been a source of collective identity and resistance,” Ikeler says. “If workers see themselves as part of an occupational community they may be more likely to form organizations together and put up collective resistance.” Worker centers can’t replace unions, but the two types of organizations can work together. “To see success,” Ikeler says, “to see large-scale organizing and an advance for the low-wage service sector, we’re going to have to see greater synergy than we’ve previously seen between worker centers and national unions that are actually willing to take risks and use some of their treasury by going on strike.” When asked if he saw any bright spots on the retail scene today, Ikeler pointed to a recent victory by Stop & Shop workers in New England. After threatening to strike in February, the UFCW negotiated a favorable contract for its 35,000 members in the region, including a quicker route to a $15 hourly wage and a promise from the company to add 480 new full time jobs over the next three years. The victory calls to mind an uplifting passage from Hard Sell, where Ikeler writes that “bad” service jobs are “not an unalterable fact of life but a social construct that can be challenged.” Never has independent journalism mattered more.

America’s Tween Soldiers View Comments "recent victory by Stop & Shop workers" Great to learn retail workers can win. Seems the great challenges to food retail unionization would be a) rapid turnover - students going to school, or workers looking for jobs that are more challenging, or that have higher status, or higher pay - and b) ease of replacing workers by drawing on a 'short-term' labor pool. On the other hand, retail food services cannot be moved out of the country, carried out via internet, nor - despite some self-service machines in some retail outlets - significantly automated. The food industry in particular needs a sizable worker base. Union outcomes may depend on particular factors: anti-union business practices are a given that may vary from state to state; but, on the other hand, politicized support groups (political parties, civic organizations, unions, newspapers) may strengthen negotiation and strike actions. The above also goes for unionism in the building trades, where outsourcing and automation are - outside of science fiction scenarios - not possible. Spontaneous strike-action-support-groups - students w/spare time, retirees, teachers between classes, spouses not working - could look at a single 'strike actions in your community' website to join up with particular actions. Posted by abramawicz on 2017-01-10 16:52:14 Unions mainstay for years has been people with tax funded jobs. - before that they were for the laborers in the factories. They turned their backs on retail workers and minimum wage earners - guess why - they don't make enough to pay dues. Now their need to replenish and build new Political Action Committees Funds(PAC's) is driving them into every niche of society/work force. Unions have provide a much needed voice for workers in America. They brought the steel mills and auto industries throughout the 1950-2000! Now its almost all been automated - dues paying members replaced by robotic machines. What will they do for minimum wage and retail sales workers ? Just askin ?

EPA/SHAWN THEW Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Most family businesses don’t have to work out how they will survive the boss taking over as president of the United States. Donald Trump has been forced to distance himself from the family firm since winning the US election. He even said: “I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it.” It is perhaps an extreme example of the pressures that swirl around the businesses at the heart of many economies, but it does signal the unique pressures which come to bear when trying to sustain an organisation through the generations. Family businesses cross a variety of cultures, religions and backgrounds. The chocolate manufacturers Rowntree’s, Fry’s and Cadbury’s, the shoemakers Clarks and the bankers Barclays and Lloyds all became large businesses after being started by Quaker families. They went into business in part because they were excluded from other aspects of public life in the 18th and 19th centuries, and along the way earned a reputation for looking after their workforces. More recent examples include small, local family retailers set up by South Asian immigrants in the UK who want to support the next generation either in the business or in another profession. Crash Family businesses can last a long time. While trying to make gold from base metals, an Armenian alchemist discovered a different type of “gold” – a metal alloy that had outstanding sound quality and power when made into musical cymbals. A few years later, in 1623, the Zildjian Cymbal Company was founded, and can be traced through 16 generations and nearly four centuries to today’s firm in Massachusetts. Family symbol. Alan Levine/Flickr, CC BY Many key family businesses have survived the test of time after opening ownership beyond the family, although often the original families still control a significant stake in the company. The list includes modern-day giants like Wal-Mart Stores and Ford Motors in the US, L’Oreal in France, Benetton in Italy, Samsung in Korea, Sainsbury’s in the UK and Siemens in Germany. The Indian company Tata has, however, recently been suffering in the media glare due to an acrimonious falling out between family members in senior positions. The fact is that most businesses are family owned. In the UK some 71% of all small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which employ up to 250 people are family owned. Given those multinational success stories above, it might be surprising to learn that up to 95% do not survive in family ownership by the third generation. Happy Shopper? Mike Kalasnik/Flickr, CC BY-SA Some reasons for this may lie in the common criticisms of family businesses. They have been accused of sometimes having poor management and discipline, inadequate funding to support growth, differing incentives between family members and a lack of formalised practices and procedures. They can fall foul of time consuming family conflict, slow decision making, risk avoidance, limited innovation and a strategy which favours the status quo rather than change. Multiple motivations So how do you build a sustainable family businesses? First, it is important to consider how the rationalities underpinning the behaviours and strategies of family firms vary from those of others, especially small businesses. Let’s assume that a well-run SME is driven entirely by “market rationalities” which focus entirely on business needs and without the interference of motivations linked to the family ownership. It can be argued then that family businesses are more likely to be profit satisficers (balancing other objectives with achieving a minimum level of profit) rather than profit maximisers. Relationships between family members – both good and bad, or short and long term – can carry over into the business and influence how things are decided. These challenge assumptions of purely economic rational decision making in family firms, particularly when combined with cognitive and behavioural biases such as preferring those who are like us, or feeling that the value of a loss is much more than that of an equivalent gain. Getting down to business. Colleen Kelly/Flickr, CC BY One way of looking at family firms suggests that we should accept that the family, business and social lives of those running a company must be seen as operating together: relationships overlap; family, friends and business logic or rationalities combine to influence behaviour and decision-making. Fundamentally, family aims and values can result in business decisions that differ from non-family firms. They may be reluctant to hire people from outside the family or they may adopt technology in a less flexible way as they are tied to existing ways of doing things and to existing staff and other assets. Supporting family businesses One implication is that support for small businesses, and companies with high growth potential, should not assume that family and other firms are identical. It may be that policies need to be carefully adapted for family firms. Support such as stimulating demand, changing public attitudes towards entrepreneurship, supporting research and development and the take-up of new technology, as well as providing training, advice and financial assistance all need to be adapted to take account of the differences between family and non-family firms. Emphasis also needs to be placed on developing partnerships and engagement with others, including family members and employees. Success for family businesses should not be considered just in terms of survival. A few family businesses will develop into future market leaders even if their ownership changes, and these need to be nurtured. As family businesses make up such a crucial part of both everyday and high growth firms, research and policies need to consider those more rounded perspectives that incorporate the complex bonds and motivations that mark family firms out from the rest. Fortunately, not all will have to factor in a startling political rise that leaves the owner preparing to move into the White House amid a media furore about many potential conflicts of interest.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 6, 2017: 12:02 PM ET See how Amazon packages ship with less than :60 in human hands Did you buy nearly all your presents for the holidays at Amazon? I did. And I must not be alone. Jeff Bezos is the new Santa Claus. But to the rest of retail, Bezos is the evil Krampus that's punishing them all for their naughty behavior. Consider this. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) is now worth more than these 10 well-known retailers combined: Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Sears (SHLD), JCPenney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN), Best Buy (BBY), Barnes & Noble (BKS), Dillard's (DDS), Gap (GPS) and Target (TGT). In fact, it's not even close. Related: Macy's is closing 68 stores, cutting 1,000 jobs Amazon's market value is just north of $370 billion. These other retailers are collectively worth a little less than $95 billion. And a big chunk of that is from Target, which has a market value of $40 billion. Amazon also is worth significantly more than other global retail giants. Its market value is about $135 billion higher than Alibaba's (BABA, Tech30) and $160 billion more than Walmart (WMT). Amazon is worth more than twice as much as Home Depot (HD), and six times as much as Lowe's (LOW). The company is much more valuable than another famous retailer based in the state of Washington too -- Costco (COST). That warehouse giant, which is increasingly competing with Amazon in the grocery business, is worth about $300 billion less than Amazon. Related: Sears and Kmart closing 150 stores Traditional retailers are doing all they can to compete with Amazon. But it looks like they are going to have to use the old Avis (CAR) rental car motto and try harder. JCPenney joined Macy's and Kohl's Friday morning by reporting disappointing results for the holidays. "Brands like Macy's, Sears, and Kmart are struggling to evolve their brands and stay relevant for today's digitally-savvy and dynamic shopper," said Forrester retail analyst Brendan Witcher. No kidding. And the stock performance of all these retailers clearly show that many retailers are also to struggling to remain relevant with digitally-savvy and dynamic investors as well. Amazon, for better or worse, is the only major retail stock that Wall Street wants to put in its shopping cart.

Florence Police detective Sgt. Brad Holmes said Stephanie L. Langford, 30, 1412 E. 26th St., Sheffield, is charged with third-degree theft of property, fourth-degree theft of property and two counts of fraudulent use of a credit card. Reports indicate Langford, who was a former employee of the Burger King location inside Wal-Mart on Hough Road, Florence, is accused taking a patron’s credit card and then using it to make purchases in Wal-Mart. “Someone left their wallet (at Burger King), Langford found it, took a credit card and then went into Wal-Mart and made purchases with the stolen credit card,” said Florence police detective Zac Maxwell, who is working the case. He said Langford was taken into custody and then charged. She has been released from the Lauderdale County Jail on bail of $4,500. tom.smith@timesdaily.com or 256-740-5757. Twitter @TD_TomSmith.

Furner, who is 42, will head the membership-only warehouse chain next month. Furner has been Sam's Club's chief merchandising officer since October 2015. Wal-Mart says he first joined the company as an hourly store associate in 1993. Brewer will leave her position February 1. The 54-year-old has been CEO of Sam's Club for five years and has had a variety of executive roles since joining the company about 11 years ago.

The goal: Use these real-world store features to lure shoppers back from the internet, and maybe even nudge them to spend more in the process. Amazon’s new experimental grocery store in Seattle, opening in early 2017, will let shoppers buy goods without needing to stop at a checkout line. Sensors track items as shoppers put them into baskets or return them to the shelf. The shopper’s Amazon account gets automatically charged. “Amazon, for good or bad, has been setting the path,” said Robert Hetu, research director at Gartner Research. “Each retailer is going to have to respond in some way. But it’s not one-size-fits-all.” Kroger, Neiman Marcus and Lowe’s are among the companies already experimenting with futuristic retail stores. Robots, for instance, could help guide shoppers to the right aisle, while augmented reality apps could help you see how a particular shade of paint will look in the living room – or how you might look in a pair of jeans. Many of these technologies will be unveiled or demonstrated at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which begins Tuesday with media previews. Plenty of retailers have learned through trial – and error – that technology can’t get too far ahead of shoppers. It has to be easy to use and beneficial to shoppers in some way, whether it’s to save time or money. If retailers get it right, they might succeed in boosting spending at retail stores at a time when consumers increasingly prefer to shop online. Here are five technologies coming to a store near you. SMART SHELVES Web retailers have plenty of data on their customers. Some of these online technologies can even track shoppers from site to site to lure them back with what’s known as retargeting ads – promos targeted to what that shopper has looked at before, but didn’t actually buy. Smart shelves with sensors promise the same kind of in-depth consumer behavior analytics at retail stores. At a Kroger store in Cold Spring, Ohio, shelves currently show digitized price tags and information about the products. The next step is to tie that to individual shoppers. For example, for a shopper who prefers gluten-free products, the price tags could light up in the aisle where all the gluten-free options are. The company says this will all be done with the customer’s permission. Perch Interactive, a startup that is working with chains like Sunglass Hut and fragrance maker Jo Malone, uses laser and motion sensors to detect when a product is picked up. Perch monitors the interactions and lets retailers know what people pick up but don’t buy. It also offers recommendations: When a shopper picks up a Jo Malone product, an interactive display pops up to show a complementary fragrance. ROBOTS Amazon and other retailers have long used robots in warehouses to help package and ship orders. But what about interacting with shoppers? Home improvement retailer Lowe’s is testing robots in one of its San Jose, California, store, and plans to roll them out to 10 more stores in the state this year. Besides scanning shelves for inventory, the robots can guide customers to specific products in both English and Spanish. Photo: 2014 press release, SoftBank Corp./Aldebaran Robotics SAS Shoppers will also start seeing robots that interact with them more deeply. Japanese joint venture SoftBank Robotics is testing a 4-foot humanoid robot called Pepper at two Westfield Malls in California. They greet shoppers and can do a little dance, but have the potential to send messages geared to people’s age and gender through facial recognition. SoftBank Robotics says it’s working with clothing retailers to help suggest outfits to shoppers. INTERACTIVE MIRRORS High-end clothing stores are testing interactive mirrors in dressing areas, a key place where shoppers decide whether to buy or not. Neiman Marcus has installed these outside fitting rooms at 20 stores to offer shoppers a 360-degree view of what an outfit looks like. Shoppers can make side-by-side comparisons without having to try them all on. They can also share video with friends for feedback. Variations include capturing a customer’s session at the beauty counter and emailing a video to help the person recreate the look at home. Rent the Runway, an online retailer that lets people rent high-end clothing, teamed up with Samsung to have digital displays highlight its online inventory for shoppers at a new location in New York. A mirror in the store is planned to recommend items that go with what the customer is wearing. VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY Home improvement retailers have been embracing virtual reality and augmented reality to help shoppers figure out ways to decorate homes or apartments. With such technologies, shoppers wear a headset to picture how something might look in 3-D, in some cases overlaid on top of their real kitchen or living room. Home Depot’s augmented reality app lets customers upload a picture of the room on their phone and thumb through thousands of paint and stain colors until they arrive at one that’s right. These tools should become more pervasive. At CES, a major clothing chain is expected to announce a tool for shoppers to virtually try on jeans and other items. SELF-CHECKOUT Stores have been pushing self-service kiosks for years to lower labor costs and speed up checkout lines. It hasn’t always been smooth, though. Two years ago, Wal-Mart offered a Scan & Go app for shoppers to scan items as they grabbed them from the shelves. At the checkout counter, the customer merely had to scan a code to complete the transaction. But Wal-Mart scrapped the project after customers found the app difficult to use. Despite Wal-Mart’s hiccups, plenty of stores believe they can avoid the pitfalls. Andy Wong, partner at Accenture’s Kurt Salmon Digital, said Wal-Mart had a tougher time because its customers are diverse and less techy overall. By contrast, Amazon is trying out its store in Seattle, a tech center, and has a customer base already comfortable with digital shopping. Wong also said Amazon is smart to focus just on groceries, and he expects other retailers to follow Amazon’s lead and also focus on certain products. In fact, shortly after Amazon announced its checkout-less store, Panasonic Corp. unveiled an unstaffed bagging system at a Lawson convenience store in Japan. Shoppers place a “smart” basket with their items on a machine at checkout. The system calculates the bill and automatically bags the items. Shoppers now have to scan items they put into the basket, though wireless tags coming in February will eliminate that step. Shoppers still have to manually pay using cash or card. As retailers consider automated self-checkout and other technologies, they have to look beyond the tech wizardry. “It all has to go back to the consumer,” Gartner’s Hetu said. “For each environment, you have to assess what the consumer will interpret as value.” (AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.)

Print Email Matt Mitchell, The Ostrich By Matt Mitchell, The Ostrich AL.com Follow on Twitter on January 06, 2017 at 8:14 AM, updated January 06, 2017 at 8:15 AM comments Matt Mitchell is the creator of The Ostrich, Walker County's least trusted news source, and was the 3rd round draft pick of the Denver Nuggets. Roughly half of what he writes is untrue. It's going to snow. This is not a drill. The governor has already declared a state of emergency. And I haven't even told you the scariest part yet.  The snow may stick.  To the ground.  According to the latest forecast models, snow accumulation is possible from Madison County to the very top of Baldwin County. No one can escape the icy grip of this winter storm. Except maybe Mobile, but y'all should probably reactivate the USS Alabama just to be safe.  Forget to buy bread and milk? Too late. Whole milk is selling on Facebook yard sale pages for $50 a gallon or one cracked-screen iPhone 4 and the only thing left in your local Walmart is something called almond milk, which sounds incredibly suspicious because there's no way you can milk an almond.  Roads? Those should be fine until the first snowflake hits the asphalt. Then road conditions are expected to deteriorate rapidly, or as the chief engineers at ALDOT say, "they'll be slicker than snot on a doorknob." But many of you will still reach for that doorknob, not realizing what a mistake you've made until your car is stuck on the shoulder of I-65 and you're forced to spend the night in the lobby bathroom of a Red Roof Inn.  This shouldn't be a problem for children since most schools and daycares have announced delays until mid-March. As for you adults with a job, you can pretty much bank on your place of employment expecting you to come in early and work a few hours late, regardless of the weather. Those almonds aren't going to milk themselves (Or maybe they do. I'm still not sure how that works). While much of this is exaggerated, one thing is absolutely true: our attempts to survive the impending Snowpocalypse will be a constant source of entertainment for Northerners. Buried in 10 feet of snow and sipping on unsweetened tea, those Yankees absolutely love to sit back and watch us panic over the threat of a measly inch of snow.  And we never disappoint.  As soon as James Spann uttered the word "snow" we all rushed to the store to buy the necessary ingredients for milk sandwiches: milk and tortillas (bread was already sold out). Yes, things would be a lot different down here if it actually snowed several times a year and we had things like snow plows, salt trucks, and winter tires.  But we don't.  Why should we? What's the point in Alabama spending millions of dollars on equipment that might get used one day a year? That would make as much sense as one of those Northerners building a trophy case for college football national championships.  All we can do now is stay warm and wait for the snow and ice to melt. And please don't hold a grudge against those "superior" Northerners, it'll make things awkward when they retire and move down here in a couple years.  TALKING POLITICS Alabama/California Conversation Project We asked Alabama Trump voters to talk politics, values with California liberals Civic-minded Donald Trump voters in Alabama agreed to have a deep, serious, respectful conversation with Hillary Clinton voters from one of the most liberal places in America, the San Francisco Bay Area. This is the result. MORE IN THE SERIES What we learned: Alabama, California women reflect on their conversations As conversation winds down, discussion turns to race, other challenges The key to civility?

It really bothers me.” Cohen, a 52-year-old, non-practicing attorney from Cape Elizabeth, has a disability. It’s called dystonia, a neurological disorder that causes repeated and uncontrolled muscle contractions and often leaves its victims painfully contorted and unable to get around without tremendous difficulty. Back in 2003, Cohen underwent Deep Brain Stimulation, a then-revolutionary surgical procedure during which the patient lies awake for hours while doctors implant a pacemaker in the chest and run electrical lead wires to the brain. The operation, performed at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, worked like a charm. Cohen’s once-severe symptoms have diminished to the point where most of the contractions are gone, he can stand up straight, walk, drive a car and generally love life far more than he did before. But he still knows what it’s like to live day in and day out with a disability. And as Portland descends into another marathon of snow and ice and all the limited mobility that comes with it, Cohen is on a dual mission: First, he wants to increase the number of handicapped parking spaces in high-traffic areas like the Old Port and Congress Street. Second, he strongly suggests we leave those spots open for the people who truly need them. According to Jessica Grondin, the city’s director of communications, Portland sets aside just under 150 on-street spaces for handicapped parking citywide – out of approximately 6,400 controlled spaces. That’s just over 2 percent, she noted, which is in line with the number of handicapped spaces required under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act for big-box store lots, parking garages and other off-street locations. Go to a Wal-Mart and you’ll see those spaces clustered right where they should be: directly in front of the store entrance. Not so in downtown Portland, counters Cohen. “Overall, there are a very few handicapped spots in the downtown or the Old Port,” he said. Worse yet, he noted, several of those have been cut off in recent weeks by construction projects or used by city plow operators to pile snow before its removal. “Freedom of movement is a fundamental desire of all of us,” Cohen said. “Sometimes finding a handicapped accessible parking space can make the difference between staying home and getting out.” To be fair, Grondin also noted that under state law, people with handicapped plates or windshield placards can park free of charge at any metered or time-limited spot for up to double the posted time limit. True, concedes Cohen. But when all of those spaces are full, as they most often are during the business day, the free-parking provision gets people with disabilities no closer to where they want to go. “For one with a mobility issue, the prospect of parking in a regular spot and having to then travel by foot or wheelchair a significant distance is daunting and is oftentimes functionally impossible for them in the first place,” he said. “And obviously this mobility issue is worsened many times over by winter snow and ice.” Cohen’s solution? More spaces spread out more strategically throughout high-traffic locations like lower Exchange Street and the streets surrounding One City Center, where there are none. (Echoing that sentiment is the United States Access Board, which develops regulations and standards for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. It has proposed a rule mandating that new or reconfigured city streets contain at least one handicapped space per block.) As Kristin Aiello, managing attorney for Disability Rights Maine, put it in an interview Thursday, “It’s cold comfort to say, ‘We have 150 spaces’ if none of them are in a place where people need and want to access.” Then there’s the hijacking of those handicapped spaces that do exist. Also known as the jerk factor. Cohen said it’s worst on weekdays around 5 p.m., when the comings and goings peak downtown and handicapped spaces become live-parking havens for able-bodied people with inexcusable blind spots. “It does not matter though how long one is parked illegally – the lawbreaker is denying rightful access to disabled Mainers who truly need the handicapped parking spot,” Cohen said. “One is still breaking Maine state law whether you’re in the spot illegally for 30 seconds or two hours.” On this point, Cohen and City Hall fully agree. According to Grondin, 800 summonses were handed out in the past year to people parked illegally in handicapped spaces. Each carried a $200 fine. The worst of the offenders? “People who do not have a disability but park in the spaces using someone else’s permit or plate, i.e., borrowing from a relative,” Grondin noted. Cohen, who has a handicapped-parking permit but rarely uses it out of concern for those who need the space more than he does, knows the imposter syndrome all too well. In March he went on a date with a woman in the Old Port. When it was over, he gallantly walked her back to her car. “It was parked in a handicapped space,” he recalled. Sure enough, she had a placard hanging from her mirror. Problem was it belonged to the elderly woman for whom she worked. An elderly woman who, for the record, was nowhere in sight. “I was in a rush to meet you, Peter!” the date hastily explained. A stunned Cohen bade her farewell. Forever.

Skip to main content Research Events Publications Commentary Store Support About Cato Blog Our Experts Our Centers Facebook Twitter Search form Search this site Commentary Trump’s Import Taxes Could Devastate US Economy By Daniel J. Ikenson This article appeared on The Hill (Online) on January 5, 2017. Give President-elect Trump credit for consistency. In his selections of Wilbur Ross as commerce secretary, Peter Navarro as chairman of the National Trade Council, and Robert Lighthizer as U.S. trade representative, Trump has empowered a protectionist triumvirate to deliver on his provocative campaign promises. Among the various ahistorical ideas under consideration is an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent on all imports. Exactly what the intended purpose of such a tax would be remains unclear — To achieve trade balance by reducing imports? To dissuade U.S. companies from outsourcing? To encourage foreign companies to invest in the United States? To show the world who’s boss? Insanity may be too mild a diagnosis. First of all, as numerous analyses from the Cato Institute have gone into great detail to demonstrate, the U.S. trade deficit is not a problem to fix. It is a reflection of the relative faith that foreigners have in the U.S. economy as a safe and potentially lucrative destination for their savings. Even though some people are confused by the meaning of the trade deficit, in reality it is a benign statistic — a reflection of many things, but absolutely not the success or failure of trade policy. In any event, a 10 percent tariff on imports would certainly have the effect of reducing imports. But, with fewer dollars in foreigners’ pockets and retaliatory measures at hand, U.S. exports would decline as well. The tariff would have a negative impact on overall trade, but no predictable impact on the trade deficit. The tariff would be akin to a 10 percent tax added to the bill at Walmart. Second, the notion that a duty would dissuade U.S. companies, in the aggregate, from investing in production or assembly operations abroad is also absurd. In order to compete both at home and abroad, U.S.-based producers need access to competitively priced inputs. Tariffs raise the cost of production for companies operating within the tariff walls, bestowing relative cost advantages on foreign firms and U.S. operations abroad, while retarding investment in value-added domestic activity. Third, a tariff would, on net, do nothing to encourage foreign companies to invest in the United States. Investment flows to locations with low trade barriers, where the political and business climates are stable, where respect for the rule of law is secure, and where crony capitalism is sufficiently suppressed. Sure, some foreign firms might decide it makes sense, given their cost structures, to produce inside the tariff walls (that induced Honda to build its first U.S. plant in 1982), but, on net, it will drive companies away because the nature of production is global. The proliferation of cross-border investment and transnational supply chains has blurred the distinctions between U.S. and foreign products and has rendered tariffs on imported inputs incompatible with the imperative of wooing, securing and maintaining productive, capital investment in the United States. The factory floor spans oceans and borders and cannot function efficiently with tariff walls between its operations. It turns out that showing the world who’s boss is the most plausible motive behind the 10 percent tariff, but it’s a deeply misinformed motive. The average U.S. tariff currently stands at about 2 percent, so adding to that another 10 percentage points would render many production operation unviable. Maybe Team Trump is unaware that raw materials, intermediate inputs, and capital equipment accounted for half of the $2.2 trillion of U.S goods imports in 2015. Nearly all of that $1.1 trillion of mechanical parts, electronic components, steel, chemicals, minerals, stamping machines, and the like went into production operations at U.S. factories, utilities, construction sites, and mines, supporting millions of U.S. jobs. That $1.1 trillion registers on the income statements of U.S. businesses as a cost of production. A 10 percent tariff would add $110 billion of costs to their books. Well, couldn’t that loss of profit be made up by generating more revenues abroad? Unlikely. In fact, businesses should expect to see their export revenues decline, as foreign governments around the world respond to Trump’s aggression by imposing tariffs of their own. In 2015, U.S. exporters sold $1.5 trillion of goods to foreign buyers. If a 10 percent tariff imposed on U.S. exports reduced U.S. business revenues by, roughly, $150 billion, the combined impact of cost increases and revenue decreases would be a profit reduction of $260 billion for U.S. goods producers. To put that in perspective, in 2015, the U.S. manufacturing sector registered profits of $511 billion. So, without even considering the impact on households, producers alone could expect to see their profits cut in half. Of course, that would lead to lower levels of investment, reduced output, and employment contraction. But the pain wouldn’t stop there. Many of the same people who lose their jobs would see their living costs rise, as the 10 percent tariff would also apply to the $1.1 trillion of imported consumer goods. Tariffs are very regressive taxes — they disproportionately affect people on the lower ends of the income spectrum. Lower income families spend higher proportions of their budgets on goods than on services, and many of those goods are imported — clothing, shoes, food, etc.,. The tariff would be akin to a 10 percent tax added to the bill at Walmart. With little evidence that Congress or respect for the Constitution will impede the new administration’s determination to fix what isn’t broken, the best to hope for is that the economic damage is not cataclysmic, but is painful enough that we as a nation can finally agree to bury the doctrine of protectionist nationalism once and for all.

While the entire country was busy becoming a veritable circus, Oklahoma did not let itself be the odd clown out. From ginormous budget cuts to our golden boy Kevin Durant cutting himself from the Oklahoma City Thunder, 2016 caused Oklahoma citizens buckets of grief. Even parts of our state, including the May Avenue bridge over Northwest Expressway, the Silver Bullet roller-coaster at Frontier City and the very ground under our feet, proceeded to fail — or fall or shake — on us. We also lost a lot of beloved Okies like Leon Russell and Merle Haggard, but not everything in 2016 was horrible. Oklahoma voters decided a constitutional amendment protecting the Ten Commandments monument wasn’t a good idea and bills against certain people don’t really help anyone. We also banded together to support the Black Lives Matter movement and made a huge effort to ditch our lazy, unhealthy reputation by installing a world-class whitewater rafting facility and actually using it. We bought a Ferris wheel on the internet and finally decided to crawl out of Prohibition and modernize our liquor laws, too. Join the crack writing team at Chicken-Fried News as we wave goodbye to the immense dumpster fire that was 2016 and say hello to all the possibility that 2017 holds. Ten Commandments Oklahoma legislators shook their fingers at the Oklahoma Supreme Court, took a line from University of Oklahoma President David Boren (“Let the people vote”) and began drafting plans for the rededication ceremony of the Ten Commandments monument on the Oklahoma State Capitol grounds after passing a resolution pushing the issue to a public vote. The third-to-last state question on the Oklahoma ballot aimed to repeal Oklahoma’s constitutional amendment separating church and state and, consequentially, allow tablets showing “God’s law” on the capitol grounds. In the ballot booth, voters scratched their heads and thought, “What about the possible lawsuits?” or “Would this allow state money to go to private, unregulated schools?” and “Does this mean the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster gets a monster statute?” With lingering questions, voters said no, squashing lawmakers’ plans for a grand rededication ceremony in 2017. Prediction: In typical Oklahoma Legislature fashion, at least one state lawmaker will propose a bill with the underlying goal of moving the Ten Commandments monument back to the Capitol. Bill language could include reclassifying the Ten Commandments as artwork by an influential Oklahoma artist. The Ten Commandments would pay tribute to sundry Okie-tied musicians, Native Americans, athletes, actors, astronauts, pilots, authors, artists, journalists and criminals Belle Starr, Chuck Norris, Rue McClanahan, Garth Brooks, Bill Hader, Sequoyah, Greyson Chance, Brian Bosworth, Joan Crawford, Ralph Ellison, Shannon Lucid, Kathy Lee Gifford, Troy Aikman, Reba McEntire, Wiley Post, Wayne Coyne, Taylor Hanson, S.E. Hinton, Joe Andoe, Walter Cronkite, Johnny Bench, Chester Gould, Will Rogers, Quanah Parker, Steve Largent, Bill Moyers, Phil McGraw, David Duke and Randy Terrill working in tablet arts. Heck, comedian Sam Kinison is buried in Tulsa. We at Chicken-Fried News strongly recommend he be included, too. New gameplan With the addition of whitewater rafting at Riversport Adventures and the OKC National High Performance Center’s status as an Olympic and Paralympic training site for the nation’s rowing athletes, there has never been more activity on the Oklahoma River. Indeed, the sports scene in Oklahoma looks bright. Legendary University of Oklahoma football coach Barry Switzer pulled the wool over the media’s eyes this month when he claimed to be president-elect Donald Trump’s choice for Secretary of Offense, but maybe it’s an idea Gov. Mary Fallin should actually consider. How about Secretary of Playtime and Exercise? Prediction: Chicken-Fried News predicts the coach’s official appointment to Fallin’s cabinet. Maybe if the whole state knew how to run the wishbone offense, it could run its way into some more education funding, or at least a way to protect school sports programs. Gone too soon The Grim Reaper kept busy during 2016. In Oklahoma alone, we lost icons like “Okie from Muskogee” Merle Haggard, Tulsa Sound lightning rod Leon Russell and former Oklahoma! Broadway star Patty Duke. Prediction: Chicken-Fried News hopes against all hope that it does not happen, but if 2016’s appetite for entertainment icons bleeds over into 2017, we fear Tulsa-raised actor Gary Busey might be somewhere high on the list. Busey is, of course,  known for his award-winning title role in The Buddy Holly Story and for smaller but no-less-timeless parts in Lethal Weapon and Point Break. He is also one of only a few celebrities to appear in multiple seasons of president-elect Donald Trump’s reality show The Celebrity Apprentice. Still, if there was any Oklahoma celebrity CFN could grant the gift of immortality, Busey would be high up on the list. Remember, for instance, this summer, when Oklahoma City social media users went nuts as the actor delivered ice cream across OKC for an Uber promotion? Those are the kind of acts of love and quirkiness that live forever. Historic headliners For some college students and relative Norman Music Festival (NMF) newbies, it might seem like NMF is something that has always and will forever exist in downtown Norman. In April, the fest celebrates a decade of free music in the city. Headliners like San Francisco garage rock act Thee Oh Sees and Washington, D.C., rapper and producer Oddisee help ensure Norman Music Festival 10 will be brought in with style. Prediction: Let’s imagine for a moment, however, that there might be some surprise bookings in store for 2017. A One Direction reunion, perhaps? The Eagles with hologram Glenn Frey? An Oklahoma duet with Carrie Underwood and Blake Shelton? No, no and … no. We suggest Jabee rapping over Blake Lusk instrumentation or maybe Lincka in duet with Wink Burcham. Make it happen, NMF. Modern liquor laws 2016 was a great year for lushes in Oklahoma. After decades of backward alcohol laws dating back to the end of Prohibition when the state chose not to ratify the 21st Amendment, voters across the state chose to move beer and liquor laws into the 21st century with the passage of State Question 792. Before that happened, though, the Oklahoma Legislature saw the writing on the wall and passed a few bills themselves. Senate Bill 424 allows craft beer makers in the state to open taprooms and sell full-strength beer to customers directly instead of requiring them to go through distributors. Then they passed Senate Bill 383, crafted by Sens. Stephanie Bice and Clark Jolley, which set in place the statutory regulations that made the state question possible. But let’s give it up for the voters, because they truly made it possible. SQ 792 garnered more than 930,000 yes votes to pass by 65 percent. Cheers! Prediction: The only problem with the new laws, which will put cold beer and wine in grocery, convenience and liquor stores, is that they don’t go into effect until 2018. So 2017 will be the year some thirsty, angry Oklahomans make a fuss at Wal-Mart because they can’t get their cold 6 percent ABV beer for little while longer. Wheeler’s wheel The Byrds sang, “To everything, turn, turn, turn, there is a season, turn, turn, turn, and a time to every purpose under heaven.” For the Santa Monica Pier Ferris wheel, that purpose was to become a part of Oklahoma City’s growing Wheeler District. Bought for $135,000 on eBay, the newly dubbed Wheeler Ferris Wheel, 1701 S. Western Ave., quickly became a staple of the Oklahoma City skyline and a popular destination for residents and tourists alike. It also became the centerpiece of a grand dining event in September when Russ Johnson and Jonathon Stranger staged the epic Le Restaurant Francais of the 1939 World’s Fair event there. Diners were treated to music, cocktails and appetizers at the base of the wheel before taking a ride and being served a four-course meal up in the air. Prediction: After the success of the wheel, Wheeler District developer Blair Humphreys will import the rest of the Santa Monica Pier to Oklahoma City, including a historic carousel, an aquarium and a trapeze school. State of disrepair The last calendar year was not exactly a poster for infrastructure in Oklahoma City. Though repaired at an impressively fast pace, nothing will ever match the feeling of confusion (and perhaps minor bemusement) the city collectively felt after a semi truck collided with and collapsed a portion of the N. May Avenue bridge over Northwest Expressway. City residents might also recall watching in June as rescue workers led eight riders to safety from atop Frontier City’s Silver Bullet roller coaster. All passengers were safely removed within two hours — much to the seeming dismay of international social media users and tabloid news websites, all of which were consumed with the coaster riders and their dramatic rescue by Oklahoma City tactical fire crews as media helicopters circled overhead. Prediction: So what new high-profile case of malfunction does 2017 have in store? The Wheeler Ferris Wheel is an obvious candidate, but Chicken-Fried News believes the amusement ride is too new to pose any potential problem soon. Instead, expect something to go wrong with Devon Energy Center’s tower elevators. Who will be the leg-pumping fireman who has to climb up all those stairs for a rescue? What if the elevators are taken out of commission for a long period of time? Expect some sweat-stained suits exiting the stairway. LGBT rights It wasn’t enough that anti-LGBT Oklahoma lawmakers introduced a record number of hateful bills in 2016. One proposed piece of legislation, which closely resembled North Carolina’s controversial bathroom bill, crept into an amendment to the budget during the last week of session. The 10-10 tied vote killed the bill that required public schools to provide separate bathrooms to students who didn’t want to share with transgender classmates. In the end, nearly 30 anti-LGBT bills were killed, including one promoting conversion therapy and another allowing business owners to refuse services to people who violated their religious beliefs. Prediction: While term limits ended the reign of anti-LGBT Republican Sally Kern, lawmakers like Rep. John Bennett, R-Sallisaw; Sen. Joseph Silk, R-Broken Bow; and Sen. Josh Brecheen, R-Coalgate, continue to serve the state. We could see those three and others attempt revivals on once-killed bills. It might be too soon for Oklahoma, but what about lawmakers proposing nondiscrimination protection bills for the LGBT community? What’s your damage? Oklahoma’s rise in seismic activity has caught the attention of scientists, the media, environmental groups, New York law firms, citizens and, at times, the state government. (Have you checked out the earthquake map at earthquake.ok.gov?) At this point, it’s fact that oil and gas drilling, specifically the rapid injection of fluid during wastewater disposal, caused the hundreds of earthquakes recorded in the Sooner State in recent years. While most Oklahomans can say they felt the tremors, folks in communities like Cushing, Pawnee, Fairview, Medford and Edmond can point to damage in their homes, workplace, houses of worship and communities. Prediction: Judges in Pawnee and Payne counties are reviewing petitions for class action lawsuits from residents who say their homes and businesses suffered major destruction. In the suits, those plaintiffs allege oil and natural gas drillers, through disposal of fracking wastewater, caused the damage. Additionally, two federal judges are tasked with reviewing complaints connected to the manmade quakes. Cases can move at a slow pace in the legal system. Considering Oklahoma is friendly to the oil and gas industry, it’s likely these cases will move glacially. Oklahoma→D.C. President-elect Donald Trump must have liked what he saw when he visited the Oklahoma State Fair in 2015, because he’s bringing some of the Sooner State with him to Washington, D.C. State Attorney General Scott Pruitt has been tapped to run the federal Environmental Protection Agency, presumably so he can tear it down from the inside after years spent attacking it from Oklahoma City. Pruitt famously sued the EPA in 2014 and 2015 over rules the agency instituted to stop the spread of pollutants across state lines and curb coal-fired power plant air pollution and infamously sent a letter to the EPA lambasting the agency over its natural gas drilling pollution estimates, which The New York Times later discovered was essentially copied and pasted from Devon Energy lawyers. Plagiarist! Gov. Mary Fallin won’t be making the trip with Trump’s new administration. After getting snubbed for a vice presidential nod and passed over for a job as secretary of the interior, Fallin seemed destined to remain in Oklahoma for a while longer. Former Oklahoma House Speaker T.W. Shannon also auditioned for a spot in Trump’s cabinet, but he wasn’t announced for any of the positions. Prediction: The Donald still has a few weeks before he takes office, so there could be a few more Oklahomans plucked for plum gigs in D.C. Our bet is that Trump sets his sights on presidential rival Joe “Exotic” Maldonado to run the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Islamophobia We all know that history is destined to repeat itself, so should Oklahomans be surprised that Rep. John Bennett hosted an interim study exploring threats posed by “radical Islam” in the Sooner State? The answer is no. After all, Bennett has made anti-Muslim comments for years. In 2014, the Sallisaw Republican said Islam “is a cancer in our nation that needs to be cut out.” In typical Bennett fashion, the lawmaker demonized the Muslim community during the span of a morning as national media watched. Bennett has vowed to draft legislation to protect Oklahoma from organizations that do harm to the state. In his mind, that includes the Oklahoma chapter of CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations). CAIR’s mission is to “enhance the understanding of Islam, encourage dialogue, protect civil liberties, empower American Muslims and build coalitions that promote justice and mutual understanding.” Prediction: While Bennett hasn’t given many specifics on his plans to protect Oklahoma from perceived religious threats, we imagine he will introduce legislation intended to marginalize Oklahoma’s Muslim community. Could we see a bill to restrict the wearing of Muslim burqas or hijabs or create a Muslim registry? Possibly. Should such legislation be proposed, we imagine calls to action by human rights, civil rights and religious rights groups. Thunder up-and-up In July 2016, Kevin Durant decided he wanted off the Thunder train in a decision that the average Oklahoman might have heard a thing or two about. However, gloom and doom began to fade the next month when Thunder star Russell Westbrook agreed to a multiple-year extension with the team. Since then, Westbrook has racked up triple-double after triple-double at a pace the NBA hasn’t seen for more than 50 years. Logic tells Chicken-Fried News that Westbrook will be hard-pressed to extend his prolific statistics through an entire season, but CFN also knows it doesn’t do much good to apply mere logic to this kind of player. Prediction: This team is finding a way to compete as is, but look out for general manager Sam Presti to recruit more help for his superstar guard sometime this calendar year. The Thunder doesn’t need a Durant replacement, just someone to take some of the load of Westbrook as he focuses on doing what only he can. Budget cuts When will Oklahomans say enough is enough? For the 2014-15 state budget, Oklahoma was short $188 million. The next year, the state saw a budget hole of $611 million. Whew! Then the budget shortfall climbed to $1.3 billion for 2016-17, leading to across-the-board cuts impacting key governmental services. This year, lawmakers face an $868 million budget deficit. Since the solution to budget woes has been cuts and layoffs, it’s tough to argue Oklahoma has a spending problem. In other words, Oklahoma has a revenue problem and the first step toward change is admitting there is a problem. Prediction: Gov. Mary Fallin is driving the conversation on pushing revenue raiser measures through the House and Senate chambers in 2017. The Republican wants to broaden Oklahoma’s sales tax base, which would call for taxing services currently exempt like tattoos, dry cleaning and car washes. Fallin’s calls have fallen on deaf ears in years past. Let’s hope lawmakers hear the shouts of the unhappy public over four-day school weeks, rural hospital closures, long waits for mental health services, concerns over roads and bridges, social workers with swelling case loads and troopers limited on their daily travels. Matisse in His Time Oklahoma City Museum of Art scored quite a coup when it became the only North American venue for an exhibit of Henri Matisse’s works and those of his contemporaries, including Pablo Picasso, André Derain and Georges Braque, called Matisse in His Time. It was a massive hit, selling out tours and bringing an entirely new crowd into the museum. According to NewsOK.com, the museum’s board of trustees chairman Jerome Holmes said more than 62,000 visitors from every state in the U.S. and several foreign nations came to the museum during its four-month stay in Oklahoma. “It is certainly one of the most successful, if not the most successful, exhibits that we’ve had,” he said. Prediction: How can OKCMOA top Matisse in His Time? It might be difficult to get another exclusive show like that to the museum. Instead, using time-travel technology, Oklahoma City will host Matisse in Our Time, snatching the famous French impressionist from a few years before his death in 1954 to paint new pieces for crowds of onlookers. Black Lives Matter This past July, Black Lives Matter OKC rallied thousands of Oklahomans in Bricktown to engage in a peaceful, public conversation on police brutality, racial discrimination and civil rights. Individuals from NAACP’s Oklahoma City branch, OKC Artists for Justice, American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma and a slew of lawmakers passed around the microphone and called for Oklahomans to vote and get active in local government. Never stop speaking out against hate, discrimination and violence. Prediction: Black Lives Matter OKC charted a course for change with its 2016 march. With resources and continued discussion — for example, increasing public knowledge on the justice system, government and the challenges for communities of color — Oklahoma City can move the needle in combating systemic racism in our communities. Standard Oklahoma “Something called ‘the Oklahoma Standard’ became known throughout the world,” said former Gov. Brad Henry. “It means resilience in the face of adversity. It means a strength and compassion that will not be defeated.” People mostly use the phrase to describe the way people in Oklahoma respond to a tragedy by sending money they might not have to help people they probably don’t know. But 2016 was a weird year for the standard, as evidenced by our state’s voting record. On the same night Americans voted in President Donald J. Trump, Oklahomans also chose to deny a raise for teachers (SQ 779) and declare that the death penalty is not “cruel and unusual punishment” (SQ 776). Then again, voters also approved State Questions 780 and 781, lowering some property and drug crimes from felonies to misdemeanors and putting the money saved into rehabilitation programs. Prediction: A tornado will hit some of Oklahoma’s crumbling jails and prisons, rendering the inmates homeless. A compassionate and caring electorate will finally approve new facilities to keep them incarcerated in humane conditions. Sadly, the money will be taken from state education funding.

(Submission Guidelines) Minnesota retailers cited for taking action on chemicals in products; others should follow Email Share Tweet Print By Kathleen Schuler | 01/06/17 REUTERS/Mark Blinch Minnesota retailers Target and Best Buy are developing safer chemical policies to keep harmful chemicals out of the products they sell. Looking ahead to 2017, there’s some good health news for Minnesota consumers. Across our nation big retailers are adopting safer chemical policies as part of their sustainability programs and becoming increasingly important players in the movement to healthier products and safer chemicals, including right here in Minnesota. Kathleen Schuler Retailers are using their considerable clout to address and eliminate chemicals of concern from their supply chains. U.S. consumers are demanding products that are free of hormone disrupting chemicals like phthalates and bisphenol A and chemicals associated with negative impacts on brain development, such as lead, arsenic, cadmium and certain flame retardants. The ubiquitous presence of potentially toxic chemicals in everyday consumer products is subtly impacting our health, resulting in increased risks for cancer, developmental disabilities, obesity and diabetes, as well as asthma. Minnesota retailers Target and Best Buy are developing safer chemical policies to keep harmful chemicals out of the products they sell. According to a recent report, “Who’s Minding the Store? A Report Card on Retailer Actions,” a retailer report card that rates the top U.S. retailers on their policies and actions to address chemicals, Target and Best Buy are among the high scorers. Amazon, Costco and Albertson’s scored lowest, all receiving an “F” grade. However, with an average grade of “D+,” most retailers have long way to go. Target earned a “B,” as did top scorer Walmart. Target deserves credit for its Sustainable Product Index (SPI), a framework it developed to evaluate chemicals used in personal care, baby care and cleaning products. Target has flagged more than 2,000 chemicals of concern for reduction or elimination and also evaluates products based on ingredient transparency, sustainable packaging, and environmental stewardship. This past year it added cosmetics to its policy, along with new criteria for disclosure of fragrance palette ingredients, allergens and nanomaterials, positioning it as a retailer leader in ingredient transparency. In addition, it prominently features healthier and safer products through its “Made to Matter” product lines. While Target has made great progress in addressing chemicals in its products, it could improve its score in the future by setting clear timelines and quantifiable chemical reduction goals and by expanding its policy to include chemically intensive products such as apparel, furniture and electronics. Best Buy received a grade of “C-,” because it is actively developing a safer chemical policy to include a list of chemicals of concern (known as a restricted substance list), as well as a “manufactured restricted substance list” (MRSL) to avoid chemicals used in manufacturing that do not end up in the final product. A MRSL will prevent worker exposures and environmental contamination in the manufacturing process and help drive chemicals of concern out of electronics. Best Buy can continue to make progress by setting goals and benchmarks for elimination of priority chemicals such as toxic flame retardants in its private label televisions and other electronics, as well as putting pressure on brand name electronics to eliminate hazardous chemicals.  While Target and Best Buy are making steady progress on addressing chemicals in consumer products, retailers at the bottom of the pack, Amazon and Costco, should start by developing a written safer chemical policy that sets clear goals and timelines for reducing, eliminating and safely substituting chemicals of high concern and requiring disclosure of chemical ingredient information. As a grandparent, I’m always looking for the safest products possible for my grandkids, so it’s nice to know that Target and Best Buy are prioritizing the health of families across Minnesota and the nation, by taking action on known hazardous chemicals in their products. I encourage them to continue making progress on this critical path to preventing unnecessary chemical exposures.

Kathleen, thank you for shedding light on a commonly silent issue. As a young mother I first learned of these chemicals in our everyday products just over a year ago. As a division I athlete and Duke graduate I was shocked I had never heard of this issue before. I'm now committed to helping others live a toxic free life and applaud your efforts in sharing this information as well. I am not surprised by the ratings as I have asked Costco management multiple times for ingredients in their Kirkland "free & clear" detergent and have yet to receive a response. When we know better, we can do better and then demand better. Keep voting with your wallet and hopefully many other retailers will continue to clean up their products. Our nation is sicker than ever and I have no doubt its due to these environmental factors in our products and food. Thank you!

You had nice winter coats on and were laughing and snapping pictures with a smartphone and so I quickly realized it wasn't your cardboard sign. I wanted to say something but I was scared of what you might do. So I shook my head and kept walking to my car. You've probably put those pictures up on Facebook or Instagram by now. Maybe you even got a couple of likes and shares from your friends. I hope one of them sees this letter and shows it to you. I think you should take the time to take a good, long look at those photos and then look at yourself in the mirror. You probably have not, and will not, know what it's like to have to hold that sign in real life. You probably have not, and will not, know what it would be like to sleep on the streets on a night like tonight. You probably have not, and will not, feel hunger, or suffer from mental health issues or an addiction. I suggest you both take a moment and contemplate what it's like to need to hold up that sign to survive. While I may not have ever been homeless, I have been poor when I was young. I have also volunteered my time working with vulnerable people, more than a few vulnerable people in fact. As such, I feel empathy and respect for vulnerable people. I feel sorry for you.   Melissa Peet Vernon     We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Yes No Life Sciences VC & Funding Startups Mobile & Broadband Employment Analysis Insider Benefits Posted Jan. 6, 2017 at 6:10 a.m. Tech headlines: Online sales soar 11%; T-Mobile goes unlimited; Samsung profits soar; Wal-Mart buys ShoeBuy Published: 2017-01-06 06:10:27 Updated: 2017-01-06 06:10:27 Post a comment Print this blog postE-mail blog post Bulldog By Wire reports Tags: E-commerce, Internet, Telecommunications and Wireless Research Triangle Park, N.C. — In today's Bulldog wrapup of technology news: Online holiday sales rise 11 percent to $91.7 billion T-Mobile says unlimited plans will be only option Samsung's profit jumps 50 percent despite Galaxy fiasco Wal-Mart expands online reach with ShoeBuy acquisition The details: Online holiday sales rise 11 percent to $91.7 billion Online sales during the recently concluded holiday season rose to $91.7 billion, topping 2015's tally by 11 percent. That's according to Adobe, which says over $1 billion in sales were generated on 57 of the 61 days between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31. Mobile sales — those made on smartphones and tablets — rose 23 percent to $28.43 billion. Adobe says it measures 80 percent of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers. Separately, ComScore says its data shows a 12 percent increase in desktop online holiday sales, to $63.1 billion. Cyber Monday — the Monday after Thanksgiving — ranked as the year's heaviest spending day, with desktop buying exceeding $2 billion for the third straight year. T-Mobile says unlimited plans will be only option T-Mobile said unlimited plans will be the only option for new customers even though they are more expensive than some of its old, limited plans. The company had said in August that it was phasing out its otherplans in favor of unlimited. On Thursday, T-Mobile said those limited plans, which executives called a "relic," won't be sold anymore starting Jan. 22. Existing customers can keep their current plans. While some existing customers could switch to the $70-a-month unlimited plan and save money, others would pay more, according to prices on T-Mobile's website. Most customers who just pay for one or two lines or who have a lower-data plan — two gigabytes per line — would save money by sticking to what they have. For example, a family of four getting two gigabytes per line was paying $100 a month; with the unlimited plan, that costs $160. T-Mobile is still trying to lure users who don't use much data by offering them a $10 credit if they use two gigabytes or less per line. A smaller rival, Google's "Project Fi," already credits customers for data they don't use. And T-Mobile's unlimited plan isn't exactly unlimited. If the network is busy, T-Mobile may slow speeds on customers that used more than 28 gigabytes. And video gets degraded to DVD-level quality unless customers pay an extra $15 a month for high-definition video and some other upgrades. The company will still offer cheaper prepaid plans as well, where you pay upfront. Samsung's profit jumps 50 percent despite Galaxy fiasco Samsung Electronics Co. said Friday that its profits in the last quarter of 2016 surged 50 percent to the highest level in more than three years, despite the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Analysts had expected Samsung's profits to surge thanks to its mainstay semiconductor business, but the result surpassed even the most optimistic forecasts. The semiconductor division cashed in on strong demand and a tight supply for microchips during the September-December period, likely contributing to more than half of its quarterly earnings. In its earnings preview, Samsung said it posted 9.2 trillion won ($7.8 billion) in operating profit, up from 6.1 trillion won a year earlier. It was the biggest quarterly income since the third quarter of 2013. Analysts polled by FactSet expected a figure of 8 trillion won. Sales fell 1 percent to 53 trillion won ($44.9 billion). The company did not give net profit or breakdown figures for its businesses, which are due later this month. For the full year, the South Korean tech giant saw a 10 percent gain in its annual income, its best result in three years. Wal-Mart expands online reach with ShoeBuy acquisition Jet.com, the online retailer now owned by Wal-Mart, has acquired the footwear-shopping website ShoeBuy for about $70 million. The deal, announced Thursday, closed Dec. 30. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. says ShoeBuy will continue to operate as a stand-alone website, and ShoeBuy's current executives and employees will still be based in Boston. The move is Wal-Mart's latest push to expand its reach online following last year's acquisition of Jet.com, which it bought for $3 billion plus $300 million in stock.

Murphy USA President and CEO Andrew Clyde said the new location in Louisiana represents another important milestone for the company’s goal of growing its branded network by more than 60 stores in 2016. Murphy USA now has nearly 10,000 employees that serve an estimated 1.6 million customers each day through a network of retail gasoline stations in 26 states, with the majority of the locations near Walmart stores. The El Dorado-based publicly traded concern now ranks 258th among Fortune 500 companies, well ahead of its former parent Murphy Oil Corp. in the 662nd spot. CHEVRON TO SPEND NEARLY $20 BILLION CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN 2017, 15% BELOW YEAR AGO LEVELS Although crude oil and natural gas prices are expected to rise in 2017, U.S. oil giant Chevron Corp. has announced the 2016 capital outlays will still be 15% lower than 2016 and 42% below 2015 levels. Chairman and CEO John Watson said spending for Chevron, which will likely serve as a precursor for other global oil and gas companies, will target shorter-cycle time, high-return investments and major projects under construction. In the company’s fourth straight year of reduced capital spending, 70% of Chevron’s outlays are planned for upstream investment that are expected to generate production within two years. Overall, Chevron plans a $19.8 billion capital and exploratory investment program for 2017, including $4.7 billion of planned affiliate expenditures. In its upstream business, nearly $8.5 billion of planned capital spending relates to base-producing assets, including about $2.5 billion for shale and tight investments mainly in the Permian Basin developments in Texas and New Mexico. Another $7 billion of the planned upstream program is related to major capital projects currently underway, including nearly $2 billion toward the completion of the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects in Australia and $3 billion for projects associated with the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. BAKER HUGHES AND EQUITY GROUPS FORM NEW PURE-PLAY ‘FRACKING’ COMPANY Oilfield giant Baker Hughes Inc., CSL Capital Management and West Street Energy Partners, a fund managed by the Merchant Banking Division of Goldman Sachs, have completed their pending transaction to create the new BJ Services, a pure-play North American land pressure pumping company providing hydraulic fracturing and cementing services.

The new entity, which was first announced on Nov. 29, 2016, does not include Baker Hughes’ international pressure pumping businesses or its Gulf of Mexico offshore pressure pumping operations, which Baker Hughes will continue to operate.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 6, 2017 at 7:41AM Dividend stocks offer current income and growth potential, and the dividend stocks that you'll find among the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) are some of the best-known, highest-quality dividend payers you'll find. Rather than simply buying the entire Dow, however, many dividend investors choose instead to follow a strategy called the Dogs of the Dow. These stocks offer better yields than the Dow as a whole, and often, they've been able to outperform the Dow over the course of the year. Let's take a first look at 2017's Dogs of the Dow to see what you should watch out for over the coming year. The 2017 Dogs of the Dow Stock Dividend Yield Verizon 4.3% Pfizer 3.9% Chevron 3.7% Boeing (NYSE:BA) 3.7% Cisco Systems 3.4% Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) 3.4% IBM 3.4% ExxonMobil 3.3% Caterpillar 3.3% Merck 3.2% Data source: DogsoftheDow.com. 2 new Dogs for 2017 Because of the way that the Dogs of the Dow get picked every year, you can count on seeing some turnover among the 10 stocks that make the cut. However, 2017 is a remarkably stable year for the Dogs, with just two new entrants joining eight carryover picks from 2016. Leaving the Dogs this year are Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble. Interestingly, neither of the two consumer giants had particularly good years, with both stocks underperforming the broader Dow in 2016. However, a combination of factors resulted in their falling to the No. 11 and 12 spots on the Dow yield list. First, the addition of Coca-Cola came from even worse performance from the beverage giant than its consumer goods peers. Coca-Cola saw its share price fall more than 3% during 2016, as ongoing challenges related to its long-struggling carbonated beverage segment continued to weigh on its prospects. The threat of greater regulation and taxation in some areas has hit Coca-Cola, and efforts to find efficiency gains haven't been adequate to give investors the optimism in the company's future prospects to justify share-price gains. Moreover, the recent strength in the U.S. dollar could once again create difficulties for Coca-Cola, given how much it relies on foreign currency for its revenue and profits. The much more unusual move in the Dogs came from Boeing, which saw its yield jump not because of a decline in share price but rather from a huge raise that the aerospace giant made late in the year. Boeing boosted its quarterly payout in December by 30%, making its quarterly payout $1.42 per share. That helped send its yield up by more than a full percentage point compared to where it started 2016, despite Boeing's solid share-price increase of 8% for the year. The move shows how much confidence Boeing has in its recent success, despite some concerns among investors that the volume of new orders in the future might begin to slow from its breakneck pace of recent years. Image source: Getty Images. Can the Dogs of the Dow beat the market in 2017? You can't count on the Dogs of the Dow always beating the entire Dow, but it has had a recent string of good outcomes. For 2016, the strategy led to a rise of about 16%, topping the 13% gain in the overall Dow. Moreover, the Dogs paid higher dividends that gave the strategy another percentage point of outperformance compared to the overall Dow. That good result brought the Dogs of the Dow's track record to six wins in seven years. The strategy didn't manage to match the Dow in 2012, and in 2014, it took the added returns from dividends for the Dogs to pull ahead. A small win in 2015 also didn't bring much outperformance, but better performance in 2010, 2011, and 2013 has many investors convinced that the Dogs of the Dow are back for good. Yet when you go back 20 years, the win-loss record is much closer to .500 than investors would like to see. The main reason to follow the Dogs of the Dow is that it's a simple way to get performance that's roughly in line with the Dow. Some years will be winners and others losers, but if you want a conservative dividend strategy that emphasizes blue-chip stocks, it's hard to beat the Dogs of the Dow.

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. THE GLOBE AND MAIL ** The crushing Alberta recession has wiped out more than C$4 billion ($3.02 billion) in value of downtown Calgary office properties, city assessors warned Thursday, with some suburban office landlords and retailers expected to see higher tax bills as a result. tgam.ca/2iiUbvC ** Penn West Petroleum Ltd said on Thursday it plans to spend C$180 million ($135.78 million) on operations this year, up from its previous estimate of C$150 million ($113.15 million), with the largest chunk earmarked for its Alberta Cardium operations. tgam.ca/2ij5kMM ** International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland portrayed Canada on Thursday as a global bulwark against populism and protectionism. While other countries build walls, Canada is opening its doors to trade and immigration, she said. tgam.ca/2iiYQ0w NATIONAL POST ** Walmart and Visa have ended an acrimonious and public battle over fees that saw the retail giant refuse to accept Visa credit cards in its northern Ontario and Manitoba stores. In a brief statement Thursday afternoon, Walmart said it would allow customers in those regions to once again use Visa cards beginning Friday. bit.ly/2ij1inX ** A new report suggests that Canada would benefit from higher capacity of so-called "partial upgrading" technology, a process that would help oilsands players fetch a higher price for their product and ease longstanding pipeline woes. bit.ly/2iiZ1Jo ** Growing U.S. production of tight oil and shale gas, combined with flat U.S. oil demand, is bad news for Canada, which will have no alternative export market until it builds new oil pipelines to the coasts and liquefied natural gas plants, and even faces new competition from U.S. imports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's 2017 energy outlook. bit.ly/2ij2vvo ($1 = C$1.33) (Compiled by Shalini Nagarajan in Bengaluru) Next In Market News BRIEF-Times Property Holdings updates on proposed issue of senior notes * Proposes to conduct an international offering of guaranteed U.S. Dollar denominated senior fixed rate notes BRIEF-Andersons says plans to exit retail business * To exit retail business and close its remaining four retail stores in q2 of 2017 UPDATE 1-Trump's offer to Putin: an end to sanctions for nuclear arms cut -London Times * He says Brexit will be "a great thing" (Recasts, adds quotes, details) MORE FROM REUTERS Sponsored Content From Around the Web Promoted by Taboola Trending Stories Photos of the week Photos of the week Sponsored Topics X Follow Reuters: Follow Us On Twitter Follow Us On Facebook Follow Us On RSS Follow Us On Instagram Follow Us On YouTube Follow Us On LinkedIn Subscribe: Feeds | Newsletters | Podcasts | Apps Reuters News Agency | Brand Attribution Guidelines Reuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters.

Located in the company’s home town, Seattle, Amazon Go looks every bit like a 7-Eleven, selling bread, milk, and cheese as well as pre-made snacks and fresh meals, except there are no cashiers or checkout lines. You walk in, pick up what you want, and walk right out. All purchases are charged automatically. It is one-click ordering, brick-and-mortar style. The “just walk out” shopping is indeed backed by some real technologies. An Amazon patent filed in 2014 reveals just how shoppers are tracked and items counted via the extensive camera system – much like the driverless cars made by Tesla or Google that are capable of navigating busy streets. Combined with embedded sensors, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, the Amazon Go system is so nuanced that it can distinguish between two people reaching for the same item based on individual skin tones. But it is exactly the sophistication of such a system that makes many observers squirm. “We are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. No office job is safe,” declares Sebastian Thrun, an artificial intelligence professor at Stanford known for his work on self-driving cars. Already, machines are used to predict how we click, buy, or lie; companies have automated how they send mail, make calls, offer discounts, recommend products, show advertisements, inspect for flaws, and approve loans. When IBM Watson beat former champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter on the game show Jeopardy! in February 2011, Jennings, who came in second, reflected, “Just as factory jobs were eliminated in the 20th century by new assembly line robots, Brad and I were the first knowledge-industry workers put out of work by the new generation of ‘thinking’ machines.” As in all cases of displacement, however, it is the poorest and lowest of the population who are most unfairly vulnerable. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, cashiers remain the second-largest occupation, with 3.5 million employed in the United States. What Amazon Go is attempting may set a precedent for Walmart and Best Buy to follow in years to come. This is why big tech companies must now go beyond their founding motto of “Move fast and break things.” To do no evil would require them to take into account the full implications of their own creations. After all, the chieftain of Silicon Valley, Apple, has already pointed out an alternate future in which retailing can be run profitably with real people in the age of smart machines. Apple’s retail stores – with their airy interiors, winding staircases, and sharp-framed modern furniture – are known as a mecca for its fan base. Apple stores routinely top the list of highest earners per square foot. In 2012, Tiffany (US$3,000 per square foot) came in a distant second after Apple (US$6,000 per square foot). With more than 30,000 staff members working at the retail branch network, a top Apple sales person can move as much as US$3 million worth of merchandise per year. “These are sales rates for a consulting company,” said Horace Dediu, an analyst who has blogged about the calculation for Asymco. Yet Apple employees’ salaries are not driven by commission. Employees are offered healthcare insurance and stock options, benefits that would seem unthinkable at a time when Walmart is sticking to minimum wage. Evidence of cutting-edge retailing experience is everywhere in Apple stores, from their use of roving credit-card swipers to their petting-zoo layouts, which encourage customers to test drive products. But none have taken human staffers out of the scene. In fact, the dramatic makeover Apple is about to undergo is meant precisely to play up its human dimension. “We are reinventing the role our stores and employees play in the community,” retail chief Angela Ahrendts explains. “We want to be more like a town square, like a gathering place.” Apple employees do display a fair dose of real empathy. One employee reportedly saw a woman in tears, obviously upset at having dropped her phone in the water earlier. It wasn’t that her phone couldn’t be replaced under warranty; it was that she had lost the last voice message from her son, who had died in a car accident. His final words, “I love you, Mom,” now had to be saved. What the employee working at the genius bar did next was truly ingenious. He carefully took out the motherboard and transplanted it into another phone, then retrieved the voicemail and saved it as an audio file so as to avoid losing it in the future. Imagine the level of customer loyalty this single employee was able to generate. Intentionally or not, staff members are empowered to be helpful, disregarding the cost incurred as a result. Much as Japanese companies did during the quality movement two decades ago, Apple expects every employee to contribute his or her own thinking to resolve issues at hand. What this all means, of course, is that the role of sales is fast changing. Companies can either treat their employees as substitutable commodities, paying them minimum wage and getting rid of them the moment automation becomes possible, or see employees as real human beings with the potential to add more value than any automation could. Last year, Wegmans, the century-old family-owned grocery chain, was named the best supermarket in America by a survey conducted by Fortune. It also ranked fourth in 2016 Best Companies to Work, trending only behind Google and the Boston Consulting Group. Wegmans’s secret? “Its focus on employee training to ensure customers have the best experience has been a winning strategy that creates superfans eager for a new location to open near their home,” Market Force Information writes. It turns out whether to unleash human potential or to automate every single job is in fact a managerial choice. There is no clear evidence to suggest any definitive advantage of one over the other. And that tension might well be the biggest consideration for all business executives in 2017.

According to the United States Department of Justice, a Springfield born 56years old American woman, Lisa Kaye Barwick-Majeski was lured into becoming their ring leader and recruiter in America. United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, announced that a Lisa was sentenced in federal court few days ago for leading a Nigerian fraud scheme in which thousands of victims across the country were tricked into cashing up to $3 million in counterfeit money orders and cashier’s checks. Lisa was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Roseann Ketchmark to 12 years in federal prison without parole. The court also ordered Barwick-Majeski to pay $49,131 in restitution to her victims and a money judgment to the government of $1,485,301, representing the proceeds of the conspiracy. Barwick-Majeski was taken into custody immediately at the conclusion of today’s hearing to begin serving her sentence. On March 10, 2015, Barwick-Majeski pleaded guilty to participating in a conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Barwick-Majeski admitted that she was the primary leader of a conspiracy that involved counterfeit postal money orders, counterfeit bank cashier’s checks and numerous wires to unindicted co-conspirators in the country of Nigeria Criminal Minds Method of Operation US Department of Justice detailed these criminal gangs mode of operation: “Barwick-Majeski and her co-conspirators dispatched counterfeit postal money orders and bogus cashier checks to thousands of victims throughout the United States. These false money orders and cashier checks were deposited in victims’ bank accounts after the victims were duped into believing they were paid participants as part of a ‘secret shopper’ exercise designed for them to evaluate Wal-Mart and various money wire outlets. The victims were instructed to keep approximately $200 or more of the less than $2,000 counterfeited postal money order or bogus cashier’s check, and immediately wire the remaining money to Barwick-Majeski and her co-conspirators. After a few days, the counterfeited money order or bogus cashier’s check would be returned against the victims’ account as not negotiable. The victims would then be obligated to pay their banks or their financial institutions for most of the money they wired to Barwick-Majeski and others. Barwick-Majeski and her co-conspirators shared most of their proceeds with a group of Nigerians that were responsible for supplying Barwick-Majeski with fraudulent postal money orders and cashier’s checks. PRESS STATEMENT SPRINGFIELD, Mo. – Tammy Dickinson, United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri, announced that a St. Robert, Mo., woman was sentenced in federal court today for leading a Nigerian fraud scheme in which thousands of victims across the country were tricked into cashing up to $3 million in counterfeit money orders and cashier’s checks. Lisa Kaye Barwick-Majeski, 56, of St. Robert, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Roseann Ketchmark to 12 years in federal prison without parole. The court also ordered Barwick-Majeski to pay $49,131 in restitution to her victims and a money judgment to the government of $1,485,301, representing the proceeds of the conspiracy. Barwick-Majeski was taken into custody immediately at the conclusion of today’s hearing to begin serving her sentence. On March 10, 2015, Barwick-Majeski pleaded guilty to participating in a conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Barwick-Majeski admitted that she was the primary leader of a conspiracy that involved counterfeit postal money orders, counterfeit bank cashier’s checks and numerous wires to unindicted co-conspirators in the country of Nigeria. Barwick-Majeski and her co-conspirators dispatched counterfeit postal money orders and bogus cashier checks to thousands of victims throughout the United States. These false money orders and cashier checks were deposited in victims’ bank accounts after the victims were duped into believing they were paid participants as part of a “secret shopper” exercise designed for them to evaluate Wal-Mart and various money wire outlets. The victims were instructed to keep approximately $200 or more of the less than $2,000 counterfeited postal money order or bogus cashier’s check, and immediately wire the remaining money to Barwick-Majeski and her co-conspirators. After a few days, the counterfeited money order or bogus cashier’s check would be returned against the victims’ account as not negotiable. The victims would then be obligated to pay their banks or their financial institutions for most of the money they wired to Barwick-Majeski and others. Barwick-Majeski and her co-conspirators shared most of their proceeds with a group of Nigerians that were responsible for supplying Barwick-Majeski with fraudulent postal money orders and cashier’s checks. During the course of the investigation, according to court documents, law enforcement officers seized more than $1.7 million worth of counterfeit postal money orders. Some of those counterfeit money orders were taken directly from Barwick-Majeski and some were seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection or intercepted en route to Barwick-Majeski. In addition to the counterfeit postal money orders, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant at Barwick-Majeski’s residence on Nov. 5, 2013, and seized a parcel that contained 354 counterfeit BMO-Harris Bank cashier’s checks with a total face value of more than $1 million. According to court documents, law enforcement officers also seized $406,800 in counterfeit Mid Missouri Credit Union cashier’s checks during the investigation. Co-defendants Nancy Madelen Peebles, 76 (Barwick-Majeski’s mother), Cheryl Barber, 42, and Terry L. Shupe, 40, (who lived together), and Kenneth Fred Ruhl, 88, all of St. Robert, have also pleaded guilty to their roles in the conspiracy and been sentenced. Peebles was sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison; Barber was sentenced to time served; Ruhl and Shupe were each sentenced to five years of probation. Peebles was ordered to pay $28,571 in restitution. Barber was ordered to pay $25,129 in restitution. Ruhl was ordered to pay $16,814 in restitution. Shupe was ordered to pay $2,796 in restitution. This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Abram McGull, II. It was investigated by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the St. Robert, Mo., Police Department. http://politicsngr.com/nigerian-fraudsters-cloned-american-banks-cashier-checks-pilfer-3million-counterfeit-money-orders/ 2 Likes Re: How Nigerian Fraudsters Cloned American Banks’ Cashier Checks, Pilfer $3million by dokiOloye(m): 4:14am On Jan 06 Since it's card fraud,d award goes to d west side.

Wait. That might make me unpopular in church. Still, it might be worth it. News stories sent in by readers indicate that Destiny has run out of believable plot lines and has fallen back on extreme stereotypes. I can predict the end of every tale readers send me. Example: After a child-custody deal recently, a little boy was set to be handed from one grandma to another. In most places, that would be straightforward -- but this took place in America, in the state of Texas, no less. You can guess what's coming. Both grandmothers carried loaded weapons as they entered the chosen transfer site, a Walmart parking lot. Both shooting. Police got involved, the area was sealed off, blood was spilled, violent grannies had to be subdued, hundreds of people were inconvenienced and a global nuclear war started. Well, maybe the last thing didn't happen, but everything else did. "America can no longer be parodied, as it is already a ridiculous version of itself," said Marie Kan, who sent me the link. True, Marie. The same is true of China. That country's reputation for bureaucratic obtuseness reached a new pinnacle. A reader from that country, in which fingerprints are often used instead of signatures, sent me a tale about a man with no arms who tried to get a bank loan. You can guess the rest. "We'll need your fingerprints," said bank officials. "I have no arms," said Wu Jianping, 25, of Henan province. "Refusing to cooperate, huh? The deal's off," said bankers. The same thing happened at every bank he tried. I wonder what the bankers would say if you put a decapitated corpse in front of them? "So, you refuse to talk, or even stay upright in the seat? The deal's off, Mr Headless Corpse." Even in placid, drama-free places like Canada, irrationality is the new norm. Officials in Toronto recently decided to discuss the importance of making facilities accessible for wheelchairs -- and you guessed it -- they chose a venue only reachable by stairs. Perhaps the saddest recent tale in this regard was that of Shoga Takeda, a Japanese man of 24 who wanted to get his life together. He applied for a job. Halfway through the interview, the boss left the room for a moment, and Shogo stole his wallet. And following the dumb criminal stereotype, he left behind his application form, complete with his name, address and numerous ways to contact him. My colleague has a theory that Destiny has upped the weirdness quotient of real life so as to combat all that fake news circulating these days. "That couldn't happen in real life," we will say to each other as we scan the clickbait headlines. "It's not weird enough." Meanwhile, if any female reader will draw one eyebrow higher than the other on her face and kindly report back to me on the general effect, I will be grateful. But just don't try to get a bank loan in China. "So, you're sceptical about everything, applicant? The deal's off." (Nury Vittachi is an Asia-based frequent traveller.
