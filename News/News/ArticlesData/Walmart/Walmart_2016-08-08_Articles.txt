During checkout, the customer can select a time to pick up their order. Personal shoppers then select the requested produce, meats and other grocery items on the customer’s shopping list. Customers arriving at a pickup locations go to parking spaces marked in orange, then call a designated number to alert an associate, who then retrieves the prepared order and loads it into the customer’s vehicle. Walmart launched its online grocery pickup service Tuesday at four Cincinnati area stores, including one in Butler County. Walmart’s Online Grocery allows customers to order groceries online and pick them up at select Walmart stores without having to leave their vehicles. The free service is now available at 8288 Cincinnati Dayton Road in West Chester Twp. It’s also available at: 5303 Bowen Drive in Deerfield Twp.; 4370 Eastgate Square Drive in Cincinnati; and 201 Chamber Drive in Milford. Walmart’s grocery pickup service features 30,000 items, including fresh meat, dairy and produce, according to the company. All items are priced at the same prices found in local Walmart stores, company officials said. The minimum order total required for the service is $30, according to Walmart’s customer service division. “At Walmart, we have always been known for saving our customers money and, with services like grocery pickup, we are also saving them valuable time,” Scott Valentine, store manager of the West Chester Walmart Supercenter, said in a statement. “Our customers have told us that grocery pick up is a game changer. They are now able to complete their grocery shopping in a matter of minutes — between errands or on their way home from an after school activity – without even unbuckling their seat belts.” Last summer, Kroger made its online shopping service, called ClickList, available to customers of its Kroger Marketplace store in Liberty Twp. The location, at 7300 Yankee Road, was the first of Kroger’s 2,640 supermarkets nationwide to test online ordering. Kroger charges $4.95 for an online order, but the fee is waived for the first three orders. Other local Kroger stores that now offer ClickList include West Chester Twp., Mason, Sharonville and Lebanon locations.

On the recording you can hear, “We have a shoplifter at Walmart 1098 Frederick Blvd.” It happened on April 22, 2015 at around 7 o’clock in the morning. A loss prevention officer inside the Walmart called 911 to report a shoplifter then gave a description. The person said, “He is located in the shoe department, Black male with a grey hoodie, black scarf, multi-colored sweatpants, black hat…. Male is consuming clothing, he is moving towards the front near the general merchandise exit.” He calls 911 back and says the person is leaving the store. Dispatcher: Do you see the officer? Walmart employee: “Nah, I’m looking for him. I don’t see the officer nowhere...Oh, I see him.” Dispatcher: “Just show him where the guy is.” We know from court testimony Officer Rankin talked with the loss prevention officer who pointed out Chapman in the parking lot. Rankin is heard saying, “I’ll be out with that suspect.” We know from court testimony that Rankin approached Chapman. There was a confrontation. Rankin pulls out his Taser and attempts to use it on Chapman, but he said Chapman knocked it out of his hand and it went flying 20 feet away. The Taser video turns off for 15 seconds – and there was a struggle. Rankin then open fires on Chapman. On the 911 recording you can hear, “Shots fired, one down near the IHOP, Frederick Blvd.” The Taser turns back on after the shooting. You can hear Rankin saying don’t die on me man as Chapman lies on the ground. You hear, “I’m by the main entrance to the IHOP right across from the Rally’s.  He is unresponsive….  Have medics stage by the Wells Fargo so they can be close…I’m not getting a pulse, start CPR.” Chapman was shot in the face and chest. “I’m doing CPR.  Start setting up a crime scene as soon as you can so you can get medics in here,” heard on the recording. The unarmed 18 year-old died at the scene. Rankin was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and the jury recommended 2.5 years. Tuesday we also got newly released video from court security video. You see a friend of the Chapman family speaking to a juror in the hallway of the courthouse. When this happened on day 6 of the trial, the defense made a motion for a mistrial, but the judge denied it. The next day the defense came back and said they had video of encounter and asked for it to be entered in as evidence. The judge also denied that request. The defense said they will use this courthouse security video in their efforts for an appeal. Rankin will be formally sentenced on October 12. Defense attorney said they can’t file an appeal until after the formal sentencing. Meanwhile, the attorney for the Chapman family said they plan to file their civil lawsuit against the city of Portsmouth, Rankin, and the former police chief in the next few weeks.   Filed in: News Topics: Stephen Rankin, William Chapman Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Team 3 Professionals Visit them today!

Press & Sun Bulletin 5:16 p.m. EDT August 9, 2016 Johnson City police responded to the Wal-Mart store on Gannett Drive Tuesday afternoon. (Photo: ANTHONY BORRELLI) BINGHAMTON, N.Y. — Police say a man who slashed his own throat inside a New York Walmart store first tried goading an officer into shooting him before he was subdued Tuesday afternoon. The incident occurred around 2:30 p.m. at the Walmart on Gannett Drive in Johnson City northwest of Binghamton and forced an evacuation of the store's employees and customers for about a half-hour. Officers responded to a call about a man in the produce section who was threatening to slit his own throat, Johnson City Police Chief Brent Dodge said. When confronted by a police officer, the 40-year-old man kept saying, "Shoot me," Dodge said, and then started to cut his arms and wrists with a razor knife he was brandishing. "He's moving around while he's doing all this," Dodge said of the man, "and the officer deployed pepper spray to subdue the guy, but that was ineffective." Once the man cut his own neck, Dodge said, a second officer deployed a Taser and was able to take the man into custody while preventing further blood loss. Shoppers who were inside the store at the time of the incident were evacuated after Walmart staff pulled a fire alarm to empty the building. Binghamton resident Diane Chapman, who waited in the parking lot with several other shoppers, said Walmart employees emptied the store in an orderly fashion. "We all appreciated that," she said. Crime scene tape blocked the entrance to the store while police investigated the incident. The 40-year-old man, whose identity was not released Tuesday, was taken to UHS Wilson Medical Center in Johnson City and police said he is expected to survive. The man is not expected to face criminal charges and Dodge said the case is being treated as a mental health arrest. Dodge also credited responding police officers for using their training in deploying less-lethal options in order to take the man into custody safely. No customers or store employees were injured during the incident.

Eternal, which sources naturally alkaline spring water from New York’s Allegheny Mountains, Tennessee’s Smoky Mountains and the Shasta-Trinity Alps of California, announced the news last week. Co-founder and CEO Karim Mashouf, who launched the brand in 2008, called the new distribution “a significant step forward for our brand to reach a larger number of customers.” In a call with BevNET Mashouf called Walmart the brand’s “first mass-market customer.” He also revealed the company will service the world’s largest retailer directly, rather than going through a distributor. Despite its alkaline properties Mashouf has been quick to distance Eternal Water from other prominent players in the emerging alkaline water space, instead likening his brand more towards premium imported natural spring and mineral water brands, almost like a domestic Fiji or Evian. It’s that pure and pristine source, Mashouf said, that’s been the brand’s primary value proposition, whereas “artificially enhanced” waters in the space, derived from municipal sources, have had to rely on their alkalinity. “Our sources happen to be naturally alkaline and we call that out, we don’t have to lean on that,” Mashouf added. “All the other ‘alkaline waters’ have to draw attention to their alkalinity because what they really are at the end of the day is just filtered tap water.” Even with the current hype around the alkaline water category, Mashouf said its source will continue to be its premium proposition, and will be what continues the brand’s growth and push into retailers. “In today’s world every category in consumer packaged goods is moving towards better-for-you, healthier, organic, natural products,” Mashouf added. “People are going to wake up and say they don’t want artificially enhanced water.” The company’s press release can be found below: (Walnut Creek, CA – August 1, 2016) – -Eternal Water, the third largest premium sourced bottled water company in the United States, has announced a distribution deal with Walmart across 23 states. Through this partnership, Eternal Water will now be available in almost 1600 stores, offering their 1L bottle. The premium, naturally alkaline water company kicked off this partnership early July. “Adding Walmart as a major distributor for our water is a significant step forward for our brand to reach a larger number of customers,” said Karim Mashouf, Founder and CEO of Eternal Water. “In less than 6 years we have grown to be the third largest premium sourced bottled water company in the country by being the first to offer alkaline water in the category. The difference is that our water is naturally alkaline, meaning that the pH is in a basic state ranging from 7.8 – 8.2. Walmart has an incredible reputation as the world’s largest retailer, and is increasingly investing in the all-natural food and beverage trend. We are excited to be a part of their journey towards offering more pure products to consumers.” In a world where most bottled water is municipally sourced and artificially enhanced, Eternal Water is 100% All-Natural with nothing added nor removed, allowing them to not require an ingredient label. “It’s absurd to me that most waters have an ingredient label on them. Water shouldn’t have any ingredients or be artificially enhanced,” said Mashouf. “We didn’t make our water, we discovered it!” Eternal Water comes from the most pure and pristine natural water sources in the USA. They are nationally distributed across major retailers in America. About Eternal Water Eternal Water is the #3 Premium Sourced Bottled Water in the USA and one of the fastest growing premium waters in the category. Eternal has swept this category in the last few years boasting 86% incremental sales and over 60% repeat purchase rates, generating one of the most loyal customer bases in bottled water. Eternal Water has national distribution and can be found in the country’s largest retailers across all channels. Learn more about their products and benefits at http://www.eternalwater.com.

On a dollar-for-dollar basis, it's easy to understand why: Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, compared to Amazon's $107 billion. But if Walmart buys Jet.com, which it's reportedly considering, it could become Amazon's worst nightmare. Here's why: 1. Walmart has a massive customer base The retailer is far behind Amazon in terms of online sales, but overall, the picture looks much different. Walmart's revenue in 2015 was $482 billion, which is more than four times Amazon's revenue last year. All that revenue for Walmart represents untapped potential for online sales from customers who are currently shopping at Walmart's physical stores. Richard Feloni 2. Walmart has a massive network of stores that can serve as distribution centers for products sold online Walmart has more than 4.500 stores in the US and 102 distribution facilities. By comparison, Amazon has roughly 180 fulfillment centers in the US. For Walmart, "This combination of a massive brick-and-mortar footprint with [an] emerging ecommerce player would put both companies in a better position for battle," said Stephan Schambach, who founded e-commerce companies NewStore and Demandware. He said he's skeptical however that Walmart will ever overtake Amazon in online sales. "I still don’t think they’ll be able to beat out Amazon, but it will be interesting to watch them try," he said. Neil Saunders, CEO of retail consulting firm Conlumino, is more bullish on Walmart's potential. "We have always said that this is a major advantage for Walmart over a player like Amazon in that Walmart can distribute products far more cheaply and quickly, if it finds a way to fully integrate stores into its systems," Saunders wrote in a note to clients. 3. What Walmart lacks in e-commerce logistics, Jet.com can offer Jet.com is growing rapidly and stealing some customers from Amazon by offering cheaper prices than the e-commerce giant. It's only a year old and it has already generated more than $1 billion in sales from more than 4 million shoppers, according to Euromonitor. According to Slice Intelligence, another industry-data firm, Jet's sales in July 2016 have grown 168% relative to August 2015. Wal-Mart’s online sales, meanwhile, have grown only 30% Jet.com is also quickly mastering fast and free shipping. Richard FeloniWhile Walmart only recently began offering two-day delivery to members of its ShippingPass program — which is meant to rival Amazon Prime — Jet.com has figured out how to achieve one-day delivery for half of US households free of cost, according to Euromonitor International. "Wal-Mart will gain significantly from Jet’s logistics and delivery expertise," Michelle Malison, retail analyst for Euromonitor. "By strategically locating its distribution centers and streamlining its logistics, Jet has doubled its one-day delivery (of its own first-party products) penetration rate from 25% to 50% of US households since launch, and is approaching 99% of US households for two-day delivery. In select high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often is able to offer same-day delivery at no additional cost to both Jet and its shoppers." Walmart's ShippingPass costs $49 a year, compared with the $99 for Amazon Prime. Meanwhile Jet.com's two-day shipping is free for all orders of at least $35. Without ShippingPass, Walmart customers have the option to choose between "rush" one-day shipping, which can cost at least $14 an item, or "expedited," "standard," and "value" options, which take two to seven days and cost about $5 to $8. Walmart offers free pickup at stores.

Then the startup sold to Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart bought Jet.com in a $3.3 billion deal, making the shares Eric Martin won last year worth somewhere between an estimated $10 million and $20 million.  (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / AFP/Getty Images File Photo)   By Gerrit De VynckBloomberg Tues., Aug. 9, 2016 Working at a startup that gets acquired can feel like winning the lottery. Not working at a startup, but still cashing in on its acquisition, can feel pretty good too, as Eric Martin learned when Jet.com sold to Wal-Mart Stores in a $3.3 billion (U.S.) deal. Martin, who works for a custom bath installation company, received 100,000 Jet shares last year when he won a contest to see who could get the most people to sign up for memberships to the online shopping site. He spent $18,000 (U.S.) on online ads and came away with a stake now worth millions in one of 2015’s buzziest startups. “It feels good; it feels really good,” Martin, of York, Pennsylvania, said in a phone interview during his lunch break. “The way, I think, to describe it is ‘occasional hysterical laughing.’” Martin, 30, has no idea what his stake is worth, though Fusion reported last year that his shares may be valued from $10 million to $20 million. The cash-and-stock sale to Wal-Mart could have boosted that since Jet’s private valuation was pegged at around $1.5 billion last November, but the company has also raised money since Martin won his shares. That could have reduced the value of his stake because startups sometimes give preferential shares to later-term investors that can squeeze out smaller investors or employees. Martin, who works in digital marketing, said he’s still waiting for Jet to tell him how much his stake is worth, but he’s hoping it’s in the “multi-millions.” Article Continued Below Wal-Mart’s purchase gives the world’s largest retailer a way to boost its online offering and better compete with Amazon.com. Jet’s founder, Marc Lore, worked at Amazon for about two years after selling his previous company to the e-commerce behemoth. He founded Jet as a members-only online retailer, aiming to cut prices below even what Amazon could offer. He’s raised more than $500 million in venture capital. While he waits to find out exactly how rich he is, Martin is thinking about his own startup, Ideadash.com, an online portal that lets people post their ideas for inventions or businesses and get others to execute them while retaining a stake in the project. “I’m weighing my options,” he said. “I’ve got to take time to process all this.” Correction – August 10, 2016: This article was edited from a previous version to update an incorrect photo caption that misstated Eric Martin’s surname.

 The US military is basically Walmart now Rosa Brooks, Foreign Policy Aug. 10, 2016, 9:46 AM 7,044 facebook linkedin twitter email print An aerial view of the Pentagon in Washington Thomson Reuters When my mother came for lunch at the Pentagon, I shepherded her through the visitor’s entrance, maneuvered her onto the escalator, and had just ushered her past the chocolate shop when she stopped short. I stopped too, letting an army of crisply uniformed officers and shirt-sleeved civilians flow past us down the corridor. Taking in the Pentagon’s florist shop, the banks, the nail salon, ­and the food court, my mother finally looked back at me. “So the heart of American military power is a shopping mall?” She wasn’t far off. By the time I started working at the Defense Department in the early years of the Obama administration, the Pentagon’s 17.5 miles of corridors had sprouted dozens of shops and restaurants catering to the building’s 23,000 employees. And, over time, the U.S. military has itself come to offer a similar one-stop shopping experience to the nation’s top policymakers. At the Pentagon, you can buy a pair of new running shoes or order the Navy to search for Somali pirates. You can grab some Tylenol at CVS or send a team of Army medics to fight malaria in Chad. You can buy yourself a new cell phone or task the National Security Agency with monitoring a terrorist suspect’s text messages. You can purchase a small chocolate fighter jet or order up drone strikes in Yemen. You name it, the Pentagon supplies it. As retired Army Lt. Gen. Dave Barno once put it to me, the relentlessly expanding U.S. military has become “a Super Walmart with everything under one roof” — and two successive presidential administrations have been eager consumers. But the military’s transformation into the world’s biggest one-stop shopping outfit is no cause for celebration. On the contrary, it’s at once the product and the driver of seismic changes in how we think about war, with consequent challenges both to our laws and to the military itself. Here’s the vicious circle in which we’ve trapped ourselves: As we face novel security threats from novel quarters — emanating from nonstate terrorist networks, from cyberspace, and from the impact of poverty, genocide, or political repression, for instance — we’ve gotten into the habit of viewing every new threat through the lens of “war,” thus asking our military to take on an ever-expanding range of nontraditional tasks. But viewing more and more threats as “war” brings more and more spheres of human activity into the ambit of the law of war, with its greater tolerance of secrecy, violence, and coercion — and its reduced protections for basic rights. U.S. soldiers of 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team disembark from a U.S. military helicopter CH-47 as they take part in the annual "Balikatan" (shoulder-to-shoulder) war games with Filipino soldiers at a military camp, Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija in northern Philippines April 20, 2015. Erik De Castro/REUTERS Meanwhile, asking the military to take on more and more new tasks requires higher military budgets, forcing us to look for savings elsewhere, so we freeze or cut spending on civilian diplomacy and development programs. As budget cuts cripple civilian agencies, their capabilities dwindle, and we look to the military to pick up the slack, further expanding its role. “If your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” The old adage applies here as well. If your only functioning government institution is the military, everything looks like a war, and “war rules” appear to apply everywhere, displacing peacetime laws and norms. When everything looks like war, everything looks like a military mission, displacing civilian institutions and undermining their credibility while overloading the military. More is at stake than most of us realize. Recall Shakespeare’s Henry V: In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility: But when the blast of war blows in our ears, Then imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, Disguise fair nature with hard-favour’d rage …   In war, we expect warriors to act in ways that would be immoral and illegal in peacetime. But when the boundaries around war and the military expand and blur, we lose our ability to determine which actions should be praised and which should be condemned. Soldiers of Company C, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, work as a six member team to lift a heavy log over their heads 20 times while competing in the Ivy Heptathlon during Iron Horse Week, Jan. 28, 2015. Teams executed seven events in accordance with Army Regulation 7-22 in the fastest time possible. (U.S. Army photo) Flickr/ The US Army For precisely this reason, humans have sought throughout history to draw sharp lines between war and peace — and between the role of the warrior and the role of the civilian. Until less than a century ago, for instance, most Western societies maintained that wars should be formally declared, take place upon clearly delineated battlefields, and be fought by uniformed soldiers operating within specialized, hierarchical military organizations. In different societies and earlier times, humans developed other rituals to delineate war’s boundaries, from war drums and war sorcery to war paint and complex initiation rites for warriors. Like a thousand other human tribes before us, we modern Americans also engage in elaborate rituals to distinguish between warriors and civilians: Our soldiers shear off their hair, display special symbols on their chests, engage in carefully choreographed drill ceremonies, and name their weapons for fearsome spirits and totem animals (the Hornet, the Black Hawk, the Reaper). And despite the changes ushered in by the 9/11 attacks, most of us view war as a distinct and separate sphere, one that shouldn’t intrude into our everyday world of offices, shopping malls, schools, and soccer games. Likewise, we relegate war to the military, a distinct social institution that we simultaneously lionize and ignore. War, we like to think, is an easily recognizable exception to the normal state of affairs and the military an institution that can be easily, if tautologically, defined by its specialized, war-related functions. But in a world rife with transnational terrorist networks, cyberwarriors, and disruptive nonstate actors, this is no longer true. Our traditional categories — war and peace, military and civilian — are becoming almost useless. In a cyberwar or a war on terrorism, there can be no boundaries in time or space: We can’t point to the battlefield on a map or articulate circumstances in which such a war might end. We’re no longer sure what counts as a weapon, either: A hijacked passenger plane? A line of computer code? We can’t even define the enemy: Though the United States has been dropping bombs in Syria for almost two years, for instance, no one seems sure if our enemy is a terrorist organization, an insurgent group, a loose-knit collection of individuals, a Russian or Iranian proxy army, or perhaps just chaos itself. A pair of U.S. Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles fly over northern Iraq Thomson Reuters We’ve also lost any coherent basis for distinguishing between combatants and civilians: Is a Chinese hacker a combatant? What about a financier for Somalia’s al-Shabab, or a Pakistani teen who shares extremist propaganda on Facebook, or a Russian engineer paid by the Islamic State to maintain captured Syrian oil fields? When there’s a war, the law of war applies, and states and their agents have great latitude in using lethal force and other forms of coercion. Peacetime law is the opposite, emphasizing individual rights, due process, and accountability. When we lose the ability to draw clear, consistent distinctions between war and not-war, we lose any principled basis for making the most vital decisions a democracy can make: Which matters, if any, should be beyond the scope of judicial review? When can a government have “secret laws”? When can the state monitor its citizens’ phone calls and email? Who can be imprisoned and with what degree, if any, of due process? Where, when, and against whom can lethal force be used? Should we consider U.S. drone strikes in Yemen or Libya the lawful wartime targeting of enemy combatants or nothing more than simple murder? When we heedlessly expand what we label “war,” we also lose our ability to make sound decisions about which tasks we should assign to the military and which should be left to civilians. Today, American military personnel operate in nearly every country on Earth — and do nearly every job on the planet. They launch raids and agricultural reform projects, plan airstrikes and small-business development initiatives, train parliamentarians and produce TV soap operas. They patrol for pirates, vaccinate cows, monitor global email communications, and design programs to prevent human trafficking. Many years ago, when I was in law school, I applied for a management consulting job at McKinsey & Co. Employees at Walmart. David McNew/Getty Images During one of the interviews, I was given a hypothetical business scenario: “Imagine you run a small family-owned general store. Business is good, but one day you learn that Walmart is about to open a store a block away. What do you do?” “Roll over and die,” I said immediately. The interviewer’s pursed lips suggested that this was the wrong answer, and no doubt a plucky mom-and-pop operation wouldn’t go down without a fight: They’d look for a niche, appeal to neighborhood sentiment, or maybe get artisanal and start serving hand-roasted chicory soy lattes. But we all know the odds would be against them: When Walmart shows up, the writing is on the wall. Like Walmart, today’s military can marshal vast resources and exploit economies of scale in ways impossible for small mom-and-pop operations. And like Walmart, the tempting one-stop-shopping convenience it offers has a devastating effect on smaller, more traditional enterprises — in this case, the State Department and other U.S. civilian foreign-policy agencies, which are steadily shrinking into irrelevance in our ever-more militarized world. The Pentagon isn’t as good at promoting agricultural or economic reform as the State Department or the U.S. Agency for International Development — but unlike our civilian government agencies, the Pentagon has millions of employees willing to work insane hours in terrible conditions, and it’s open 24/7. It’s fashionable to despise Walmart — for its cheap, tawdry goods, for its sheer vastness and mindless ubiquity, and for the human pain we suspect lies at the heart of the enterprise. Most of the time, we prefer not to see it and use zoning laws to exile its big-box stores to the commercial hinterlands away from the center of town. But as much as we resent Walmart, most of us would be hard-pressed to live without it. As the U.S. military struggles to define its role and mission, it evokes similarly contradictory emotions in the civilian population. Civilian government officials want a military that costs less but provides more, a military that stays deferentially out of strategy discussions but remains eternally available to ride to the rescue. We want a military that will prosecute our ever-expanding wars but never ask us to face the difficult moral and legal questions created by the eroding boundaries between war and peace. We want a military that can solve every global problem but is content to remain safely quarantined on isolated bases, separated from the rest of us by barbed wire fences, anachronistic rituals, and acres of cultural misunderstanding. Indeed, even as the boundaries around war have blurred and the military’s activities have expanded, the U.S. military itself — as a human institution — has grown more and more sharply delineated from the broader society it is charged with protecting, leaving fewer and fewer civilians with the knowledge or confidence to raise questions about how we define war or how the military operates. Soldiers with the Japan Ground Self Defense and US Marines and sailors carry combat rubber raiding crafts ashore during boat operations as part of the Japan Observer Exchange Program at Kin Blue beach here, July 16. The soldiers are with JGSDF’s Western Army and the Marines and sailors are with Company L, Battalion Landing Team 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. The JGSDF soldiers have been observing L Co. for approximately six weeks. JOEP enables the JGSDF observation and education of small unit concepts, tactics, and amphibious operations to further enhance the interoperability of the two forces and security of the region. Cpl. Henry Antenor/US Marine Corps It’s not too late to change all this. No divine power proclaimed that calling something “war” should free us from the constraints of morality or common sense or that only certain tasks should be the proper province of those wearing uniforms. We came up with the concepts, definitions, laws, and institutions that now trap and confound us — and they’re no more eternal than the rituals and categories used by any of the human tribes that have gone before us. We don’t have to accept a world full of boundary-less wars that can never end, in which the military has lost any coherent sense of purpose or limits. If the moral and legal ambiguity of U.S.-targeted killings bothers us, or we worry about government secrecy or indefinite detention, we can mandate new checks and balances that transcend the traditional distinctions between war and peace. If we don’t like the simultaneous isolation and Walmartization of our military, we can change the way we recruit, train, deploy, and treat those who serve, change the way we define the military’s role, and reinvigorate our civilian foreign-policy institutions. After all, few generals actually want to preside over the military’s remorseless Walmartization: They too fear that, in the end, the nation’s over-reliance on an expanding military risks destroying not only the civilian competition but the military itself. They worry that the armed services, under constant pressure to be all things to all people, could eventually find themselves able to offer little of enduring value to anyone. Ultimately, they fear that the U.S. military could come to resemble a Walmart on the day after a Black Friday sale: stripped almost bare by a society both greedy for what it can provide and resentful of its dominance, with nothing left behind but demoralized employees and some shoddy mass-produced items strewn haphazardly around the aisles.

Walmart parking lot USA Today Network Ashley May , USA TODAY 3:32 p.m. EDT August 9, 2016 Police found a meth lab on the property of a Walmart in Amherst, N.Y. this week. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) Police found more than low prices at an Amherst, N.Y., Walmart this week. They found a meth lab inside of a drainage pipe in the parking lot. The pipe, wide enough for a 6-foot-tall person to walk through, leading to the meth lab runs underground near the Walmart parking lot exit on Sheridan Drive. Amherst Police “stumbled upon it,” Detective Lieutenant JoAnn DiNoto said. Inside, they found a makeshift table of wood propped on top of a tire, along with soda bottles filled with solvents used to make meth. USA TODAY Mayor of rich D.C. suburb charged in 'meth-for-sex' scheme “There was no danger to the community or Walmart shoppers or contaminating water source,” DiNoto said. Police don’t know how long the underground operation was thriving. Officials are reviewing Walmart surveillance footage to determine suspects. Anyone who has tips, can call the Amherst Police Department in New York at 716-689-1392. DiNoto could not comment on what police were investigating prior to the discovery.

The New York State Police Contaminated Crime Scene Emergency Response Team arrived on the scene Monday afternoon dressed in hazmat suits. A spray can, chemicals and liquid thought to be methamphetamine were found, yet officials stated there was no threat of flammability or air contamination, according to NBC 4. Captain Scott Chamberlin relayed to NBC 4 that the police had not received a tip. Rather, they were conducting a routine patrol of the area. “That’s what we do every day,” Chamberlin told the news outlet. “We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good.” According to the Buffalo News, it was difficult to tell how long the lab had been in use. Chamberlin also spoke to the news outlet: “It happens all over the country, all over the state,” Chamberlin said of meth labs. “Is it out of the ordinary for Amherst? Has it happened here before? Yes.” Related Stories Meth Lab Discovered In Walmart Breaking Not So Bad According to police, the culvert was said to be tall enough to stand inside of and was not secured. Officials are working to secure the area so that it can no longer be accessed by the public. The New York Daily News reported no arrests had been made and officers were reviewing the Walmart surveillance tapes. Methamphetamines can be easily manufactured from every day products like cold medicine and cleaning chemicals. Meth production can cause “fires, explosions, injuries and environmental contamination,” according to the CDC. In a report that examined data from 1,325 meth-related chemical incidents reported by five states (Louisiana, Utah, Oregon, Wisconsin and New York) between 2001 and 2012, the CDC reported that “Seven percent of meth-related chemical incidents resulted in injuries to 162 persons, mostly members of the general public (97 persons, including 26 children) and law enforcement officials (42).” Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Go figure. One scenario starred an impatient dog left in a parked car while its master went shopping. Well, doggie apparently felt enough is enough, and proceeded to honk the horn. Incessantly. Far more shocking is what transpired in a West Virginia Wal-Mart parking lot. Two frisky car-prisoners managed to shift into neutral! The car slowly rolled until bumping into the Wal-Mart building. What could have been disastrous thankfully ended without harm to bodies or buildings. Even the car was fine. Hopefully, though, dog owners will now think twice about leaving their best friends in hot, parked cars. Although the Wal-Mart canines lacked driving skill, last year a pint-sized Chihuahua was filmed taking a toddler for a spin in a kiddie convertible. Incredibly, the dog successfully maneuvered the 5 mph mini-vehicle for a full minute until it gently bumped into a curb. In 2012, a New Zealand animal shelter executed a publicity stunt to encourage the adoption of three dogs. They taught the dogs Drivers’ Ed. Seriously. And each successfully drove a real car — including ignition, gears, pedals, and steering wheel — and one even managed a hairpin turn! Two of the three were adopted in short order. A far more eye-opening fact about dogs, though, recently surfaced in the Daf Yomi, Bava Kamma 60b: “When dogs cry, it means the malach hamaves has come to town. When dogs play, it means Eliyahu Hanavi has come to town.” Somehow, dogs sense things that are out of our realm. But why dogs? As lovable as they may be, they’re often regarded as lowly creatures (as in the insult, “you dog!”).[1] Deepening the mystery, both “Eliyahu” and “kelev” have a gematria of 52; and Kaleiv ben Yefuneh’s name is spelled with the same kaf, lamed and veis as kelev! “U’lchol Bnei Yisrael lo yecheratz kelev leshono.” At the moment of makkas bechoros — the final clincher of freedom[2] — there is an emphasis that no dog so much as barked at any Jew or Jewish-owned animal. Dogs symbolized Jewish redemption. Why? The only two individuals excluded from the non-entry decree were Yehoshua bin Nun and Kaleiv ben Yefuneh, “ki milu Acharai.” The test of the Meraglim was not easy. Kaleiv went to Me’aras Hamachpelah and davened to not be swayed. He faithfully persevered despite witnessing the terrifyingly titanic inhabitants. That quality of faithfulness is the positive aspect of dogs. Their appellation “man’s best friend” is deserved. Dogs are fiercely loyal to their masters, often despite severe maltreatment. A faithful messenger completes his mission, no matter what. Eliyahu Hanavi is tasked by Hashem to herald the Geulah[3] and despite the passage of many, many long years, he will faithfully fulfill his mission — just as he was the quintessence of loyalty in his unflagging battle against Achav and Izevel’s pernicious promotion of baal peor.[4] And like the first geulah from Mitzrayim, dogs — with their trait of tenacious loyalty — will manifest that expression of redemption when Eliyahu eventually comes. During ikvesa d’Meshicha, “the face of the generation will be as the face of the dog.” Brazenness — the lowly, negative side of dogs — will abound. At face value, it’s a harsh-toned statement decrying Klal Yisrael’s lowliness upon the advent of Moshiach. However, it also contains a strong chord of consolation. In Mitzrayim — at the 49th level of tumah — we were not in good shape. Nonetheless, Hashem looked past all the filth to the pure, inner core of His beloved children, and helped them bring out their great potential. Although entrenched in idolatrous Egyptian practices, Bnei Yisrael remained loyal to their core identity. Halevai, Moshiach should come immediately. If c”v he does not, though, and we’ll have to sit on the floor bemoaning our past tragedies and current squalid state — innumerable crises and heartrending tragedies — we cannot overlook our core loyalty to our Father in Heaven. Yes, like the dog, we have serious flaws and failings and are soiled with caked-on layers of tumah. But, when push comes to shove, the Jewish People remains forever loyal to their Master. Hashem will not be put off by our less-than-attractive exterior. Looking past our face, Hashem will focus on our inner, faithful core and help actualize our great potential. May we imminently merit to see Eliyahu Hanavi fulfill his age-old mission, heralding the arrival of Moshiach Tzidkeinu. [1].

Till now, both the companies were at the same level, having opened 21 stores each. By 2020, METRO plans to set up 50 stores, whereas Walmart plans to have 70. While both are bullish on India, French retailing group Carrefour, which had a cash-and-carry business, left India after it found difficult to do business here. METRO claims higher revenues and better operational metrics than Walmart’s cash-and-carry business in India though these claims could not be independently verified. METRO is also working on a pilot in Jaipur to offer delivery to its registered customers, and plans to roll out the same across its stores, but it will charge for delivery, depending on the weight and the value of the goods ordered, said Arvind Mediratta, managing director & chief executive officer, METRO Cash & Carry India. Last year, Walmart India had kicked off online sales from all its stores. METRO has no plans to offer online sales, said Mediratta. Cash-and-carry stores are allowed to sell to business customers like traders and resellers, hotels, restaurants, caterers, companies and self-employed people. Mediratta joined METRO in February this year, after working for nine years in Walmart — he headed Walmart’s cash-and-carry business in India before moving to the US to work for Walmart’s retail business. His brief is to accelerate METRO’s growth in India and make its operations profitable. Metro has been in India for a decade but continues to post losses. In FY15, it reported a net loss of Rs 110.7 crore, Rs 142 crore loss a year ago. Net sales were Rs 3,974 crore, against Rs 3,440 crore a year ago. But METRO hopes to be profitable soon. It recently identified India along with Russia, China and Turkey as its key focus markets. “You need certain scale (20-30 stores) to be profitable and we will soon get there,” said Mediratta. METRO has been focusing on improving its operations by cutting costs and driving efficiencies and discipline.

Amherst police Capt. Scott Chamberlain told the news station officers often "look into areas where people could be up to no good." The culvert ran from a nearby street down under the Walmart parking lot. Police told WIVB the culvert was tall enough to stand in and not secured, meaning anyone could walk into it. Members of the New York State Police Contaminated Crime Scene Emergency Response Team donned full hazmat suits before they were lowered beneath the parking lot through a manhole. They found spray paint cans, various chemicals and "a liquid we believe is methamphetamine," Chamberlain told WIVB.   Parking lot of Sheridan Dr. Walmart in #Amherst.

"It's not so much the chemicals themselves, it's the way they're mixed and how they're handled," he told the news station. "Once (officers) went in there and saw what they needed to see, it's determined it wasn't a hazard." Authorities have not determined how long the culvert was used or who was using it. "This isn't the kind of thing you'd expect in a place like this, that's the bottom line," resident Steve Harding told WIVB.

Square Blossoms Water Authority West Rock Trails Westville Renaissance Westville Synagogue What Now New Haven Workforce Alliance Yale Events YMCA Youth Continuum Under Chief, Abusive Behavior Unpunished by Paul Bass | Aug 9, 2016 12:30 pm (12) Comments | Commenting has been closed | E-mail the Author Posted to: Legal Writes, True Vote In Chief Dean Esserman’s police department, unchecked bullying has run downhill. Consider the case of Patricia Helliger. Like Esserman, Helliger, currently a police captain, has an extensive history of alleged rudeness, disrespect and bullying toward members of the public and lower-ranking cops alike. Like Esserman, she has escaped from those incidents with wrist-slaps at the most at a time when activists nationwide are calling for more accountability for police misconduct. Amid these complaints, Helliger won promotion to a top departmental post. Now Esserman is struggling to keep his job as chief. He’s in the midst of a three-week forced paid leave in which he has been ordered to show he can gain control of his temper and vaguely described “personal problems” and regain the confidence of a deeply skeptical public and a force in open revolt. Meanwhile, he faces complaints like a new human rights complaint by an 18-year office staffer in the chief’s suite that Esserman repeatedly “bullied” and demeaned her and other women, reduced her to tears and “shaking” by yelling at her when she didn’t immediately hear an order to dial a phone number for him, and created a “reign of terror” in the office. (Sixteen witnesses signed on to that statement.) One key question has emerged: Given Esserman’s record of abusing his cops and the public, can he credibly discipline cops who do the same if he returns to 1 Union Ave.? He has repeatedly avoided disciplining Patricia Helliger, based on a review of her internal affairs and personnel files in response to a state Freedom of Information Act request. An internal investigation found she confronted a citizen who dared to take her picture in a Walmart parking lot, slapped the phone out of his hand in contravention of a department general order on First Amendment rights, then lied about it when questioned by officers. One investigator suggested having her arrested. Instead, Chief Esserman — who at the time escaped from serious punishment for berating an elderly Yale Bowl usher and threatening to shut down a football game because he wasn’t allowed in for free — decided not to punish her. The police union president told Esserman that Helliger had just had a “bad day,” echoing the phrase Esserman himself used to seek to explain the Yale Bowl encounter. An attorney for a Latino immigrant complained that Helliger refused to certify routine paperwork needed to apply for a visa for an abused child, while insulting the mother’s command of English and complaining about immigrants allegedly taking advantage of a visa program. It turns out other immigrant families — whom Helliger allegedly suggested were liars — were also stalled in obtaining the paperwork. Instead of disciplining Helliger, police brass transferred the duties to another official. When Helliger allegedly “abus[ed] her authority as a friend” of a woman involved in a custody dispute, she escaped punishment. The head of internal affairs lodged a complaint about Helliger’s alleged “pattern of both verbal and physical aggression with both her staff (sworn and civilian) and the public,” including yelling incidents that interfered with staff work. “[T]hese incidents have been documented and reported yet nothing has been done to address it,” wrote the complainant, Lt. Racheal Cain. She filed that complaint last November. Officials claim an open “investigation” into the matter continues. Meanwhile, Helliger was promoted to captain. She did receive a one-day suspension once, for failing to respond one evening in 2012 to a scene where a cop shot a dog that was attacking a police canine. Helliger was the B squad shift commander. An internal investigation found that Helliger violated a general order requiring the supervisor on duty to respond to scenes where cops discharged weapons. Helliger wrote in a memo to Chief Esserman that she “should have responded to the scene…. I see that this incident certainly appears that I or the other supervisors are uncaring toward the welfare of the troops but for this supervisor and shift commander that is far from the truth.” Helliger has defended her actions in past controversies and claimed that she was subjected to unfair treatment by the chief. In fact, she’s suing him and the city for allegedly limiting her opportunities at the police department. The suit (read it here) also accuses police brass of not taking action against racist acts by white cops directed at Helliger, an African-American woman. One department member, for instance, called her “Mrs. Butterworth” in a Facebook posting. (Read her complaint here.) The discrimination Helliger reported she has faced in-house, along with visible support she has received from African-American alders, raised the political stakes of any action Esserman might have taken against her. However, he has also failed to take action against other officers who have violated the spirit or text of rules protecting citizens’ First Amendment rights. Helliger did not respond to requests for comment for this story. She had a lot to say internally when her fellow cops concluded she abused a member of the public, violated a general order, then fabricated her story in a dispute over a parking space. Attention Walmart Parkers The dispute occurred around 7 p.m. on Oct. 2, 2014, outside the Walmart on Route 80. Off-duty at the time, Helliger, then a lieutenant, was driving her department cruiser. She pulled into the Walmart parking lot. Chad and Bianca Grant, a brother and sister, were loading purchases into their car at the time. They each had a daughter with them. Their shopping cart occupied part of the space next to their car’s space. Helliger started to pull into that space. According to the Grants, Helliger asked them to move the cart, and they agreed. Here’s Bianca Grant’s version of what happened, according to a summary in the ensuing internal investigation’s file: Lt. Helliger then began to inch her car into the space. Again, they told her that they were packing up the car and asked her why she was inching up the car? She was going to hit the cart with her car if she continued to pull into the space. Lt. Helliger then identified herself as a police officer and said that when she asked them to do something, she expected them to do it. They told her that does not give her the right to inch into the space when they are trying to pack up the car. Again, Lt. Helliger said that she was a police officer, and she expected them to do what she asked. An argument ensued where all the parties involved cursed at each other. Lt. Helliger finished parking and left to go into the store. Bianca’s brother then said that he was going to take a picture of Lt. Helliger’s license plate because, if she is an officer, he wanted to call the cops and tell them what kind of officer she is. As her brother took a picture of her license plate, Lt. Helliger left the store and walked towards them. She said, “You can take a picture of whatever the hell you want.” As she approached him closely, he turned around, with his feet planted firmly on the ground, and tried to take a picture of her face. She said the camera was less than a foot from Lt. Helliger’s face. Lt. Helliger then slapped his phone out of his hands and pushed him away. Her brother raised his hand to block her, and then Ms. Grant stepped between them and pushed Lt. Helliger twice. She repeatedly said, “Do not touch my fucking brother.” Lt. Helliger raised her hands in a defensive posture and shouted back that they were not allowed to touch her. Ms. Grant said she was protecting her brother and although Lt. Helliger claimed to be an officer, she was not acting like one. Bianca said Lt. Helliger acted ridiculous and not as someone in authority should. Lt. Helliger returned to her car and called for back-up. They did not try to block or prevent Lt. Helliger from entering her car. They then left the parking space and saw officers stop another vehicle. Her brother rolled down his window and told the officers that they were probably looking for him. He was then handcuffed and placed in the back of a cruiser. One of the daughters and Chad Grant offered similar accounts to a police investigator the same story. The file includes this passage from the summary of the interview with Chad Grant: “As he turned around to take a picture of her, she slapped the phone out of his hand. The phone was around 2-3 feet from her face. He doesn’t remember whether he pushed back. He did not take a fighting stance or raise his hands with clenched fists (which is consistent with the video surveillance footage). His sister then got in her face and pushed the Lieutenant away.” Helliger called for back-up. Several officers arrived. One directed traffic. Another interviewed witnesses. An officer handcuffed Chad Grant, who insisted that “he did nothing wrong and that the video would show this. He said the Lieutenant came at him aggressively and tried to swat at him.” Helliger told the officers that she had returned to her car because she had forgotten something. She said that “the male tried to take a picture of her. She asked him not to and reached towards him to stop him. She said that he pushed her, and a female also came at her,” according to a report by Officer David Parker. Helliger told her side to several officers, including Sgt. Rose Turney. According to the file, Helliger said she had “opened her window and asked the male subject if he could move the carts.” He then asked why. She identified herself as a police officer and said she needed to get into the store quickly. He took offense to the comment and said, “Fuck the police. You think you can do whatever you want.” She ignored the comments, because she wanted to avoid a confrontation. She was eventually able to park her car. She got out and entered the store. Once in the store, she remembered items she forgot in the car. She returned towards the car to retrieve those items. The male individual was at the back of her car taking pictures with his cell phone. As she approached the car, he turned towards her and started to take pictures right up in her face. She became uncomfortable and unsure whether he was going to assault her. She pushed him back with two hands. His cell phone fell to the ground, and he took up a fighting stance with clenched fists. She believed he wanted to fight her. The females exited the car and confronted her. They yelled at her, and she put up her hands in a surrender type fashion. They continued to make comments about why she wanted to fight their brother. She continued to say she didn’t want anymore problems and then was able to get back in her car. She radioed the dispatcher with a description of what had happened. The other subjects saw her on the radio, continued to put their groceries away and then left quickly. Lt. Helliger never mentioned that she was assaulted or injured and Sgt. Turney observed no visible injuries. Four officers ended up reviewing surveillance video footage inside Walmart. Sgt. Turney was among them. In a subsequent internal affairs interview, Turney called “Lt. Helliger’s statement inconsistent from what she viewed in the video. The male subject did not walk up on her and put himself in her face to take a picture. He only slightly turned his body as if he heard something being said behind him. She then hit his hand holding the cell phone. Sgt. [Jason] Minardi asked Sgt. Turney based on this video, [whether] she would consider Lt. Helliger the aggressor in this incident, and Sgt. Turney responded, ‘Yes.’” Officer David Totino also reviewed the footage. He later told an internal affairs investigator that the video bore out Chad Grant’s version, not Helliger’s: “Lt. Helliger left Walmart and directly approached the male who is at the back of her car and either pushed or swatted at him. He then dropped an item on the ground and leaned over to pick it up. Officer Totino said the Lieutenant made ‘a bee line’ towards the male subject and did not see the male subject approach her. ...  He said from what he observed in the video, the male subject was not aggressive at all.” “The video clearly showed her swatting at him. He then bends down and may be picking up his phone. The two females then get out of his vehicle, and they have breach,” another officer present, Jason Bandy, later told an investigator. In a subsequent interview with internal affairs, Helliger reported that three days after the incident, she discovered that her right arm had a bruise. She concluded that she had been injured during the Walmart confrontation. She repeated that the Grants were the aggressors, not she. No Charges, No Discipline Sgt. Rose Dell conducted the internal affairs investigation. After reviewing all the interviews and the video, Dell concluded that Helliger had misrepresented her actions and violated department rules: In her taped statement, Lieutenant Helliger said she did not approach the male subject but passed by him in order to return to her vehicle. When she passed him, he placed his cell phone in her face. This statement is inconsistent with what is viewed in the video surveillance footage. Lieutenant Helliger left the store and briskly walked directly up to the male subject. His back was turned to her as she approached. As he turned towards her, he lifted the phone, and she slapped the phone from his hands. Lieutenant Helliger violated General Order 311, Citizen’s Right to Video: It is the policy of the New Haven Department of Police Service to permit video recording of police activity as long as such recording does not interfere with ongoing police activity or jeopardize the safety of the general public or the police. Lieutenant Helliger also violated Rule 15, Subsection 42: No employee of the Department shall engage in any act which would constitute conduct unbecoming an officer. Lieutenant Helliger is required as a police officer to treat all members of the public with respect and courtesy and create a positive impression when interacting with members of the public. During her first encounter with the Grants, she identified herself as a police officer. General Order 311 presented a particular challenge for the chief. His officers have repeatedly violated citizens’ rights to record them in public, in some cases arresting them for doing so. Earlier in 2014, the city paid two citizens $31,500 for violating their rights in those cases. As part of that settlement, the cops promised to train officers better in the general order. But Chief Esserman decided not to discipline Helliger for violating the General Order (which has since been rewritten to make it more enforceable), or for any of her actions in the Walmart incident. When asked by the Independent, he declined to say why. Then-police union President Lou Cavaliere Jr., who attended the meeting with Esserman and Helliger about possible discipline, said the chief decided to call the incident a “misunderstanding,” given that Helliger’s account differed from those of other officers. Helliger argued that the police should have arrested the woman for allegedly assaulting her. Cavaliere said he advised Helliger to “apologize and say you ‘had a bad day,’” since Esserman had just done that for his behavior at the Yale Bowl football game. Two days after he cleared Helliger, Esserman escaped discipline with that explanation, beyond receiving a reprimand warning him not to repeat his actions. Here is the full text of Sgt. Dell’s 22-page internal affairs report, including the full text of Helliger’s statement and those of officers and witnesses who contradicted her. It ends with a memo recounting that she raised the question of referring the incident to the state’s attorney’s office for criminal prosecution. According to the memo, then-Assistant Chief Al Vazquez said not to. Meanwhile, under Esserman, violations of citizens’ free speech rights have continued to go unpunished in the department — such as in the arrests of an immigrant-rights activist outside Goodfellas restaurant on State Street and of a woman video-recording an arrest outside the Beverage Boss on Whalley Avenue. Esserman either stayed mum or supported the actions of officers in those cases. He never publicly questioned the arrests. A new report by a mayoral commission recommends that the police department “provide comprehensive training in First Amendment and protest rights” to officers and “consider writing a new [general order] regarding citizens’ right to free speech, assembly, and protest that outlines expectations of civilians and police in these situations.” Immigrants Dubbed “Liars” The Walmart incident was hardly the first or last time Esserman learned of, and let pass, alleged bullying and rudeness by Helliger. Consider what happened to an immigrant mom whose 10-year-old daughter was sexually assaulted. With the help of an attorney, beginning in February 2015, the mom tried to get a routine form signed by then-Lt. Helliger. At the time, as head of the records division, Helliger was the authorized official who needed to sign off on a form citizens need to file for U-Visas (I-918 supplement form B). The mom’s child was eligible for a visa as long as the form got signed showing the family had cooperated with police in the investigation. In the first two months, the mom spoke with Helliger around ten times, she claimed. At one point, Helliger allegedly told her, “Look, there are lot of cases that happen here and there are a lot that lie.” After that Helliger would not respond to repeated calls asking to pick up a signed form, according to a civilian complaint the mom later filed against Helliger, charging “rudeness and neglect of duty.” The attorney eventually got the form back. It was signed, but not fully filled out. By that time the Clifford Beers Clinic had assigned a family advocate to try to help the mom get help with the police department. The advocate, Genesis Polanco, went to 1 Union Ave. on July 22 to ask to speak with Helliger. According to a subsequent police internal affairs report, Helliger “refused to speak with them and she stated ‘I don’t understand why there is so many people involved with this case, I’ve already spoken to the lawyer and there is no need for me to speak with you.’ Polanco explained that they wanted Lt. Helliger to come downstairs to get a copy of the form that needs to be completed. Lt. Helliger refused to come downstairs and asked for the form to be left at the front desk.” On Aug. 5, according to the report, Polanco received a promise that the mom would receive the signed form once Helliger returned from vacation. Helliger was allegedly back at work on Aug. 7. The mom showed up at 1 Union Ave. “[S]he tried to speak with Helliger on August 2015. Lt. Helliger refused to come downstairs and told her that if she didn’t know how to speak English properly to get an interpreter and that there was no need for her to speak with” the mom, according to the internal affairs report. The mom’s attorney told her it would take only 15 minutes to fill out the report. But she had only six months since the incident to obtain one and still have her daughter qualify for the visa. That time was running out. According to the internal affairs report, Assistant Chief Campbell met with the mom’s attorney: “Chief Campbell told [the] Attorney that the New Haven Police Department has not received the proper training with handling juvenile U-Visa requests. He stated he is currently seeking training for the Department on this matter. Chief Campbell stated he advised Lt. Helliger to not sign the forms and that he would take care of it.” The matter was eventually “resolved,” according to the report, which was written by Sgt. Jason Weted. (In order to protect the identities of the mother and the child involved in the U-Visa case, we are not publishing the internal affairs report.) It turned out that other immigrants were complaining of similar problems getting U-Visa forms signed by Helliger. At a “white shirt” (command staff) meeting, Helliger reported that “she was ‘overwhelmed’ and that a lot of the U-Visa applicants are just trying to use it as a way to circumvent the process,” according to a written account by Lt. Racheal Cain of internal affairs. So Campbell and Esserman convened a meeting on Oct. 15 with top cops and community domestic violence and immigrant rights advocates.  As a result of the meeting, the department transferred responsibility for handling U-Visa forms to Helliger’s then-deputy in records, Lt. Darcia Siclari. New rules would guarantee applicants a response within 60 days and written explanations of any denials. In a Dec. 8 memo, Campbell reported that all the U-Visa complainants “were more than satisfied with these changes.” The memo made it clear that Helliger was not “disciplined” for her conduct in these cases. “Lieutenant Patricia Helliger was removed from the U-Visa program, not as a discipline, but as a means relieving her of the responsibility of the U-Visa program, which clearly requires an enormous amount of focus and time,” Campbell wrote. “The amount of time that the program required was clearly interfering with the other primary responsibilities that Lieutenant Helliger has as the O.I.C. [Officer In Charge of] Records.” Helliger no longer oversees the records division, where she instituted a program to cut the backlog of unserved warrants. Asked what her current assignment is, Acting Chief Anthony Campbell said Esserman made her “Deputy of Administration. Currently she oversees the animal shelter, the garage, property room ... Her primary assignment right now is getting our fleet management system up to date, tracking department vehicles, getting the animal shelter into the 21st century and ensuring that staffing levels are brought up to speed. Additionally she is working with the unions at the animal shelter to get staffing levels improved.” (In the past, Helliger, , an immigrant from St. Martin, has run a program introducing immigrant police officers to New Haven schoolchildren. Read about that here and here. She continues to help organize an annual food, clothing, and toy giveaway program for children.) Jennifer Rodriguez, the attorney for the mom in the child-assault case, said Tuesday that she eventually gave up on trying to get the police to sign off on the visa form. She went to the state’s attorney’s office and obtained the signature there, she said. Since Helliger was relieved of the visa-form duty, Rodriguez said, she has had success with other clients in getting the police to deal with the forms. Rodriguez took exception to the claim that immigrants lie about being crime victims to obtain visas. Particularly in domestic violence cases, she said, ” “that’s one of the things they hold over them: ‘I can get you deported.’” Grab & Run Another internal affairs investigation of Helliger centered on a child custody battle. The complained stemmed from a Jan. 17, 2014 incident. The complainant was the uncle of the 10-year-old girl at the center of the custody. Helliger was friends with the child’s “biological great aunt,” according to the complaint. (Again, to protect the child’s identity, the text of the complaint is not being published here.) The biological aunt had custody of the girl. The uncle had the girl with him the night of Jan. 17 when, he said, Helliger showed up at his house one night and took the child away. The uncle “believed the situation was escalating so he attempted to take the child out of Helliger’s car…. Helliger wrapped her arms around him. He was able to break free from her hold and he began running to the house with the child. Helliger then grabbed [his] arm to restrain him. The child ran into the house and ran out of the back door where Helliger was now waiting. Helliger put the child into her car and drove off,” according to the internal affairs report, written by Lt. Rebecca Goddard. The uncle’s wife gave a similar statement. Goddard contacted Helliger for her side. Helliger “confirmed there was a verbal altercation ... involving the custody of the ten year old child” but “did not wish to provide further details due to the fact it was off-duty conduct,” Goddard wrote. The outcome: “Lieutenant Helliger was advised not to contact either party. This case is closed due to mediation. Raising Cain One complaint against Helliger remains unresolved. The timing of its handling is a story in itself. The complaint was issued not by a member of the public, but by a lower-ranking officer, internal affairs chief Lt. Cain. Cain filed her complaint against Helliger on Nov. 18 with the city’s Department of Human Resources. Cain complained that Helliger had created a “hostile” workforce by berating her and yelling at her in front of other people in a number of instances, and was making it difficult for her to do her job right. In the first instance, Cain was serving as a administrative sergeant in the detective division. (She hadn’t yet become head of internal affairs.) She asked a detective why he hadn’t completed a photo board of suspects in a robbery; the detective said Helliger had ordered him not to include juveniles because the law forbids it. Cain said a department inspector told her the law in fact allows the inclusion of juveniles’ pictures in photo arrays. “When I brought this to Lt. Helliger’s attention, she became defensive and told me that she would not authorize the use of juvenile photos regardless of what the Inspector said,” Cain wrote in her complaint. The next instance occurred when Cain was in charge of the Bureau of Identification. Her account: I was tasked with retrieving photographic evidentiary that was taken by patrol officers. Although there was a written policy on how to maintain these photographs, often the policy was not followed resulting in photographs never being downloaded or the designated computer having access to the internet (unsecure). As a result, Captain [Jeff] Hoffman (OIC of Patrol) and I proposed having the officers either print the photographs or burn them to CD and place them into evidence. This would alleviate the above mentioned issues and allow us to destroy the evidence in accordance with State Statute. When we brought this recommendation to Lt. Helliger she became angry, yelling at us that she was not the OIC of the Property Room and it was not her job. Over the course of several meetings, in an attempt to resolve the issue, she continually berated me. Ultimately, Assistant Chief [Al] Vazquez (then Lt.) became involved and after witnessing one of her rants, spoke with her supervisor who agreed the photos should be treated as evidence and be placed into the property room but, due to her unwillingness to cooperate with Captain Hoffman and I, the transition never occurred. The next three alleged confrontations occurred while Cain has been serving as head of internal affairs. In one, Cain wrote, Helliger yelled at her for not including her in the loop about an internal affairs decision involving another cop she had wanted to have disciplined. The second involved the immigration U-Visa case described earlier in this article. Cain wrote that at the “white shirt” command staff meeting, she had suggested a bureaucratic solution to the U-Visa paperwork jam. “After the meeting was concluded, but while several people were still gathered, Lt. Helliger turned to me and started yelling, repeatedly, “This is not an IA issue.” I repeatedly told her that she was correct, it was not an IA issue, and that the only reason I was involved was because there was a complaint filed. She continued yelling and pointing her finger at me. Fearing the incident would escalate further, I told her that I did not want to argue with her and got up and left. And, although this was witnessed by her immediate supervisor, Assistant Chief Anthony Campbell, to my knowledge, her behavior was not addressed.” The third incident involved a Freedom of Information Act request filed with records by New Haven Register reporter Esteban Hernandez. Hernandez sought copies of all civilian complaints filed against Chief Esserman. Helliger forwarded that request to internal affairs, Cain wrote. One day she came down to the first-floor IA office to ask about the status of the Hernandez request, according to Cain. When Helliger asked, Cain wrote: I told her that I had already fulfilled the request. She became visibly angry and told me that she was the “Keeper of Records” and that I should have forwarded the information for her to disseminate. She continued to tell me that we only have 4 days to respond and she needed to maintain those records for 1 year. I told her that I had maintained them but that I would make copies [of] all of the responses I had written and give them to her for her files. She continued to raise her voice and told me that I am supposed to give all of the documents to her because she was the Chief’s designee. I explained to her that when I took over as OIC I was not sure how the FOIAs were handled therefore, I contacted Kathleen Foster from Corporation Council and asked who is responsible for the IA records. Attorney Foster told me that I am the keeper of IA records and that in the past her office would make any needed redactions. Lt. Helliger said, “no one else ever asked before.” I tried to tell her that I called Corporation Council to make sure I was doing my job correctly, but she continued to speak over me in a hostile tone, telling me that I was wrong and that she is tired of me “disrespecting” her. I tried to tell her that I did not disrespect her and that she can have copies of my responses to the FOIAs I complete in the Internal Affairs division. Lt. Helliger continued yelling at me and said several times that I had disrespected her, that she was tired of it and would not tolerate it. I noticed that several citizens who were standing in the lobby were now turned around, looking toward my office, watching us. At that time, I told Lt. Helliger I did not want to argue with her and asked her to leave. She continued to yell and said that she is not arguing with me. I again asked her to leave but she yelled, “you can’t kick me out.” I said, “Patty, it’s my office, please leave” at which time she left and slammed the door behind her, again causing everyone in the lobby to focus on her. When I began walking back to my desk, I noticed that all of my staff which included Deb Sullo, Sergeant Rose Dell and Intern Frank Olive, were all staring at me with a shocked look on their face. One of my employees asked, “what was that?” I believe Lt. Helliger’s aggression and hostility has escalated in each of our interactions and feared it would continue to do so therefore, I reported this last incident to my immediate supervisor, Assistant Chief L. Casanova. He ordered that I, and all of the staff who witnessed the incident, submit memos detailing what occurred. In my memo, I asked that her behavior be addressed because, again, I fear her hostility toward me will grow and a physical confrontation will occur. One week after submitting my memo, I attended the regularly scheduled Board of Police Commissioners meeting in which I give the Internal Affairs report. Although there was nothing on the Agenda pertaining to Lt. Helliger, eleven Aldermen attended the meeting to show “support” for her. I found this to be a form of bullying and intimidation for reporting what I believed to be a hostile work environment to my supervisor. I also found it to be very concerning that eleven appointed City officials would take a stand when none of them were privy to the facts of the case. I can only interpret this to mean that, if there is an investigation, regardless of what is found these appointed City officials will back Lt. Helliger and no action will be taken to correct her behavior. I also fear, that based on their position of power within the City, I will be retaliated against and relieved of my position or overlooked for other positions within the Department. Lt. Helliger has shown a pattern of both verbal and physical aggression with both her staff (sworn and civilian) and the public. Yet, although these incidents have been documented and reported yet nothing has been done to address it. This latest incident, and the Alderman’s response, has caused me a great deal of anxiety and am hesitant to perform my required duties when it involves Lt. Helliger. I am asking for relief from her continued intimidating and hostile behavior. At the time of the filing of Cain’s complaint, Helliger was under consideration for her promotion to captain. She had influential people — numerous city alders — showing up at the Board of Police Commissioners to complain that her promotion was being unfairly delayed. More then eight months later, according to the head of human resources, the matter remains under investigation. And Dean Esserman officially remains chief of the New Haven police department.

Share | Post a Comment Commenting has closed for this entry Comments posted by: FacChec on August 9, 2016  2:00pm According to this story concerning Hellinger, not only does Esserman not recognize and take punitive action against Hellinger for multiple allegations of personal abuse towards police officers and the public, he ignores her abuse and reluctantly promotes her to the rank of Captain. It becomes abundantly clear that the reason for Esserman’s failure to follow policy and instill discipline is because he is looking at himself in the mirror and excusing his/her own actions. Essserman has a documented record of discipline, albeit slight, Hellinger does not. Therefore, it appears the problem in the police department, all city departments and the BOE is Harp. posted by: THREEFIFTHS on August 9, 2016  2:18pm Wow. This sounds like the movie Prince of the City. https://youtu.be/AIaKFOtLWd8 posted by: Sincerity on August 9, 2016  2:42pm Well this definitely does not surprise me that the machine is starting to work in an effort to make the transition of Chief Essermans return back to work justified. This is called, “Politics 101 deflectionat its worse”. This is not really a brilliant spin by any form of the imagination. It’s done every day in politics across the country even as I scribe this commentary pertaining to all of the “Tom Foolery” which has gone on with Donald Trump since campaigning. It’s done every day. Here’s the key to this, Chief Esserman, in case you or anyone else think this is brilliant it is really not. The public is smarter than this. In order for you, “Chief Esserman” to return back to the helm of the NHPD you need someone you can say, “Look I am not the only one”. Yes. It’s totally unfortunate for at the time then, Lieutenant Hellinger, now Captain allegedly was confronted with a bad situation. Here are the differences between Esserman and Hellinger.Hellinger runs nothing, Esserman does. Hellinger can’t suspend or recommend termination, Esserman can. Chief Esserman still will be able to discipline. No matter what Capt. Hellinger or any officer may have done in the past they were not the Chief of Police. One of the largest departments in the State of Connecticut. No matter however the machine chooses to deflect and redirect Chief Essermans behavior he has no business running anyone’s Police Department in these United States of America. This is not about Capt. Hellinger this is about YOU! Chief Esserman! You can not hide behind any medium or political official with what you’ve inflicted on civilians and the officers of the City of New Haven. I can tell you that I’ve had conversations with your contemporaries across the state since your last explosive behavior. I can tell you this much from what I’ve received is, “If I don’t have anything good to say about someone I’d just rather not say anything at all”. This comes from Federal, State and Municipal partners. posted by: Statestreeter on August 9, 2016  3:00pm Let’s be honest here. Maybe the Indy could do a story, unless I missed it, about how a dozen or so alders marched their way to a police commission meeting to demand she be promoted to captain. Then everyone including our city hall elites held the big celebration to talk about the good old glass ceiling BS. Essermans behavior and Hellingers behavior happens because not only is it condoned but it’s celebrated at the highest levels. Esserman is here to stay. Guaranteed!!!! posted by: Hill North on August 9, 2016  3:31pm Mayor Harp it doesn’t make sense to bring back Esserman. How could you justify his return. posted by: Brian Banks on August 9, 2016  4:28pm This is a great job of investigative journalism, nice work Paul.  The article is founded in fact and the details are undeniable.  In an effort to refrain from responding viscerally, I will keep from personally commenting on Esserman or Helliger.  Furthermore, they are not the only command level officers at the NHPD who conduct themselves in this manner, they just happen to be in the spotlight right now.  This is the rule rather than the exception right now at the NHPD since most of the real police leaders have retired.  But i digress….     Over the past couple weeks Esserman’s ability to discipline subordinate officers, should he return, has come into question repeatedly.  The very real truth is that he won’t be able to be effective in this regard and any punishment he did impose would be met with immediate litigation and a flurry of union grievances.  Mayor Harp is taking the city down a rabbit hole if she allows Esserman to return, even if he doesn’t have any future problems.  Let’s make it easy to understand by talking about managing employees.  Most of us know that discipline should be 1) Uniform and 2) Consistent, that can never be the case now.  In her interview, I heard Mayor Harp mention the old “progressive discipline” standard, which is truly outdated.  You guys know the old four-step system: verbal warning, written warning, suspension, termination.  The problem is that with progressive discipline, the manager and the employee become stuck in a series of escalating steps, ending in threats and documentation, but very little action or rehabilitation.  The discipline or punishment is not instructive. It cannot teach a new behavior or solve a problem (how does three weeks off with pay solve a problem).  You may be able to stop a person from doing something or even coerce him to act in a more desirable way, but the desired behavior will never be permanently learned unless the person recognizes the impact of the problem and takes ownership to solve it. posted by: Brian Banks on August 9, 2016  4:36pm Continued… Esserman and Helliger have never admitted they were wrong, ever, about anything.  They merely make excuses for their behavior and deflect responsibility for their actions.  Every manager in the world has made a mistake or two during their careers.  In fact, mistakes are essential in the learning process and they help us develop a sense of compassion when dealing with employee errors.  But, my fellow NHI readers, these are not mistakes.  These are character flaws in people who have been promoted beyond their abilities and are much too arrogant and indignant to admit their mistakes and strive to improve. posted by: Sincerity on August 9, 2016  5:21pm I promised myself that I would not make any more comments but I just could not help myself because my conscience was bothering me about the return of Chief Esserman and the fact that he is in possession of a service weapon. I do understand that Chief Esserman was not suspended in the true sense of the word. What concerns me which should concern every person who has been confronted by or in the future may come in contact with Chief Dean Esserman. In light of the most recent allegation which is still being investigated of a “Hostile Work Environment” pertaining to a civilian employee. Why is Chief Esserman allowed to continue to holster and wear a weapon on his side with a serious allegation pending? The allegation of a “Hostile Work Environment” has been filed and documented with the City of New Haven departments of Human Resources and Personnel as well as made public by this newspaper alleging Chief Esserman is the perpetrator or suspect of that claim. The most deciding factor in judging whether Chief Esserman is guilty of this behavior will be based on whether the civilian victim has transferred out of the NHPD to another department. So now you have to go back to the initial inquiry when the victim is transferred out of the NHPD the writing is on the wall. There was an incident the city had to comply with upon the return of the perpetrator to make the victim feel safe. That being said, if the transfer occurs then Human Resources and Personnel for the city knows that an actual “Hostile Work Environment” did occur and their responsibility is to make the victim feel safe from the perpetrator (Chief Dean Esserman). Lastly, if all of above has been played out and in fact Chief Esserman has been identified as the cause and threat for the transfer. Why is he allowed to carry a weapon? Also, is anyone concerned with his erratic behavioral pattern that he may be a high risk individual? I know I’m not the only one who is concerned about this am I? posted by: Ex-NHPD on August 9, 2016  8:03pm It is often said that the greatest stress for cops is not on the street; it is inside headquarters.  Esserman is hardly the first NHPD Chief to fail miserably in dealing with a problem employee.  Over my career, I saw numerous examples of problem cops (of all races/ethnicities/gender) who were never sufficiently taken to task for their actions, inactions, or unacceptable behavior.  Many were subsequently promoted and continued to act as they always had.  And then there were the absurdly ironic promoted employees who would take to task their subordinates for the exact same offenses they were notorious for doing. NHPD Supervisors and IA Investigators have been stymied for years after they wrote up Disciplinary Reports to the Chief on a cop or civilian, and had little or no action taken against those employees.  It emboldens the “bad” employee to continue their behavior and erodes the Supervisor’s authority.  It also destroys morale among the majority of the sworn and civilian employees who come to work every day and do their job professionally. For “problem” Supervisors, the Chief’s answer is not to discipline them, but transfer them.  Some supervisor work histories look quite impressive, with numerous assignments.  In reality, they are just shuffled through the deck at 1 Union after being ineffective or unable to get along with others in their last position. Everyone loses when problem NHPD employees are not addressed with proper documentation and discipline. In this article, several Assistant Chiefs are cited as having roles in different incidents with Helliger.  It seems they may have dropped the ball as well.  There also seems to be more than aninsinuation of Political interference. We know the rank and file lost confidence in Esserman. He will return to the NHPD even weaker than when he left for 15 days.  The ship is sinking.  With Esserman back at the helm, it is heading straight for the rocks.  The public and rank and file know this.  Why doesn’t Harp? posted by: Sincerity on August 9, 2016  8:55pm @ Ex-NHPD on the contrary Mayor Harp does know what’s going on. It’s easier to take the low road and pretend that everything is ok and to continue to put a political spin on serious matters concerning Chief Esserman. The second part of this is that she politically can not touch Chief Esserman because of what she is be holding to what was agreed upon. I can not say any more because of the fear of being deleted or censored but I think you can read between the lines. All of this will come out in the wash before or after November 8th. posted by: Brian L. Jenkins on August 10, 2016  5:53am Instead of this officer being promoted, she should have been demoted. I see absolutely nothing wrong with promoting officers that have earned their promotions.  However, this is one officer according to what I read if accurate, who does not deserve one. We as black people cannot look the other way when black officers behave in this manner, and then ask for the dismissal of white officers when they behave similarly.  This chief, upon his return, will be ushered into an untenable situation with regard to potential disciplinary actions towards other officers. Thus, the city should protect itself, from himself. To simply imply that officer Helinger was just having “bad day” is reprehensible.  What kind of day do you think the young man that was handcuffed in the presence of his family and placed in the back seat of a police car was having?  Did these same Alders march to his home and apologize for Helinger’s behavior?  If you can march in solidarity to support this officer in terms of a promotion, then you should’ve marched in solidarity to support this gentleman who experienced the wrath of officer Helinger also. I’m a huge proponent of fairness irrespective of race or sex.  In essence, I call it at I see it, and thus far what I see emanating from these two officers is flat wrong.  I pray that these officers turn from their disrespectful ways and wear the badge correctly. Both Chief Esserman and Lt. Helinger should be made to apologize to those in whom they have harmed.  This form of contrition should be mandatory throughout the department as a form of discipline.  No citizen should be disrespected by an officer, ever. posted by: thecove on August 13, 2016  4:03am There is absolutely no way Chief Esserman can return and effectively run the NHPD.  Leadership of this once fine department must change and change now.

Scott Levine (scott81236) Aug 9, 2016 at 12:15PM Image source: Getty Images. When a company reports its quarterly earnings, management often presents just a sketch of how the company performed. But equally important for investors is the conference call where management's commentary colors in the sketch, providing the full picture of the company's recent performance. Let's look at some of management's more notable comments from Plug Power's (NASDAQ:PLUG) most recent call to help discern the full picture for Q2 2016. The beginning of a beautiful friendship? Throughout its history, one of Plug Power's ongoing challenges has been diversifying its customer base. In 2015, for example, Wal-Mart accounted for 56.7% of Plug Power's total consolidated revenue -- even worse than the previous year when Wal-Mart and Volkswagen provided 37.2% of revenue.  On the call, management suggested that a partnership formed in the second quarter will help address this problem. Although the new customer's identity is unknown, Andy Marsh, Plug Power's CEO, reported that it is a "leading North American retailer with a global presence." Occurring in the third quarter, the first deployment with the retailer -- which has over 40 sites -- may be just the first of many similar deals: And we believe there's potential in our discussions that over the next 12 to 18 months, it could be five to six additional sites of the same size. So this first site will actually have -- the first deployment will be over 200 units and that site could grow to be as large as 400 units. So we're pretty excited about that one. Fall semester credit Like other renewable energy sources, fuel cells have relied heavily on federal tax credits to make their high price tags more palatable to potential customers. So it was quite a disappointment when the industry found that fuel cells -- unlike solar and wind -- weren't included in the latest extension of renewable energy tax credits.  Claiming that the lack of inclusion was due to an oversight, management has spent months, maintaining that the renewal of the investment tax credit (ITC) for fuel cells is just around the corner. Image Source: Getty Images. In fact, on the company's previous conference call, Marsh suggested the renewal could be attached to the FAA reauthorization bill scheduled for this summer. But the Senate sent the bill excluding mention of the ITC renewal to the president in July. Nonetheless, management remains confident: We're working closely and continually with Congress and our coalition partners to make the extension a priority in Congress when members return after the November election. Supporting his confidence, Marsh reported that management has "identified a number of potential legislative vehicles which can be used to enact an extension," and despite the delay, the renewal is forthcoming.  A cut here, a cut there, and there, and there Lastly, management recognizes that it has not only made great strides in expanding the margin on its GenDrive units, but it also sees ample opportunity to further cut costs of its various products and services as it drives the company closer to profitability. According to Paul Middleton, Plug Power's CFO, the company "continues to make great traction on margin improvement. And our success is indicative of our ongoing progress both in terms of volume leverage and cost-down initiatives, demonstrating the focus we have on driving all offerings to 30% margin profiles or greater over the longer term." Management's focus on the long term is admirable; however, investors would benefit from some context. For the second quarter, management reported that it achieved a 39% margin on its flagship GenDrive units -- a vast improvement over the 26% it reported for the same period last year. Evidently, this fits in well with Middleton's 30% margin profile target. In fact, Andy Marsh, later in the call, stated his opinion that in the long term " the GenDrive business itself long term can be a 45% gross margin plus business." But zooming out a little, we find that management has also targeted an overall gross margin for the company of about 12% for fiscal 2016, making 30% seem like a goal not quite attainable for some time. Nonetheless, management believes that in addition to cutting costs in the GenDrive units themselves, it can reduce its expenses in the development of its hydrogen infrastructure. According to Marsh, the company is continuously working on "how to simplify and reduce the cost of hydrogen: infrastructure, which we believe can become a significant business for Plug in the future." The takeaway According to management, new customers represented more than 60% of bookings in the quarter, and Wal-Mart only represented about 15% of the bookings. These figures suggest that the company is succeeding in diversifying its customer base, but it will be interesting to see if Plug Power's 10-K for fiscal 2016 actually confirms that there is greater diversity among the main customers contributing revenue. Regarding the ITC extension, it's not surprising that it didn't appear on the FAA bill, but investors should watch for the renewal by the end of the year. Though Marsh claims that senators have offered to call potential customers and assure them of the tax credit's extension, it seems like there are some more pressing concerns in Washington right now than the ITC renewal. Lastly, investors can keep an eye on the company's gross profit margin. Achieving management's 12% target would certainly be impressive, considering the company reported a negative gross profit margin of 9.6% in fiscal 2015.

Walmart CEO Explains Why Company Spent $3 Billion On Money-Losing Jet Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart CEO Explains Why Company Spent $3 Billion On Money-Losing Jet Image courtesy of Mike Mozart August 9, 2016 11:24 am EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup wal-jet walmart jet acquisitions e-commerce culture shock When the CEOs of Walmart and of Jet met for the first time, they fell in corporate love. The two men couldn’t stop envisioning the future of their companies together, sketching out their dreams of combining Walmart’s inventory and supplier relationships and Jet’s e-commerce algorithm. The companies announced their engagement this week, and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explained what it was he ever saw in the startup, which has barely been selling to the public for a year. Walmart, after all, is known for its innovations in logistics and ways to save its own an customers’ money. “If Walmart were starting today and we were building an e-commerce business some of the things that Jet designed into their approach would have been things we would have thought of,” McMillon told CNBC in an interview (warning: auto-play video at that link) after the merger announcement. Walmart is paying $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Walmart shares for the startup, which is the biggest acquisition of an e-commerce company ever: the second-biggest is QVC’s acquisition of flash-sale site Zulily a year ago. Jet fits in with what Walmart wants to do in the future, though: McMillon notes that the startup’s algorithm thinks about purchases in terms of the total “basket,” or everything purchased at once, not the individual items. Walmart plans to keep Jet as a separate brand, but integrate more of its technology in Walmart’s own website. According to CNBC, Walmart had set aside more than $1 billion to invest in e-commerce this year.

Walmart announced Monday that the company has agreed to buy fast-growing online retail newcomer Jet.com. The deal underscores how serious Walmart is about igniting its online business, which has been slowing even as it has been making big investments in new distribution centers and expanding services. AP PHOTO/SETH WENIG, FILE Copyright - Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO AP Retail Writer NEW YORK — Walmart is buying fast-growing online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, scooping up a newcomer that launched a year ago with the intention of challenging online leader Amazon. The hefty price underscores how Walmart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively for younger and more affluent customers as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services. As part of the deal, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will oversee both that site and walmart.com, and will report to Walmart Stores Inc. Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Lore brings to the role a rich e-commerce background as founder of Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, which was bought by Amazon for $500 million in 2010. Analysts say the acquisition still won’t enable Walmart to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help narrow that gap and should widen the distance between Walmart and other online retailers. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com of making it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups, with Hudson’s Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchasing flash-sales site Gilt Group and Bed Bath & Beyond buying One Kings Lane. While not a startup, Walmart itself announced in June that it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. As part of the deal, which Walmart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Walmart and Jet.com will maintain separate brands — for now. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company’s low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Walmart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast. It has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Walmart says it will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart” technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. It is built on a pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping and adjusts prices based on what items are in the checkout cart, as well as how far the desired products are from the shopper’s home. So shoppers are encouraged to add more to build a more efficient cart and buy items labeled “smart cart” for more savings. McMillon said Walmart customers likely will see lower prices and new brands aimed at millennials that have been carried by Jet.com. Walmart customers may also have more control over creating their own basket to save money. “We have some cool ideas on how the two brands can work together over time,” he said. As for perhaps merging the two sites eventually, McMillon said Walmart wants to be thoughtful about how it approaches that. Lore cited the benefits of Walmart’s purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with Jet.com’s team and technology. Jet.com, which touts its service, delivers to two-thirds of the country overnight in its purple boxes. In some high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often can offer same-day delivery at no additional cost. Lore told The Associated Press that he can see helping Walmart with speeding up shipping, among other things. In its fiscal year ended in January, Walmart had online sales of $13.7 billion, a fraction of its total revenue of $482.1 billion. And its online figure pales in comparison to Amazon.com’s annual net revenue of $107 billion. Apple.com is the only brick-and-mortar retailer that outranks Walmart in online sales in the U.S. But Walmart reported in May that global e-commerce sales rose 7 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 8 percent in the previous quarter and far below the 20 percent increases seen less than two years ago. So it trimmed its free-shipping pilot program ShippingPass to two-day delivery from three and cut a dollar off the membership to $49 a year in an attempt to answer Amazon’s Prime program. But while Amazon’s Prime membership costs $99 a year, it comes with a lot of perks like streaming music and video and household subscriptions.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 9, 2016 at 10:00AM Image source: Jet.com. Though rumors surfaced last week, it's now official: Global retail juggernaut Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is buying e-commerce start-up Jet.com. The move stands as the latest, and perhaps most significant example of Wal-Mart's continued shift into global e-commerce -- a move that further pits Wal-Mart in a head-to-head battle for global e-commerce supremacy with market leader Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). With so many important storylines at work here, let's quickly review what this move means for investors. Inside Wal-Mart's Jet.com buyout In headline numbers, Wal-Mart will acquire Jet.com for $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Wal-Mart stock. The deal already gained approval from both companies' boards of directors and will reportedly close before year's end. The deal marks Wal-Mart's largest-ever acquisition, in a sign the company sees e-commerce as a central strategic priority amid slowing growth in its core retail business. The purchase price essentially doubles the $1.4 billion valuation Jet.com received during its latest round of fundraising in November. As part of the agreement, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will assume responsibility for Wal-Mart's e-commerce division, while also running Jet.com as an independent operating subsidiary. Image Source: Getty Images Lore, who reportedly stands to make some $750 million as the largest shareholder in Jet.com, is something of a visionary in the e-commerce industry. Along with several co-founders, Lore established and scaled the holding company Quidsi, which served as the parent company for Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com. After a protracted and highly public price war with Amazon, the Seattle-based e-commerce giant purchased Quidsi in 2010 for $545 million, making Lore one of the few entrepreneurs to successfully challenge the famously competitive Amazon and not completely lose his shirt. Investors weren't exactly sure what to make of the Jet.com deal, though it seems like a clear-cut win for Wal-Mart, price tag notwithstanding. A win for Wal-Mart? For its part, Wal-Mart gains two important assets as part of the purchase. The first is Jet.com's sophisticated pricing software. The second is Jet.com's executive team, which has what one publication described as "some of the best e-commerce operations minds in the business." Especially when layered atop Wal-Wart's supply-chain excellence and purchase-power scale, it doesn't take an overly active imagination to see how both Jet and Wal-Mart stand to benefit from each other's strengths. Though Wal-Mart launched its eponymous Walmart.com over 15 years ago, e-commerce has always been something of a strategic backwater for the world's most dominant brick-and-mortar chain. For context, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales last year -- though topping $13 billion -- accounted for just 3% of the company's whopping $482 billion in revenue. What's more, Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth remains lower than the industry average and has decelerated in recent quarters. Clearly, the company needs some help if it ever hopes to credibly challenge Amazon's increasingly dominant grip on the e-commerce space. Judging by the market's initial reaction, investors may not view Wal-Mart's Jet.com purchase favorably; the stock traded down by nearly 1% on an essentially flat day for the broader market.  That falls well short of a sharp rebuke, but still suggests investors dislike the deal to some extent. There's certainly a case to be made that Amazon's leadership position in e-commerce will prove difficult to disrupt. Amazon's e-commerce business counts $99 billion in sales to Wal-Mart's roughly $13 billion. Its Prime subscription shopping and entertainment service continues to incentivize users to shift spending to Amazon. Though Wal-Mart recently launched a competitor service to Prime, it isn't clear what kind of reaction it has drawn from consumers.  I've long viewed the global e-commerce space -- with so much room for growth -- as a generational growth story, the true extent of which investors often overlook. Because of Wal-Mart's multiple structural advantages, it certainly seems possible for the company to carve out its own meaningful market share in this space. However, with Amazon seemingly as strong as ever, success will be harder to come by for Wal-Mart than, say, five years ago. Regardless, waiting to prioritize e-commerce would only make things harder for Wal-Mart, and adding Jet to its operational fold should certainly help in that effort.

This time, the giant retailer was determined not to whiff. On Monday, Wal-Mart announced the $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce upstart Jet.com, and named Lore, the company's co-founder and CEO, as head of online retail. It's a hefty price to pay — the most ever in e-commerce — for a 2-year-old company that's been burning millions of dollars a month and is nowhere near turning a profit. But Wal-Mart wasn't going to miss this opportunity. Not after what happened six years ago, when Lore's start-up Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, was snapped up by Amazon.com for $545 million following a bidding war. JPMorgan Chase, Wal-Mart's financial advisor then and now, was equally committed to aggressively closing the deal after missing out on Quidsi, according to sources familiar with the matter. Unlike in 2010, when Wal-Mart was up against Amazon as well as Walgreens in the bidding, there was no competition for Jet, sources said. Lore had spoken with other potential strategic investors because he knew Jet would require deep-pocketed financiers for years to come, but Wal-Mart was alone in pursuing an acquisition, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the talks were confidential. Lore didn't respond to a request for comment, and a representative from JPMorgan declined to comment. Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, said he doesn't have perspective on the Quidsi deal and that "Marc's reputation speaks for itself." Hargrove reiterated comments that CEO Doug McMillon made on a conference call on Monday. "Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive," McMillon said from Walmart.com's headquarters in San Bruno, California. "What he has built at Jet and his mindset at Jet does have application at Walmart, and that's really what led us to make the decision to let Marc be responsible for both Walmart and Jet." show chapters Wal-Mart buying Jet.com to compete with Amazon?    Monday, 8 Aug 2016 | 4:18 PM ET | 03:47 The acquisition includes a payout of $300 million in Wal-Mart shares. Lore's stake stands at around $750 million, according to Recode, but requires him to stick around and build up both Jet.com and Walmart.com. Neil Ashe, Wal-Mart's global e-commerce chief, is transitioning to other roles and then leaving the company. Some are referring to the deal as a high-priced acquihire because Jet was just getting off the ground. Lore's plan had been to serve customers with tremendous choice and a pleasurable experience while building a stronger economic model than Amazon. Algorithms help determine prices, which vary depending on how many items are in a customer's basket, the use of a debit card or credit card and whether a buyer waives the merchandise return option. Wal-Mart said Jet is on pace for $1 billion in gross merchandise volume and has 12 million products. "Jet.com brings a strong online presence, fresh perspective, and expertise on competing in the e-comm space and an attractive brand with appeal among millennials," analyst Jessica Schoen Mace of Nomura Securities wrote in a report. She recommends buying the stock and has a price target of $81. Wal-Mart shares fell 0.6 percent on Monday to $73.34. With a stock market capitalization of $228.6 billion, Wal-Mart's purchase of Jet is equal to 1.4 percent of its value. More importantly, Wal-Mart is desperate to crack Amazon's online dominance. The company launched Walmart.com in 2000, six years after Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, but has never been able to close the gap. Amazon vs. Wal-Mart Bezos' shrewd business tactics were on full display in 2010, when the company was pursuing Quidsi. Amazon, Wal-Mart and Walgreens all approached Quidsi at about the same time. When Walgreens heard where the bidding was starting, it quickly bailed, sources said, eventually purchasing Drugstore.com the following year for $429 million. (The company said last month that it's shutting down Drugstore.com.) Meanwhile, Amazon took control of the process, as documented in Brad Stone's book "The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon." Amazon was slashing the price on diapers on its own site, putting pressure on Quidsi's margins and making outside investors hesitant to put in more money. Furthermore, Amazon promised to keep dropping prices if Quidsi sold to Wal-Mart. "The Quidsi executives stuck with Amazon, largely out of fear," Stone wrote. Wal-Mart, for its part, was too focused on the pricing battle in a niche category and not looking at the long-term technology advantage that Lore and his team could bring to the company, said sources with knowledge of the deal. That was under Mike Duke, who was CEO from 2009 through early 2014. McMillon, who's been at Wal-Mart since 1984, succeeded Duke at the helm. The Jet purchase will be reviewed by regulators and is expected to close this year. McMillon and Lore are now teaming up to make sure that Amazon isn't the only game in town. Of course, this wasn't the plan. After being forced into a sale to Amazon and then working at the e-commerce giant for two years, Lore's ambition was not to land a top executive job at Wal-Mart. Rather, he'd set out to raise billions of dollars on a path to picking up enough market share to give customers actual choice in how and where they shopped online. Earlier this year, Lore responded to a question on the website Quora asking what would keep Jet from becoming the next Quidsi. "Amazon could afford to dramatically cut the price of diapers because it was such a small percentage of their business," Lore wrote. "As a mass marketplace, Jet is much more diversified than Diapers was, so we're better insulated against that kind of aggressive pricing." That may still be true, but getting there will require the strength of Wal-Mart's balance sheet. —CNBC's Courtney Reagan contributed to this report.

If the owner can't be found, Copiague town officials say they'll dispose of the boat. That could cost taxpayers $3,000 to $5,000. Newsday says the cruiser was dumped at the Tanner Park Marina last week. It's scrubbed of all identifying marks. The town turned to Facebook for help in identifying the owner. Copiague public safety director Pat Farrell says the boat is worthless. Its engine is shot. Farrell says he encounters about 11 such cases a year and recalls only about five of the owners being located. Consequences can include fines, labor costs and sometimes criminal charges. Suspected meth lab found under parking lot of Wal-Mart AMHERST (AP) -- Authorities say they've discovered what they believe is a methamphetamine lab under the parking lot of a suburban Buffalo Wal-Mart store. Police in the town of Amherst say officers on routine patrol found chemicals and other items used to make meth in an underground culvert that runs below the parking lot. Officers say the culvert is tall enough for a person to stand up in. Police and fire crews on Monday removed several jars of suspected meth from a manhole that's accessible from the culvert. Authorities say they plan to look at the Wal-Mart store's surveillance video to see if it shows people using the culvert. No arrests have been made yet. Woman sentenced for stealing $492K from company BUFFALO (AP) -- A 61-year-old western New York woman has been sentenced to prison time for stealing nearly half a million dollars from her longtime employer. The Erie County District Attorney's Office says Bernadette Szymanski of Cheektowaga was sentenced Monday to 1 2/3 to 5 years in prison. She pleaded guilty in May to a grand larceny charge. Prosecutors say Szymanski worked as the controller for FPPF Chemical Co. of Buffalo from 1991 until late 2015, when she was fired. Official say during a 13-year period that started in early 2002, she stole nearly $492,000 by committing payroll fraud and making unauthorized personal purchases on the company's credit card. The thefts were discovered after Szymanski became embroiled in a dispute with the company's owner. Szymanski so far has repaid $80,000 to the company. State to reimburse city $11.5M for cost of buying water NEWBURGH (AP) -- A Hudson Valley city has approved a contract that calls for the state to set aside up to $11.5 million to cover the municipality's cost of buying drinking water after a chemical was found in the city's main water supply. The Times Herald-Record of Middletown reports the contract with New York City was approved Monday. The deal calls for the state Department of Environmental Protection to send Newburgh a $2.4 million down payment upon approval of the contract by the state's comptroller's office. Washington Lake has long been Newburgh's primary water supply. It was closed in May because of the presence of a chemical known as PFOS. The chemical, which is used in firefighting foam, has been identified by environmental regulators as an emerging contaminant of concern. NYC officials seek ways to expand Brooklyn Bridge's walkway NEW YORK (AP) -- Transportation officials in New York City say they're exploring options to expand the Brooklyn Bridge's walkway to accommodate pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Officials announced Monday they've commissioned a seven-month engineering study to assess how much weight the bridge can carry and consider options for expanding the promenade. The path extends on an elevated track above the six-lane road below and most of the walkway ranges from 10 to 17 feet wide. The city says the average number of pedestrians on the bridge during peak weekend hours has increased from 511 in May 2008 to more than 1,900 in May 2015. City Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg says they've received complaints that the promenade is narrow. But she says the study is a first step and an expansion could be complicated. Authorities find body of missing woman, 23, in Erie Canal PERINTON (AP) -- Authorities say they've found the body of a missing western New York woman in the Erie Canal. Monroe County Sheriff's deputies say 23-year-old Sonya Seetharam was found in the canal in Perinton around 11:30 a.m. on Monday. Investigators say she was reported missing by her family Saturday evening. Her body was spotted in an area near where marine and scuba units were searching. It's unclear when or how the Perinton woman got into the water. The woman's death remains under investigation. State's environmental magazine goes digital ALBANY (AP) -- The state Department of Environmental Conservation's 70-year-old outdoor magazine is going digital. Commissioner Basil Seggos says the Conservationist will now be available in both print and digital editions. The online edition will offer additional content, including video and audio files and more pictures. For a limited time, the August 2016 issue online is being made available free. Readers can subscribe on the website. A subscription to the Conservationist costs $12 for one year, or $21 for two years. Subscribers will get both the print and online editions. State warns against driver selfies, cites Instagram review ALBANY (AP) -- Authorities are warning New York drivers against taking selfies, citing a national review suggesting they are among the most likely to do it. It's generally illegal except in an emergency to use a handheld mobile device while driving in the Empire State. Terri Egan, executive deputy commissioner of the New York Department of Motor Vehicles, says taking selfies behind the wheel is "just irresponsible." The Auto Insurance Center website says it recently reviewed 70,000 Instagram posts with driving-related hashtags, including (hash)DrivingSelfie, (hash)SelfieWhileDriving, and (hash)HopeIDontCrash. New Yorkers ranked eighth nationally with 1.29 posts per 100,000 residents. AAA reports that a driver's eyes may leave the road for at least two seconds to snap a selfie, during which time a car can travel 176 feet at 60 miles per hour. Man grabs officer's gun, kills someone; cops wound him NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City police say a suspect grabbed and repeatedly fired an officer's gun, killing another man. A second officer wounded the suspect. Assistant Chief Larry Nikunen says uniformed officers were flagged down around 1 a.m. Tuesday to handle a dispute in a Bronx deli. As they were escorting a man out of the store, he ripped the gun out of an officer's holster. He fired the officer's gun numerous times. One of the shots fatally struck a man who'd had a dispute with the suspect. Another officer fired three shots at the suspect, hitting him twice. He was taken to a hospital in stable condition. Police say video recovered from the deli corroborates all of their information.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/23/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Monday, November 21, 2016 Volunteers to cook up holiday spirit in city with meal delivery Saturday, November 19, 2016 Experienced core will be key for Northville Friday, November 18, 2016 Mayfield returns four starters; also has talented 6-foot-5 eighth grader in the mix Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Fulton County supervisors give approval to $97M draft budget Friday, November 18, 2016 From The Recorder Archives Saturday, November 19, 2016 Thomas to replace Cramer as undersheriff Saturday, November 19, 2016 Sophie Malkowicz Friday, November 18, 2016 City gun buyback yields less, but still viewed as a success Thursday, November 17, 2016 Police report Friday, November 18, 2016 Isabel faces Nelson for county legislature District 8 seat (1) Jury convicts Thomas Mair of murdering UK lawmaker Jo Cox (0) Oh please, not another gratitude list (0) The News in Brief (0) University police officer shot in head (0) Airstrike hits bridge, disrupting IS supply lines (0) Trump taps Gov.

Our shopper compared the prices on items at Sam's Club and Walmart and found sometimes Sam's prices were actually more expensive Cameron Huddleston, GoBankingRates.com Updated 8:57 am, Tuesday, August 9, 2016 Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images Our shopper compared the prices on items at Sam's Club and Walmart and found sometimes Sam's prices were actually more expensive. Our shopper compared the prices on items at Sam's Club and Walmart... My husband and I had a membership at Sam's Club for years. But we dropped it two years ago because we didn't think we were shopping at the warehouse club enough to justify the $45 annual fee. A funny thing happened, though. I wrote an article for GOBankingRates earlier this year about secret ways to save money at Sam's Club. In doing research for the piece, I learned that Sam's had improved its merchandise and food items to compete better with Costco — which, unfortunately, doesn't have a store where I live. I discovered that it was offering deeply discounted products through limited-time deals and auctions on its website. So I started wondering, "Did we make a mistake by dropping our membership? Should we give Sam's another try?" You can probably guess what happened. We were lured back in. We decided to fork over $45 for a membership, thinking we'd get more out of it now that our kids are a little older and eating more, especially our 4-year-old son who is an eating machine. To see if our membership is actually saving us money, I did some comparison shopping — something I should've done before joining, but hindsight is 20/20. Be aware that I was not looking for the best and worst deals at Sam's Club. Here's what I found.

I did a per-unit price comparison to figure out how much I would have to pay to get the same amount or size of an item at Wal-Mart as is available at Sam's, which sells things in larger quantities. I was skeptical that I was saving enough at Sam's to justify the annual cost. So I was surprised by what I found after adding up prices on the same item at both stores, adjusting for size and amount. The winner: Sam's Club by $87. The total for item's purchased at Sam's would be $410.93, and the total at Wal-Mart would be $498.09. I know what you're thinking: What in the world is she buying that costs so much? Included in my sample basket of goods were several high-priced items, namely over-the-counter medication, personal grooming products, batteries, party supplies such as paper plates and cleaning products like detergent. These items likely would only have to be purchased once a year, but I wanted to find out whether they were actually a better deal when purchased in bulk. Removing those items, Sam's still came out ahead by about $30 — $189.92 versus $219.49 at Wal-Mart. WHERE I'M SAVING Medication: The biggest savings at Sam's, by far, were on over-the-counter medications. A bottle of generic Ibuprofen with 1,200 tablets cost $10.88 at the Sam's I checked. I would have to pay $15.56 for the same number of generic Ibuprofen tablets at Wal-Mart. A three-pack of Flonaise nasal spray with 360 metered sprays is $49.98, but would cost $67.41 for the same amount at Wal-Mart. And I'd save $8 by buying Allegra in bulk at Sam's — yes, I have allergies. Total savings on medicine by shopping at Sam's: $30.14. Also, I'd only need to buy these items once a year at Sam's because the large quantities would last a while. Batteries: We go through batteries quickly with our kids' toys — and they are significantly cheaper at Sam's. A pack of 34 AAA Duracell batteries costs $16.98 at Sam's but would cost $23.21 for the same number of batteries at Wal-Mart. And party supplies, such as heavy duty paper plates, are a much better deal at Sam's, costing $15.63 for a pack of 100 Chinet brand oval platters at Sam's versus $22 for the same number at Wal-Mart. Food: Even several everyday items were cheaper. For example, I would pay about $5 less in total to buy snack items such as granola bars, tortilla chips and Goldfish crackers in bulk at Sam's than for the same amount of those items at Wal-Mart. And fruits and vegetables that my family eats lots of and wouldn't go bad if bought in bulk — including grapes, spinach, apples, strawberries, bananas, blueberries, tomatoes and potatoes — would cost me about $8 less at Sam's Club than buying the same amount at Wal-Mart. WHERE I'M NOT SAVING Although I would see big savings on some items, the price on other things are about the same or even less at Wal-Mart. Soda — I occasionally drink Coke Zero — costs nearly twice as much per can at Sam's than at Wal-Mart. I also wouldn't save any by buying toilet paper at Sam's. In fact, I would pay about $1 more for the same number of rolls and same brand at Sam's than at Wal-Mart. A 3-liter bottle of extra virgin olive oil costs the same at both stores. And there's only a 10 cent difference in price per pound for chicken breasts at the two stores. I'LL KEEP MY MEMBERSHIP ... FOR NOW If I actually make use of my membership by buying the products I found to be cheaper at Sam's, then it's worth it for me to pay the $45 annual fee. However, I can't do all of my shopping there because we couldn't eat some bulk items fast enough to avoid waste. And it doesn't carry all of the items my family enjoys. That means I still have to make trips to the grocery store. As a working mom of three kids, I don't have a lot of time to shop at several stores throughout the month to get the best deals. So I'll just have to use my Sam's membership to buy items that will last longer and only make occasional trips to the warehouse club. Or my family might have to make some changes to what it eats so we can do all of our shopping at Sam's to maximize savings.

The acquisition of Jet.com, launched in July 2015 by entrepreneur Marc Lore, gives Walmart the startup's innovative pricing software, which Walmart plans to integrate into its own store while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity. 2. Delta cancels 250 more flights as it recovers from computer outage Delta Airlines canceled 250 flights on Tuesday as it struggled to get back to normal after a power outage at its Atlanta base disrupted its operations worldwide. About 200 other flights could be delayed. On Monday, the computer glitch forced the carrier to cancel about 1,000 flights. Limited flights resumed after a six-hour halt to Delta traffic. Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized to travelers, and said restoring the computer systems and getting back on schedule was "an all hands on deck effort." Delta is offering stranded passengers refunds and $200 travel vouchers. 3. Barclays agrees to pay states $100 million in rate-rigging settlement British bank Barclays has agreed to pay $100 million to 44 U.S. states to end state investigations of alleged manipulation of interest rates from 2005 to 2009. The scheme allegedly hid evidence of Barclays' poor health during the global financial crisis, inflating borrowing costs linked to the U.S. and London interbank offer, or Libor, rates. "There has to be one set of rules for everyone, no matter how rich or how powerful, and that includes big banks and other financial institutions" that manipulate financial markets, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. 4. Lending Club CFO resigns Loan marketplace Lending Club announced Monday that its chief financial officer, Carrie Dolan, is stepping down to "pursue a new opportunity." The news came three months after the company ousted its founder and CEO, Renaud Laplanche, over his failure to report details on problematic loan sales to an investment bank. The company's shares, which have lost two-thirds of their value in the past year, fell by nine cents to $4.70 in after-hours trading. 5. Fox News' Tantaros says she was pulled off air after complaining about Ailes harassment Fox News host Andrea Tantaros says through a lawyer that she complained several times to senior executives that the cable news company's now-ousted chief, Roger Ailes, has sexually harassed her before she was yanked off the air in April. Her lawyer said he believed her sidelining was "retaliatory." The claim counters earlier statements by Fox News senior executives that they were unaware of any accusations against Ailes until former anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual-harassment lawsuit against him in July. The company says Tantaros was taken off the air for violating company policy — and her contract — by failing to submit her latest book for review.

Walmart Pay vs. Apple Pay: Hardware age dictates all Walmart went nuclear and banned Visa from Canada Video Inside Google's Loon and Wing If you have $3.3 billion lying around, why not buy a startup? That is exactly what Walmart is doing. The retail giant is buying two-year-old e-commerce startup Jet.com in an attempt to invigorate its online sales division. Walmart is dropping a lot of money on this deal, but it hopes to get a lot in return.  In IT Blogwatch, we hit 'buy' now. What are the deal's details? Erika Morphy gives us the background: Walmart...is...buying Jet.com, an e-commerce site...for the tidy sum of $3.3 billion, $3 billion of which will be in cash, to augment its own online sales operations. ... Jet.com's customer base does not align with Walmart's customers, which could be a point in the deal's favor...only a fifth of Jet.com buyers have purchased from Walmart.com in the most recent 6-month period. Millions of people have bought items from Jet.com, but it may not be an household name for everyone. So what do we know about the e-commerce site? Jason Del Rey fills in the blanks: Jet sells more than 12 million products...A little less than a third of its sales volume comes from items that Jet stores in its...warehouses and sells directly to customers. ... Jet has...a discounting model, dubbed the Smart Cart, that rewards customers with greater discounts as they add more items to their order...[It] also gives customers additional discounts if they forfeit the right to return an item, or [if they] pay with a debit card...Four million people have made a purchase on Jet since it launched. But what is Walmart's impetus for buying Jet? Turns out, this is part of a larger trend. Nandita Bose has some insight into Walmart's purchase: The deal...follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Walmart...has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. ... Walmart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year...as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. So if the Jet purchase helps Walmart catch up with Amazon, this deal could turn out well for both companies. But they aren't the only ones happy with this deal. It promises to pay out nicely for at least one Pennsylvania family. Anita Balakrishnan has the details: Walmart's...acquisition of...Jet.com was potentially a flush exit for early employees and its familiar big-name investors...But it was also a probably huge windfall for 10 people who -- like Pennsylvania's Eric Martin -- won significant equity in the company. ... Martin won 100,000 shares in Jet.com...as part of a contest aimed to get users to refer the most family and friends to the...site. That means he'll likely get some...slice of Jet's $3.3 billion price tag, along with a handful of other contest winners, who each got 10,000 shares. So what does this mean for tech buyouts in the future? Matthew Bradley thinks he knows: The Jet.com acquisition...soon to become known as the Silicon Valley hustle. It'll happen to Coca-Cola next.

Matt Krantz , USA TODAY 6:30 a.m. EDT August 9, 2016 In this May 16, 2011 photo, the Wal-Mart logo is displayed in Springfield, Ill. What Wal-Mart Stores Inc. says about how it's reversing a slump in its namesake U.S. business will be at the front of analysts' minds at the company's annual meeting with Wall Street Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2011. (Photo: Seth Perlman, AP) Q: Is Walmart more attractive with Jet? A: Walmart (WMT) is betting $3.3 billion it can take on Amazon.com (AMZN) on its home turf: Online. It has much to prove before investors will buy it. Walmart, the nation’s top retailer, is buying online retailer Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Jet has ramped up its name recognition with consumers and is developing ways to secure discounts on merchandise in a bid to rival Amazon’s retail business. Walmart, which still gets a majority of its business from physical stores, needs to reinvigorate growth especially with online shoppers. Make no mistake, Amazon’s growth is stellar. The company’s adjusted profit this fiscal year is expected to jump 356% to $5.70 a share, says S&P Global Markets Intelligence. Walmart, in comparison, is expected to see a 7.4% decline in adjusted profit this fiscal year. But in some ways, Amazon is opening the door for companies that are more focused on retail. Amazon is increasingly looking to get more business outside of retail, including cloud technology services. If Walmart can focus on retail, there could be an in. Investors aren’t convinced, though. Analysts rate Walmart a “hold” and have an 18-month price target that’s 6% lower than Monday’s price. USA TODAY markets reporter Matt Krantz answers a different reader question every weekday.

Jet gamifies shopping for CPG products, an experience not usually identified with fun.” eMarketer estimates that this year, ecommerce sales account for just 2.8% of revenues at Wal-Mart, which makes the bulk of its revenues at brick-and-mortar stores. But retail store sales growth has slowed dramatically in the past few years, down to just 1.6% in 2015 and into negative territory this year, according to company reports. Ecommerce sales, meanwhile, are growing at Wal-Mart—but there too the company’s 2016 performance is worse than the US average, according to eMarketer estimates. eMarketer expects US retail ecommerce sales to rise by nearly 16% this year, substantially faster than Wal-Mart’s estimated ecommerce sales growth of 9.4% for 2016 and the 6.8% growth estimated for the past 12 months. “Wal-Mart clearly needs to do something to jumpstart its ecommerce strategy, and adding Jet.com’s management team—and brand—seems like a very smart move,” said eMarketer analyst Yory Wurmser. “Jet.com’s expertise is in fulfillment optimization and pricing. Given Wal-Mart’s scale and physical store footprint, these improvements could turn Wal-Mart into a formidable price competitor to Amazon. “Second, Jet’s brand could attract some customers who are turned off by Wal-Mart’s brand, either by poor ecommerce experiences in the past or by unhappiness with the core Wal-Mart brand itself,” noted Wurmser. Overall, eMarketer estimates that 8.2% of total retail sales in the US will be transacted via digital channels this year—again, much higher than the share of Wal-Mart’s revenues from ecommerce sales. And the categories Jet focuses on tend to be even more reliant than average on brick-and-mortar stores. Euromonitor reported in June that just 3.0% of 2015 dog and cat food sales in the US occurred via digital, for example—and that was the CPG category with the most ecommerce sales. For paper towels, by contrast, ecommerce sales made up just 0.3% of the total. And these figures are not changing much. In 2014, 2.8% of dog and cat food sales were ecommerce sales, along with 0.3% of paper towel sales. eMarketer does not break out CPG sales specifically in its ecommerce sales estimates. The health and personal care subcategory will see 7.2% of US sales occurring online this year, while food and beverage (which includes groceries as well as packaged food and beverages) will have just 2.5% of sales transacted online.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 9 August 2016 | MYT 3:14 PM Wal-Mart buying Jet.com to lift online sales, battle Amazon Set to fly: Wal-Mart Stores Inc will pay about US$3bil (RM12.1bil) for Jet.com and its innovative pricing software in the largest-ever deal for an e-commerce startup. — Reuters Wal-Mart Stores Inc, vying to better challenge Amazon.com Inc, will pay about US$3bil (RM12.1bil) for Internet retailer Jet.com and its innovative pricing software in the largest-ever deal for an e-commerce startup. The deal disclosed on Aug 8 follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world's biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. Wal-Mart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. Jet.com was launched by Internet entrepreneur Marc Lore in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity. "One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay," Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a media call. McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time in getting the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short-term. "Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent." McMillon said Lore would run its new US e-commerce business. Lore had cofounded Quidsi, the owner of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon. "Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive," McMillon said. Wal-Mart's current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year. The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients. Wal-Mart said it would pay around US$3bil in cash and US$300mil (RM1.21bil) in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet's revenue of about US$500mil (RM2.02bil), the cash purchase price represents six times Jet's revenue, according to analysts. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said the acquisition gives Wal-Mart a leg-up on competitors in the race to be the No. 2 online retailer, citing the size of Jet.com's online offerings and number of customers. Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly. "The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," he said. In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China's 2 e-commerce firm. Billions spent on online efforts  Wal-Mart's first-quarter online sales grew 7%, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart's online sales rose 12.3% to US$13.7bil (RM55.24bil), compared with a 16% jump to US$92.4bil (RM372.56bil) for Amazon.com. Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of US$3.1bil (RM12.5bil) for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said. Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online. — Reuters You May Be Interested Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Factory complied with authorities’ requirements, says Wong M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

After years of forcing department and big-box stores out of business, is Amazon "taking market share" from QVC? asked Barton Crockett, retail analyst for FBR Capital Markets, in an investor conference call Friday with QVC boss Michael George. "The biggest drop was clearly in fashion, which had been the thing that was propelling our business," George admitted. Still, citing internal customer interviews, George said QVC's heavy users - mostly working-age women - use Amazon for mundane purchases like "pet food and cleaning supplies," not clothes or other QVC mainstays. He said QVC expects sales to recover later this year. Shares rose nearly 4 percent Monday. Meanwhile, in Hoboken, Marc Lore, the Bucknell grad who sold Diapers.com (Qdisi) to Amazon.com for $500 million six years ago, had another fat payday Monday. He, his partners, and their investors sold Jet.com, their high-tech warehouse development in Swedesboro near the Commodore Barry Bridge, and other assets, to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. With client sales of $1 billion a year from retailers including Barnes & Noble, GNC, Toys "R" Us, and Sports Authority (now in bankruptcy), Jet will now help Walmart, the nation's largest retail chain, try to catch up to Amazon's long lead in direct-from-the-warehouse retail. Walmart wants Jet for the company's "dynamic pricing and sourcing," said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer at Radial (formerly eBay Enterprise), a King of Prussia company that manages mobile and online sales for retailers. "One of Jet.com's value propositions is that they are able to reprice items in your basket, based on the other items you buy," Weitz told me. "Jet is able to do this because they are constantly repricing their goods based on the [profit] margins they've decided they need to hit," and the savings from sending many items to a single buyer. The software needed to match profit targets to inventory and location, adjust prices, and deliver on time "is a phenomenally complex computer science task" - and has special resonance for Walmart, Weitz added. Jet's "dynamic pricing" recalls Walmart's former "Rollback" in-store price-cut program, which relied on old-fashioned inventory and sales tracking to target products for discounts. By bringing back Rollback-like savings online, Jet.com makes Walmart more appealing to longtime customers as they move online, so they'll buy more and keep coming back, Weitz said. The deal enriches Jet founders and investors: Jet raised around $470 million from venture capitalists at Boston's Fidelity and Bain investment firms, Philadelphia-based MentorTech, Accel Partners and Google Ventures of Silicon Valley, New Enterprise Associates of suburban Washington, New York-based Goldman Sachs, and others, mostly in 2014, according to SEC reports.

By: Reuters | Published:August 9, 2016 12:48 pm Wal-Mart Stores vying to better challenge Amazon.com will pay about billion for internet retailer Jet.com. (Source: Reuters) Wal-Mart Stores Inc, vying to better challenge Amazon.com Inc , will pay about $3 billion for internet retailer Jet.com and its innovative pricing software in the largest-ever deal for an e-commerce startup. The deal disclosed on Monday follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. Wal-Mart’s online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. Jet.com was launched by internet entrepreneur Marc Lore in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity. “One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay,” Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a media call. McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time in getting the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short-term. “Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent.” McMillon said Lore would run its new US e-commerce business. Lore had cofounded Quidsi, the owner of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon. “Marc’s e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive,” McMillon said. Wal-Mart’s current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year. The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients. Wal-Mart said it would pay around $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet’s revenue of about $500 million, the cash purchase price represents six times Jet’s revenue, according to analysts.

Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly. “The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal,” he said. In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China’s 2 e-commerce firm. BILLIONS SPENT ON ONLINE EFFORTS Wal-Mart’s first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart’s online sales rose 12.3 percent to $13.7 billion, compared with a 16 percent jump to $92.4 billion for Amazon.com. Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said. Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online.

The deal announced Monday shows Wal-Mart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services. In June, it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. Analysts say Wal-Mart buying Hoboken-based Jet.com still won't enable it to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help widen the gap between itself and other retailers online. The deal also reflects the difficulties for start-ups like Jet.com to make it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online start-ups in an extremely competitive landscape. In January, Hudson's Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchased flash-sales site Gilt Group. And in June, Union Township-based Bed, Bath & Beyond bought One Kings Lane. "This acquisition in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Wal-Mart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," said Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Shea. "As we believe 'catching' Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg up on its competitors in the very important race to be No. 2 online." As part of the deal, which Wal-Mart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Jet.com will maintain separate brands. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company's low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast. It has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Wal-Mart says it also will incorporate some of Jet.com's "smart" technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, the deal provides big financial backing. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. "It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Wal-Mart." Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, said in a statement the combination of Wal-Mart's retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with the team, technology and business of Jet.com will allow the company to deliver more value to customers. Jet.com, which touts its service, delivers to two-thirds of the country overnight in its purple boxes. In some high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often can offer same-day delivery at no additional cost. In May, Lore told The Associated Press that Jet.com had expected to reach overall profitability in 2020 and to hit $20 billion in general merchandise value with 15 million customers. Lore also has experience competing with Amazon as CEO of Quidsi, whose main site was diapers.com. Eventually, it bought him out for more than $500 million back in 2010. The Wall Street Journal reported that Lore will take a senior leadership position on the e-commerce side of Wal-Mart and that Wal-Mart's top online executive, Neil Ashe, is expected to depart. Wal-Mart and Jet.com each declined to comment on that. In its fiscal year ended in January, Wal-Mart had online sales of $13.7 billion, a fraction of its total revenue of $482.1 billion. And its online figure pales in comparison to Amazon.com's annual net revenue of $107 billion. O'Shea noted that Apple.com is the only brick-and-mortar retailer that outranks Wal-Mart in online sales in the U.S. But Wal-Mart reported in May that global e-commerce sales rose 7 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 8 percent in the previous quarter and far below the 20 percent increases seen less than two years ago. So it trimmed its free-shipping pilot program ShippingPass to two-day delivery from three and cut a dollar off the membership to $49 a year in an attempt to answer Amazon's Prime program. But while Amazon's Prime membership costs $99 a year, it comes with a lot of perks like streaming music and video and household subscriptions. Jet.com has also faced plenty of challenges. Three months after it launched, it ditched its annual membership fee of $49.99, leading critics to question the business model. So Jet.com promised to undercut Amazon and other retailers by 4 percent to 5 percent instead of larger discounts. O'Shea noted that Wal-Mart is "paying a lot" for Jet.com, but it was too soon to say if it overpaid.

Here, a Walmart store is seen in Chinatown, Los Angeles, Jan. 16, 2016. Photo: MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images UPDATE: 6 p.m. EDT — Walmart formally announced Monday its takeover of online retailer Jet.com “for approximately $3 billion in cash, a portion of which will be paid over time. Additionally, $300 million of Walmart shares will be paid over time as part of the transaction.” In a statement, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said of the acquisition: “We’re looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want. We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities.” Original story: After being subject to rumors for over a week, Walmart and Jet.com are expected to announce a $3 billion deal on Monday under which the brick-and-mortar retailing giant will buy the online retailer, according to various reports. Confirmation of the deal was first reported Saturday by Bloomberg, which, citing unnamed sources, said the terms of the acquisition will require that the startup founder Marc Lore continues “to head the retailer’s online division for several years.” Previously, Lore has worked for Amazon.com, the market leader in online retail sector and a rival that Walmart has been trying to close the gap with. Before spending over two years with Amazon, Lore was also competing with the e-commerce company when he founded Quidsi, known best for its Diapers.com business. He was forced to sell the company to Amazon in 2010 but after quitting Amazon, Lore started Jet.com, his new e-commerce venture, in 2015.

Compared to Amazon’s $99 billion annual revenue from e-commerce operations, Walmart has a fraction at $14 billion, Recode reported. “Wal-Mart still struggles with things like third party marketplaces which Marc and his team have successfully built,” Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., told Bloomberg. Recode, which also spoke to unnamed sources familiar with the deal, said Neil Ashe, Walmart’s current global e-commerce chief, will depart after a transition period. For his part, Lore is expected to make about $750 million from the deal, since he owns 25 percent of Jet.com. The deal was signed Friday and is expected to be announced Monday, TechCrunch reported.

The deal announced Monday shows Wal-Mart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services. In June, it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. Analysts say Wal-Mart buying Jet.com still won’t enable it to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help widen the gap between itself and other retailers online. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com to make it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups in an extremely competitive landscape. In January, Hudson’s Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchased flash-sales site Gilt Group. And in June, Bed, Bath & Beyond bought One Kings Lane. “This acquisition in tandem with its joint venture in China with JD.com demonstrates that Wal-Mart is attacking online retail with significant zeal,” said Moody’s lead retail analyst Charlie O’Shea. “As we believe ‘catching’ Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg up on its competitors in the very important race to be No. 2 online.” As part of the deal, which Wal-Mart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Jet.com will maintain separate brands. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company’s low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast. It has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Wal-Mart says it also will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart” technology that lowers prices in real time. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, the deal provides big financial backing. “We’re looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want,” Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said. “It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Wal-Mart.” Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, said in a statement the combination of Wal-Mart’s retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with the team, technology and business of Jet.com will allow the company to deliver more value to customers. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. slipped 50 cents to $73.26 in midday trading Monday.

The hefty price underscores how Wal-Mart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively for younger and more affluent customers as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services.

Investor suits against VW move ahead FRANKFURT, GERMANY Investor lawsuits claiming up to $4.5 billion in damages against Volkswagen over its diesel emissions scandal are moving ahead in German courts. Investors claim that Volkswagen did not inform them in a timely way of the impending scandal over cars with software that enabled them to cheat on emissions tests in the United States, depriving them of a chance to decide whether to sell the stock. The company has reached a $15 billion settlement with U.S. authorities.

According to Detective Lt. JoAnn DiNoto, detectives were in the area of Walmart, 3290 Sheridan Drive at Bailey Avenue, at about 11 a.m. Monday when they discovered what has been deemed “a clandestine drug lab in the storm sewer.” She said upon discovering the lab, which they believe was being used to create methamphetamine drugs, officers and detectives immediately notified area emergency hazardous materials teams. Responding to the scene were Eggertsville firefighters and members from both Brighton Fire Company’s and Clarence Fire Company’s hazardous materials teams. DiNoto added that members of the Buffalo Fire Department, led by Division Chief Patrick Britzzacaro, also responded. “Because they were entering a confined space, the Buffalo Fire Department had members that were certified to go into the confined area,” she said. Members of the state’s Crime Scene Emergency Response Team were also heavily involved at the scene. DiNoto said certified members of the teams remediated the scene, took photographs and removed all of the evidence. “We intend to use all of the evidence we gathered to find the suspect or suspects,” she said. The detective said that at as of Monday night, police did not have a suspect or a person of interest in custody. She added that the discovery of a drug lab within a sewer line is “very, very uncommon” and that police have not determined whether there are other similar types of labs in the area. Hazardous materials officials, firefighters and police officials left the scene at about 4:30 p.m.  Anyone with information that may assist police in their investigation may call 689-1311.

Today the company is making another big bet towards that path by confirming it will be buying Jet.com, online-only shopping site that has been live for a little over a year, for $3 billion in cash plus up to $300 million in shares for Jet founders. The deal is expected to close towards the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval, making this one of the largest-ever acquisitions of an e-commerce company. Jet’s founder Marc Lore will reportedly lead Walmart’s e-commerce operations after the deal closes, replacing Neil Ashe after a transitional period. Lore previously co-founded Diapers.com’s parent company and sold it to Amazon for $550 million in 2011. Walmart currently has 11,527 stores in 28 countries with a total annual revenue of $482 billion and $15 billion in profits last year. E-commerce represents just a drop in the bucket with $14 billion in annual e-commerce sales, a far cry from Amazon’s roughly $100 billion, and its growth rate has reportedly decelerated for five consecutive quarters. With the acquisition of Jet.com the retail giant hopes to reinvigorate online sales. Wal-Mart and Jet plan to maintain distinct brands, with Wal-Mart's website continuing to focus on emphasizing the company's "everyday low price" strategy. While still not profitable and burning through advertising money at a rate of $20 million to $25 million per month to fund its growth, Jet has been adding more than 400,000 new shoppers each month and processes an average of 25,000 orders daily. The site sells more than 12 million products through its own warehouses and a network of third-party sellers. Aside from acquiring a growing e-commerce operation, Walmart is also interested in Jet’s back end technology, which can identify in real time which orders should be routed to which vendors to get the lowest fulfillment and shipping costs and pass some of that savings to customers.

Brown/Getty Images Tech Shira Ovide Shira Ovide is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering technology. She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Aug 8, 2016 3:42 PM EDT FACEBOOK INC-A -1.29 As of 1:45 PM EST 120.18 USD WAL-MART STORES INC +0.63 As of 1:45 PM EST 70.75 USD Walmart is trying to solve its online problems with a $3.3 billion acquisition that can't be justified with any conventional financial analysis.  But for validation of its deal splurge, the folks in Bentonville, Arkansas, can look west to Menlo Park, California. There, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made three overpriced acquisitions that turned out to be the smartest moves the company ever made. Facebook has struck a collective $22 billion worth of acquisitions for Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Facebook issued 279 million shares -- or 10 percent of the company's total outstanding shares as of July 25 -- for three companies that barely had revenue, let alone profits, at the time of the acquisitions. Oculus didn't even really have a product for sale when Facebook agreed to buy the virtual reality startup in 2014. When Facebook agreed to pay up to $19 billion for WhatsApp, the deal was so surprising and costly that some people thought the initial acquisition announcement might be a hoax. Good Buy Of Facebook's four main products with at least 500 million monthly users, two of them are companies Facebook acquired Source: Facebook Note: Monthly user count for Facebook also includes Messenger. Facebook's trio of deals makes Walmart's spending 1.4 percent of its stock market value for Jet seem sane -- as though Walmart bought a sensible Hyundai after a careful reading of Consumer Reports, while Zuckerberg went out for a gallon of milk and happened to come home with a fleet of Ferraris. Yet Facebook's acquisitions have since become foundations for the company's user growth and strategy long into the future. Facebook now has four products with at least 500 million monthly users. Two of those are the acquired Instagram (500 million monthly users) and WhatsApp (more than 1 billion at last disclosure in February).  Of the three, Instagram is the only one that so far has started to carry its weight financially. Research firm MoffettNathanson has estimated Instagram's yearly revenue could reach $3.7 billion in the next few years. Instagram also is Facebook's best chance to blunt the threat from teen favorite Snapchat. The sales and the competitive parry have already more than justified the Instagram purchase.  Oculus is on its way to sanity status, too. The company started selling its first virtual reality headset this year, and Cantor Fitzgerald estimates VR could account for roughly 10 percent of Facebook revenue by 2020.  Freewheeling Deals Facebook has been willing to spend big chunks of its market value on its acqusitions of Instagram, Oculus and WhatsApp Source: Company filings For the moment, Facebook has been appropriately cautious about squeezing money from WhatsApp. The smartphone calling app has dropped its tiny subscription fee, which was WhatsApp's only source of revenue. Executives have talked in broad strokes about how WhatsApp could make money by connecting businesses with their customers -- Delta, for example, might pay WhatsApp to contact frequent fliers left stranded by Monday's flight-system glitch. For a glimpse at the financial potential of WhatsApp's audience, if the app started making one-tenth of Facebook's current average of $3.82 for each user, WhatsApp could churn $382 million in yearly sales.  Of course, the ink is barely dry on Walmart's acquisition contract with Jet, and it remains to be seen whether Walmart has the same acquisition wisdom as Facebook. Plus picking the right deals is only half the battle. The other trick is what happens after the purchase, when the buyer has to integrate a new company's operations with its own or let it carry on with relative independence.  Best Reaction to Facebook's WhatsApp Acquisition “They should call it WTFapp.” Facebook has opted for the light integration approach. It basically set up Instagram, Oculus and WhatsApp as independent fiefs inside of Facebook. Even now, Instagram is the only one of the three that is even marginally part of Facebook's broader advertising sales machine. Based on Walmart's early comments about its Jet deal, the big box retailer plans to leave Jet as an autonomous island and seek to harness Jet executives' experience in e-commerce to help cure Walmart's decades of incompetence in online shopping.  There's an axiom of dealmaking that most corporate acquisitions aren't worth it. But it's interesting that both Google and Facebook -- arguably the two most ascendant of the tech superpowers -- turned acquisitions that looked like expensive head-scratchers into foundations of their tech empires. Just as it would be hard to imagine Facebook without its trio of deals, Google wouldn't be Google without its purchases of DoubleClick and YouTube.   Walmart is all about encouraging shoppers to hunt for good prices. But sometimes expensive deals wind up looking incredibly smart.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. The count of issued shares includes restricted stock doled out to employees of the acquired companies.  I'm less sanguine about Google's priciest purchase, its $10 billion deal for Motorola struck in 2011, and its more recent purchase of thermostat maker Nest Labs.  To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide in New York at sovide@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.net Leaping Deere Leaping Deere Deere shares spiked to a record after the company reported earnings that weren't as awful as expected Source: Bloomberg Overkill Enough Fawning Over Deere Industrials Brooke Sutherland Leaky Roofs Leaky Roofs Foxtons shares have been hit hard by the Brexit vote but have also underperformed web-based peers Source: Bloomberg Fee Fail Tech's Big Chance to Help Generation Rent Real Estate Lionel Laurent That Sounds Gross $1.32 Fine-Tuning AT&T Plays It Forward Tech Rani Molla Annual Revenue From PC Hardware $174 billion Hold the Eulogy Don't Write Off the PC Just Yet Tech Shira Ovide Peaked Interest Peaked Interest The market expectations for a Fed interest rate increase in December have hit 100% Source: Bloomberg Switchback Bond Market's November Surprise Markets Lisa Abramowicz Wrong Way Wrong Way Rocket Internet's shares are far below their initial public offering price Source: Bloomberg Startup Factory Rocket Internet's Trajectory Shift Tech Leila Abboud Back in Black Back in Black The big five panel manufacturers have posted enough profit in 2016 to wipe out two-and-a-half years of aggregate losses Source: Bloomberg Note: Shows aggregate net income for JinkoSolar, Trina Solar, JA Solar, Canadian Solar, and Yingli Green Energy.

NEW YORK, Aug 9 — Working at a startup that gets acquired can feel like winning the lottery. Not working at a startup, but still cashing in on its acquisition, can feel pretty good too, as Eric Martin learned when Jet.com Inc sold to Wal-Mart Stores Inc in a US$3.3 billion (RM13.3 billion) deal. Martin, who works for a custom bath installation company, received 100,000 Jet shares last year when he won a contest to see who could get the most people to sign up for memberships to the online shopping site. He spent US$18,000 on online ads and came away with a stake now worth millions in one of 2015’s buzziest startups. “It feels good; it feels really good,” Martin, a York, Pennsylvania, resident, said in a phone interview during his lunch break. “The way I think to describe it is ‘occasional hysterical laughing.'” Martin, 30, has no idea what his stake is worth, though Fusion reported last year that his shares may be valued from US$10 million to US$20 million. The cash-and-stock sale to Wal-Mart could have boosted that since Jet’s private valuation was pegged at around US$1.5 billion last November, but the company has also raised money since Martin won his shares. That could have reduced the value of his stake because startups sometimes give preferential shares to later-term investors that can squeeze out smaller investors or employees. Martin, who works in digital marketing, said he’s still waiting for Jet to tell him how much his stake is worth, but he’s hoping it’s in the “multi-millions.” Wal-Mart’s purchase gives the world’s largest retailer a way to boost its online offering and better compete with Amazon.com Inc. Jet’s founder, Marc Lore, worked at Amazon for about two years after selling his previous company to the e-commerce behemoth. He founded Jet as a members-only online retailer, aiming to cut prices below even what Amazon could offer. He’s raised more than US$500 million in venture capital. While he waits to find out exactly how rich he is, Martin is thinking about his own startup, Ideadash.com, an online portal that lets people post their ideas for inventions or businesses and get others to execute on them while retaining a stake in the project. “I’m weighing my options,” he said. “I’ve got to take time to process all this.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Merkel ‘not happy’ Trump scrapping Pacific trade deal Lufthansa pilots’ strike wreaks havoc on flight schedule Australia’s Crown Resorts casino staff arrested in China Automakers seek to cut inventories with Black Friday, holiday promotions Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Wal-Mart reviews Welspun records after Target pulls sheets Wal-Mart in talks to buy online retailer Jet.com, says report Wal-Mart to sell China online unit to JD.com for a 5pc stake Bank blunder millionaire spent bulk of A$4.6 million on designer handbags, ‘deluxe vacuum cleaner’ Wal-Mart sues Visa over chip cards in US Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo 1/2 left right Aircraft flies over a Wal-Mart billboard in Mexico City March 24, 2015. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo 2/2 By Nandita Bose Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), vying to better challenge Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), will pay about $3 billion for internet retailer Jet.com and its innovative pricing software in the largest-ever deal for an e-commerce startup. The deal disclosed on Monday follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world's biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. Wal-Mart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. Jet.com was launched by internet entrepreneur Marc Lore in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity. "One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay," Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a media call. McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time in getting the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short-term. "Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent." McMillon said Lore would run its new U.S. e-commerce business. Lore had cofounded Quidsi, the owner of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon. "Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive," McMillon said. Wal-Mart's current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year. The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients. Wal-Mart said it would pay around $3 billion (2 billion pounds) in cash and $300 million in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet's revenue of about $500 million, the cash purchase price represents six times Jet's revenue, according to analysts. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said the acquisition gives Wal-Mart a leg-up on competitors in the race to be the No. 2 online retailer, citing the size of Jet.com's online offerings and number of customers. Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly. "The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," he said. In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China's 2 e-commerce firm. BILLIONS SPENT ON ONLINE EFFORTS Wal-Mart's first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart's online sales rose 12.3 percent to $13.7 billion, compared with a 16 percent jump to $92.4 billion for Amazon.com. Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said. Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT The largest-ever acquisition of an e-commerce company likely won't be enough for Wal-Mart (WMT) to dethrone Amazon (AMZN). But there's no shame in playing for second. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.73 +0.61 +0.87% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.81 -6.52 -0.83% In a bid to juice its online business, the world's largest retailer agreed Monday to purchase Jet.com in a $3.3 billion deal. The acquisition will beef up Wal-Mart's e-commerce prowess, from deepening its bench of talent to finding the cheapest way to ship online orders. These capabilities should help Wal-Mart grab a larger piece of the growing e-commerce pie. They're also the best chance it has of closing the wide — and growing — gap between it and Amazon, analysts said. "Amazon's got this huge lead. That lead is going to be tough to relinquish but there's a lot of [share] out there," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea told CNBC. Amazon's North America sales topped $62 billion last year. Forrester estimates the company grew its U.S. retail business by $23 billion, accounting for roughly 60 percent of total digital sales growth here. Those numbers are enviable, especially among its bricks-and-mortar competitors. Still, with Forrester calling for $373 billion in online revenue in the U.S. this year, "there's room for everybody to grow," O'Shea said. "These guys aren't just kind of sitting there and letting the world do what it wants to do," O'Shea said. Though Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth its slowing, its $13.6 billion in digital revenue already make it the second-largest online retailer. Yet even if it remains in second place, Jet is still worth the hefty price tag, analysts said. "I think they're playing for first and they may have a chance at it, but even if they take second place, there's a broad [range]," said Drew Carter, a managing director at AlixPartners. For instance, if an acquisition pumps Wal-Mart's digital growth from, say, 10 percent to 15 percent, "it's probably worthwhile," he said. © Provided by CNBC Buying Jet was necessary for Wal-Mart to have a shot at catching Amazon, Carter said. Not only does the online brand give Wal-Mart a fresh roster of digital talent, it can also help the company fine-tune its shipping and online logistics — a crucial part of preserving margins. Jet's co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will lead both Jet and Wal-Mart.com, bringing his vast e-commerce experience as a co-founder of Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, which was sold to Amazon. These factors outweigh the fact that Jet is not yet profitable, Carter said. "The potentially dilutive nature of the Jet acquisition, that's very short term," he said. "The long-term value is buying their way into this expertise." On a call with reporters Monday afternoon, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said his company would help Jet become profitable more quickly than it could on its own. O'Shea added that the lofty $3.3 billion price tag makes sense for Wal-Mart to pay, as it shifts its capital expenditures from its bricks-and-mortar stores to the web. Even as the company invests in its online operations and higher wages, it's spending less capital overall. The retailer's capital expenditures budget for the five years ended January 2012 was roughly $15.5 billion, during which time it opened more than 3,000 stores, O'Shea said. That compares with $14.6 billion over the last four years, when it only opened 1,000 stores. Many of those were smaller format, making them less capital intensive. Wal-Mart had $7.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter. The company's shares were slightly lower, near $73, in afternoon trading. The world's largest retailer said a portion of the $3 billion it's paying for Jet, along with $300 million in Wal-Mart shares, will be spent over time. Terms of those payments were not disclosed. The deal is expected to close this year, subject to regulatory approval. After the deal closes, Wal-Mart and Jet plan to maintain distinct brands, with Wal-Mart's website continuing to focus on emphasizing the company's "everyday low price" strategy, while Jet.com provides a curated experience that targets millennials. Although Jet has been operating its site for only a little more than a year, it has already reached $1 billion in run-rate gross merchandise value, and boasts a growing customer base of urban and millennial customers. The site says it has been adding more than 400,000 new shoppers each month and processes an average of 25,000 orders daily. In an attempt to dethrone Amazon, Jet uses an algorithm that it promises will deliver lower prices. Customers can save by buying in bulk from the site, or by forgoing the chance to make a return. The company originally planned to charge a $50 annual fee, but that was quickly nixed. "We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across [our] priorities," McMillon said. "Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time. Our customers will win. It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart." —CNBC's Courtney Reagan contributed to this report Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from CNBC CNBC View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

The hefty price underscores how Wal-Mart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively for younger and more affluent customers as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services. As part of the deal, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will oversee both that site and walmart.com, and will report to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Lore brings to the role a rich e-commerce resume as founder of Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, which was bought by Amazon for $500 million in 2010. FILE - In this Thursday, Sept. 19, 2013, file photo, reusable shopping bags are offered for sale at a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market, in the Chinatown district of Los Angeles. Wal-Mart announced Monday, Aug. 8, 2016, that the company has agreed to buy fast-growing online retail newcomer Jet.com, which had launched with a splash in 2015 when it announced its intention to challenge online leader Amazon. The deal underscores how serious Wal-Mart is about igniting its online business, which has been slowing even as it has been making big investments in new distribution centers and expanding services. (AP Photo/Nick Ut, File) Analysts say the acquisition still won't enable Wal-Mart to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help narrow that gap and should widen the distance between Wal-Mart and other online retailers. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com of making it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups, with Hudson's Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchasing flash-sales site Gilt Group and Bed, Bath & Beyond buying One Kings Lane. While not a startup, Wal-Mart itself announced in June that it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. "This acquisition in tandem with its joint venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Wal-Mart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," said Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Shea. "As we believe 'catching' Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg up on its competitors in the very important race to be No. 2 online." As part of the deal, which Wal-Mart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will maintain separate brands — for now. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company's low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast. It has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Wal-Mart says it will incorporate some of Jet.com's "smart" technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. It is built on a pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping and adjusts prices based on what items are in the checkout cart, as well as how far the desired products are from the shopper's home. So shoppers are encouraged to add more to build a more efficient cart and buy items labeled "smart cart" for more savings. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, the deal should help accelerate its path to profitability. McMillon said Wal-Mart customers likely will see lower prices and new brands aimed at millennials that have been carried by Jet.com. Wal-Mart customers may also have more control over creating their own basket to save money. "We have some cool ideas on how the two brands can work together over time," he said. As for perhaps merging the two sites eventually, McMillon said Wal-Mart wants to be thoughtful about how it approaches that. "This is about winning over time," he said. Lore cited the benefits of Wal-Mart's purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with Jet.com's team and technology. Jet.com, which touts its service, delivers to two-thirds of the country overnight in its purple boxes. In some high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often can offer same-day delivery at no additional cost. Lore told The Associated Press that he can see helping Wal-Mart with speeding up shipping, among other things. "I'm definitely in this for the long haul," Lore said. He said he was introduced to McMillon this past spring. In its fiscal year ended in January, Wal-Mart had online sales of $13.7 billion, a fraction of its total revenue of $482.1 billion. And its online figure pales in comparison to Amazon.com's annual net revenue of $107 billion. O'Shea noted that Apple.com is the only brick-and-mortar retailer that outranks Wal-Mart in online sales in the U.S. But Wal-Mart reported in May that global e-commerce sales rose 7 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 8 percent in the previous quarter and far below the 20 percent increases seen less than two years ago. So it trimmed its free-shipping pilot program ShippingPass to two-day delivery from three and cut a dollar off the membership to $49 a year in an attempt to answer Amazon's Prime program. But while Amazon's Prime membership costs $99 a year, it comes with a lot of perks like streaming music and video and household subscriptions. O'Shea noted Wal-Mart is "paying a lot" for Jet.com, but it was too soon to say if it overpaid. Shares of Wal-Mart slipped 42 cents to close at $73.34 Monday. Its shares are up 3 percent over the past year. ___ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio on Twitter at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio FILE - In this Monday, May 2, 2016, file photo, Jet.com CEO Marc Lore speaks during an interview in Hoboken, N.J.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Aug 8, 2016 at 5:25PM While hundreds of companies will report quarterly results in August, there are two that stand out. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the leader in the graphics card market, will need to keep up its recent pace of growth in order to justify its increasingly lofty valuation. And brick-and-mortar retail giant Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), faced with a tectonic shift toward e-commerce, has its hands full returning to earnings growth while taking on the Amazon.com juggernaut. Here's what investors need to know about these two companies. The graphics card king Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA has consolidated its lead in the discrete graphics card market over the past two years, claiming a nearly 80% unit market share during the first quarter and leaving Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with the scraps. At the same time, NVIDIA's push into the data center, pitching its GPUs as ideal accelerators for artificial intelligence and machine learning tasks, has created a fast-growing business for the company. NVIDIA will report its second-quarter results after the market close on Aug. 11. The stock has been on fire over the past year, up about 175%, as investors have increasingly bet that the company's profits will soar in the future. NVIDIA is at the center of a buzzword trifecta -- artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and self-driving cars -- and investors can't get enough of the company's stock. With NVIDIA stock now trading for more than 50 times last year's earnings, the company will need to impress when it reports its second-quarter results. Sales of its high-end gaming GPUs have been consistently strong, and that's unlikely to change with AMD offering no real alternative at the moment. But further market share gains will be tough, especially with AMD going after the mainstream portion of the market aggressively. And NVIDIA's growth businesses, including data center and automotive, are still small relative to the core PC GPU business. With the stock priced at an optimistic level, NVIDIA will need to show that it can produce the earnings growth that investors are expecting. Everyday low prices Image source: Wal-Mart. Retail behemoth Wal-Mart expects its earnings to decline during the second quarter, results for which it will announce on Aug. 18. The company has been making major investments in higher wages for its employees, new training programs, and e-commerce, sacrificing profits in the short-term in an effort to drive growth and customer satisfaction in the long-term. Wal-Mart expects to produce between $0.95 and $1.08 in per-share earnings, compared to $1.08 during the second quarter of last year. Already, some of these initiatives are bearing fruit. The U.S. business has reported positive comparable sales for seven quarters in a row, and customer service scores are improving. The e-commerce business is growing, albeit slowly, as Wal-Mart expands initiatives like its ShippingPass program and its online grocery pickup service. Wal-Mart's $3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet demonstrates how much of a priority online sales have become for the company. Jet launched last year to substantial buzz, promising to undercut Amazon on price by offering discounts based on how many items shoppers buy. With the Jet acquisition, Wal-Mart is following the same strategy that it always has -- offering the lowest prices possible. Investors shouldn't expect much improvement when it comes to profitability anytime soon, as Wal-Mart doesn't expect meaningful earnings growth to return until fiscal 2019. But the company needs to keep showing progress, particularly positive comparable sales growth in its U.S. business. A surprise drop in sales would likely undo some of the stock's gains this year.

Aug 9 2016 at 8:32 AM Updated Aug 9 2016 at 3:02 PM Save article Print Wal-Mart pays $US3.3b, record sum, for Jet.com as it goes big into e-commerce Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Wal-Mart' is one of a number of major US corporations to comment to renewable energy targets. Luke Sharrett by Leslie Picker and Rachel Abrams Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, is buying Jet.com, the year-old online bulk retailer, for $US3.3 billion ($4.3 billion), the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company. The purchase, and a shuffling in the executive ranks that comes with it, are Wal-Mart's clearest acknowledgments yet that its online strategy is not working. It also sends a strong message to the rest of the consumer and retail industry: When it comes to competing against Amazon, not even the mightiest brick-and-mortar stores can go at it alone. "The other retailers are going to be looking up to it and saying, 'You know, absolutely, we've been failing at doing this,'" said Jharonne Martis, a retail analyst at Thomson Reuters. "Bringing in an expert might be the key to it." Overall, Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales have stalled. The online business grew just 7 per cent last quarter, a number that Doug McMillon, the company's president and chief executive, acknowledged at the time was "too slow." Most recently, the company has focused much of its online strategy on expanding its curbside grocery pickup business. Jet is perhaps best known for an algorithm that encourages bulk buying, an area where Walmart.com has fallen short and could energise its sagging online growth.

View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements 400,000 new users Wal-Mart said Jet offered it access to "urban and millennial customers," two groups that the retailer's large rural footprint has been slow to attract. Wal-Mart said on Monday that Jet had added more than 400,000 users monthly. Jet says it uses a complex formula to offer items 10 to 15 per cent less than competitors by adjusting prices based on the quantity of products bought at once. The company relies heavily on suppliers, and Wal-Mart offers more pricing power and potentially better distribution operations through its vast network of warehouses across the country. Still, the $US3.3 billion figure is eye-popping, given that Jet.com started selling products barely a year ago. Wal-Mart is not valuing Jet.com solely based on traditional metrics like profitability, which the startup does not have. The retailer is spending billions in cash and stock in large part for something or someone else: Marc Lore. Lore, a serial e-commerce entrepreneur who started Jet.com, is seen as one of the few executives who can help put a dent in Amazon's edge. "If you looked at Jet from a fundamentals perspective, the company wouldn't be worth what they're paying for it," said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights, a research firm covering venture capital. "They're trying to inject Marc and probably some of the veterans on his team, and try and help Wal-Mart figure this out." Lore, 46, will take over responsibility for Walmart.com in the United States and will continue running Jet, which will operate separately, McMillon said in a call with reporters. Wal-Mart will be "thoughtful" about how it merges the two companies, and will focus on expanding both brands in the short-term, he said. 'Innovative business models' Lore will replace Wal-Mart's current top e-commerce executive, Neil Ashe, who will leave the company. McMillon said that now was the "natural inflection point" for a leadership change and praised Ashe for doing an "outstanding" job building the company's online business. Lore co-founded a company, Quidsi, that grew into a collection of e-commerce websites, including Diapers.com and Soap.com. The company was sold to Amazon in 2010 for more than $US500 million. He stayed at Amazon for two years, then left to figure out a new project. Investors lined up to back Lore on his next venture, Jet.com. He raised more than $US200 million before the company sold a single product, and more than $US500 million overall. In the latest funding in November, the company was valued at $US1.5 billion, according to data compiled by CB Insights. He is seen as someone who can bring a unique approach when it comes to e-commerce, according to Adam Silverman, an analyst at Forrester, a research firm. "Marc has been a creative force within the industry, creating pretty innovative business models, including Jet.com," Silverman said in a phone interview. "He's proven that he can create businesses from scratch, and Wal-Mart needs a bit of that entrepreneurship within their e-commerce business." Under the terms of the deal, Wal-Mart will pay $US3 billion in cash, a portion of which will be distributed to Jet.com stakeholders over time, while $US300 million will be paid in Wal-Mart stock over time, according to a statement released by the companies Monday. Wal-Mart said that while it would incorporate some of Jet's ideas and talent into Walmart.com, Jet would remain a separate brand, too. Yet both sites will continue to face a daunting reality: Amazon.com continues to wallop the competition. Amazon does more business online than any other retailer, yet still reports double-digit growth. In 2015, Amazon reported that net product sales rose 13 per cent to $US79.3 billion, while Wal-Mart reported that global annual e-commerce revenue had risen 12 per cent, to $US13.7 billion, in its latest fiscal year. For Wal-Mart, buying Jet may not be about beating Amazon at its own game, according to Charlie O'Shea, the lead retail analyst for Moody's. "We view this as a race for second," O'Shea said. "Amazon's lead is so great that it's going to be virtually impossible to catch them, but you can compete with them."

(Associated Press files) By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO, Associated Press Published: August 8, 2016, 4:25 PM A   A NEW YORK — Wal-Mart is buying fast-growing online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, scooping up a newcomer that launched a year ago with the intention of challenging online leader Amazon. The hefty price underscores how Wal-Mart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively for younger and more affluent customers as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services. As part of the deal, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will oversee both that site and walmart.com, and will report to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Lore brings to the role a rich e-commerce resume as founder of Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, which was bought by Amazon for $500 million in 2010. Analysts say the acquisition still won’t enable Wal-Mart to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help narrow that gap and should widen the distance between Wal-Mart and other online retailers. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com of making it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups, with Hudson’s Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchasing flash-sales site Gilt Group and Bed, Bath & Beyond buying One Kings Lane. While not a startup, Wal-Mart itself announced in June that it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. “This acquisition in tandem with its joint venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Wal-Mart is attacking online retail with significant zeal,” said Moody’s lead retail analyst Charlie O’Shea. “As we believe ‘catching’ Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg up on its competitors in the very important race to be No. 2 online.” As part of the deal, which Wal-Mart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will maintain separate brands — for now. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company’s low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s pending acquisition of Jet.com Inc. impacts more than just the two retailers in talks—it also affects the roughly 3,000 merchants that sell on the retailers’ online marketplaces. Wal-Mart on Monday announced plans to acquire 1-year-old online marketplace Jet in a cash and stock deal valued at $3.3 billion. While Wal-Mart is best-known as the world’s largest retailer by revenue and has an online presence that brought in $13.7 billion in sales last year, it also has a much smaller online marketplace business that allows outside merchants to sell on its e-commerce site, similar to business models operated by Jet, Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc. Wal-Mart has about 600 retailers and brands selling on Walmart.com as marketplace sellers, Internet Retailer estimates. Jet has more than 2,400 merchants selling on its site. Wal-Mart says Jet will continue to operate as its own distinct brand, for now.

Wal-Mart and Jet make a good couple but should remain separate entities, says Jason Boyce, co-founder and CEO of online sporting goods retailer Dazadi Inc. While the two companies tout their low-priced products, Jet does it “a lot sexier than Wal-Mart,” Boyce says. Dazadi, No. 673 in the Internet Retailer 2016 Second 500 Guide, sells on several online marketplaces in addition to its e-commerce site, Dazadi.com. Online marketplace sales represented 65% of its $16.2 million in revenue in 2015. “Both companies offer low prices, but Jet’s branding ‘makes it OK’ to bargain shop,” Boyce says. “Our preference would be to keep the sites separate. If Jet and Wal-Mart were to combine under the Wal-Mart flag, they would lose a lot of Jet customers,” he says. 52.4% of Walmart.com’s shoppers have an annual household income of $60,000 or less, according to Top500Guide.com data.    In addition, rolling Jet under the Wal-Mart brand may hurt some merchants because of how the Wal-Mart brand is perceived compared with the Jet brand. E-retailer OrthoticShop.com, for instance, only offers some of its inventory on Walmart.com, in contrast to Jet, where it offers its full product assortment. It’s not by choice, though. Some manufacturers of OrthoticShop’s products don’t allow the company to sell their products on Walmart.com, says Matt Behnke, president of the comfort footwear retailer. “There’s still this stigma that Wal-Mart equals ‘cheap,’” Behnke says. “Some manufacturers thinks selling on Wal-Mart cheapens their brand.” OrthoticShop began selling on Wal-Mart this year, and Behnke says there have been a few instances where manufacturers have asked them to take down the manufacturers’ products that the retailer was selling on Walmart.com. This has never happened for any products that it sells on Jet, but it has occurred on other marketplaces such as those operated by eBay and Sears Holdings Corp., he says. OrthoticShop.com brings in about $10 million in sales and generates about 60% of its revenue from its sales on Amazon and about 30% on its own website. OrthoticShop.com’s typical daily revenue from Jet has ranged from $1,000- to 1,800 since it began selling on the marketplace earlier this year. On the other hand, Nathan Gordon, chief information officer of online retailer Christmas Central, says that combining the brands wouldn’t make much of a difference to the e-retailer because the marketplace is still small.  “So much of our marketplace sales comes from Wal-Mart and Amazon alone that if we stopped selling on Jet, our customers would just find our products somewhere else,” Gordon says.   Christmas Central sells its 109,000 SKUs on 11 marketplaces, including Wal-Mart and Jet, and about 75% of its revenue comes through those marketplaces. Wal-Mart’s marketplace sales have outpaced Christmas Central’s sales on Amazon thus far in 2016, Gordon says. The e-retailer of seasonal merchandise, No. 534 in the Top 1000, says it hasn’t found that its customers differ across shopping portals. “When we first started selling on Wal-Mart, they told us that the average order value will be lower than other sites. But we found that customers buy the same items they do on our site and Amazon. They were not afraid to spend $1,000 on Walmart.com,” Gordon says. Wal-Mart’s marketplace has quickly increased the number of merchants in the last couple months, adding 100 new sellers in May and 150 merchants in June, with hundreds more expected to be added by the holidays, Seth Beal, the retailer’s senior vice president of global marketplace, told Internet Retailer last month. Wal-Mart offers 11 million products online and plans to add 1 million items per month to the assortment, primarily through its marketplace, Beal says.

The deal was disclosed on Monday, with Walmart paying close to $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares, Reuters reports. Launched in July 2015, Jet.com's software offers customers lower prices as they add items to their cart. "One of the things we really like is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Monday during a media call. The company is looking to challenge Amazon, and has already purchased 15 startups over the last five years. Jet.com's revenue is about $500 million, and its founder, Marc Lore, will stay on to run Walmart's new U.S. e-commerce business. Walmart said it plans to keep Jet.com a separate entity from Walmart.com, which will embrace Jet.com's software. Catherine Garcia   Walmart to acquire Jet.com for $3 billion August 8, 2016 sad trombone Edit Fewer shoppers expected in stores for Black Friday 1:41 p.m. ET   iStock Bargain hunters just aren't feeling the same sense of urgency around Black Friday this year. Only 23 percent of U.S. adults say they plan to visit stores on the country's biggest shopping day, Bankrate reports. Those that do venture out, though, are expected to spend more than ever, with median spending at $300 this year, up from $200 in 2014, Fortune writes. Holiday sales are expected to increase by 4.7 percent. Many other shoppers are focused on online deals, or have been purchasing gifts throughout the month. "Two years ago, Black Friday was one day. Last year it was a week-long event. This year it's been a month-long event,” said Shelley Kohan, vice president of retail consulting at RetailNext. "A lot of Black Friday deals are already out there. They've been out there since the beginning of the month." Jeva Lange   Fewer shoppers expected in stores for Black Friday 1:41 p.m. employing vets Edit Veterans made up 44 percent of all federal government hires last year 1:23 p.m. ET   iStock Veterans made up 44 percent of the nearly 120,000 full-time hires the federal government made in 2015, The Washington Post reports. That's in keeping with a larger trend: The share of veterans among new government hires has stayed relatively constant since the Obama administration pledged in 2009 to give former veterans preferential consideration for job openings, with that number hovering around 45 percent for at least the last five years. Some areas of government hired more veterans than others: A full 62 percent of Air Force new recruits last year had military backgrounds, as opposed to 46 percent at the State Department and 21 percent at the Environmental Protection Agency. Due to the special treatment given to former military applicants, some federal offices have seen tensions arise among veteran and non-veteran employees and resentment among non-veterans who don't get the jobs, The Post reports. Some government experts also contend the policy "fails to give the government the best talent in real time." However, efforts to soften hiring advantages — such as a change to a military policy bill pushed by former service member Sen. John McCain — have been shut down thanks to veterans lobbying efforts. Kelly Gonsalves   Veterans made up 44 percent of all federal government hires last year 1:23 p.m. silly millennials Edit Young workers are actually more exhausted by their jobs than older employees 1:19 p.m. ET   iStock Many employers probably assume that younger workers have more energy than their older colleagues, theoretically making youngsters more productive employees. But a recent survey of over 10,000 laborers found more people under the age of 45 (43 percent) say they are exhausted at work than those over age 45 (35 percent). The least exhausted workers are those over 60. The researchers point to the changing nature of people's working lives. The human lifespan keeps increasing — and therefore so do the number of years individuals spend in the workforce as retirement costs add up. That longer working life is dismantling the "traditional three-stage life of full-time education, full-time work, and full-time retirement"; it rarely all happens quite so separately or in that exact order. Now employees of all ages are embracing "a multi-stage life that blends education, exploration, and learning, as well as corporate jobs, freelance gigs, and time spent out of the workforce." That blending of life stages leads to more intergenerational overlap and interaction, with work behaviors and attitudes becoming more "age agnostic." Old stereotypes don't really apply anymore, if they ever did. "When corporations believe that older workers invest less in their knowledge [...] and are on a path to physical decline and exhaustion," the researchers say, "they make the wrong decisions about whom to select, promote and develop, and whom to retire." Kelly Gonsalves   Young workers are actually more exhausted by their jobs than older employees 1:19 p.m. This just in Edit Donald Trump appoints Betsy DeVos as education secretary 1:19 p.m. ET   Donald Trump has appointed Michigan GOP philanthropist Betsy DeVos as education secretary, The Detroit News reports. DeVos, 58, has long been an advocate of expanding charter schools and voucher programs, seeing eye-to-eye with Trump on his pledge to promote school choice. "Betsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate," Trump said in a statement. "Under her leadership, we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families." DeVos said she was honored to help "make American education great again."

DeVos supports Common Core curriculum standards, which have been heavily criticized by opponents, including Trump, who called the program a "total disaster" and vowed to get rid of it. Trump has additionally promised to make education "local" as well as to create a $20 billion block grant to expand charter and private school options for low-income students.

The talks, held before the U.S. election, were attended by 30 people including diplomats, politicians, and businessmen and were hosted by French think tank founders Fabien Baussart and his wife, Randa Kassis, both of whom have worked closely with the Kremlin on the topic of Syria. President Barack Obama ended talks with Russia on Syria last month when a Russian-backed bombing campaign targeted the city of Aleppo. Russia has been repeatedly accused of committing war crimes in the country. President-elect Donald Trump has argued that allying with Russia and backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would be a quicker route to defeating ISIS and stabilizing the Middle East. Kassis said that in her conversation with Donald Trump Jr., she communicated "how we can cooperate together." Kassis also reportedly discussed her conversation with Donald Trump Jr. with senior Russian officials, including the deputy head of Russia's foreign ministry. The foreign ministry did not comment. Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said in an email to The Wall Street Journal that Donald Trump Jr.'s interactions with Kassis were limited. "Don was addressing a roundtable in Paris, and [Kassis] was present for that talk and at a group dinner for 30 people. This event featured a number of opinion leaders from all over the world who were interested in the U.S. elections," Conway said.

David Williams, 46, of Ellenwood, was booked with aggravated battery, attempted carjacking and attempted second degree kidnapping, according to the Hammond Police Department. Williams is accused in the Aug. 2 incident at the Wal-Mart Supercenter at 2799 W. Thomas St. At about 11 p.m. that night, a woman who was getting into her car in the parking lot was confronted by a man who blocked her from closing the car door and put a knife to her chest, police said. A witness who was parked next to the woman's car intervened and the man ran away toward U.S. 190. The woman was treated at the scene for cuts. Hammond Police sought the public help to identify the attacker. At about 1 p.m. Monday, police received a tip that the suspect in the attack was walking near South Baptist Road and Old Baton Rouge Highway. Police officers and Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's deputies responded and sought information from the man, who was identified as Williams. Detectives learned that Williams had been released from prison last year after serving 10 years for armed robbery. He confessed to the incident at Wal-Mart and said he was attempting to take the victim's car to go back to Georgia, police said. follow us Twitter Facebook LInkedIn Google+ Pinterest Tumblr special report The New Orleans Gun Pipeline An exploration of the complex, violent ecosystem that keeps New Orleans criminals armed.

Walmart  WMT  has closed its buyout of private e-commerce firm Jet.com for $3.3 billion in cash and WMT shares. South African retailer Steinhoff has announced it will purchase Mattress Firm  MFRM  for $3.8 billion. Shares of MFRM has shot up 114% in pre-market trading . The Mattress Firm deal gives the South African holding firm access to the U.S. market, and it is paying a high premium for the privilege at $64 share. The buyout includes the purchase of some debt. Walmart's move helps give the U.S.'s biggest retailer (not counting Amazon [ AMZN ]) a more robust presence in online sales. This buyout had been expected for awhile, and now the other shoe has finally dropped. Walmart is up slightly ahead of the bell. Delta Air Lines  DAL  has experienced a massive computer system outage that has left customers stranded all around the world this morning. Though improvements appear to be forthcoming, already so many cancellations have occurred this morning that Delta has announced there will also be a refund program put into place for any customers whose flights have been cackled or "significantly delayed." Delta shares have dropped a percentage point in the pre-market. Index futures are again in positive territory ahead of today's market open, partly on strength in oil. Friday saw prices rise 2%, and both WTI and Brent indexes are showing oil prices north of $42 a barrel. As we saw when oil collapsed going back to last year, the effect this commodity has on any number of seemingly unrelated industries is staggering. Oil prices staying buoyed above $40 per barrel would indicate a bit of relief for the markets overall, even with the S&P 500 trading at record highs. Q2 earnings season has begun to dwindle as August progresses, but we did see a top- and bottom-line beat from Tyson Foods  TSN this morning. Earnings of $1.21 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus of $1.07, and the large-cap food company also topped expectations on the top line. Shares are up 3% ahead of the opening bell.

Why would Walmart pay such a premium for a startup that was unprofitable and just a year old? One hypothesis was that Walmart may have been competing against other bidders for Jet — possibly Alibaba or even Google. Turns out that was not the case, Jet CEO Marc Lore told Recode in an interview Monday afternoon. “This was about trust between Doug and I,” Lore said in reference to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, noting that the conversations between the two sides began in the spring. “It never occurred to me to go out and get another offer, quite honestly,” he added. A person familiar with the talks confirmed Lore’s account. As part of the deal, Lore will take over as head of Walmart.com in addition to Jet, as Recode first reported Sunday evening. Neil Ashe, Walmart’s CEO of global e-commerce, will depart at the end of Walmart’s fiscal year. In a conference call with reporters, McMillon outlined why Walmart found Jet so valuable. It was a combination of the speed of the shopping site’s growth (a $1 billion annualized sales volume run rate within eight months of launch); the expertise of the exec team led by Lore that is joining Walmart in the deal; and the proprietary pricing and back-end technology that is expected to eventually be used in some capacity on Walmart.com. McMillon also spoke of the “empowerment” of shoppers in Jet’s model; customers earn bigger discounts on bigger orders and can earn additional savings by forfeiting their right to return an item or paying with a debit card instead of credit card. For Lore, the opportunity to join forces with the world’s largest retailer was too good to pass up, he said. It actually almost happened five years ago, but Walmart was outbid by Amazon in the acquisition of Lore’s last startup, Diapers.com parent company Quidsi. “It gives us the benefit of scale, and I’m really excited to carry this vision out over the next five to 10-plus years,” Lore said of the Jet sale. “This is a historic, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me and the team.” Both McMillon and Lore said Jet.com will achieve profitability much more quickly under Walmart than it otherwise would have. The startup is currently spending $20 million to $25 million a month on advertising. Lore also disputed the notion that the sale goes against the ambitious plans for Jet he laid out time and time again in the press. “I never once said it had to be a standalone business,” he said. “This is an opportunity to have that vision come to fruition even sooner.” recode_divider More From Recode Donald Trump told Tim Cook that Apple is going to ‘build a big plant’ in the U.S. Post-election ‘terror and hysteria’ over Trump is not justified, says Observer editor Ken Kurson Recode Daily: Facebook built a censorship tool that could help it get back into China Can the journalists who work for Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner still cover the White House fairly?

REUTERS/John Gress/Files Bloomberg News Aug 8, 2016 at 3:42 pm | Print View Wal-Mart Stores agreed to buy e-commerce start-up Jet.com for about $3.3 billion, giving the world’s largest retailer the resources for a stronger shopping website to compete with market leader Amazon.com. The deal includes $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares that will be paid over time, the world’s largest retailer said Monday in a statement. Acquiring Jet.com of Hoboken, N.J., which achieved a $1 billion gross merchandise run rate in a little more than a year, gives Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart a website that processes an average of 25,000 orders a day and is adding 400,000 shoppers monthly. The move is Wal-Mart’s biggest attempt yet to chase down Amazon, which has dominated e-commerce in much the same way that Wal-Mart has ruled brick-and-mortar retail. Wal-Mart already had spent billions expanding its online operation, including hiring thousands of workers, opening two offices in Silicon Valley, and building large e-commerce distribution centers. It also started an annual subscription service similar to Amazon Prime, at half the price, but still trails the e-commerce behemoth in online sales. “Wal-Mart has definitely put its stake in the ground saying, ‘We’re going to be winning in e-commerce,’” said Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group. “Amazon should be concerned about what Wal-Mart is doing.” Jet.com has distinguished itself in e-commerce through “gain sharing” — luring buyers to add items to their orders to reduce shipping costs, and to pay with debit instead of credit cards to reduce transaction fees. Traditional store-based mass retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp. have been struggling to fend off Amazon’s momentum in online shopping. The deal gives Wal-Mart control over Jet.com’s proprietary technology and its customer database. Wal-Mart’s online sales were about $14 billion last year, 14 percent of Amazon’s product and service revenues of $99 billion. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said last month that the company’s online operation has taken too long to grow. Your next Business articles Many Eastern Iowa retailers opening door ...

By Erika Morphy | Aug 8, 2016 CHANNEL: Digital Marketing After a week of rumors, Walmart has confirmed that it is indeed buying Jet.com, an e-commerce site headquartered in Hoboken, N.J, that launched in 2014 with high hopes of competing with Amazon. That never happened — and the site has been unprofitable since its launch. On paper, though, it looks damn good. There is Jet.com's unique price model and underlying technology, not to mention the pedigree of its CEO. Briefly, Jet.com's model adjusts prices downward the more people add to their carts. It can do this because it sources its products from all over the country and bases the prices on the customer's location from the source. Thus, Jet.com is able to both save on transportation costs and maximize the cart's total sales. And because the site was built to adjust the prices as the products are added into or subtracted from the cart, it is by necessity lightning fast. Then there is the CEO Marc Lore. Before founding Jet.com, Lore co-founded Quidsi, the parent company of Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon for $545 million in 2011. He spent two years at Amazon before moving on to launch Jet.com. So while Jet.com may have been unprofitable — and many start ups are — it clearly was valuable enough for Walmart to acquire for the tidy sum of $3.3 billion, $3 billion of which will be in cash, to augment its own online sales operations. Now all that is left for Walmart to do is slip Jet.com into its already extensive e-commerce operations and finally begin to make some headway in this area. Right? Unfortunately, not quite. An Uphill Battle For starters, with any merger or acquisition there is the more-than-distinct prospect that its value will ultimately not be realized, usually because of a culture clash between the two companies. If Walmart and Jet.com — an immense corporate retailer and a fledgling tech start up — are able to make this marriage work it will surely be an M&A studied for years to come. It is also noteworthy that Jet.com's customer base does not align with Walmart's customers, which could be a point in the deal's favor — or a reason why it was unable to meld its practices with Walmart. Jet.com buyers are more likely than other online buyers to have incomes greater than $150,000 a year, according to NPD Checkout Tracking data. It also reports that only a fifth of Jet.com buyers have purchased from Walmart.com in the most recent 6-month period and that Jet.com buyers spent more of their online dollars on Baby Products, Pet Supplies, Home & Kitchen, Tools & Home Improvement and Health & Beauty compared to non-Jet.com buyers. As it happens, Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at The NPD Group, sees this mismatch as a plus. The Jet.com acquisition puts Walmart in the bigger game of online retailing of the future and it brings consumers from outside traditional retail, he said.  "Omni channel moves to omni presence." Too Slow But perhaps the biggest headwind facing a successfully combined Walmart.com and Jet.com is the fact that Walmart hasn’t really been able to succeed at e-commerce to date despite investing millions of dollars on cutting edge start ups via WalmartLabs.  It has, over the years, acquired OneRiot,  Kosmix,  Adchemy  and OneOps to name just a few examples. And yet for its first quarter of fiscal 2017, which it released in May 2016, CEO Doug McMillon reported that on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales grew 7%. That was too slow, he flat out said in the earnings call. "We can see progress against several of the necessary capabilities we need to win in e-commerce but we are still working on a few others. We need them all to come together to see stronger growth," he said. So what exactly is the problem? Two Completely Different Mindsets Joel Citron, director of Advertising Technology at Ai Media Group, a New York City-based digital strategy company, chalks it up to a different mindset between a brick-and-mortar company and an online retailer. "They have very different ways of engaging with the customer," he said. Now here is where Jet.com can clearly help Walmart — it continuously engages with the customer, far more so than Amazon. Every time a customer puts an item into his cart, the site engages with him, Citron told CMSWire. "It will tell you, for example, 'all you need is to buy another $10 to get your total price down to $75.'" Is the secret sauce that Walmart.com has been missing? Possibly, but Citron also agrees that it is unusual for a retailer to have such a huge chunk of the brick-and-mortar sales and such as small percentage of online sales. "Maybe Walmart won't be able to successfully integrate Jet.com in the end," he said. But, then maybe it can. Besides the pricing engine, which automatically builds in engagement as well as maximized cart sales, that $3.3 billion purchase price includes Lore's expertise. Lore will be staying on at Walmart.com for two years as part of the deal.  "He has a great reputation plus those two years at Amazon," Citron said. "If anyone can turn Walmart.com around it is Lore." "We couldn’t be more thrilled to start the next leg of this journey." -@marcericlore pic.twitter.com/PWuvtYJDqK — Jet (@Jet) August 8, 2016 Title image "shopping cart harmonic convergence II" (CC BY 2.0) by  Paul L Dineen  0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers 7 Big Problems with the Internet of Things Dropbox Is Reinventing Itself to Win More Love From IT The Collaboration Community's Big Dirty Productivity Secret Simplicity is the Future of Customer Engagement Why You Can't Afford to Ignore Customer Marketing Hacking Marketing: Out With the Old, In With the New Marketing Management Evergage Guardian Uses Machine Learning, AI to Pull Deeper Insight From Data 1 in 4 Micro Businesses Are Missing Big Marketing Opportunities This Small Business Saturday, It's All About Location Useful Article?

Published Aug 8th, 2016 3:07 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart’s $3.3 billion pending acquisition of Jet.com includes new leadership for the retail giant’s e-commerce business in the coming months, according to Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon. McMillon said during a conference call with the media on Monday (Aug. 8) the timing was right for Jet.com founder and CEO Marc Lore to eventually assume control of Wal Mart’s e-commerce brand and business in addition to running Jet.com. Neil Ashe is now the CEO of Walmart.com. “We are thankful for the progress Neil Ashe has made running and growing the business … re-platforming, nearly doubling the GMV (gross merchandise value) of our online offerings, building a winning e-commerce team but now there is a natural inflection of leadership change,” McMillon said during the call. He did not say when Ashe would step down, but did say that Lore will eventually take over the leadership and his salary and compensation package would be detailed in Proxy filings at a later date. He said Lore is eager to manage the Walmart.com brand. He also told reporters there would be no updated guidance and he didn’t respond to the question asking if the deal would impact the rate of share repurchases in the coming years. The company will report fiscal second quarter earnings on Aug. 18. “We have some bandwidth within the company at this time. We will update share purchases at a later date,” he said. Marc Lore, CEO and co-founder of Jet.com, will assume Walmart’s e-commerce management duties from Walmart.com CEO Neil Ashe once Wal-Mart’s $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com is completed. McMillon conducted the phone conference from San Bruno, Calf., where he held a town hall for Walmart.com employees earlier in the day. He said it’s not unusual for Walmart to operate multiple brands in a market as they own and operate 50 brands around the world. Walmart.com and Jet.com will operate independently once the deal is approved and completed. He said Walmart customers won’t see any changes in the short term. He said the company will continue to execute its game plan for the holiday season and then the two companies will begin to integrate and combine some of their efforts. “We are taking this at a smart pace. Some of the timely work involves the tech platforms,” McMIllon said. “We are hoping Walmart customers will go online and checkout Jet.com, but for now they remain separate.” McMillon said this is a long-term game plan to win with the customer. He said Walmart U.S. is pleased with progress in its supercenter business and the Jet.com deal is complementary to its agenda to win long term. He said Lore is a proven e-commerce success and his mindset about how to give customers what they want matches the Walmart.com strategy. He said Lore’s model puts the customer more in charge of the price they pay with the “smart cart” features that gives an option for return privilege on an item. He also said Lore’s model is also an insightful way that allows customers to build a basket. “Walmart has been a stock up and basket business for a long, long time,” he added. “Lore’s focus has been more on millennial and urban consumers. We have a large millennial client base but one that is different from Jet.com. Also Jet has been able to attract brands that we don’t have at Walmart,” McMillon said. “We hope to keep the focus on both brands independently but also leverage some things on the backend. The essence of those brands (Jet.com and Walmart.com) will remain different over time.” Analysts say Lore is a major talent score for Wal-Mart. He’s a former Amazon executive, who left that e-tailer to launch Quidsi which he sold to Amazon in 2010 for $540 million – a deal in which Wal-Mart also pursued. However, some analysts wonder how long Lore, a serial entrepreneur, will be able to work in a corporate bureaucracy like Wal-Mart. McMillon said early talks with Lore suggest that Lore is eager to apply his talents to Walmart.com and continue innovating for both brands. He said with Jet.com using the strengths of Walmart to reduce logistics and sourcing costs, Jet.com could see profits much faster than otherwise.

On Monday, Walmart announced that the acquisition would be moving forward, at a cost of $3 billion in cash and $300 million worth of Walmart shares. The two brands will not be combined, but both companies are looking to take advantage of each other’s strengths to offer low prices online. The deal is a way for both companies to challenge their primary competitor, Amazon. For Walmart, Amazon has become an existential threat as more Americans have been buying household items online: Amazon’s 2015 sales revenue included nearly $80 billion in product sales, and the company accounted for 60 percent of the year’s growth in U.S. online sales growth. Walmart’s sales, overall, still far outstrip Amazon’s at $482 billion, but its e-commerce sales, at $12.5 billion— just 2.5 percent of its total sales—have been slowing in the past two years. In a call with investors regarding Walmart’s second-quarter earnings in May, CEO Doug McMillon said that growth in its e-commerce sector wasn’t fast enough. Recommended: Considering a Big Change? Go for It, Says Evidence From 20,000 Coin Flips In the past decade, Walmart has largely focused on its sales in its physical locations. But earlier this year, the company announced the closure of over 150 U.S. stores, and while it still has about 4,600 of them, it is looking for growth that pairs its massive brick-and-mortar scale with robust online retail. There are a few specific things Walmart will acquire in the Jet.com deal that might aid in the company’s fight to fend off Amazon. First is a new crop of customers. Jet reports that it has a growing base of “urban and millennial customers” and that it adds 400,000 new shoppers a month—a level of growth that is likely very appealing to Walmart. Second is technology: Jet uses an algorithm that minimizes supply-chain, logistics, and shipping costs, as well as software that shows different prices to different customers. It’s been speculated that this pricing technology is a main component of the deal. The third piece, interestingly, is Jet.com’s CEO, Marc Lore. Recode reported that Lore will continue to run Jet, but will also run Walmart’s e-commerce after the deal closes. It’s likely that Walmart will be looking to Lore for creative ideas when it comes to online retailing, as Lore has spent the past decade competing with Amazon. And he’s been successful: Lore sold his company Quidsi, which owned Diapers.com and Soap.com, to Amazon for $550 million in 2010. But more recently, Lore has been open about being anti-Amazon; a Bloomberg BusinessWeek profile of him reported that he was “preparing to assault it” with Jet.com. The Walmart-Jet deal is expected to close this year, and with McMillon and Lore setting their aim on Amazon, it looks like the beginning of a long price war between the internet’s biggest American retailer and the combined forces of its two rivals.

Since launching a year ago, Jet has grown rapidly to reach $1 billion in merchandise sales. While Walmart dominates the brick-and-mortar retail ecosystem in the U.S., its online sales trail that of its greatest e-commerce competitor, Amazon. In 2015, Amazon reported net sales of $107 billion, while Walmart's online sales came to $13.7 billion, compared to its total sales of $482 billion. Expected to close later this year, Walmart's acquisition of Jet includes transfers "over time" of $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Walmart shares. Walmart.com and Jet.com will continue to operate as distinct brands, with Jet keeping its focus on "a unique and differentiated customer experience with curated assortment," according to today's announcement. Jet-Powered Growth The acquisition of Jet is a "jolt of entrepreneurial spirit" that will help Walmart speed efforts to lower prices, expand product assortment and offer an easy shopping experience, Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. "Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time." Launched in July 2015, the New Jersey-based Jet began as a members-only shopping club with an annual subscription fee of $49.99 but dropped that fee in October. The company uses a dynamic pricing algorithm that founder and CEO Marc Lore said gives customers "the ability to save money by placing bigger, smarter orders." Since its launch, Jet's business has grown dramatically, adding more than 400,000 new customers every month and processing an average of 25,000 orders per day. It sells everything from groceries to electronics, offering more than 12 million products through more than 2,400 retail partners. 'Furious' Competition with Amazon Earlier this year, the financial services firm Cowen and Company predicted that Amazon could grab a much greater share of retail sales in North America between now and 2018, while Walmart's share would remain relatively unchanged. Walmart currently accounts for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the U.S., down from 11.6 percent in 2009. Amazon's share, meanwhile, could grow from a little over 3 percent to around 7 percent by 2018, according to Cowen and Company. "Walmart is spending furiously to fight back against Amazon's online onslaught," The Economist noted in June. "Last year it poured a staggering $10.5 billion into information technology, more than any other company on the planet," the publication added, citing data from IDC. Walmart said its acquisition of Jet will "build on and complement the significant foundation already in place to serve customers across the Walmart app, site and stores and position the company for even faster e-commerce growth in the future by expanding customer reach and adding new capabilities."

Photo / AP Wall Street moved lower overnight from record highs, while oil prices and the US dollar firmed amid talk about fresh efforts to curb a global glut and increased bets that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year after all. In 3.11pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3 per cent. In 2.56pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index slipped 0.2 per cent. The Dow fell as declines in shares of Merck and those of Pfizer, recently down 2 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Exxon Mobil and those of Caterpillar, last up 1.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. Shares of Wal-Mart fell, last 0.5 per cent weaker in New York, after the world's biggest retailer said it agreed to buy Jet.com for about US$3.3 billion. "Wal-Mart has definitely put its stake in the ground saying, 'We're going to be winning in e-commerce," Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, told Bloomberg. "Amazon should be concerned about what Wal-Mart is doing." Shares of Amazon were 0.1 per cent weaker in New York in late afternoon trading. "Amazon's got this huge lead. "That lead is going to be tough to relinquish but there's a lot of [share] out there," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea told CNBC. Continued below.

Even so the stock traded 0.1 per cent weaker at US$73.57 as of 1.56pm in New York. Earlier in the session the stock had traded as high as US$75.46. "People are struggling with the idea that these earnings are looking peakish," Tim Ramey, a Salem, Oregon-based analyst for Pivotal Research Group, told Bloomberg. Profit growth in the high single digits "is below trend line but still powerful." Shares of Exxon Mobil followed oil prices higher amid a report in the Wall Street Journal that some OPEC members suggested fresh talks about curbing output. "It would appear that OPEC calls for restraint would be inevitable," Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates, told Reuters, citing concerns over rising US oil rigs and weakening energy demand. People are struggling with the idea that these earnings are looking peakish. Also gaining was the US dollar after Friday's US jobs better-than-expected reported renewed expectations the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates sooner than later. "The market is still digesting a blockbuster payroll number and I think a lot of things are in motion right now to assess whether the Fed raises earlier than thought," Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York, told Reuters. "It certainly won't be September, but it could possibly be December." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index barely budged, ending the day with a gain of less than 0.1 per cent from the previous close.

Wal-Mart's $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce company Jet.com was potentially a flush exit for early employees and its familiar big-name investors like Goldman Sachs, Bain Capital and Fidelity. But it was also a probably huge windfall for 10 people who — like Pennsylvania's Eric Martin — won significant equity in the company. Martin won 100,000 insider stock options in Jet.com last year as part of a contest aimed to get users to refer the most family and friends to the membership-based site. That means he'll likely get some sort of slice of Jet's $3.3 billion price tag, along with nine other contest winners, who each got 10,000 insider stock options. Jet Tweet: We're so happy for Eric Martin, winner of 100k shares of Jet Stock! Check out his @fox43 interview right here! It's a nice surprise for a family man who spent about $18,000 to refer about 8,000 customers to Jet in early 2015, surpassing more than 200,000 other contestants for the prize. Martin said he can't disclose the value of his shares, and he doesn't know how the Wal-Mart deal will pay out for him. (The terms of the deal weren't publicly disclosed.) "Up until today, it was all just a hope and a wish and a dream," he said. "I don't think I'm some genius person that I thought Jet was going to work out. It was a gut instinct." Martin, a devout Christian, said he hopes to live a lifestyle that "glorifies God," not money. He doesn't live like a millionaire, except for the occasional crab leg, though some reports have valued his Jet.com shares upward of $20 million. But Jet.com has changed his life, Martin said, giving him the credibility to pursue a career in digital marketing, and inspiring a "gamefied" approach to his new start-up, Ideadash. Martin, a self-proclaimed addict to Bloomberg Businessweek, was inspired to sign up for Jet by a January 2015 cover story. He then referred his wife (the main Jet shopper in the household) to sign up. Martin saw that his rank immediately shot up in the contest. After referring a few close family and friends, he was able to estimate how many referrals the top candidates had, and after talking to another contestant on Facebook, he guessed he needed at least 4,000 referrals to win the whole thing. "I was working out one night during the contest, I was really thinking about it. I wasn't really questioning at the time whether it would worth something or not," Martin said. "I thought, 'I think I can win. Should I win? Should I do this?' I think I prayed about it a little. If it's going to me or someone else, I thought, why not do it?" Martin used sites like Swagbucks.com and Facebook ads to get referrals, and was able to pay his way to the top 10 with about $3,000. He figured that if he could win 10,000 shares for $3,000, anything less than $300,000 would be worth it for the top spot — so he went all in until he got a call from Jet.com co-founder Marc Lore. Since future of his Jet shares remains unclear, Martin is focused on the big picture. "The overarching theme of my life is 'the great idea,'" Martin said. "Ideadash was born out of frustration on my part, no way to get your ideas out there in a way to get some sort of financial gain or return. ....But even if this Jet thing is worth a lot of money, way down the ladder, I don't want to live in a way where all I care about is money. I hope I never care about money."

Probably not Wal-Mart recently bought online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion, but that doesn't mean it will be able to immediately compete with Amazon in e-commerce. By Conner Forrest | August 8, 2016, 12:37 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jet.com On Monday, Wal-Mart announced its plan to acquire e-commerce company Jet.com for approximately $3 billion in cash and $300 million of Walmart shares. The agreement could help bolster Wal-Mart's online presence and make it more competitive in the e-commerce space. The acquisition is still subject to approval from the boards of directors of both companies, but if it is approved it is expected to close this year. Both Wal-Mart and Jet.com's websites will continue to operate as separate sites. Doug McMillon, CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, called the deal "another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart." When Jet.com was originally launched on July 21, 2015, it garnered headlines as the next potential "Amazon killer." Multiple side-by-side orders were placed to show how Jet stacked up against then-rivals Amazon and Walmart.com. However, a little more than one year after its official launch, questions have been raised about the effectiveness of its strategy and revenue growth. Still, Jet is growing with new customers and is able to reach certain demographics that Wal-Mart wants to capture. According to a press release announcing the deal, "The acquisition of Jet will infuse Walmart with fresh ideas and expertise, as well as an attractive brand with proven appeal, especially with Millennials, the first generation of true digital natives." SEE: Amazon still crushing cloud competition, says Gartner Magic Quadrant for IaaS Wal-Mart is clearly hoping that the acquisition of Jet.com will get it one step closer to its ultimate e-commerce goal: Beating Amazon. Over the past year, Wal-Mart has given the world plenty of evidence to show that this is what it wants. In 2015, on Amazon's Prime Day, Wal-Mart criticized paid membership models in a blog post and offered its own deal as an alternative. Later, in June 2016, Wal-Mart offered a free trial of ShippingPass, a subscription service meant to compete with Amazon Prime. And, even though McMillon said that his plan to beat Amazon was to "win with stores," it seems that Wal-Mart is trying to buy competitiveness with the Jet acquisition. The question is: Will it work? Long story short—probably not. The first problem with Wal-Mart's strategy is that it is going after the wrong business. Amazon's business is not driven by e-commerce, it's driven by cloud. It's standing as an e-commerce giant merely drives its infrastructure business. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the infrastructure arm of Amazon, was responsible for 56% of Amazon's operating profits overall. Even more, AWS remains leaps and bounds above its competitors, according to the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant report. Sure, in late 2015 Wal-Mart tried its hand at cloud by open sourcing its cloud tech, but it didn't take off. TechRepublic columnist Matt Asay called it "open source in all the wrong ways." Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy Even if you remove the infrastructure element from Amazon's business, the e-commerce market has been struggling lately. Additionally, Wal-Mart's choice of Jet as an e-commerce linchpin is perplexing, as Jet has struggled to retain customers. But, even if Wal-Mart and Jet were able to build a competitive customer base, they wouldn't be able to compete with Amazon in terms of scale. Amazon is the king of logistics, and its latest endeavor in leasing a fleet of "Prime Air" planes proves that. Amazon has taught the world to expect online deliveries in two days. Walmart has started to offer similar services, but it's just not there yet. Amazon's initial foray into online retailing highlighted the need for better infrastructure services, which birthed Amazon's core business, AWS. By targeting Amazon's e-commerce business, Wal-Mart is setting itself up to compete with the Amazon of a few years ago, not the Amazon of the future—which is going to compete with UPS in logistics and Microsoft in cloud infrastructure. In the immortal words of Wayne Gretzky: "I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been." The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Wal-Mart recently announced that it would acquire e-commerce company Jet.com for $3 billion in an effort to improve its online business. Wal-Mart has made many efforts to disrupt Amazon, but its efforts have come up short and highlighted the current struggles faced by the overall e-commerce market. By competing with Amazon on e-commerce, Wal-Mart is competing on the wrong business, as Amazon's profits are built on the back of its cloud infrastructure arm, AWS.

Wal-Mart announced Monday, Aug. 8, 2016, that the company has agreed to buy fast-growing online retail newcomer Jet.com, which had launched with a splash in 2015 when it announced its intention to challenge online leader Amazon. The deal underscores how serious Wal-Mart is about igniting its online business, which has been slowing even as it has been making big investments in new distribution centers and expanding services. (AP Photo/Nick Ut, File) (Nick Ut) Print Email The Associated Press | Wire reports By The Associated Press | Wire reports MLive.com on August 08, 2016 at 4:11 PM, updated August 08, 2016 at 4:12 PM comments NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is buying fast-growing online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, scooping up a newcomer that launched a year ago with the intention of challenging online leader Amazon. The deal announced Monday shows Wal-Mart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services. In June, it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. Analysts say Wal-Mart buying Jet.com still won't enable it to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help widen the gap between itself and other retailers online. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com to make it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups in an extremely competitive landscape. In January, Hudson's Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchased flash-sales site Gilt Group. And in June, Bed, Bath & Beyond bought One Kings Lane. "This acquisition in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Wal-Mart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," said Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Shea. "As we believe 'catching' Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg up on its competitors in the very important race to be No. 2 online." As part of the deal, which Wal-Mart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Jet.com will maintain separate brands. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company's low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast. It has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Wal-Mart says it also will incorporate some of Jet.com's "smart" technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, the deal provides big financial backing. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," said Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. "It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Wal-Mart." Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, said in a statement the combination of Wal-Mart's retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with the team, technology and business of Jet.com will allow the company to deliver more value to customers. Jet.com, which touts its service, delivers to two-thirds of the country overnight in its purple boxes. In some high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often can offer same-day delivery at no additional cost. In May, Lore told The Associated Press that Jet.com had expected to reach overall profitability in 2020 and to hit $20 billion in general merchandise value with 15 million customers. Lore also has experience competing with Amazon, as CEO of Quidsi, whose main site was diapers.com. Eventually, it bought him out for more than $500 million in 2010. McMillon confirmed on a conference call Monday that Lore will head up walmart.com and jet.com, and that Wal-Mart's top online executive, Neil Ashe, is departing. In its fiscal year ended in January, Wal-Mart had online sales of $13.7 billion, a fraction of its total revenue of $482.1 billion. And its online figure pales in comparison to Amazon.com's annual net revenue of $107 billion. O'Shea noted that Apple.com is the only brick-and-mortar retailer that outranks Wal-Mart in online sales in the U.S. But Wal-Mart reported in May that global e-commerce sales rose 7 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 8 percent in the previous quarter and far below the 20 percent increases seen less than two years ago. So it trimmed its free-shipping pilot program ShippingPass to two-day delivery from three and cut a dollar off the membership to $49 a year in an attempt to answer Amazon's Prime program. But while Amazon's Prime membership costs $99 a year, it comes with a lot of perks like streaming music and video and household subscriptions. Jet.com has also faced plenty of challenges. Three months after it launched, it ditched its annual membership fee of $49.99, leading critics to question the business model. So Jet.com promised to undercut Amazon and other retailers by 4 percent to 5 percent instead of larger discounts. O'Shea noted Wal-Mart is "paying a lot" for Jet.com, but it was too soon to say if it overpaid. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. slipped 50 cents to $73.26 in midday trading Monday. Its shares are up 3 percent over the past year.

The project, designed to improve the roadway and add turn lanes to that stretch of Holton Whitehall Road, was originally scheduled to begin a week ago. As of Monday, seven days past the original start date, the construction work has yet to begin. This map shows the section of Holton Whitehall Road that will be improved as part of the construction project, which has been delayed.Google Map  Paul Bouman, the highway engineer for the Muskegon County Road Commission, said the project has been delayed because of some changes being made to the road project. It is unclear at this time when the road will be closed for construction. Wal-Mart, which hired its own contractor for the project, is heading the completion of the project through a permit with the Muskegon County Road Commission, which has oversight of that section of road. The original project plan called for the road to be widened in that stretch of the road to add a center-run lane and a right-turn lane on the south side of Holton Whitehall Road for those turning into the planned Wal-Mart. It is currently a two-land road in that section extending from U.S. 31 to Silver Creek Road. Road closure originally planned for Aug. 1 near Wal-Mart As originally planned, the road construction project was expected to take up to three weeks. Bouman said the changes to the plan could shorten the amount of time the road is closed to motorists. The 122,000-square-foot store will offer a full line of fresh produce, general merchandise including health and beauty items, baby and pet supplies, toys and games, electronics, sporting goods, apparel and household items. A full-service pharmacy with drive-thru, vision center, money center, digital photo-processing center and Wal-Mart pickup will also be at the location. Wal-Mart is tentatively planning a grand opening in the spring or early summer of 2017, a spokesman said earlier this year. The construction of the store is the end of a long, pre-construction legal battle between the Bentonville, Ark.-based company and a local group calling itself BOW NOT — Back Off Wal-Mart, Not Our Town. For the construction work, the road commission sent out a road closure notice that is expected to last about three weeks, beginning Monday, Aug. 1. A detour will be posted, directing motorists on Holton Whitehall Road to take Russell Road, then White Lake Drive, and then Whitehall Road.

In 3.11pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3 percent. In 2.56pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent. The Dow fell as declines in shares of Merck and those of Pfizer, recently down 2 percent and 1.7 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Exxon Mobil and those of Caterpillar, last up 1.1 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. Shares of Wal-Mart fell, last 0.5 percent weaker in New York, after the world’s biggest retailer said it agreed to buy Jet.com for about US$3.3 billion. “Wal-Mart has definitely put its stake in the ground saying, ‘We’re going to be winning in e-commerce," Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, told Bloomberg. “Amazon should be concerned about what Wal-Mart is doing.” Shares of Amazon were 0.1 percent weaker in New York in late afternoon trading. "Amazon's got this huge lead. That lead is going to be tough to relinquish but there's a lot of [share] out there," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea told CNBC. Tyson Foods, one of the world's largest food companies, reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and upgraded its full-year earnings estimate bolstered by lower feed and livestock costs. Even so the stock traded 0.1 percent weaker at US$73.57 as of 1.56pm in New York. Earlier in the session the stock had traded as high as US$75.46. “People are struggling with the idea that these earnings are looking peakish,” Tim Ramey, a Salem, Oregon-based analyst for Pivotal Research Group, told Bloomberg. Profit growth in the high single digits “is below trend line but still powerful.” Shares of Exxon Mobil followed oil prices higher amid a report in the Wall Street Journal that some OPEC members suggested fresh talks about curbing output. “It would appear that OPEC calls for restraint would be inevitable," Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates, told Reuters, citing concerns over rising US oil rigs and weakening energy demand. Also gaining was the US dollar after Friday’s US jobs better-than-expected reported renewed expectations the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates sooner than later. “The market is still digesting a blockbuster payroll number and I think a lot of things are in motion right now to assess whether the Fed raises earlier than thought,” Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York, told Reuters. "It certainly won’t be September, but it could possibly be December." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index barely budged, ending the day with a gain of less than 0.1 percent from the previous close. France’s CAC 40 index increased 0.1 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 index added 0.2 percent, while Germany’s DAX index rose 0.6 percent.

U.S. stocks drifted lower in early trading Monday, Aug. 8, 2016, as investors sized up the latest company earnings and deal news. The major stock indexes were coming off new highs set a week earlier following a strong U.S. jobs report. Energy stocks surged the most as oil prices rose, while health care companies were the biggest laggard. Associated Press   By YOUKYUNG LEE     SEOUL, South Korea -- Asian stock markets were little changed Tuesday after Wall Street closed nearly flat amid little market-moving news. Prices of oil retreated slightly after reports of a new OPEC meeting sparked a rally. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.1 percent to 16,669.12 and South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.2 percent to 2,035.97. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.3 percent to 22,416.01 while China's Shanghai Composite Index stayed flat at 3,004.48. Stocks in Australia, Indonesia and Taiwan remained nearly unchanged. CHINA DATA: China's consumer price index gained 1.8 percent last month over a year earlier, slower than June's 1.9 percent, Xinhua said citing the National Bureau of Statistics. The July figure is the third monthly drop in a row since April when the consumer price index reached its highest level since July 2014. The news came a day after China reported another fall in exports for the month of July as weak global demand hampered efforts to shore up Chinese trade. OPEC MEETS: Amid little market-moving news, oil was in focus after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced Monday that oil ministers of the 14-nation organization will meet next month, well ahead of their previously scheduled November meeting. It is unusual for the OPEC to come together outside of their regularly set gatherings and the report pushed up the price of crude oil overnight. ANALYST'S TAKE: "News that OPEC would be having a September meeting with certain members keen to push for supply cuts again served as the impetus for oil prices to rally. While a deal is highly unlikely to eventuate, the fact that it is even being mentioned shows how much difficulty the past month's renewed sell-off was causing many struggling OPEC members," Angus Nicholson, a market analyst at IG in Melbourne, Australia, said in a daily commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stock markets finished nearly unchanged on Monday, hovering just below the record highs they set late last week. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 14.24 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,529.29. The S&P 500 index dipped 1.98 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,180.89. The Nasdaq shed 7.98 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,213.14. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 22 cents at $42.80 per barrel in New York. The contract rose $1.22, or 2.9 percent, to close at $43.02 per barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 28 cents at $45.11 per barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar weakened to 102.33 yen from 102.36 yen while the euro fell to $1.108 from $1.109.

Edgard Garrido / Reuters Most Popular The Trump Takeover The Editors 7:15 AM ET 'Hail Trump!': White Nationalists Salute the President Elect Daniel Lombroso and Yoni Appelbaum Nov 21, 2016 The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck 7:00 AM ET The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart Nov 21, 2016 What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Bourree Lam Aug 8, 2016 Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Last week, there were whispers that Walmart was in talks to buy e-commerce retailer Jet.com. On Monday, Walmart announced that the acquisition would be moving forward, at a cost of $3 billion in cash and $300 million worth of Walmart shares. The two brands will not be combined, but both companies are looking to take advantage of each other’s strengths to offer low prices online. The deal is a way for both companies to challenge their primary competitor, Amazon. For Walmart, Amazon has become an existential threat as more Americans have been buying household items online: Amazon’s 2015 sales revenue included nearly $80 billion in product sales, and the company accounted for 60 percent of the year’s growth in U.S. online sales growth. Walmart’s sales, overall, still far outstrip Amazon’s at $482 billion, but its e-commerce sales, at $12.5 billion— just 2.5 percent of its total sales—have been slowing in the past two years. In a call with investors regarding Walmart’s second-quarter earnings in May, CEO Doug McMillon said that growth in its e-commerce sector wasn’t fast enough. In the past decade, Walmart has largely focused on its sales in its physical locations. But earlier this year, the company announced the closure of over 150 U.S. stores, and while it still has about 4,600 of them, it is looking for growth that pairs its massive brick-and-mortar scale with robust online retail. There are a few specific things Walmart will acquire in the Jet.com deal that might aid in the company’s fight to fend off Amazon. First is a new crop of customers. Jet reports that it has a growing base of “urban and millennial customers” and that it adds 400,000 new shoppers a month—a level of growth that is likely very appealing to Walmart. Second is technology: Jet uses an algorithm that minimizes supply-chain, logistics, and shipping costs, as well as software that shows different prices to different customers. It’s been speculated that this pricing technology is a main component of the deal. The third piece, interestingly, is Jet.com’s CEO, Marc Lore. Recode reported that Lore will continue to run Jet, but will also run Walmart’s e-commerce after the deal closes. It’s likely that Walmart will be looking to Lore for creative ideas when it comes to online retailing, as Lore has spent the past decade competing with Amazon. And he’s been successful: Lore sold his company Quidsi, which owned Diapers.com and Soap.com, to Amazon for $550 million in 2010. But more recently, Lore has been open about being anti-Amazon; a Bloomberg BusinessWeek profile of him reported that he was “preparing to assault it” with Jet.com. The Walmart-Jet deal is expected to close this year, and with McMillon and Lore setting their aim on Amazon, it looks like the beginning of a long price war between the internet’s biggest American retailer and the combined forces of its two rivals.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What's Really Going On in North Carolina's Gubernatorial Race? David A. Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Netflix Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life Is a Rare TV Revival That Works David Sims The beloved family dramedy returns with a Netflix mini-series that’s self-aware enough to succeed. The nostalgic TV revival is a genre still in search of a purpose: Too often, shows like Arrested Development, Full House, and The X-Files have returned for no reason other than to gin up easy viewership, to appeal to those seeking to remember better days. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is the first such TV sequel that really uses the long-delayed circumstances of its existence to its advantage. There’s a smart self-awareness to the show (available on Netflix starting Friday) that goes beyond sly winks to the camera about how long it’s been since its titular mother-daughter team have appeared onscreen. Considering it could merely exist as a cheap cash-in, that A Year in the Life feels so emotionally resonant is somewhat miraculous. Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).

In an effort to improve its website and woo millennials, Walmart today announced it is acquiring Hoboken, NJ-based e-commerce company Jet.com for $3 billion in cash. The world's largest retailer will also pay $300 million of its shares over time as part of the transaction, which has been approved by both companies' boards and is expected to close before the end of 2016. Walmart said the acquisition will "infuse" the big box retailer "with fresh ideas and expertise, as well as an attractive brand with proven appeal, especially with millennials." Jet.com does indeed have an impressive track record, reaching $1 billion in sales its first year and growing its customer base of "urban and millennial" shoppers by more than 400,000 people monthly. The online retailer offers some 12 million products and processes an average of 25,000 orders every day. Its technology rewards customers in real-time with discounts on items that are bought and shipped together, "thereby reducing the supply-chain and logistics costs often buried in the price of goods," Walmart said. Current Jet customers don't need to worry about the brand going away. After the acquisition closes, each organization will continue to maintain their distinct brands. Walmart and Jet will leverage each other's technology to "develop new offerings to help customers save time and money," the companies said. //Related Articles Walmart Pay Now Available in Stores Nationwide In a statement, Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon elaborated on that plan. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," McMillon said. "We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. "Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time… It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart," he added.

 Walmart is getting a huge perk from Jet.com that no one's talking about Hayley Peterson Aug. 8, 2016, 3:32 PM 11,305 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart employees partake in Shareholders Meeting festivities in front of the company's Bentonville headquarters. Walmart Walmart's $3 billion purchase of Jet.com has been widely praised as a win for both companies. The acquisition is expected to help Walmart refine its e-commerce businesses, while helping Jet.com expand its reach and strengthen its negotiating power with suppliers. But the implications for Walmart go even further, according to UBS analyst Michael Lasser. The deal could help Walmart shed any perceptions that it's a retail dinosaur still deeply rooted in the era when brick-and-mortar stores thrived. In turn, Walmart could start attracting top tech talent away from Amazon, eBay, and other top online retailers. "Until now, Walmart probably faced some difficulty attracting the best & brightest engineers & [e-commerce] talent given its perception as a 'traditional retailer,'" Lasser wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "We think the addition of a rapidly growing and innovative retailer should enable Walmart to attract human capital and knowledge that it might not have otherwise been able to attain." Data from Euromonitor Lasser said it will be important for Walmart to hold on to Jet's talent — especially founder Marc Lore — in addition to attracting new talent. "We think it will be critical for Walmart to let Jet stand alone, enabling this rapidly growing business to not get distracted by the bureaucratic culture of a large enterprise," Lasser wrote. "Plus, we think it will be important for Walmart to hold onto the talent. In particular, Mr. Lore ... [who] has proven himself to be a serial entrepreneur, which might eventually lead him to look beyond his role at Jet." The acquisition could also help Walmart attract younger shoppers that live in cities. Jet's shoppers tend to be young, urban millennials, according to Walmart.

(NYSE: WMT) acquired on Monday for $3.3 billion. The Wall Street Journal profiled Lore on Monday following the acquisition announcement and quickly pointed out his plans to battle Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) "didn't pan out as he projected," but he will assume a senior leadership position at Wal-Mart. Lore, a 45-year-old native of Staten Island, New York, is no stranger to e-commerce. He sold Diapers.com and Soap.com in 2010 for $550 million — ironically to Amazon, Wal-Mart's largest foe. The Birth Of Quidsi Diapers.com was created to fill a void that Lore recognized: delivering household goods quickly and reliably to busy mothers. Realizing the site had potential for success he created Soap.com. He combined Diapers.com and Soap.com into a company called Quidsi. Related Link: Wal-Mart Confirms $3 Billion Deal For Jet.com Prior to that, he created an online sports cards trading company called The Pit, which he sold to Topps Co. for around $5.7 million in 2001. After Quidsi Lore eventually sold Quidsi for roughly 10 times the amount of venture capital he raised after taking Amazon head on in a pricing war before deciding to sell the company and join its team. "Marc is the most talented e-commerce operator I've come across," the Wall Street Journal quoted Jeremy Levine of Bessemer Venture Partners and investor in Quidsi as saying. "He has a deep, intuitive grasp of the finance side of things — that's something that most entrepreneurs don't have an eye for." Lore left Amazon in 2013 after his contract expired and decided to take on his former employer through Jet.com which promised to deliver consumers prices that we as much as 15 percent cheaper than Amazon. Lore felt that Jet.com would achieve profitability by 2020 when it delivers $20 billion worth of goods a year. However, the business struggled in its early days, and Lore scrapped an initial pledge not to charge an annual membership fee and offering smaller discounts compared to its competitors. Nevertheless, Wal-Mart made it official on Monday that it will acquire the company for more than $3 billion — a notable premium over a round of financing last October which valued the company at just $1.35 billion.

 Amazon is crushing Walmart in the space where people are spending the most money online Eugene Kim Aug. 8, 2016, 3:05 PM 3,262 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart just spent $3 billion on Jet.com, a move that is expected to help boost its lagging e-commerce sales. But the Jet.com acquisition doesn't address Walmart's struggles in the largest online category that Amazon continues to eat into: clothing and apparel sales. As this chart from Statista shows, apparel and accessories saw the highest spending in the US last year, generating $63.79 billion in total revenue. Statista projects US online apparel sales will keep growing at a robust pace, reaching $100 billion in sales by 2019. Statista The problem is Walmart has been losing its share to Amazon in the online apparel category over the past two years. Neither company breaks down its sales by specific categories, but a survey by market research firm Cowen & Co. gives a clue to how the two companies fared in clothing and apparel sales. Cowen's monthly consumer survey of 2,500 US consumers show Amazon growing the size of its apparel purchasers by 27% over the past two years. In the same period, Walmart's number dropped 2.1%, while Target's dropped 1.3%. Although Walmart saw a 12.4% growth in the latest month, that's likely due to the huge drop it saw in the year-ago period. What's more impressive is that Amazon used to have the smallest size back in the second quarter of 2014, but has completely turned the tables and is now considered the distinct leader in this space. Cowen & Co. On top of that, Amazon has been growing the size of its apparel buyers relative to the overall customer base, while Walmart and Target have seen stagnant growth there, as this chart by Cowen & Co. shows: Cowen & Co. Now, the question is whether Jet.com's acquisition will help Walmart grow its apparel business, but that doesn't seem to be the case either. According to market research firm Slice Intelligence, Jet.com's biggest advantage against Amazon is in the grocery and kitchen product markets, and doesn't offer much against Amazon's thriving apparel unit. As this chart by Slice shows, apparel & accessories represent the worst sales contribution to Jet.com against Amazon: Slice Intelligence Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

The deal announced Monday shows Walmart is trying to compete more aggressively and effectively as it has seen its online business growth slow, even with big investments in distribution centers and expanding services. In June, it announced it was forming a partnership with JD.com in China to bolster its presence in that market. Analysts say Walmart buying Jet.com still won’t enable it to catch up to Amazon in sales, but it will help widen the gap between itself and other retailers online. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com to make it on their own in a sphere Amazon dominates with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups in an extremely competitive landscape. In January, Hudson’s Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchased flash-sales site Gilt Group. And in June, Bed, Bath & Beyond bought One Kings Lane. “This acquisition in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal,” said Moody’s lead retail analyst Charlie O’Shea. “As we believe ‘catching’ Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg up on its competitors in the very important race to be No. 2 online.” As part of the deal, which Walmart expects to close this year upon regulatory approval, Walmart Stores Inc. and Jet.com will maintain separate brands. Walmart.com will stay focused on the company’s low price strategy and Jet.com will still provide a curated assortment of products. The acquisition will help Walmart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger than its own shoppers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015, sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers and has been growing fast. It has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Walmart says it also will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart” technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, the deal provides big financial backing. “We’re looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want,” said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. “It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart.” Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, said in a statement the combination of Walmart’s retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with the team, technology and business of Jet.com will allow the company to deliver more value to customers. Jet.com, which touts its service, delivers to two-thirds of the country overnight in its purple boxes. In some high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often can offer same-day delivery at no additional cost. In May, Lore told The Associated Press that Jet.com had expected to reach overall profitability in 2020 and to hit $20 billion in general merchandise value with 15 million customers. Lore also has experience competing with Amazon. As CEO of Quidsi, whose main site was diapers.com. Eventually, it bought him out for more than $500 million back in 2010. The Wall Street Journal reported that Lore will take a senior leadership position on the e-commerce side of Walmart and that Walmart’s top online executive, Neil Ashe, is expected to depart. Walmart and Jet.com each declined to comment on that. In its fiscal year ended in January, Walmart had online sales of $13.7 billion, a fraction of its total revenue of $482.1 billion. And its online figure pales in comparison to Amazon.com’s annual net revenue of $107 billion. O’Shea noted that Apple.com is the only brick-and-mortar retailer that outranks Walmart in online sales in the U.S. But Walmart reported in May that global e-commerce sales rose 7 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 8 percent in the previous quarter and far below the 20 percent increases seen less than two years ago. So it trimmed its free-shipping pilot program ShippingPass to two-day delivery from three and cut a dollar off the membership to $49 a year in an attempt to answer Amazon’s Prime program. But while Amazon’s Prime membership costs $99 a year, it comes with a lot of perks like streaming music and video and household subscriptions. Jet.com has also faced plenty of challenges. Three months after it launched, it ditched its annual membership fee of $49.99, leading critics to question the business model. So Jet.com promised to undercut Amazon and other retailers by 4 percent to 5 percent instead of larger discounts. O’Shea noted Walmart is “paying a lot” for Jet.com, but it was too soon to say if it overpaid. Shares of Walmart Stores Inc. slipped 50 cents to $73.26 in midday trading Monday. Its shares are up 3 percent over the past year.

Wal-Mart announced Monday, Aug. 8, 2016, that the company has agreed to buy fast-growing online retail newcomer Jet.com, which had launched with a splash in 2015 when it announced its intention to challenge online leader Amazon. The deal underscores how serious Wal-Mart is about igniting its online business, which has been slowing even as it has been making big investments in new distribution centers and expanding services. by Joseph N.

DiStefano High spending, low taxes boosts Pa. bond costs another $50M+ above neighbors' Nov 22 'Aggressive' hiring ahead: Wayne drug tech firm buys West Coast, India offices Nov 21 Smartphone paywars: JPMorgan Chase Pay goes live Nov 21 More from Joseph N. DiStefano Arrow icon Marc Lore, the Bucknell grad who cofounded Diapers.com/Qdisi and sold it to Amazon.com for $500 million in 2010, has another fat payday: He and partners Matt Hanrahan and Jake Faust have sold their Hoboken company, Jet.com, its high-tech warehouse in Swedesboro (in South Jersey near the Barry Bridge) and other sites in Ireland, Kansas, Nevada and Utah, to Walmart for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, payable in installments. With client sales of $1 billion a year from clients including Barnes & Noble (books), GNC (non-FDA-approved pills), Toys R Us, Sports Authority (now in bankruptcy), and hundreds more, Jet grew fast, but remains far short of displacing Amazon as the dominant online retailer. It will now help Walmart, the largest retail store chain, try and catch up to Amazon's long lead in warehouse direct sales.  Walmart wants Jet for the company's "dynamic pricing and sourcing," said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer at Radial (formerly eBay Enterprise), a retail-sales service  in King of Prussia. "One of Jet.com’s value propositions is that they are able to reprice items in your basket, based on the other items you buy," Weitz told me. "Jet is able to do this because they are constantly repricing their goods based on the (profit) margins they’ve decided they need to hit.  When you order two things that happen to ship from the same warehouse, they can combine shipping of the items, reducing their (costs) and therefore enabling them to reduce the price they charge to the consumer," without cutting profitability. The software needed to match profit targets to inventory and location and quickly adjust prices -- and still deliver on time -- "is a phenomenally complex computer science task" -- with special resonance for Walmart, Weitz added: Jet's approach neatly recalls Walmart's former Rollback in-store price-cut strategy, which relied on old-fashioned inventory and sales tracking. By bringing back similar price cuts, based on instant digital calculations, Jet.com makes Walmart more appealing to longtime customers as they move online, to get them to buy more and keep coming back, Weitz concluded.    Jet founders and investors will be richly paid: The firm raised at least $470 million from investors including Boston's Fidelity and Bain investment firms, Philadelphia-based MentorTech, Silicon Valley-based Accel Partners and Google Ventures, Washington-based New Enterprise Associates, New York-based Goldman Sachs, and others, mostly in 2014. "The transaction is well within Walmart's financial resources," wrote Diya G. Iyer, analyst at Standard & Poor's credit rating agency in a report to clients this morning. Jet "has the potential to accelerate Wal-Mart's e-commerce growth and enhance capabilities to compete more effectively against Amazon.com through Jet.com's pricing algorithms and unique fulfillment approach." But that doesn't guarantee Walmart will be able to rapidly boost online sales, which accounted for only about 3% of Wal-Mart purchases last year, a fraction of online sales at more tech-friendly companies like Philadelphia-based Urban Outfitters. total company sales last year.   "Walmart has already invested billions of dollars in its Wal-Mart Pay mobile app, Amazon Prime rival Shipping Pass and various other digital efforts in recent years," but "it continues to face challenges in competing with Amazon, which has more than seven times the sales including its Web-service business," Iyer concluded.

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published:August 8, 2016 11:32 pm Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced to acquire Jet.com (AP Photo File) Global retail chain Wal-Mart Stores on Monday announced to acquire Jet.com for about USD 3 billion in cash. “Wal-Mart Stores, and Jet.com today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for Walmart to acquire Jet for approximately USD 3 billion in cash, a portion of which will be paid over time. Additionally, USD 300 million of Walmart shares will be paid over time as part of the transaction,” a joint statement said. The acquisition will build on and complement the significant foundation already in place to serve customers across the Walmart app, site and stores and position the company for even faster e-commerce growth in the future by expanding customer reach and adding new capabilities, it said. The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, has been approved by the Boards of Directors for both companies and is expected to close this calendar year, it added. “We are looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Wal-Mart Stores said.

The statement further said that Jet is among the fastest growing and most innovative e-commerce companies in the US, with an experienced leadership team led by co-founder and CEO Marc Lore, together with fellow co-founders Mike Hanrahan and Nate Faust. Among other things, Lore previously co-founded and led Quidsi, the parent company of e-commerce sites Diapers.com, Soap.com and Wag.com, it said. “With the help of Faust and Hanrahan, Lore grew Quidsi into a prominent and successful business that was ultimately sold. The acquisition of Jet will infuse Walmart with fresh ideas and expertise, as well as an attractive brand with proven appeal, especially with Millennials, the first generation of true digital natives,” it added.

Once again, a boutique bank is claiming a monster acquisition deal, as Allen & Co. was named as the lead adviser for Wal-Mart's $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet.com. The Arkansas-based mega retailer's buyout of the New Jersey-based website is the biggest U.S. e-commerce M&A deal ever. The arrival of Allen & Co. at Wal-Mart's side in the Jet.com deal is notable for several reasons. Not only is the rising tide of boutique banks, sometimes led by former Wall Street banks' ex-rainmakers, continuing to pose a threat to bigger institutions. Allen & Co.'s working for Wal-Mart is also a sign that little banks are making big in-roads toward institutional firms' cherished business relationships with large-cap clients. It's going to mean big bucks at Allen & Co., said Jeffrey Nassof, director at mergers and acquisitions consulting firm Freeman & Co. Altogether, the banks that work both sides of the Wal-Mart acquisition of Jet stand to make up to $45 million combined, he said. Jet's advisers on the deal were not publicized, and a CNBC request for comment was not returned. So far this year, boutique banks have nudged bigger banks aside to claim advisory roles on deals like Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn and the ongoing dance between Bayer and Monsanto . Wal-Mart, in prior tech acquisitions, did little by way of announcing which banks, if any, it worked with. Monday morning's announcement said that along with lead bank Allen & Co., JPMorgan Securities worked on the Jet deal. In contrast, Wal-Mart's 2015 acquisition of Chinese e-commerce firm Yihaodian made no mention of an adviser. It also made no such mention during its 2015 acquisition of Silicon Valley-based PunchTab for its WalmartLabs division. And when the mega retailer bought its way into the South African market in 2010 with the $4.6 billion deal for MassMart, another smaller bank (albeit one with a far longer track record), Rothschild, was on the deal. Boutique investment banks saw their share of revenue from M&A rise year over year in the first half of 2016 — and if more deals like Wal-Mart's Jet buyout fly their way, it could make for an all-time high for small banks. At a time when Wall Street banks are having a tough time meeting analysts' expectations for return on equity, the deals may mark one more challenge in a difficult year.

NICK UT , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By THE NEW YORK TIMES Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Traditional retailers have spent more than a decade and billions of dollars trying to transform their brick-and-mortar businesses for the online shopper. Yet Amazon and other digital upstarts continue to lap them. Now Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer and the dominant player of big-box stores, is turning to someone else’s technology and talent. On Monday, the company said it was buying Jet, the year-old online bulk retailer, for $3.3 billion, the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company. The purchase, and a shuffling in the executive ranks that comes with it, are Wal-Mart’s clearest acknowledgments yet that its online strategy is not working. It also sends a strong message to the rest of the consumer and retail industry: When it comes to competing against Amazon, not even the mightiest brick-and-mortar stores can go at it alone. Overall, Wal-Mart’s e-commerce sales have stalled. The online business grew just 7 percent last quarter, a number that Doug McMillon, the company’s president and chief executive, acknowledged at the time was “too slow.” Jet is perhaps best known for an algorithm that encourages bulk buying, an area where Walmart.com has fallen short and could energize its sagging online growth. Wal-Mart is not valuing Jet.com solely based on traditional metrics such as profitability, which the startup does not have. The retailer is spending billions in cash and stock in large part for something – or someone – else: Marc Lore. Lore, a serial e-commerce entrepreneur who started Jet.com, is seen as one of the few executives who can help put a dent in Amazon’s edge. “If you looked at Jet from a fundamentals perspective, the company wouldn’t be worth what they’re paying for it,” said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights, a research firm covering venture capital. “They’re trying to inject Marc and probably some of the veterans on his team, and try and help Wal-Mart figure this out.” For Wal-Mart, buying Jet may not be about beating Amazon at its own game, according to Charlie O’Shea, the lead retail analyst for Moody’s. “We view this as a race for second,” O’Shea said. “Amazon’s lead is so great that it’s going to be virtually impossible to catch them, but you can compete with them.” Shares of Wal-Mart fell nearly 0.6 percent to $73.34 in New York. The stock had gained 20 percent this year through the end of last week. Seattle-based Amazon slipped 0.1 percent to $766.56.

 Walmart is coming after Amazon, but it has a long way to go Jeff Dunn Aug. 8, 2016, 1:29 PM 1,699 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   With its $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, Walmart is taking aim at Amazon’s online retail dominance. Though that’s a big sum for a relatively unproven company, the purchase should at least help the retail giant tidy up its ecommerce offering. As this chart from Statista shows, though, Walmart has plenty of ground to make up. As you’d expect, Amazon was far and away the go-to choice for America’s online shoppers in 2015, generating an estimated $92.4 billion in ecommerce sales. That was almost four times as much as second-place Apple’s $24.4 billion, and well ahead of Walmart’s $13.7 billion. Ecommerce isn’t the same as commerce, and Walmart still generates way more overall revenue than Amazon. But as more and more customers take their business online, Walmart clearly thinks it’s time to try closing that gap.

Brian Barrett Business Date of Publication: 08.08.16. 08.08.16 Time of Publication: 12:55 pm. 12:55 pm Walmart’s $3 Billion Jet.com Buy Still Leaves It Way Behind Patricia Monteiro/Bloomberg/Getty Images This morning, Walmart made official its previously rumored, $3 billion play for Jet, the promising e-commerce upstart. It’s tempting to think of this as Walmart’s shot at Amazon. Don’t. The online retail race still won’t be close. And it may never be. That’s not to say that Walmart doesn’t need Jet; it does, for myriad reasons. To think of it in terms of Amazon, though, requires a serious shift in perspective. Compared with Amazon, Walmart barely registers online. Jet doesn’t suddenly make it a threat. What it does do is position Walmart to more effectively pick up Amazon’s scraps. Jet Set When Jet launched last year, it did so with a fresh proposition: the pricing model offered savings that increased along with your shopping cart tally. The more you bought, the deeper the discount. Most items came with the same free two-day shipping offered by Amazon Prime. “We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress,” said Walmart CEO Doug McMillion in a statement announcing the acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of the year. “Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time.” Jet will remain an independent brand, but its innovations will seep into Walmart’s online business, just as Walmart’s purchasing power and distribution will bolster Jet’s pricing and selection. “The real challenge for Walmart is that it is not successfully competing on convenience, ease and speed when it comes to online. Amazon’s systems and site are just better in these areas,” says Neil Saunders, CEO of retail research firm Conlumino, tells WIRED. “Jet is part of the solution to this issue.” In a note written ahead of the deal, Saunders also suggested that Jet could use Walmart’s huge network of stores and blue chip logistics as, effectively, “a big warehouse and distribution system.” All of which proves there’s plenty of room for synergy here. It’s a match made in retail heaven, assuming the deal goes through and Walmart can effectively integrate Jet. What it won’t do, though, is put it in anything like the same league as Amazon. A Little Perspective Let’s start with scale. This past March, researcher eMarketer ranked the top 25 companies in online retail. First place, not surprisingly, was Amazon, which scored over $79 billion in e-commerce sales last year. Walmart came in second place—at $13.5 billion. That’s not a gap; it’s a chasm. It’s also not clear how Walmart would catch up online, even with Jet. It has more purchasing power than Amazon, and so could hypothetically offer lower prices on many items. But Amazon, as O’Shea and other analysts have noted, has historically not cared about turning a profit in retail. That’s even more the case now that its most profitable business isn’t selling products, but rather cloud services, through its AWS division. Over the last six months, AWS has turned an operating income of $1.32 billion. Over that same period, Amazon’s traditional businesses produced roughly $1 billion in combined North America and International income. Walmart may have room to trim prices, but Amazon can (and has shown ample willingness to) actively turn a loss. Especially now that it can offset balance sheet negatives with its robust cloud business. “Amazon has got a lead online that’s me running against Usain Bolt, and that’s not going to be a fair race,” says Moody’s lead retail analyst Charlie O’Shea. The other important number to remember? Eight percent. That’s roughly how much of total US retail takes place online, says O’Shea. It’s a number that sounds suspiciously small to a tech-savvy ear, but again Walmart and Amazon offer an illustrative example. The former did $485 billion in total sales last year. That’s an order of magnitude more than the online retail king. The rate of growth is slower than one might expect also. O’Shea pegs it in the low teens, year to year, a respectable but not transformative pace. He notes that some product segments (food in particular) still don’t make much sense online, while more Internet-friendly items have already saturated the market. The question given that scale isn’t so much if Walmart can beat Amazon. It’s why Walmart would spend $3 billion on an unproven online retailer in the first place when it’s doing just fine without it where it matters most. Fighting for Second Walmart’s biggest concern isn’t existing online retailers. It’s fending off other brick-and-mortars that have finally made the transition online. “The challenge for Walmart is, you’ve got to be the second site,” says O’Shea. “If someone jumps off Amazon’s site, there’s got to be a reason they jump.” Buying Jet helps Walmart catch them. That’s increasingly important, as the number of landing pads multiplies. Staples does more than half of its overall sales online, according to eMarketer, and was just shy of Walmart in e-commerce sales last year. Target only did $2.5 billion online last year, but is growing at a rate of roughly 30 percent, says O’Shea. If any one of these companies—or the sum total of them—figures out a better online model before Walmart does, it could quickly fade online. Yes, it’s a small percentage of its overall sales today. But it’s still billions of dollars at stake each year. In fact, some view the Jet buy as less about Jet specifically than it is about the man who founded it, Marc Lore. Lore had previously founded Quidsi, which operated e-commerce sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com before selling to Amazon in 2011. Lore is widely regarded as one of the sharpest minds in online retail today; that’s how he was able to raise over $500 million in funding for an e-commerce startup in the first place. Now, he works for Walmart. “It seems like this is an acquihire,” says Forrester retail analyst Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali. “I think the real value is to have someone like Mark rethink all of Walmart’s dot-com strategy and task Jet with growing Walmart’s dot-com business to $100B.” In other words, about as much as Amazon and Walmart today, combined. The good news is, even half that would be a pretty clear win. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Amazon eCommerce jet Walmart Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Xconomy Xperience EXOME National Regions Channels Events Xconomy Intersect → Walmart Makes It Official, Acquires Jet.com for $3 Billion João-Pierre S. Ruth August 8th, 2016 @xconomy @xconomy Like Us Xconomy New York —  After word leaked last night via Recode, Walmart officially announced Monday in an e-mailed statement that it has agreed to acquire Hoboken, NJ-based e-commerce site Jet.com for $3 billion cash, a strategic move touted by some as a way for the big box retailer to be more competitive with Amazon. Further sweetening the deal, Walmart said it will pay out some $300 million in shares over time. Jet, barely out of diapers, launched its site about one year ago, offering deeper discounts as customers add more items to their online shopping carts. This is a huge exit for a New York-area e-commerce company, especially given the high expectations and some major disappointments to come out of this ecosystem. Shai Goldman, managing director with Silicon Valley Bank, put the significance of Jet’s acquisition into perspective via Twitter. NYC had several big ecommerce misses: Fab , Gilt, Quirky , nice to get a W on the board — (((Shai Goldman))) (@shaig) August 8, 2016 In its statement, Walmart said the acquisition will further enhance its Walmart app, website, and stores to make faster moves in e-commerce. Moreover, Walmart is bringing on board Jet’s CEO and co-founder Marc Lore, who previously co-founded Quidsi, an e-commerce company that is the parent to Diapers.com, Wag.com, and Soap.com. Amazon acquired Quidsi back in 2010 for some $545 million. Jet co-founders Mike Hanrahan and Nate Faust were also part of the Quidsi team. The plan, according to Walmart, is to maintain the distinct Jet.com brand and its assortments of products curated for its customers while Walmart.com continues to stick with it bread and butter of “everyday low prices.” Of particular interest to Walmart is the draw Jet has with millennial and urban consumers; the company specifically cited the gains Jet.com made in a short amount of time attracting customers from those demographics. Getting, and retaining, the patronage of consumers can be fiercely difficult in e-commerce. As Goldman noted in his tweet, the New York startup scene has had its share of hype and high hopes in this sector that later fizzled out. In January, Hudson’s Bay Co. acquired Gilt Groupe for $250 million, somewhat less than what investors had poured into the shopping site. Last year, the original iteration of Quirky, a platform for marketing and selling inventions, filed for bankruptcy and then sold off all its assets, including smart home app developer Wink. Quirky has since resurfaced under new ownership, but without some of its more questionable products—such as an egg tray that tells the user when their food goes bad. Fab.com was another shooting star from the New York startup community that made a splash in e-commerce as a curator and seller of well-designed products, and seemed to be on track to become huge with mainstream consumers. But after raising more than $300 million, and seeing a peak valuation of about $1 billion, Fab.com was sold to PCH International in 2015 for an undisclosed sum—some news outlets asserted the deal was for as little as $15 million to $50 million. It should be noted that beyond the obvious big payday, there are some significant differences between Jet’s deal and those other New York exits. The leadership behind Jet had a notable track record of a solid return with Quidsi, which raised a bit more than $58 million and then was sold for $545 million. And while Jet.com did raise a considerable war chest of $565 million from investors, the company is being acquired a little more than one year after its launch. It hit hard and fast, rather than hold out until it lost its luster. Such a massive offer from Walmart is a rarity, but the end result is impossible to ignore.

Buying Jet.com would let Wal-Mart compete more effectively with Amazon.com and other online retailers. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com to make it on their own in a sphere dominated by Amazon.com with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The acquisition is expected to be completed this year upon regulatory approval, according to Wal-Mart. Buying Jet.com will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger. Jet.com has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Wal-Mart says that it will also be incorporating some of Jet.com’s “smart” technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, it will provide big financial backing. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups in an extremely competitive landscape. In January, Hudson’s Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchased flash-sales site Gilt Group. And in June, Bed, Bath & Beyond scooped up One Kings Lane. “We’re looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, in a statement. Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com noted in a statement that the combination of Wal-Mart’s retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with the team, technology and business we have built at Jet will allow the company to deliver more value to customers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015 under Lore, set out to reinvent the shopping cart. It now sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers, coming from more than 2,400 retailers. The company, which touts its service, delivers to two-thirds of the country overnight in its purple boxes. In New York City, Jet often can provide same-day delivery at no additional cost. Wal-Mart said in May that global e-commerce sales rose 7 percent in the first quarter, below the 8 percent in the previous quarter and far below the 20 percent hikes seen less than two years ago.

Walmart announced  Monday it agreed to pay around $3 billion for the online retailer. The deal also includes another $300 million in Walmart shares to be paid over time.  SEE MORE: Amazon Is Finally Going To Test That Drone Delivery You Heard About CNBC reports  the deal is one of the largest acquisitions of an e-commerce company ever. Some speculate the purchase is an attempt to close ranks with Amazon, which currently dominates the e-commerce industry. Jet.com was founded in 2014, and  various   outlets  were quick to call it an "Amazon-killer." The retailer's prices are  reportedly cheaper  than Amazon's in some cases thanks to its "buy more, spend less" business model. And Walmart could use the help. Forbes reports growth in the company's online sales have been sluggish in  recent months .  The deal follows Amazon's unveiling of its first-ever branded cargo plane. The retailer says it plans to eventually lease even more planes from Atlas Air and the Air Transport Services Group to boost delivery speeds. Walmart and Jet will still maintain their distinct brands throughout the acquisition. This video includes clips from  Walmart ,  Amazon  and  Jet.com  and images from Getty Images.

 What you need to know on Wall Street right now Business Insider Aug. 8, 2016, 12:58 PM 859 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters/Rick Wilking Finance Insider is Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours. To sign up, scroll to the bottom of this page and click "Get updates in your inbox," or click here. Walmart is buying Jet.com in the largest e-commerce acquisition in history. Walmart will pay about $3 billion in cash plus about $300 million of Walmart shares for the two-year-old e-commerce site. This chart shows why. Elsewhere in deal news, Vail Resorts is buying Whistler Blackcomb in a $1.1 billion deal, and Dentsu has acquired US marketing agency Merkle in a deal worth more than $1 billion. Meanwhile, there are more billionaires than ever before, and they're frightened. Barclays says there's nothing left to fight the coming economic storm. And copper is waving a red flag for China's economy. One of the biggest warning signs of the financial crisis is flashing again — but this time is different. On Wall Street, Deutsche Bank got fined for literally broadcasting confidential information over loudspeakers, and some of the biggest names in finance have their eye on your savings. In politics, Hillary Clinton looks like she's about to crush Donald Trump — but it might not be so simple. Trump is in the middle of a speech on the economy, and you can get the key takeaways here. Lastly, here are the 12 things every guy should keep at his desk. Here are the top Wall Street headlines at midday: Tesla will burn through $1.1 billion in cash this quarter — Tesla disclosed $1.1 billion in third-quarter cash requirements in payments and planned expenditures on Friday, about a third of the cash on hand mid-year, in a new sign of pressure on the electric vehicle maker. Oil is leaping on reports OPEC is considering a production freeze — Prices of the major oil benchmarks are all higher on Monday following a report that the oil cartel OPEC may cap its production. Hedge funds have done a terrible job at picking stocks this year — Hedge funds are not doing too hot in 2016. Nike and Adidas are getting out of the golf business at exactly the wrong time — Nike and Adidas are ditching their golf businesses, but it may be the wrong move. 'They are hurting right now': The oil patch and has been decimated — A global supply glut has pushed prices below $40 a barrel, and it's hurting a wide range of industries. This little-known app could take on Facebook in a key market — Messaging could be the next big thing. If it is, Line is perfectly positioned to ride the trend to untold riches, as it has four or five times the number of monthly active users as Facebook in Japan, and is similarly popular in Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. The head of Bloomberg's $150 million VC fund explains the formula for finding a top AI startup — When Bloomberg first built the terminal system, back in the early 1980s, most of its customers — mainly finance professionals — didn't have computers on their desks. The 20 most common hobbies of the richest people in the world — When billionaires have free time, they have the means for extravagant hobbies, whether it's collecting classic cars or jet-setting across the globe.  Follow Finance Insider and never miss an update!

Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters Rupert Neate in New York @RupertNeate Monday 8 August 2016 12.46 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.39 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 3 months old Walmart is buying Jet.com, an online retailer less than two years old, for more than $3bn (£2.3bn) as it attempts to rebuild its internet retailing strategy to try to catch up with Amazon. The big box store giant, which operates more than 11,000 stores across the world, including Asda in the UK, on Monday said said the total $3.3bn purchase represented “another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart”. The entrepreneurial spirit comes in the form of Marc Lore, Jet’s 45-year-old founder and chief executive, who will join Walmart in a senior role as part of the deal. Lore, who started Jet in 2014 after selling his previous company to Amazon for $550m, is in line to collect as much as $825m from this deal as he still owns 25% of Jet, according to Recode. Walmart said Lore would “infuse Walmart with fresh ideas and expertise, as well as an attractive brand with proven appeal, especially with millennials, the first generation of true digital natives”. The Arkansas-based company is expected to axe its current president of e-commerce, Neil Ashe. Lore, a 45-year-old serial entrepreneur from Staten Island, said: “We started Jet with the vision of creating a new shopping experience. I couldn’t be more excited that we will be joining with Walmart to help fuel the realization of that vision.” Walmart to shutter 269 stores, with most located in the US Read more Analysts say Walmart’s acquisition of the loss-making startup is an admittance that the retailer’s online efforts are failing to make headway. Walmart was very slow to the online shopping revolution now dominated by Amazon, and the gap between them has grown: Walmart currently has a stock market value of $230bn, compared to Amazon’s $365bn. “I think it’s an admission that they [Walmart] never really got off to a flying start with online; they never had the growth they should have had,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail analyst service Conlumino. “Walmart’s aim should have been: we are the biggest retailer in the world – we want to be the biggest online retailer in the world. “Instead, [online] growth has taken a lot longer to come through than they would like. Walmart is under the average growth rate of the market, so they are definitely losing [market] share online. It means in some [product categories], they are losing share overall as people stop buying some products in stores in favor of online.” Walmart’s online sales came to about $14bn last year, compared with $99bn at Amazon. Doug McMillon, Walmart’s president and CEO, said: “We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time. Our customers will win. It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart.” Lore started working on Jet, a direct competitor to Amazon, just weeks after leaving Jeff Bezos’s company, which he joined as part of the sale of his previous venture, Diapers.com, to Amazon for $550m in 2010. When he started, Jet Lore told Bloomberg he had “no bad feelings toward Jeff and Amazon”, but he wanted to create a online retail challenger aimed at more price-sensitive consumers – and one that treated its staff with civility. At Jet, staff members are not required to sign non-compete agreements, and board presentations are posted online for all staff to see. “What goes around comes around,” Lore said. “There’s more loyalty and trust that is built [by valuing and trusting employees].” More news Topics Walmart E-commerce Retail industry Amazon.com Internet Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Levitt Wal-Mart has agreed to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com for about $3 billion in cash, giving the world’s largest retailer the resources for a stronger shopping website to compete with Amazon.com Inc., the online market leader. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.72 +0.60 +0.85% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.74 -6.59 -0.84% Target Corp TGT ▲ 78.79 +0.92 +1.18% Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▼ 152.06 -0.61 -0.40% The deal also includes $300 million in Wal-Mart shares that will be paid over time, the world’s largest retailer said Monday in a statement. Acquiring Jet.com, which achieved a $1 billion gross merchandise run rate in a little more than a year, gives Wal-Mart a website that processes an average of 25,000 orders a day and is adding 400,000 shoppers monthly. Wal-Mart has spent billions expanding its online operation, including hiring thousands of workers, opening two offices in Silicon Valley, and building large e-commerce distribution centers. It also started an annual subscription service similar at half the price to Amazon Prime. Amazon’s $99-a-year service provides free two-day shipping on millions of items, encouraging shoppers to stay on the website, as well as the company’s video entertainment offerings. Hoboken, New Jersey-based Jet.com has distinguished itself in e-commerce through “gain sharing,” luring buyers to add items to their orders to reduce shipping costs, and to pay with debit instead of credit cards to reduce transaction fees. Traditional store-based mass retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target Corp. and Costco Wholesale Corp. have been struggling to fend off Amazon’s momentum in online shopping. “For Wal-Mart to protect its household products lead from Amazon, it must address the rising reliance of Amazon shoppers on free shipping,” Jitendra Waral, a Bloomberg Intelligence senior industry analyst, wrote in an Aug. 4 research note. Jet.com “could bring a nascent e-commerce platform that Wal-Mart could scale.” The deal gives Wal-Mart control over Jet.com’s proprietary technology and its customer database. Wal-Mart’s online sales were about $14 billion last year, 14 percent of Amazon’s product and service revenues of $99 billion. Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said last month that the company’s online operation has taken too long to grow.

Home In Corporate March to Clean Energy, Utilities Not Required Instead of waiting for large utilities to go greener, companies are buying renewable energy directly, upending the traditional system. By Jan Ellen Spiegel, InsideClimate News Aug 8, 2016 Google is one of the companies leading the trend toward direct corporate purchase of clean energy through power purchase agreements. Credit: Getty Images A curious thing happened while U.S. utilities were focusing on cheap fracked gas, expensive nuclear power, what to do about coal, and how to fight  renewable energy models that threatened their bottom line. Some of the nation's largest corporations decided not to wait for utilities and took their interest in renewable energy into their own hands. They bought their own clean power. And they bought it directly from the companies that produced it. No utility middleman needed. This clean power revolt, led by some of the biggest corporate energy consumers, is the latest threat to the power purchase and delivery system that's been in place since Thomas Edison invented it. Could this be what gets utilities' attention and forces them to consider clean energy as the future instead of the enemy? Will it ultimately lead to the greening of all of America's power? "It's a really interesting question and I don't know the answer," said Blaine Collison, managing director of marketing and strategic partnerships at Altenex, an energy management company that has orchestrated direct energy purchases for Microsoft, Home Depot, Walmart, Procter and Gamble, Yahoo, Bloomberg and 3M, among others. "What I do know is that we've got a very significant number of massive employers and drivers of American economic output that have said, 'Okay, we want renewables and we're not satisfied with the current options that are available to us. So we're going out into the market and getting renewables for ourselves.'" Many experts say there is more of this to come, and that utilities will not sit back and let this market pass them by. The trend was spearheaded by the elite of the Fortune 500, especially those companies with electricity-guzzling data centers and manufacturing operations such as Google, Amazon and Walmart. Most have climate change concerns and want to boost their green portfolio—their customers wanted that, too—and to make the cost of power more predictable. And so they turned to an old, basic energy project financing model: a power purchase agreement, commonly called a PPA. Traditionally, a utility agrees to buy power for a long time from a generator, giving the builder of an energy plant the stability to attract financing for its construction. The utility then resells power to its customers. But in PPA 2.0, big customers started asking independent renewable power developers to build the installations, usually off-site and sometimes not even in the same state. The companies  signed contracts to buy the electricity virtually for a decade or longer. The trend line has been startling in the last few years, with more than 3.2 gigawatts of corporate renewable deals in 2015—most of them PPAs. That's more than double the amount in 2014. Municipalities, universities, and other institutions are adopting the model. And the temporary renewal of tax credits for wind and solar at the end of last year makes now an ideal time to jump in. Credit: DAVID MCNEW/AFP/Getty Images The windfall has been biggest for the wind power industry. Wind vastly outstrips solar as the corporate PPA power of choice. For 2015 and the first part of this year, about 2,800 megawatts of wind power contracted for corporate PPAs to only a little more than 800 megawatts of solar, according to a Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) analysis. "The rise of corporate buyer demand is very exciting for the wind industry," said Hannah Hunt, senior analyst for American Wind Energy Association. She called it a complement to the increasing wind purchases by utilities themselves, which she said was being propelled by better technology and improved siting that has cut the cost of wind by two-thirds over the last six years. Hervé Touati, managing director of RMI, called the trend "a very strong signal and an indication of the role corporate buyers can play." Companies considering PPAs are generally seeking larger amounts of renewable power than they can get putting a solar system on their roof, at a rate that's lower than the prevailing cost of electricity, locked in for 15 to 25 years. Some utilities are getting the message and working with companies to arrange competitive terms. Google is one of the earliest and largest adopters. In the last six years the company has structured more than a dozen PPAs totaling nearly 1,900 megawatts as it tries to reach its goal of 100 percent renewable power. They include one announced late last year through Duke Energy for solar in North Carolina. Amazon, also looking to be 100 percent renewable, has contracted for power from several wind farms and a solar installation for nearly 550 megawatts. It structured a solar PPA in Virginia through Dominion. Credit: IKEA The ranks of PPA purchasers include Walmart, Equinix, Microsoft and IKEA to round out the top half-dozen. General Motors is a recent addition. In 2011, GM set a goal of 125 megawatts of renewable energy by 2020. Twenty-two solar, three landfill gas, one waste-to-energy and one hydro installation later, the company is now at 106 megawatts. The largest solar system is just under 12 megawatts. "Even if we put up solar and covered the entire rooftop of our assembly plant, I'd maybe get 20 or 30 percent of our full load," said Rob Threlkeld, GM's global manager of renewable energy. "That's why we started to look at PPAs." Last year GM announced two wind PPAs—one 34-megawatt for several manufacturing facilities in Mexico, another 30-megawatt for an assembly plant in Texas. When the Mexico PPA goes online in a couple of months, it will put GM over its renewable goal four years early. Each plant will save the company $2 million annually for the life of the contract. Experts expect much more is coming, and soon. A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in conjunction with the American Council for Renewable Energy (ACORE), which has also studied the corporate PPA phenomenon, sampled U.S.-headquartered companies with large energy footprints. Seventy-two percent of respondents said they were actively pursuing renewable energy purchases, mainly PPAs. So far, only 18 Fortune 500 firms have signed renewable PPAs, plus another 10 or so other companies. Last year's jump in contracts was partly attributable to uncertainty over the expiring tax credits. That sent many companies scrambling to lock in projects before the Dec. 31 deadline. The credits were extended for five years, driving the 2016 corporate renewable PPA pace below 2015. Experts said companies felt they could take a little more time with their decisions now. While the renewed tax breaks will clearly help, according to many people, the key driver behind PPA decisions was sustainability, not money. Many companies now have sustainability and renewable energy goals. And more and more investors, partners, stockholders and customers expect a company to address sustainability and climate change. "I don't believe that large corporations are leading this," said RMI's Touati. "I believe that customers are leading this." Either way, the price increasingly is right. "You don't have to use your own capital," noted George Favaloro, managing director for sustainable business solutions and head of the corporate energy transformation practice at PriceWaterhouse. He was the lead author of its survey. PPAs also avoid energy market price volatility. They lower energy costs. They don't require a company to have a large amount of land. But corporate PPAs do have shortcomings and risks. "The biggest risk is long-term contracts," GM's Threlkeld said. "What's the market going to look like in 10 to 15 years? What's our manufacturing presence in that state or country going look like in 10 to 15 years?" The trend also presents complex questions for the utilities. In Las Vegas, two major hotels—MGM and Wynn Resorts—have said they will pay hefty fees to leave the local utility, NV Energy, so they can buy renewable power. That was after they were unable to work out renewable deals with the utility. Such situations could portend even larger economic ramifications said Greg Wetstone, president of ACORE. "We may have companies saying, 'Look we don't want to come to your state if you're structured in a way that we can't buy the power we want,'" he said. "That's a very compelling economic message." Utilities appear to be listening. "Frankly I haven't heard any worry at all . I've heard more enthusiasm than anything," said Phil Moeller, vice president for energy delivery and chief customer solutions officer at the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for investor-owned utilities. "The typical issues related to it from a utility's perspective —perhaps you have to include some balancing capability if it's just one fuel, and that fuel isn't available all the time. "That's really not a high hurdle."   Collison of Altenex said there are broader considerations, beyond any one utility. "It's a really interesting intersection of a market opportunity and a set of outcomes that has huge net benefits for the developer, for the power user, for climate change," he said. "This is about changing the U.S. generation portfolio. "It's pretty neat to see the corporates say 'look we want it and we're not waiting.'"

Swarm Of Bees Gets Loose In Parking Lot Of Walmart, Sends 3 Customers To Hospital Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Swarm Of Bees Gets Loose In Parking Lot Of Walmart, Sends 3 Customers To Hospital August 8, 2016 11:50 am EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup bees bees bees swarm of bees insects bee stings bees walmart walmart neighborhood market The Oklahoma Walmart Bee Invasion began with a routine transaction. No, Walmart isn’t selling bees now: two beekeepers met up in the store’s parking lot to complete the sale of three hives of around 10,000 bees each in a public place. Instead, the bees got loose, stinging people in the parking lot. Three people had severe enough problems that they were transported to the hospital. Additional beekeepers came to the parking lot of the Walmart Neighborhood Market to collect the useful insects, but when they first escaped, the insects stung multiple customers, including one firefighter who was on the scene to help. Of the hospitalized people, the last report local news had on Sunday night was that two of them were in “serious” condition, and one in good condition. Bee stings can cause sudden, severe, and life-threatening reactions in people, even people who didn’t previously know that they had an allergy, or who had been stung without any symptoms other than local pain and swelling in the past. 3 taken to hospital after being stung by bees outside metro Walmart [KOCO] Bees escape in Oklahoma City Wal-Mart parking lot, sting several people [WOWT] August 8, 2016 By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup bees bees bees swarm of bees insects bee stings bees walmart walmart neighborhood market Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related bees on a plane Bees Swarm American Airlines Plane, Delaying Flight what would macaulay do?

In an effort to improve its website and woo millennials, Walmart today announced it is acquiring Hoboken, NJ-based e-commerce company Jet.com for $3 billion in cash. The world's largest retailer will also pay $300 million of its shares over time as part of the transaction, which has been approved by both companies' boards and is expected to close before the end of 2016. Walmart said the acquisition will "infuse" the big box retailer "with fresh ideas and expertise, as well as an attractive brand with proven appeal, especially with millennials." Jet.com does indeed have an impressive track record, reaching $1 billion in sales its first year and growing its customer base of "urban and millennial" shoppers by more than 400,000 people monthly. The online retailer offers some 12 million products and processes an average of 25,000 orders every day. Its technology rewards customers in real-time with discounts on items that are bought and shipped together, "thereby reducing the supply-chain and logistics costs often buried in the price of goods," Walmart said. Current Jet customers don't need to worry about the brand going away. After the acquisition closes, each organization will continue to maintain their distinct brands. Walmart and Jet will leverage each other's technology to "develop new offerings to help customers save time and money," the companies said. //Related Articles Walmart Pay Now Available in Stores Nationwide In a statement, Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon elaborated on that plan. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," McMillon said. "We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. "Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time… It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart," he added.

Jet co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will continue to run Jet as well as Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce operations after the acquisition closes, according to sources. The deal includes $3 billion in cash, as well as $300 million in Walmart stock that will be paid out over time as part of an incentive bonus plan for Jet executives. The announcement comes after Recode reported the deal was finalized over the weekend. Walmart and Jet declined to comment on the earlier report. For Walmart, the purchase marks a giant bet on a largely unproven startup that only launched its shopping site widely last July. Up until now, the largest U.S. e-commerce acquisition was last year’s $2.4 billion sale of Zulily, a public company, to QVC. The Jet acquisition is an acknowledgement by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon that his company needs outside help if it’s ever going to close the giant gap with Amazon. It’s still unclear whether that is the right strategy for the brick-and-mortar retailer. Lore spoke about battling Amazon on Recode Decode last December: The deal is in many ways a marriage of necessity, but a shot worth taking, as I explained last week when news of the talks first broke. Walmart’s $14 billion in annual e-commerce sales is a fraction of Amazon’s $99 billion and is growing slower than the industry average. Its growth rate has decelerated for five consecutive quarters. Jet.com was co-founded in 2014 by the entrepreneur Marc Lore in an attempt to build a new online megastore that would compete with the likes of Amazon, Walmart and Costco. Jet has secured more than $800 million in financing since its founding but is spending $20 million to $25 million on advertising a month to fund its growth. It is not profitable. It most recently raised a $619 million round that gave it a value of more than $1.6 billion, but was going to have to keep raising huge sums of money to survive on its current path. Lore pulled the rip cord instead, but he will be rewarded handsomely — he owns about 25 percent of the company, according to sources. Such a stake suggests Lore stands to make as much as $750 million in the deal. He will now have Walmart’s deep pockets — the company registered $15 billion in profits last year — to try to fuel more growth at Jet. Lore will stay on and run Walmart.com as well as Jet.com, two sources said. It seems likely that he will report to McMillon, the CEO. Walmart’s current global e-commerce chief, Neil Ashe, will eventually depart after a transitional period, these people said. He joined Walmart in 2012 after a three-year stint at CBS Interactive. Lore previously co-founded Diapers.com’s parent company and sold it to Amazon for $550 million in 2011 after the two sides battled through a pricing war that threatened to put the startup out of business. Jet sells more than 12 million products ranging from TVs to toys to cereal, and even milk and other fresh groceries in some markets. A little less than a third of its sales volume comes from items that Jet stores in its own warehouses and sells directly to customers, an exec recently told Recode. The remainder comes from a network of more than 2,000 vendors who list their own products on Jet.com and ship orders to Jet customers from their own facilities. The company typically takes a cut of 8 to 15 percent on these orders. As of March, Jet was on track to sell more than $1 billion worth of goods over the next 12 months, though it only records a fraction of that as revenue. Jet has attempted to stand out from competitors through a discounting model, dubbed the Smart Cart, that rewards customers with greater discounts as they add more items to their order. Jet also gives customers additional discounts if they forfeit the right to return an item, or pay with a debit card instead of a credit card. Four million people have made a purchase on Jet since it launched, but the company recently shifted its advertising efforts to getting existing customers to come back more often. Jet originally planned to charge customers a $50 annual membership fee in exchange for even larger discounts, but scrapped that model before its launch. At the time, Lore explained the move in part by saying that some brands did not want to sell goods on a site that was considered a discount destination. On the back end, Jet’s technology can identify in real time which orders should be routed to which vendors to garner the lowest fulfillment and shipping costs — a model that is said to allow the company to provide bigger discounts for bigger orders. Vendors are able to set business rules so they only accept orders that will be profitable for them, Lore has previously said. Such technologies were attractive to Walmart, according to sources, as it attempts to use its vast store and warehouse footprint to reduce shipping costs and cut down on delivery speeds. Amazon has put pressure on the whole industry through its Amazon Prime shipping program, which now delivers some goods in as little as two hours in dozens of cities. Walmart is expected to utilize some parts of the pricing technology on its other e-commerce sites. Walmart may also use some of Jet’s technologies to expand the business it gets from other vendors selling their wares through Walmart.com. This model — known as a third-party marketplace — is also employed aggressively by Amazon, which now gets around half of its unit sales from that group. Even with Walmart acquiring the strong Jet leadership team and proprietary technology, the deal still will be viewed as a rich, if not desperate, one by some industry observers. Jet does not disclose revenue numbers, but my back-of-the envelope math suggests the company is on pace to do no more than around $500 million in revenue over the next year. An acquisition price that is six times a company’s revenue is mostly unheard of in e-commerce, especially for a company that is nowhere near profitable. Dollar Shave Club sold to Unilever for between four and five times revenue but had said it could be profitable on an Ebitda basis by year’s end. Amazon, by comparison, currently trades around 3.7 times its e-commerce revenue and has registered record profits three quarters in a row. Jet is based in Hoboken, N.J., and has raised investments from several of Diapers.com’s original backers including Accel Partners, NEA and MentorTech Ventures. Jet also took investments from Primary Venture Partners, Bain Capital Ventures, Google Ventures and Alibaba. Lore had been known to regale the press with his ambitious plan to build a long-term stand-alone business that could be worth tens of billions some day. Jet’s investors are still pleased. Several have told Recode privately that they thought the chances of a successful outcome were slim to near-impossible, even with the background of Lore and his co-founders. Now, they’re cashing out tens of millions or more, in some cases. "Not bad for two years’ work," one said. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Lore would run Sam's Club's online operation. He will only run Walmart and Jet's e-commerce businesses. Update: The story was updated to include official announcement of the deal from Walmart. recode_divider More From Recode Donald Trump told Tim Cook that Apple is going to ‘build a big plant’ in the U.S. Post-election ‘terror and hysteria’ over Trump is not justified, says Observer editor Ken Kurson Recode Daily: Facebook built a censorship tool that could help it get back into China Can the journalists who work for Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner still cover the White House fairly?

Published Aug 8th, 2016 9:57 am jsmith@thecitywire.com / @tbarkansas The Young Entrepreneurs Academy (YEA) will soon have its first location in Arkansas as the Bentonville-Bella Vista Chamber of Commerce will offer its first YEA class this fall. The Chamber will host two informational meetings about the program with the first being Aug. 8 and the second Sept. 12. The meetings will begin at 4:30 p.m. in the Walmart World Room, which is upstairs from the Walmart Museum on the Bentonville Square. Founded in 2004 at the University of Rochester with support from the Kauffman Foundation, the Young Entrepreneurs Academy today works with thousands of students in nearly 170 communities in 38 states. Since the program’s inception, more than 4,250 businesses have been launched, according to the national YEA! website. The YEA teaches students in grades 6-12 (ages 11-18) how to develop a viable business idea and to make that business become a reality. The work with instructors and mentors to: develop a business plan, interact with business professionals from many Northwest Arkansas industries through guest speaking sessions and field trips, pitch their business plan to real local investors, and launch their business or social movement. A winner from the Bentonville-Bella Vista YEA program will be able to take their idea to compete at the regional and possibly national level. “If this had been offered when I was a kid, I would have jumped all over it,” said Dawn Stewart, vice president of business retention and program development for the Chamber. Students must apply for the program and once accepted, they will attend classes for 32 weeks beginning Oct. 17. YEA classes will be 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. every Tuesday (except school holidays) in the Walmart World Room. held at the Walmart World Room. Students aren’t required to have a business idea in mind when they apply. In fact, the first couple weeks of the program is spent brainstorming ideas. Students will have the ability to choose to operate their own business or to form groups to develop a joint business idea. This program provides an excellent alternative for students for whom attending college right out of school may not be a good fit. “They will be students today and CEOs tomorrow,” Stewart said of those selected. The students will have three instructors who will each offer a 10-week curriculum. They will also take field trips and have the chance to hear from a panel of CEOs and several other guest speakers throughout the 32-week course. Each business will have a mentor who will help them develop a sales pitch and marketing plan to present before an investor panel towards the end of the class. “I love that we’re giving another option for youth for what they want to do with their life,” Stewart said. Eric Howerton, CEO of Fayetteville-based WhyteSpyder, plans to be involved in several ways, including as an instructor. WhyteSpyder is a marketing agency. “I would have loved to have discovered my passion long before,” Howerton said, adding that it’s important for this region to demonstrate a more “progressive business-minded” approach. “In reality, school teaches how to learn not how to do,” he said.

Walmart to scoop up Jet.com for $3.3B to better battle Amazon 0 Tech Industry by Ben Fox Rubin August 8, 2016 5:59 AM PDT @benfoxrubin by Roger Cheng August 8, 2016 5:59 AM PDT @RogerWCheng Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Jet.com has landed at Walmart. Photo by Ben Fox Rubin/CNET Walmart is hoping to take its online presence to new heights -- and is willing to pay big for it. The world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer said Monday it has signed a deal to acquire e-commerce startup Jet.com in a cash and stock deal worth $3.3 billion. The purchase, expected to close this year, will be one the biggest yet for an e-commerce company. Rumors of the purchase first started up last week. The deal could create a significant rival to Amazon, which has been the undisputed king of online retail for years. The increased competition might create more choice for online consumers, force prices lower and puncture the dominance of Amazon and its Prime loyalty program. Still, Walmart -- even with Jet -- would have a long way to go to catch up to the Seattle retailer. While Walmart makes significantly more revenue than Amazon overall, Walmart's e-commerce sales last year were a mere $13.7 billion. Amazon's were $107 billion. "This is Walmart being even more committed to winning in e-commerce," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on a call with reporters Monday. In a statement set out earlier in the day, he said the deal will help Walmart.com grow and develop faster, while allowing Jet to become more successful in a shorter period of time. Walmart and Jet disclosed that the retail startup adds 400,000 new shoppers every month and processes an average of 25,000 orders each day. Since officially launching just over a year ago, Jet's marketplace is on track to hit $1 billion in total sales from both the company and third-party sellers. Walmart and Jet will maintain their separate brands. A bulk of the deal is in cash, with Walmart paying $300 million in stock over time. The acquisition is the second major exit for Marc Lore, CEO and co-founder of Jet. Lore started Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com and Soap.com, and eventually sold it to Amazon for $545 million in 2011 after a price war. He stayed at Amazon for a few years but departed to start Jet. According to CrunchBase, Jet has raised $565 million in equity funding, a huge sum for a startup and a clear sign of investors' confidence in Lore's abilities to take on Amazon again. Jet has distinguished itself by offering real-time discounts to customers for purchasing more items from the same warehouse and for waiving free returns, both of which save Jet money. The company has developed a complex algorithm to power these discounts, likening it to a real-time trading platform. Still, Jet has been furiously burning through its war chest in an effort to acquire new customers and get the word out on its new business. Despite plenty of skepticism that Jet could -- from scratch -- take on Amazon, Lore offered an ambitious plan to push Jet to $20 billion in sales by 2020. He may now pursue that goal under Walmart. Lore will be responsible for both Jet.com and Walmart's US e-commerce business, taking on the title president and CEO of Walmart's e-commerce business. Walmart's current global e-commerce chief, Neil Ashe, will leave the company by the end of the fiscal year. Before joining Walmart, Ashe was president of CBS Interactive, parent of CNET.

Finance Search Thu, Nov 24, 2016, 6:02 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 3 hrs 58 mins Wal-Mart to buy US online retailer Jet.com for $3.3 blnBy John Biers | AFP – Mon, Aug 8, 2016 9:08 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Wal-Mart's earnings for the quarter ending July 31 were $3.8 billion, up 8.6 percent from the year-ago period Wal-Mart Stores announced Monday that it will acquire e-commerce company Jet.com for $3.3 billion as it beefs up its online retail operations in response to Amazon and other competitors. Wal-Mart is paying $3 billion in cash for the online retailer. Shareholders of Jet.com, which was launched in July 2015, will also receive $300 million in Wal-Mart shares over time, Wal-Mart said. The move comes as Wal-Mart and other conventional retailers struggle to keep up with Amazon and a slew of smaller online businesses that have sprouted in recent years as consumers become more comfortable with shopping in cyberspace. Conventional retailers have responded by shutting some stores and by meshing the two formats by, for example, having consumers order on line but pick up groceries at a store. In recent months, Wal-Mart has announced ventures with ride-sharing companies Lyft and Uber to allow speedy delivery of goods to compete with Amazon's Prime service. It has also introduced Walmart Pay, a mobile application designed to compete with Apple Pay. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," said Wal-Mart chief executive Doug McMillon. Credit Suisse said the Jet.com acquisition by Wal-Mart could spark acquisitions by other conventional retailers as specialty stores in everything from auto parts to home furnishings look for new ways to reach consumers. The Jet.com deal "could open up the doors for other brick and mortar retailers to follow suit," Credit Suisse said. "Wal-Mart's move is one that many retailers should be considering as they need the people, the technology and infrastructure to compete, but have shied away for fear of further margin erosion," it added. - Targeting millennials - Wal-Mart praised Jet.com's leaders, including chief executive Marc Lore, whose previous company owned the e-commerce site Diapers.com., which was sold to Amazon in 2010. Jet.com has 3.6 million members and has been adding 400,000 new subscribers a month and averaging 25,000 daily processed orders. The company works with about 2,400 retailers and brands. "The acquisition of Jet will infuse Walmart with fresh ideas and expertise, as well as an attractive brand with proven appeal, especially with Millennials, the first generation of true digital natives," Wal-Mart said. The deal could also let Wal-Mart access a wealthier clientele. The average Wal-Mart customer has annual income of about $58,000, compared with $68,000 for Amazon, said market research firm Kantar. Wal-Mart plans to keep Jet.com as a distinct brand. Ramping up investment in e-commerce has been a drag on Wal-Mart earnings, along with added costs due to paying US workers more. Wal-Mart said in October it would raise investment in e-commerce from $700 million in 2015 to $900 million in 2016 and a projected $1.1 billion in 2017. Wal-Mart is still awaiting a fuller payback on the investment. In May, the company reported a seven percent rise in e-commerce sales in the first quarter, a rate of increase that McMillon said was too slow. Wal-Mart reported $478.6 billion in sales last year, more than four times that of Amazon. However, Amazon's market capitalization of $361.6 billion is nearly 60 percent higher than Wal-Mart's. Wal-Mart shares fell 0.6 percent to $73.34. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Mexico maintains growth forecasts despite TrumpAFP Mexico's finance ministry on Wednesday maintained its growth forecasts for 2016 and 2017 despite volatility in … Brexit to spark UK slowdown, blow hole in public purseAFP Lufthansa scraps 900 flights Thursday as pilots extend strikeAFP Webjet signs with Chinese travel partnerAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7390 -0.0011 -0.15% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5931 -0.0025 -0.42% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.7002 +0.0037 +0.53% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Pope Francis Personal loan Aussie dollar Australia energy Kanye West Interflora Donald Trump Pet insurance Aussie weather Interest rate Australia Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

The generous Walmart employee went viral when a customer snapped and posted a photo of him giving a homeless man the shoes off his own feet. Powell then continued to work, greeting Walmart customers in his yellow Walmart vest and pink socks. While his charity warmed the hearts of many, it’s his story that really stood out.

The New Manchester High School student was also homeless for most of his life. When he saw the man walking barefoot, he glanced down at the converses on his feet and saw his own story. Coming from nothing, he was once gifted the converses because of his good grades. Later on the generous teenager found out his godmother was struggling with breast cancer and dyed the sneakers pink in support of her. Regardless of the turbulent stories the sneakers held, he knew it was time they had a new journey. “It’s not an easy lifestyle,” he told Fox News. “I was homeless from third until the 11th grade it was just in and out of hotels, shelters, cars.” READ; This 8-Year-Old Californian Started A Home Bakery To Fund A New House For His Mother Powell’s mother, Brenda Patterson, fled to Georgia seven years ago with Powell and his siblings to escape from domestic violence.

 One chart shows why Walmart just spent $3 billion to take on Amazon Myles Udland Aug. 8, 2016, 10:46 AM 6,571 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Amazon is the king of retail, and now Walmart is reeling. In a deal announced Monday, Walmart acquired e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus an additional $300 million in Walmart stock. This deal is clearly part of Walmart's bid to take on Amazon, which currently brings in about $100 billion in annual e-commerce sales against Walmart's roughly $15 billion. Walmart's total revenue, we'd note, is nearly $500 billion. But as the retail business shifts online, the acquisition of Jet.com gives Walmart not only an existing customer base to build its e-commerce business, but the technical and logistical know-how of an online-first retailer. The urgency for Walmart to do something — anything — to make serious inroads on building out its online operations, however, is clearly outlined in this chart showing the rise of Amazon's market cap against Walmart. And while market cap isn't everything, the shift here very obviously shows that investors are betting big on the future of Amazon while mostly sitting tight on what Walmart is worth, both now and in the future.

Hong, File) NEW YORK – Wal-Mart has agreed to buy fast-growing online retail newcomer Jet.com, which had launched with a splash a year ago when it announced its intention to challenge online leader Amazon. Wal-Mart is paying $3 billion in cash and another $300 million in stock. The deal announced Monday marks a major move for Wal-Mart, which is realizing that it needs to compete more aggressively in the online world. Wal-Mart’s online business has been slowing even as it has been making big investments in new distribution centres and expanding services. Last month, Wal-Mart announced that was selling its Chinese online business Yihaodian.com to the China’s second-biggest e-commerce site J.D.com in a strategic partnership that it hopes will bolster its presence in the lucrative but increasingly competitive marketplace. Buying Jet.com would let Wal-Mart compete more effectively with Amazon.com and other online retailers. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com to make it on their own in a sphere dominated by Amazon.com with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The acquisition is expected to close this year upon regulatory approval, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups in an extremely competitive landscape. In January, Hudson’s Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchased flash-sales site Gilt Group. And in June, Bed, Bath & Beyond scooped up One Kings Lane. As part of the latest deal, the companies will maintain separate brands, with Walmart.com focusing on delivering the company’s everyday low price strategy. Jet.com will continue to provide a curated assortment of products. Jet.com has been grown fast, reaching $1 billion in gross merchandising value in its first year. The Jet.com deal will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger. Jet.com has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Wal-Mart says that it will also be incorporating some of Jet.com’s “smart” technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, it will provide big financial backing. “We’re looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, in a statement. “It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Wal-Mart.” Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, said in a statement that the combination of Wal-Mart’s retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with the team, technology and business it has built at Jet – will allow the company to deliver more value to customers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015 under Lore, set out to reinvent the shopping cart. It now sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers, coming from more than 2,400 retailers. The company, which touts its service, delivers to two-thirds of the country overnight in its purple boxes. In some high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often can offer same-day delivery at no additional cost. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, reported in May that global e-commerce sales rose 7 per cent in the first quarter, weaker than the 8 per cent in the previous quarter and far below the 20 per cent increases seen less than two years ago. So it trimmed its free-shipping pilot program ShippingPass to two-day delivery from three and cut a dollar off the membership to $49 a year in an attempt to answer Amazon’s Prime program. But while Amazon’s Prime membership costs $99 a year, it comes with a lot of perks like streaming music and video and household subscriptions. “From a competitive perspective, we believe the impact on Amazon will be fairly benign,” wrote Moody’s lead retail analysts Charlie O’Shea in a statement. “However, this acquisition in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Wal-Mart is attacking online retail with significant zeal. As we believe ‘catching’ Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg-up on its competitors in the very important race to be number 2 online.” O’Shea noted that Wal-Mart is “paying a lot” for Jet.com, but “no one knows whether they’ve paid too much or too little,” he said. In its latest fiscal year ended January, Wal-Mart generated online sales of $13.7 billion, a fraction of its total revenue of $482.1 billion. And its online figure pales in comparison to Amazon.com’s annual net revenue of $107 billion. Wal-Mart’s online business is ranked number three in terms of sales, behind Apple Inc. Lore has experience competing with Amazon before, as CEO of Quidsi, whose main site was diapers.com. Eventually, it bought him out for more than $500 million back in 2010. Jet.com has faced plenty of challenges, though. Three months, after Jet.com launched, it ditched its annual membership fee of $49.99, leading critics to question the business model. So Jet.com promised to undercut Amazon and other retailers by 4 per cent to 5 per cent instead of larger discounts. But Jet.com is not a discount site. It is built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping and adjusts prices based on what items are in the checkout cart, as well as how far the desired products are from the shopper’s home. So as shoppers put items in their cart, they’re encouraged to add more to build a more efficient cart and buy items labeled “smart cart” for more savings. Users can even further customize orders for more savings. For instance, if they waive the right to return an item – a huge cost for online retailers – prices drop even more. In May, Lore told The Associated Press that Jet.com had expected to reach overall profitability in 2020 and to hit $20 billion in general merchandise value with 15 million customers. Lore said the company wanted to make sure people know about it and was taking its profit from selling products and investing it in advertising. Jet.com was also testing the sale of fresh food like eggs. The Wall Street Journal reported that Lore will take on a senior leadership position on the e-commerce side on the company and Wal-Mart’s top online executive, Neil Ashe, is expected to depart, said a person familiar with the situation. Wal-Mart and Jet.com each declined to comment on that that report. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. slipped 37 cents to $73.39 in morning trading Monday. Its shares are up 3 per cent over the past year.

The acquisition of the loss-making company, which launched its low-price website just a year ago, was seen as a bold attempt to tackle the widening gap between Amazon and Walmart’s own e-commerce business. Although its $482bn in sales last year make Walmart - which also owns Asda - the world’s biggest retailer, the vast majority of this was in traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing and its online revenues were just $13.7bn, compared to $99bn for Amazon’s retail business. Walmart’s market capitalisation, meanwhile, was surpassed by Amazon last year and is now less than two-thirds of its younger rival. We're excited to continue building an incredible savings experience with @Walmart. More on today's news: https://t.co/f93WXlzr4Q— Jet (@Jet) August 8, 2016 Jet, which was founded just two years ago and did not launch a website until July last year, has been seen as one of the few internet retailers capable of stymieing Amazon’s dominance of internet shopping. By offering heavy discounts on bulk orders, which save on shipping costs, the upstart has claimed to undercut Amazon in many areas as well as encourage high-volume shopping on its own site. It has grown to around 3.6m shoppers in the US, although it is heavily loss-making having spent millions on marketing, and was believed to be looking for more cash despite having raised hundreds of millions in recent months. The rise of the retailer also appears to have done little to stunt Amazon, whose sales in North America rose by 25pc last year. Jet is led by Marc Lore, an internet commerce entrepreneur who sold his last company Quidsi, which owned Diapers.com and Soap.com, to Amazon for $545m in 2010. Owning an estimated 25pc of Jet, he stands to make around $750m from the sale. Walmart will pay $3bn in cash and then $300m in shares over time, with the deal ranking as the biggest takeover of a US e-commerce company. Other investors had included Google’s venture capital arm and Alibaba. Jet boss Marc Lore Credit: AP Mr Lore will continue to run Jet.com, which will maintain its status as an independent website, but also take over Walmart’s online operations. The supermarket’s website is set to introduce Jet’s technology, while being under Walmart’s umbrella will allow the startup to lose money for longer. Walmart is believed to have insisted that Mr Lore remain at the combined company for several years as part of the deal. “We’re looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want,” said Walmart’s chief executive Doug McMillon.

Hot Topics: U.S. Presidential Election News Local Heroes Where We Live My Classic Car The Alphabet Print   Email   Font Resize What's the fairest produce of them all? 'Ugly' fruit, veggies get their own glass slipper By Rick Sobey, rsobey@lowellsun.com Updated:   08/08/2016 08:25:04 AM EDT Plaintains are reduced at a Market Basket supermarket are discounted at a local Stop & Shop. SENTINEL & ENTERPRISE PHOTOS / RICK SOBEY TEWKSBURY -- Richard Asadoorian, 66, makes his way from the produce aisles to the reduced-price produce cart at Market Basket in Stadium Plaza. He starts inspecting the outside of the fruits and vegetables, with some having bruises, spots and dents. "I'd pass these plantains up," the Lowell man said, as the banana-like fruit had bruises all over them. "You have to be picky. Make sure they're not too old." He ended up selecting some peaches from the reduced-price area, which offers discounts of 25 percent or more on blemished and edible produce as compared to fruits and vegetables sold in the regular section. "Economic times are tough," he said. "For those on a fixed budget, it's good to have the reduced-price cart, even though they should be more like 50 percent off." An increasing number of grocery chains has begun stocking and distributing fruits and vegetables once deemed unfit for sale based solely on appearance. Recently, Walmart -- the nation's largest grocer with more than 4,000 produce-selling stores -- announced it would sell "less-than-pretty" apples in 300 stores across Florida. Walmart also sells imperfect potatoes in Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma. "We're not planning to sell these products in Massachusetts as of now, but we'll see what customers say in these states and go from there," said John Forrest Ales, a Walmart spokesman. While Walmart doesn't sell imperfect produce in Massachusetts, there are still area options for those seeking cheaper fruits and vegetables at Market Basket and Stop & Shop. Advertisement At Chelmsford's Stop & Shop on Wednesday, a selection of slightly imperfect produce -- including tomatoes, apples and limes -- were being sold at a discount. "Even produce that cannot be sold is put to good use," said Philip Tracey, spokesman for Stop & Shop's New England Division. "Produce that is damaged, for example, is sent to our green energy facility in Freetown, where it is turned into clean energy. Green apples are discounted at a local Stop & Shop. SENTINEL & ENTERPRISE PHOTOS / RICK SOBEY " Wegmans in Burlington doesn't sell imperfect produce, but this type of produce could soon be sliced up for its "fresh cut" products -- such as squash and veggie spaghetti that is chopped up and prepared for customers. "We actually just discussed this the other day in a meeting," said Brad Whitney, produce manager at the Burlington location. "It would be a great use of the produce, and it will taste the same. "It falls in line with our sustainability here," he added. "You hate to see food wasted." The United States throws away tons of food every year. The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that 40 percent of food grown and produced annually in the U.S. goes uneaten. More fruit and vegetables are wasted than any other food category, with 52 percent being lost rather than consumed. Hannaford Supermarket across from Stadium Plaza doesn't sell imperfect produce; however, the company doesn't throw it away, either. Hannaford donates the produce to churches and charities, said Jose Killgren, produce manager. "We give it to people who really need it," he said. In the future, Hannaford Supermarkets in the region could sell imperfect produce. The chain has started selling some produce items that are "cosmetically challenged," according to Michael Norton, director of external communication and community relations. Called "Misfits" produce, these items may be slightly discolored or not uniform in size; in some instances, they have an unusual shape or bump. The food is just as nutritious and flavorful as other produce, and it will be selling for a lower price, as much as 25 percent less, Norton said. "Our supermarkets pride themselves in making sure that any produce we don't sell goes to local food pantries or, when it is not appropriate for donation, to composting and animal feed," said Eric Blom, Hannaford spokesman. "Misfits takes that to another level by helping to reduce farm waste, while providing our customers with another option for nutritious fruit and vegetables." Misfits items will be sold in the produce section of participating Hannaford stores in the Alban, N.Y., area. The offering will include apples, oranges, cucumbers, tomatoes, mini-watermelon, squash and more.  Whole Foods in Bedford doesn't sell imperfect produce, but in April the store started to sell these types of fruits and vegetables in Northern California. Whole Foods already buys less attractive produce for prepared foods, juice and smoothies. "Our goal is zero waste and we're always looking for ways to reduce our collective impact and positively influence the industry," Whole Foods said in a statement. No employees from Market Basket were available to discuss their reduced-price produce, but a Tewksbury man shopping at the store Wednesday certainly didn't hold back when checking out the imperfect produce. "This is my way of protesting the high prices," said the man, who declined to give his name. "Prices have gone up so much over the years, so I check these out. They're not bad."

The major stock indexes were coming off new highs set last week following a strong U.S. jobs report. Energy stocks surged the most as oil prices rose, while health care companies were the biggest laggard. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped two points to 18,541 as of 10:08 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid less than one point to 2,182. The Nasdaq composite index fell four points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,216. Allergan PLC slumped 3.5 percent after the Botox-maker's second-quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street's forecasts. The stock lost $9.14 to $244.70. Wal-Mart Stores slipped about 1 percent after the retail giant agreed to buy fast-growing online retail newcomer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash and another $300 million in stock. The deal underscores how serious Wal-Mart is about challenging online leader Amazon. Shares in Wal-Mart shed 69 cents to $73.06. Germany's DAX was up 0.7 percent after government figures showed that industrial production posted a better-than-anticipated gain in June. France's CAC 40 was up 0.2 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 index was flat. Markets in Asia moved mostly higher despite a report showing China's exports fell again in July, while a decline in imports accelerated. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.6 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.9 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 surged 2.4 percent. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.4 percent, while Seoul's Kospi rose 0.9 percent. India's Sensex added 0.2 percent. Benchmarks in Taiwan, New Zealand and Thailand also rose, while Singapore declined.

Brent crude, used to price international oils, was up 91 cents, or 2.1 percent, at $45.18 per barrel in London. It lost 2 cents on Friday. Bond prices fell.

Walmart announced the deal Monday, adding it will throw in another $300 million in stock. The sale is expected to close by the end of the year.  Walmart hopes to give a shot in the arm to its online business with the purchase, CNN Money said.  Jet.com positioned itself as a low-cost alternative to Amazon.com and traditional shopping clubs such as Costco when it launched in July 2015. It originally said it would only make money off its $49.95 membership fee but scrapped the fee less than three months later.  Jet processed 25,000 orders a day and has access to 2,400 retailer partners, according to Walmart. It is not yet profitable, according to the Los Angeles Times. The two will remain separate brands. Jet CEO Marc Lore of Mountain Lakes was named one of Fortune Magazine's "Smartest People in Tech" in 2012 for his e-commerce business, Quidsi (Latin for "What if?"), which he founded in 2005 with his childhood friend Vinit Bharara. Quidsi's first e-commerce venture was diapers.com, which was sold to Amazon for $500 million in 2010. Lore will stay with the company after the sale in an as yet-unannounced role, USAToday.com said.  Jeff Goldman may be reached at jeff_goldman@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JeffSGoldman.

Brian Sozzi Aug 8, 2016 3:39 PM EDT Updated from 11:07 a.m. to include CEO comments.  Bricks and mortar retail king Walmart (WMT) has pulled out the big guns this year in its efforts to shoot down digital foe Amazon (AMZN) . The latest bazooka shot was fired on Monday as the world's largest retailer said it will acquire e-commerce player Jet.com for $3 billion in cash. It will also give Jet.com $300 million worth of Walmart shares, which will be paid out over time. Jet.com founder Marc Lore -- a long-time e-commerce entrepreneur -- will assume the leadership of Walmart's U.S. e-commerce operations, the company confirmed on a media call Monday afternoon. Neil Ashe, who currently oversees Walmart's e-commerce operations, will depart. Jet will continue to operate independently.  In Jet, said the source, Walmart recognizes an experienced management team in digital retail. In particular Lore is an expert in the sector, a source close to the matter said, and he could provide very valuable knowledge on e-commerce. "Marc points to the future," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told reporters.  Walmart expects the deal to close later this year. Shares were recently down less than 1% to $73. According to the source, Walmart is particularly keen on Jet's "smart cart" technology. The technology recommends savings opportunities to customers such as increasing item quantities, buying items that ship from the same location, waiving returns and using a low-fee payment method. Jet will also help Walmart expand the number of items it sells online, and reach a higher income customer. The ability of Jet's technology to help Walmart customers save money over time was not lost on McMillon. "The customer has more choice over the price they pay, they can build a basket of items," McMillon told TheStreet when asked what he really likes about Jet's business model. He added, "It's [building baskets and subsequently saving money on an overall shopping trip] frankly true to the spirit of Walmart's pricing philosophy." McMillon did acknowledge that integrating the two online platforms -- and getting key Jet technology onto Walmart's website -- will not happen overnight. He also pointed out that Walmart's backing with such things as fulfillment will help to lower costs for Jet, and "achieve profitability sooner." "A Walmart and Jet.com tie-up could firmly make the e-commerce battle a two-horse race. While Amazon's current lead may make it seem like the race is already won, this combination could make Walmart more competitive as an omni-channel player with an innovative website in Jet.com," wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman in a new note on Monday.  The Jet deal comes in the wake of several actions Walmart has taken this year to try and close the competitive gap with Amazon.  Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like Trump's Tech-Firm Target Practice As tech companies become enemies of the State, mid-cap financials are a good play.

Jet says its sales have reached an annual run rate of $1 billion. As part of the deal, Jet co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will take over as president and CEO of Wal-Mart e-commerce at the end of the current fiscal year. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has acquired online marketplace Jet.com in a cash and stock deal valued at over $3 billion, Wal-Mart announced today. Reports surfaced last week about Wal-Mart’s interest in Jet, with a Wal-Mart spokeswoman declining to comment at the time and Jet not returning multiple requests for comment. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer by revenue but far behind Amazon.com Inc. in online sales, anounced this morning that it will pay $3 billion in cash and an additional $300 million in stock to acquire Jet, which launched 13 months ago. Why Amazon is suddenly swimming in profit As part of the deal, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will take over as president and CEO of e-commerce at Wal-Mart, effective at the end of the current fiscal year. Current president and CEO of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will be leaving the retail chain at that time. “(Ashe) and I have been talking about the fact that this was a natural inflection point for a leadership change,” Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon told reporters on a conference call on Monday afternoon. “Marc is excited about the opportunity to work on the Wal-Mart brand. I expect that we’ll work together for a long, long time.” “The combination of Wal-Mart’s retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint, and digital assets – together with the team, technology and business we have built here at Jet – will allow us to deliver more value to customers,” Lore said. Related Articles Top 500 U.S. E-Retailers Jet.com acquires online retailer Hayneedle Online Marketplaces E-retailers rely more heavily on online marketplaces Online Marketplaces Jet.com predicts its sales will total $1 billion Wal-Mart says Jet will continue to operate as its own distinct brand. “Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time,” McMillon said. “Our customers will win. It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Wal-Mart.” “Wal-Mart has definitely put its stake in the ground saying, ‘We’re going to be winning in e-commerce,’" said Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group. “Amazon should be concerned about what Wal-Mart is doing.” The $3.3 billion cash and stock purchase price represents nearly six times the amount of funding Jet.com has raised in its brief history. According to CrunchBase, Jet has raised $565 million across four rounds of funding. Jet, which launched to a torrent of hype 13 months ago, offers shoppers a variable pricing model, including lower prices for buying more of certain items or opting out of free returns on items.  Jet’s sales have reached an annual run rate of $1 billion, and chief revenue officer Scott Hilton says it now has over 4 million active shoppers. Jet.com operates as a marketplace on which some 2,400 brands sell 12 million SKUs, Wal-Mart says. Jet.com process 25,000 daily orders and is attracting 400,000 new shoppers per month, according to Wal-Mart. Jet launched in July, requiring a $49.95 annual subscription, aiming to generate additional revenue beyond the commission it charges for sellers on its shopping portal. The company opted to jettison the subscription model just three months later, instead opening up the marketplace to all shoppers, which some observers suggested it was having trouble attracting shoppers quickly enough to meet its projections of rapid growth. Jet's basic commission is 15% on a sale, although the rate drops for higher-ticket purchases. Lore is “one of the smartest people in e-commerce” who will bring a new kind of thinking to Wal-Mart to help it transition to digital commerce, says Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. “Wal-Mart still struggles with things like third party marketplaces, which Marc and his team have successfully built.” Jet itself grew through acquisition, buying online retailer Hayneedle in February. Hayneedle had been No. 95 in the 2015 Internet Retailer Top 500, with estimated 2014 online sales of $404 million. The acquisition of Jet appears to be another sign that Wal-Mart, No. 4 in the Internet Retailer 2016 Top 500 Guide, is taking direct aim at Amazon, No. 1. Some industry experts say this move won’t necessarily close the gap between Wal-Mart and Amazon, however. “While Jet’s deeply discounted pricing model fits Wal-Mart’s low price strategy we don't believe that this marriage offers anything truly differentiated or new to the market,” says Dianne Inniss, customer experience and innovation strategist at ThoughtWorks Retail. “While Wal-Mart will acquire some interesting pricing technology and the e-commerce capabilities that it has struggled to develop, this investment won’t be a game changer in the battle against Amazon which still accounts for half of all e-commerce growth. Compared to the Amazon.com powerhouse, this marriage still has a long way to go.” Bloomberg News contributed Topics acquisition Amazon.com Inc.

Wal-Mart, headquartered in Berntonville, Ark., will pay $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares to be paid over an undisclosed time period, the retailer said in a statement. It's Wal-Mart's largest ever deal in the United States. Jet.com, based in Hoboken, N.J., surpassed $1 billion in gross merchandise sales since it started a year ago. It processes an average of 25,000 orders a day and is adding 400,000 shoppers monthly, according to a release. Wal-Mart's website had $13.6 billion in annual revenue, which was 3 percent of its $482 billion in total revenue, including at it 11,527 stores. Amazon's sales were $107 billion last year, including its Web-service business, according to CNBC. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO, {link:said in a statement. WalMart has been trying to expand past its brick-and-mortar operation with new offices in Silicon Valley and e-commerce distribution centers. Like Amazon Prime, it debuted an annual subscription service that includes shipping. "Wal-Mart has definitely put its stake in the ground saying, 'We're going to be winning in e-commerce,'" said Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group to Bloomberg. "Amazon should be concerned about what Wal-Mart is doing." Wal-Mart and Jet will maintain distinct brands, with Wal-Mart focusing on goods at low prices "every day" and Jet still providing a more "curated" assortment of products, the companies said. Also, "Walmart and Jet will leverage innovative technology solutions from both companies to develop new offerings to help customers save time and money," the release said. Jet founder Marc Lore, 45, will continue to play a key role at the company, according to the companies. "We started Jet with the vision of creating a new shopping experience," Lore said in a statement. "Today, I couldn't be more excited that we will be joining with Walmart to help fuel the realization of that vision. The combination of Walmart's retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint, and digital assets – together with the team, technology and business we have built here at Jet – will allow us to deliver more value to customers." Lore cofounded Quidsi, which runs the e-commerce sites Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com, but sold it to rival Amazon in 2010 for $550 million. He debuted Jet.com in 2015.

Wal-Mart is paying $3 billion in cash and another $300 million in stock. The deal announced Monday marks a major move for Wal-Mart, which is realizing that it needs to compete more aggressively in the online world. Wal-Mart’s online business has been slowing even as it has been making big investments in new distribution centers and expanding services. Last month, Wal-Mart announced that was selling its Chinese online business Yihaodian.com to the China’s second-biggest e-commerce site J.D.com in a strategic partnership that it hopes will bolster its presence in the lucrative but increasingly competitive marketplace. Buying Jet.com would let Wal-Mart compete more effectively with Amazon.com and other online retailers. The deal also reflects the difficulties for startups like Jet.com to make it on their own in a sphere dominated by Amazon.com with its network of distribution hubs and the powerful asset of its Prime membership program. The acquisition is expected to close this year upon regulatory approval, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said. The move follows a series of acquisitions by major traditional retailers of online startups in an extremely competitive landscape. In January, Hudson’s Bay, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, purchased flash-sales site Gilt Group. And in June, Bed, Bath & Beyond scooped up One Kings Lane. As part of the latest deal, the companies will maintain separate brands, with Walmart.com focusing on delivering the company’s everyday low price strategy. Jet.com will continue to provide a curated assortment of products. Jet.com has been grown fast, reaching $1 billion in gross merchandising value in its first year. The Jet.com deal will help Wal-Mart grab a higher-income customer who typically is younger. Jet.com has more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. Wal-Mart says that it will also be incorporating some of Jet.com’s “smart” technology that lowers prices in real time by looking for ways to cut costs. For Jet.com, which has been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, it will provide big financial backing. “We’re looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, in a statement. “It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Wal-Mart.” Marc Lore, co-founder and CEO of Jet.com, said in a statement that the combination of Wal-Mart’s retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint and digital assets together with the team, technology and business it has built at Jet— will allow the company to deliver more value to customers. Jet.com, launched in July 2015 under Lore, set out to reinvent the shopping cart. It now sells 12 million products, from jeans to diapers, coming from more than 2,400 retailers. The company, which touts its service, delivers to two-thirds of the country overnight in its purple boxes. In some high-density regions such as New York City, Jet often can offer same-day delivery at no additional cost. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, reported in May that global e-commerce sales rose 7 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 8 percent in the previous quarter and far below the 20 percent increases seen less than two years ago. So it trimmed its free-shipping pilot program ShippingPass to two-day delivery from three and cut a dollar off the membership to $49 a year in an attempt to answer Amazon’s Prime program. But while Amazon’s Prime membership costs $99 a year, it comes with a lot of perks like streaming music and video and household subscriptions. “From a competitive perspective, we believe the impact on Amazon will be fairly benign,” wrote Moody’s lead retail analysts Charlie O'Shea in a statement. “However, this acquisition in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Wal-Mart is attacking online retail with significant zeal. As we believe ‘catching’ Amazon online is an unrealistic goal for any brick-and-mortar retailer, Wal-Mart now has a definite leg-up on its competitors in the very important race to be number 2 online.” O'Shea noted that Wal-Mart is “paying a lot” for Jet.com, but “no one knows whether they’ve paid too much or too little,” he said. In its latest fiscal year ended January, Wal-Mart generated online sales of $13.7 billion, a fraction of its total revenue of $482.1 billion. And its online figure pales in comparison to Amazon.com’s annual net revenue of $107 billion. Wal-Mart’s online business is ranked number three in terms of sales, behind Apple Inc. Lore has experience competing with Amazon before, as CEO of Quidsi, whose main site was diapers.com. Eventually, it bought him out for more than $500 million back in 2010. Jet.com has faced plenty of challenges, though. Three months, after Jet.com launched, it ditched its annual membership fee of $49.99, leading critics to question the business model. So Jet.com promised to undercut Amazon and other retailers by 4 percent to 5 percent instead of larger discounts. But Jet.com is not a discount site. It is built on a real-time pricing algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping and adjusts prices based on what items are in the checkout cart, as well as how far the desired products are from the shopper’s home. So as shoppers put items in their cart, they’re encouraged to add more to build a more efficient cart and buy items labeled “smart cart” for more savings. Users can even further customize orders for more savings. For instance, if they waive the right to return an item — a huge cost for online retailers — prices drop even more. In May, Lore told The Associated Press that Jet.com had expected to reach overall profitability in 2020 and to hit $20 billion in general merchandise value with 15 million customers. Lore said the company wanted to make sure people know about it and was taking its profit from selling products and investing it in advertising. Jet.com was also testing the sale of fresh food like eggs. The Wall Street Journal reported that Lore will take on a senior leadership position on the e-commerce side on the company and Wal-Mart’s top online executive, Neil Ashe, is expected to depart, said a person familiar with the situation. Wal-Mart and Jet.com each declined to comment on that that report. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. slipped 37 cents to $73.39 in morning trading Monday. Its shares are up 3 percent over the past year.
