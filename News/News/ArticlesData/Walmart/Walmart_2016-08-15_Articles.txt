(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) NEW YORK (AP) — The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Mo., headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, N.Y., who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said. ___ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio on Twitter at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Walmart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, by 27 per cent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Walmart has been in Berkshire’s portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Walmart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. “They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year,” Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he’s probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time.” Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett’s largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 per cent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros’ firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China’s policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday’s Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy, and a higher stake in John Malone’s telecommunications company Liberty Global. It also reflected Berkshire’s more than 14 per cent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66. Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Walmart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a “buy” rating on Berkshire. Berkshire’s filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz was the company’s largest equity investment as of June 30, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co.

(AP Photo/Gerry Broome) Print Email Chris Baker | cbaker@syracuse.com By Chris Baker | cbaker@syracuse.com The Post-Standard Follow on Twitter on August 16, 2016 at 4:10 PM, updated August 16, 2016 at 4:14 PM comments A new poll from Zogby Analytics shows Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump leading Democrat Hillary Clinton among two unusual demographics: NASCAR fans and Wal-Mart shoppers. The poll, released Tuesday afternoon, shows Clinton with a two-point lead over Trump in a sample of 1,277 likely voters. But the unusual measure from Zogby was a look at NASCAR fans and Wal-Mart shoppers. According to Zogby: Another interesting development is over the years we have tracked voting habits among NASCAR fans and Weekly WalMart shoppers. Ten years ago these groups tended to slant conservative and Republican. That trend has been reversed during the Obama Presidency, and these consumers tend to be more liberal and supporters of Democrats today. Trump has reversed this trend. Both NASCAR fans and WalMart shoppers favor Trump over Clinton. Donald Trump is winning NASCAR fans (44% to 36%) and weekly WalMart shoppers 41% to 36%. Clinton served as director of Wal-Mart's board from 1986 to 1992 while her husband was governor of Arkansas (where Wal-Mart is based).   The Zogby poll also shows Trump leading among groups like Independents, men and voters older than 50. Clinton has a commanding lead among Hispanics and African Americans. She leads among millennials, but the poll claims Trump is closing the gap among 25- to 34-year-olds. The poll is a bright spot in a slew of bad numbers for Trump this week. A handful of major polls show Clinton with large leads over Trump in key battleground states. In New York, a poll released Monday shows Clinton with a 30-point advantage. Zogby Analytics was founded by John Zogby, a native of Utica, N.Y.

    Home | About | Archives | Sponsorship | Contact Us | Submit / Suggest            A Look At Wal-Mart's Food Lab, Aimed At Developing New Items by Anne D'Innocenzio, Associated Press Posted: Tuesday, August 16, 2016 at 3:40PM EDT NEW YORK — Wal-Mart opened a 12,000-square-foot culinary and innovation center at its headquarters in June as a place where the nation's largest food retailer can work with major suppliers to come up with new food ideas, and develop ideas on its own to bolster its store-brand selection. Here's a peek at the food lab: WHAT IT IS: The center has 10 test kitchens including a studio-style chef's kitchen and replicas of the bakery and deli kitchens found in most of its stores. It has stoves, ovens and microwaves so the staff can cook the same ways customers do at home. There's also a sensory lab where Wal-Mart can collect feedback from customers and employees, who answer questions about the texture, saltiness or sweetness of a food or beverage. The facility follows a similar lab at the company's Sam's Club headquarters, which opened a few years ago. WHY IT MATTERS: Wal-Mart derives 56 percent of its total sales from food and other grocery items. The company also accounts for about 25 percent of the overall U.S. grocery business. Since customers might shop for food several times a week, it's critical to get food items right to build loyalty. In the past, Wal-Mart had tested products at kitchens throughout its headquarters, but that effort was limited and the feedback it provided was fairly general. Now, Wal-Mart gets specific feedback from customers that it can share with suppliers to help decide if an item is ready or needs changes. That collaboration saves money and cuts several months off a product launch, which can last a year from idea to an item landing on store shelves.

Jim Tovey says he will be meeting with new Walmart Canada CEO Lee Tappenden next month in an effort to determine whether the North American retail giant will be opening a store in Lakeview. “That’s the plan (to open a Walmart),” Tovey said in an interview from Windsor Tuesday, where he was attending the annual Association of Municipalities of Ontario conference. “But there have been a lot of rumours going around and it’s my job to find out for the residents.” Tovey said he also plans to show the new CEO some of the projects in the works to revitalize Lakeview’s waterfront. Speculation began to swirl in the community after a Mississauga News story this past spring in which Trinity Development repeatedly refused to comment on reports that Walmart is no longer part of its massive commercial and retail project on Lakeshore Road. The News reported earlier this year that Walmart would be opening a location on the Lakeview property just west of Cawthra Road — information that was confirmed by Mike Bottigoni, senior vice-president of construction for Trinity. However, the large development firm wouldn’t make the same affirmation in May when asked to address speculation in the community that a Walmart store is no longer in the plans. Senior project manager Brad Desrocher would only say “no comment.” Desrocher and other Trinity executives whom The News reached out to Tuesday have not replied to requests for comment on the project. Desrocher deferred the inquiry to Walmart. When asked if the store is going ahead in Lakeview, Walmart spokesperson Felicia Fefer replied “we do not have anything further to share at this time.” Tovey said from what he understands, Trinity has a 20-year lease with Walmart that the retail giant “can’t get out of.” Tovey said he was told several months ago by Trinity that Walmart would have an 84,000-square-ft. location on the Trinity land. He said if plans have changed, he hasn’t been made aware, but didn’t hide his opinion on the possibility of a Walmart no longer coming to Lakeview. “The one thing that would concern me is dead retail space,” he said in a May interview. “I’m always concerned when there are empty stores. It wouldn’t be nice to see 84,000 square feet of space sitting there with boards on it.” Signs on the Trinity land indicating a Walmart would be one of the retailers have been boarded up with metal plates for at least a few months, Tovey said. The idea of a Walmart in Lakeview has been met with mixed public opinion, with some saying it will kill the community’s distinct village character and devastate small mom-and-pop shops, while others maintain it will actually boost business for local stores by bringing more vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Tovey said the new store is similar to Walmart’s “Urban 90” stores, one of which opened in Toronto in 2012, which are dramatically smaller than the traditional supercentres and are designed for dense urban markets in which other tenants can occupy the building because of the set-up on the second floor. The plan by Trinity Developments, which owns 14.5 acres of land, is to open an anchor store as part of a phased, mixed-use development that also includes residential buildings, office space, shopping and cafes on the prime piece of land at Lakeshore Road East and Enola Avenue. The project will create 1,500 jobs and generate $3 million in annual taxes, Trinity said back in 2013. Walmart will also be opening a 136,000-sq.-ft. Supercentre at Erin Mills Town Centre, scheduled to open before the end of the year, Fefer said, adding the retailer's South Common Mall location will remain open.

Jacqueline Nelson The Globe and Mail Published Friday, May 27, 2016 8:31AM EDT Last updated Friday, May 27, 2016 5:50PM EDT Comments Print / License AA Loblaw Cos. Ltd. is mulling the sale of its gas station business, bucking the trend of large retailers doubling down at the pumps. The Brampton, Ont.-based grocery and pharmacy giant said Friday that it had started a process to talk to potential buyers about the sale of its 212 gas stations, which have been established alongside 20 per cent of the company’s locations, such as Real Canadian Superstore, No Frills and Independent grocers across most provinces. Loblaw’s move to siphon off its fuel business would be at odds with competitors who are increasing their focus on their gas bars in Canada and south of the border. Michael Medline, chief executive officer of Canadian Tire, has said he wants to bolster the company’s gas business because it helps drive customers to the retail and financial services divisions of the company. “We really like this business,” Mr. Medline told analysts earlier this month. “Our plan is to ensconce the petroleum division even stronger into our group of businesses.” In the U.S., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to build and run more of its own gas stations, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The company’s long-time partner operator Murphy USA Inc. will be left to tend the more than 1,000 stores it has partnered with Wal-Mart on so far. On both sides of the border, Costco Wholesale Corp. has become an aggressive competitor in the gas business, offering discounts that customers will travel further to get and line up for on weekends. These stations typically exceed the industry average litres pumped per year by a wide margin. Grocers, Canadian Tire and Costco have grown their presence in the retail gas-fuelling business significantly in the past decade, contributing to an overall decline of the number of locations in Canada as smaller competitors are squeezed out. While there were about 21,000 gas stations across the country 25 years ago, now there are about 12,000, said petroleum industry consultant Michael Ervin, who monitors the retail gasoline industry. Loblaw gas stations are branded under various names that respond to their adjacent stores, such as Gas Bar, At The Pumps and A Plein Gaz. The gas bars have loyalty systems that allow customers to earn rewards through the company’s PC Points cards, as well as a legacy rewards program called Superbucks. When it comes to buyers, Canadian convenience giant Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. has been acquisitive in recent months. But Peter Sklar, an analyst at BMO Nesbitt Burns, says he isn’t sure whether the company “would have an interest due to the relatively small square footage of the store footprint versus the average Couche-Tard store.” Other major Canadian gas station owners include 7-Eleven Canada Inc. and Parkland Fuel Corp., which have both been expanding. Very few oil refining businesses still have retail gas stations integrated into their businesses, with the notable exception of Suncor Energy Inc.’s Petro-Canada brand. In March, Imperial Oil Ltd. struck a $2.8-billion deal to sell 497 Esso-brand retail gas stations to five fuel distributors in a sale process that garnered interest from U.S. buyers as well as Canadian businesses. Loblaw says that whether it sells the gas stations or not, it intends to keep the loyalty systems and locations intact for customers, which will be a consideration for any potential buyer. “Customers appreciate the convenience of on-site fuel and the benefits of a loyalty program that links gas bar and grocery purchases. We anticipate that these benefits will continue regardless of whether the business is sold,” Grant Froese, chief operating officer of Loblaw, said in a statement. The company said it had gone public with its proposal to sell the business to generate a “competitive and transparent” bidding process. The fact that Loblaw wants to cling to this rewards program comes as no surprise to Mr. Ervin, who said the opportunity to “cross-merchandise,” or create incentives at the pump that encourage shopping in the grocery store, has been one of the big strengths of non-traditional gas station operators such as the grocers and Canadian Tire. But the partnership model hasn’t been foolproof in Canada. In 2002, Wal-Mart attempted to expand its gas station partnership agreement with Murphy into Canada. Murphy built eight gas stations in the country, with plans to grow and aggressively compete on price. But by 2007, Murphy had quietly exited the Canadian market altogether. The gas business can also be volatile from quarter to quarter. At Canadian Tire, gas sales were down a little in the first quarter because of unseasonable weather and economic weakness in Alberta. But CEO Mr. Medline said he was not too concerned about sales volumes in the long term. “They will remain steady or probably in the long term a tiny bit up, but they don’t move that much.” With files by reporter Marina Strauss.

Walmart customer Richelle Stewart capture the confrontation on video. She posted it to Facebook where it has been viewed more than 300,000 times. Stewart told NBC 4 in Columbus that she and her husband spotted the monkey attacking an employee in the parking lot as they were arriving. "All of a sudden, the monkey jumps on him and she pushes him out of the way," Stewart said, according to NBC 4. A Walmart spokesman told the station the employee was not bitten. The animal, clad in a diaper, apparently escaped from a nearby camper. The employee grabbed the monkey's leash and returned it to its owner, who was "grateful," according to NBC 4. The Ohio Department of Agriculture is trying to track down the animal's owner to determine if the monkey is registered in the state, according to the station. The monkey was only on the loose for a matter of minutes before being returned to its owner, the Lancaster Eagle-Gazette said. The monkey escaped the camper when a door was opened. No criminal charges were filed against the animal's owners.

Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, by 27% to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Walmart has been in Berkshire's portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple.

Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Walmart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. "They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year," Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. "If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he's probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time." Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett's largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7% one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Apple acquires artificial intelligence startup Turi Apple is upping the ante on artificial intelligence (AI). Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros' firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China's policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday's Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy Inc , and a higher stake in John Malone's telecommunications company Liberty Global Plc . It also reflected Berkshire's more than 14% stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 . Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Wal-Mart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a "buy" rating on Berkshire. Berkshire's filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz was the company's largest equity investment as of June 30, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co .

Christine Ann Davis, 45, of the 1300 block of Fritz Drive, on July 10 found the credit card in the parking lot of Wal-Mart, 3926 Nazareth Pike, Bethlehem Township. A female victim on July 10 reported to police she was shopping at 9:15 a.m. at Wal-Mart when she realized she was missing $100 in cash and a credit card from her purse. The victim told police she suspected the items fell out of her wallet and went to cancel the credit card. The victim then learned from her creditor an unauthorized purchase for $80 was made at Holiday Hair, which is located in the same shopping center as Wal-Mart. Police contacted the manager of Holiday Hair and was provided a description of Davis. Police nabbed Davis when she returned to the store to return the hair products. She allegedly provided a false name when signing the return slip, but gave police an identification card revealing her true identity. In an interview with police at the station, Davis allegedly admitted to the crime, saying she used a credit card she found to pay for the hair products because she didn't have enough of her own money. Davis is charged with unauthorized use of an access device, theft (two counts), forgery and receiving stolen property. She was arraigned Saturday before District Judge Jacqueline Taschner, who set bail at $5,000. In lieu of bail, Davis was taken to Northampton County Prison.

Gwinnett County police suspect the two used $1,000 worth of fake bills to buy lawn equipment in Buford, Georgia, last month. The woman reportedly returned one of the purchases at another Walmart store in exchange for real cash. SEE MORE: 50 Cent Says He Posed With Fake Money To Protect His Brand Investigators say the cashier who accepted the fake money quit her job. "She quit her job shortly after being questioned about this transaction," Cpl. Michele Pihera told WAGA. "So it could have been an inside job?" reporter George Franco asked. "It might have been," Pihera replied. Apparently, the illegal use of prop money is a problem across the nation, even though businesses that make and supply it have to follow strict guidlines. Atlanta-based movie prop warehouse owner RJ Rappaport said the fake bills believed to be used in the Walmart scam appear to skirt federal guidelines. "What they did is they took real money, and they copied it on a copier. And then they put this (pointing to the phrase 'For Motion Picture Use Only') — this tiny disclaimer that says, 'prop money,' so they say it's legal. It's not," he explained to WXIA. Rappaport told WAGA none of the fake bills he makes have any elements copied from real cash. The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports movie prop money was also used in at least one other recent incident in Athens, Georgia.

In video footage of the incident, the monkey appears to be scuffling with an employee collecting shopping carts when the animal's owner barrels toward him to pull them apart. Footage of the bizarre moment was caught on camera by Richelle Stewart, who posted the clip to Facebook.  'I just video tapped a monkey attacking a guy at Walmart in Lancaster Ohio!' Stewart wrote on the video.  Going bananas: A monkey scuffling with an Ohio Walmart employee was caught on camera The monkey can be heard squeaking and hooting as it holds on to the arm of the Walmart employee, before its owner runs over to push them apart  Since she posted it on Sunday it has received more than 280,000 views.  The clip begins with the monkey standing on top of a metal beam on the cart collection area. The monkey can be heard squeaking and hooting as it holds on to the arm of the Walmart employee, who was trying to grab the animal's leash after it ran from its owner, according to KSN.com.  As the man and monkey scuffle, the owner barrels toward the two shouting: 'Let him go, let him go, let him go!' She breaks them apart, holding the monkey by the hand as if it were a toddler and says to the employee: 'If he bites you, they'll put him down.' As they walk away the unidentified woman says to the employee: 'No, I'm not mad at you.' She then can be seen walking hand-in-hand with the monkey back to the trailer that it had previously escaped from.   As the man and monkey scuffle, the owner barrels toward the two shouting: 'Let him go, let him go, let him go!' The woman says to the employee, 'If he bites you, they'll put him down', before walking away 'I saw the monkey and he was just standing on the carts,' Stewart told 'The monkey had escaped from a nearby camper. And we saw the cart guy from Walmart coming over to help her. 'All of sudden the monkey jumps on him and she pushed him out of the way,' Stewart told the New York Daily News. The Ohio Department of Agriculture is now trying to find the woman to figure out if the monkey is registered or not.

Share this article Share In a statement to DailyMail.com, a spokeswoman said the Department of Agriculture hasn't identified the woman and said they are investigating. 'While I cannot speculate on what would happen if the owner is identified, I can say that most monkeys are considered "dangerous wild animals" under an Ohio law passed in 2012 and are prohibited without a valid permit from the state.  'Under Ohio law it is also illegal to allow a dangerous wild animal to escape from its enclosure or to allow one to come into contact with the public,' Communications Director Erica Hawkins said in an email.  After the incident, a call was placed to 911 and reported that a person had been bitten by the monkey, according to CBS 6.  The employee was uninjured and the woman walked back to her trailer hand-in-hand with the monkey The Lancaster Eagle-Gazette reported that the caller said the monkey was bigger than her two-year-old child.  When Lancaster Police responded to the scene they determined the monkey only grabbed the man and he was not in need of medical attention.  Since he was unharmed, no report was filed by officers.   Read more: Monkey gets loose in Walmart parking lot | KSN-TV Diaper-wearing monkey gets loose, scuffles with Wal-Mart employee in parking lot | WTVR.com Monkey reported loose in Wal-Mart parking lot www.nydailynews....

Here's Why Wal-Mart Insurers Don’t Think Tracy Morgan Deserved His Accident Settlement Share facebook twitter whatsapp tumblr pinterest email SOUL TRAIN AWARDS LOVE & HAPPINESS, AN OBAMA CELEBRATION SOUL TRAIN WEEKEND Disgusting! Here's Why Wal-Mart Insurers Don’t Think Tracy Morgan Deserved His Accident Settlement The situation continues to get uglier. Published August 16th While the horrific car crash that left Tracy Morgan severely injured and another passenger dead has seen a sliver of positivity in the comedian's recovery, the situation has recently taken another ugly turn with the legal battle between Wal-Mart and its insurers. While Wal-Mart paid up a rumored $90 million after one of their drivers crashed into the limo which was carrying the 30 Rock actor and several other passengers, the insurers are now claiming that the retail giant overpaid to save face. According the Daily Mail, the documents filed by the insurers state that the "exorbitant" settlements should not be covered by them, because there is "no coverage to the extent which these settlements were paid to avoid adverse publicity." Continuing to allege that Wal-Mart's excessive payment was a ploy to avoid bad publicity, they added that the amount the chain paid to both Morgan and his co-passengers was excessive in comparison to the actual injuries he experienced. They also claim that Wal-Mart failed to sufficiently assess investigations into Morgan's health before settling. "Within weeks of Wal-Mart settling with Morgan, Morgan was seen driving one of the most powerful sports cars in midtown Manhattan, driving without any difficulty and clearly showing he was enjoying himself," the documents read. "Wal-Mart would have learned that Morgan was capable of doing these things had it done an adequate and reasonable investigation before settling." The horrific crash, which took the life of Morgan's friend James McNair and injured three others, caused the star to suffer a traumatic brain injury and several fractures. Watch Tracy talk about surviving the crash in the video above.  Written by Moriba Cummings (Photo: Robert O'neil/Splash News) COMMENTS Get More!

Sure, we were thrilled to hear that Jet.com had successfully executed a highly profitable exit. Walmart paid $3.3 billion, even more than some observers expected. But Jet.com was growing fast, adding some 400,000 customers a month. It recently moved into a very cool new space in Hoboken. We loved its culture, admired what it had already accomplished, and deeply respected Jet.com CEO Marc Lore's long-time commitment to our community (we just honored the company at last November's Awards Celebration). Some of us may have been nursing visions of our own Amazon.com: an independent e-commerce company that might have grown into a $50 billion mammoth right here in our Garden State. That wasn't to be. But there's plenty of good news associated with Jet.com's buyout. First, Jet.com found a great U.S. buyer. In many ways, Walmart is a technology leader: You merely need to look at the amazing things it has done (and continues to do) on the supply chain side of its business. And it does seem that Walmart is looking east to New Jersey, both for a big shot of entrepreneurial spirit and for access to the extraordinary team that Jet.com brought together. This is clearly a strategic acquisition for Walmart, which hasn't been satisfied with its own growth online. For now, at least, Lore will be running both Jet.com and the homegrown Walmart.com operation, and Walmart's CEO promised to be “thoughtful” about how it merges these. In the short term, the stated plan is to build both brands. I'm hopeful Jet.com will ultimately become Walmart's East Coast hub for technology innovation, drawing talent from throughout New Jersey — and into New Jersey from the entire East Coast. I'm also hopeful that Walmart will learn lessons from other successful buyouts, where successful companies have been permitted to keep their culture and operate as independently as possible, while still offering compelling synergies with the parent company. One example immediately comes to mind: the way Walmart's key competitor, Amazon, purchased Audible — and then empowered it to transform the audiobook industry from its home right here in Newark. Even if all goes well for Jet.com within Walmart, it's likely that some of Jet.com's extraordinary team will gradually move on to new ventures. That's the way of the world, and that, too, can only be good news for the New Jersey technology ecosystem. We've certainly seen this virtuous cycle before. Marc Lore did it himself, first selling Diapers.com and its parent company Quidsi to Amazon.com, years before launching Jet.com. Think about the groups of "alumni" emanating from organizations like PayPal after it was sold for $1.5 billion to eBay in 2002. They are referred to commonly as the PayPal Mafia, and they have taken all they've learned into new ventures, including Tesla, LinkedIn, YouTube, Yelp, SpaceX and others. Now imagine that happening again here in New Jersey, as Jet.com "graduates" leverage everything they've learned on Lore's team, creating new startups that build our technological ecosystem and contribute to our communities, just as Jet.com has. At the New Jersey Tech Council, I see these positive dynamics playing out firsthand and close up. We work closely with new and fast-growing ventures like Jet.com to help them make the most of New Jersey's remarkable technological, business and research resources. We see every new generation of buyouts and mergers spawning another new generation of startups. We meet these emerging companies at our venture conferences and networking events; they're the companies we're constantly connecting to partners, funders (including our Jumpstart Angels Network and Venture Fund) and customers.  We see pioneers like Greg Olsen, who sold Sensors Unlimited and with the proceeds invested in and advised many local entrepreneurs over the years. More recently, Navneet Puri, who sold Innopharma to Pfizer and is now growing his new venture, Nevakar. Or Francois Nader, who sold NPS Pharma to Shire and is now investing in new ventures and mentoring/advising both startups and growth companies. Or Gerard Adams, who sold his Elite Daily millennial site to The Daily Mail and is now working to catalyze entrepreneurship in Newark and beyond. These are just a few. This is how it's supposed to work — and in New Jersey, this is how it does work. Even if we were dreaming of big things for Jet.com as an independent company, we can now dream of even bigger things for Jet.com and its mob of enriched and experienced alumni — both inside and outside Walmart.  James Barrood is CEO of the New Jersey Tech Council.

Monkey Gets Loose In Walmart Parking Lot, Throws Down With Employee Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Monkey Gets Loose In Walmart Parking Lot, Throws Down With Employee Image courtesy of Richelle Stewart August 16, 2016 10:00 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk literal monkey business walmart wildlife monkeys retail shopping What happens when a monkey gets loose in a Walmart parking lot and jumps a store employee? Someone catches the whole thing on video, that’s what happens, and the Internet goes crazy. The rumble far from the jungle happened in Lancaster, OH on Sunday night, and was filmed by a shopper who was arriving at Walmart, reports NBC-4. She noticed something a bit odd — a monkey standing on a bunch of carts, apparently in a showdown with an employee trying to help its owner catch it. It had escaped from a woman’s nearby camper. In the video, the monkey’s owner can be seen running towards the worker yelling, “Let her go, let her go! Did she bite you?” “All of a sudden the monkey jumps on him and she pushes him out the way,” the eyewitness told the news station. A Walmart spokesperson told NBC4 the monkey didn’t bite the worker. After it escaped from its camper, the employee took its leash and returned the monkey to its owner, who was “grateful,” Walmart says. The Department of Agriculture is now interested in speaking with the woman out of concern that the monkey might not be registered.

A video posted to Facebook by Richelle Stewart shows the monkey struggling with a Walmart employee by the cart return station in the Lancaster store's parking lot Sunday evening. A woman, apparently the monkey's owner, runs up and pulls the two apart. "Let him go, let him go, let him go! If he bites you, they will put him down," the woman says. The woman and monkey then return to a nearby camper, which the primate apparently escaped from earlier. A Walmart representative told KSN-TV the monkey did not bite the employee and the woman was "grateful" to the worker for catching her unusual pet. The Ohio Department of Agriculture said it is working to identify the woman to determine whether she is an Ohio resident and, if so, whether her monkey is properly registered.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Kate Taylor Aug 16th 2016 5:58AM Public enemy No. 1 in the retail industry today is Amazon, but the biggest threat as we know it didn't begin with the internet. It began with Walmart. "Walmart destroyed retail," retail consultant Jan Kniffen said on Monday on CNBC. "They wrecked every other form of retailing because it was a race to the lowest price, and they were the lowest price." As Walmart beat out other discount retailers like Gold Circle in 1988 and Venture Stores in 1998, the company expanded rapidly across the country. Today, there are more than 5,000 Walmart and Sam's Club locations in the US alone. Walmart's dominance has created an environment where it's difficult for retailers to compete in an overcrowded market. The issue is complicated by recent changes in the retail industry, with more shopping being done online — another factor that is creating more competition for retailers. According to job-placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, retailers have cut almost 44,000 positions so far this year.

And Walmart closed 269 locations earlier this year. The root of the problem, according to Kniffen, is that there are simply too many physical retail stores in the US. Kniffen isn't alone. Last week, Macy's CFO, Karen Hoguet, said in an earnings call that"this country is over-stored, given evolving customer shopping habits." Physical shopping locations can provide incentives for consumers to visit in the form of coffee shops, hair salons, and other things that boost the quality of the experience — but, ultimately, there is a surplus of subpar stores and malls that consultants like Kniffen believe won't be open in a few years. "We've never been this over-stored before," Kniffen said. Walmart did not reply to a request for comment.

A shopper captured the bizarre moment a pet monkey wearing a diaper escaped and 'attacked' a man in a Wal-Mart car park. Richelle Stewart recorded the incident and posted it on Facebook, explaining: "I just [recorded] a monkey attacking a guy at Walmart in Lancaster Ohio!! ‪#‎crazy." The monkey reportedly escaped from a camper van parked outside the Wal-Mart store on August 14 at around 7:50pm when the door was left open. Ms Stewart believes the Wal-Mart employee was attempting to help the woman in the video retrieve the runaway primate when it turned on him. The woman in the video, believed to bet the monkey's owner, is heard shouting at the employee: "Let him go, let him go, let him go! If he bites you, they will put him down." She then grabs the animal's leash and leads it away. Ms Stewart's husband then tells the Wal-Mart employee: "You could have got hurt ... you could have got sick with that." She told NBC4i.com: "I saw the monkey and he was just standing on the carts, and this lady was trying to come over and get him. "The monkey had escaped from a nearby camper. And we saw the cart guy from Walmart coming over to help her. "When we posted it on Facebook, we did it for fun. We go to Wal-Mart, we moved to Lancaster and there's a monkey." Continued below.

X Warren Buffett’s Berkshire takes bigger bite of Apple Move comes as other investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn have sold their shares Tue, Aug 16, 2016, 08:20 Updated: Tue, Aug 16, 2016, 11:08 Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros’ firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors said they dissolved their own Apple stakes         Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has increased its stake in Apple by 55 percent, boosting its bet on the iPhone maker even as prominent investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn shed theirs. Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30th, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31st, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, by 27 per cent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Wal-Mart has been in Berkshire’s portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30th. Mr Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Wal-Mart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. ‘Technophobe’ Warren Buffett takes a $1bn stake in Apple Apple’s difficulty could be rival Samsung’s opportunity Investor Carl Icahn sells entire Apple stake on China woes “They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year,” Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he’s probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time.” Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett’s largest purchase. Berkshire boost Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 per cent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. ADVERTISEMENT Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros’ firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Mr Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China’s policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday’s Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy, and a higher stake in John Malone’s telecommunications company Liberty Global. It also reflected Berkshire’s more than 14 per cent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66. Mr Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Wal-Mart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a “buy” rating on Berkshire. Berkshire’s filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz Co was the company’s largest equity investment as of June 30th, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co.       Topics: Carl Icahn Edward Jones George Soros Jim Shanahan John Malone Leon Cooperman Ted Weschler Todd Combs Warren Buffett Apple Berkshire Hathaway ConocoPhillips Dairy Queen Deere & Co Duracell Fruit of the Loom Kraft Heinz Liberty Global Precision Castparts Soros Fund Management Suncor WalMart Wells Fargo Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears 18:55 European shares steady as metal prices rise 18:53 WRC asks Cityjet pilots to defer strike 18:11 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 17:35 UK chancellor Philip Hammond maps out post-Brexit future 17:23 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Tech Tools: projector for use with smartphones Review: Vivofit Jr, an activity tracker for kids Fool your children into activity by turning it into a game Prynt prints your smartphone photos – and adds video Tech Tools: It’s augmented reality meets actual reality with the help of Zink technology Smart wifi plug gives you the power to control the power Tech Tools: TP Link device means you can use home appliances from your smartphone Most Read in Business 1 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules 2 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 3 Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 4 What to do in your 20s/30s...if you don’t want to be broke in your 60s 5 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 6 Thousands affected as RaboDirect axes investment funds 7 UK chancellor Philip Hammond maps out post-Brexit future 8 Shocking revelations at Rush Credit Union are just the start 9 Loosening of mortgage rules will push up house prices, says Davy 10 WRC asks Cityjet pilots to defer strike Never miss a story.

Berkshire's filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz Co was the company's largest equity investment as of June 30, at US$28.81bil (RM115bil), followed by Wells Fargo & Co. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Facebook builds censorship tool to attain China re-entry: NYT Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Northern Ireland, Wales face FIFA action over poppy displays M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world’s largest retailer, by 27 percent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Wal-Mart has been in Berkshire’s portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted WWeschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Wal-Mart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. “They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year,” Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. “If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he’s probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time.” Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett’s largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 percent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros’ firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors Inc said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China’s policies regarding the company.

According to the Lancaster Eagle-Gazette, police say the monkey got loose at about 7:50 p.m., escaping the trailer after a woman opened the door. "I saw the monkey and he was just standing on the carts, and this lady was trying to come over and get him," Richelle Stewart, who recorded the incident, tells nbc4i.com. "The monkey had escaped from a nearby camper. And we saw the cart guy from Walmart coming over to help her." The monkey jumped on a Walmart employee attempting to help the woman retrieve the animal. The employee was not injured. The employee managed to grab the monkey's leash and the woman ran up and took control of it. Stewart posted her video of the encounter on Facebook. (See the video below.) "When we posted it on Facebook, we did it for fun. We go to Walmart, we moved to Lancaster and there's a monkey," she tells nbc4i.com. Reports say the Ohio Department of Agriculture is trying to locate the woman with the monkey over concerns that the monkey might not be registered.

By Evan Clark on August 15, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its stake in Wal-Mart by 15 million shares. REX/Shutterstock The Oracle of Omaha seems to be leaning away from Bentonville and toward Cupertino. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold off 15 million shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in the second quarter, cutting its stake by 27 percent to 40.2 million shares worth $2.94 billion, according to regulatory filings late Monday. Over the same three months ended June 30, Berkshire boosted its stake in Apple Inc., buying 5.4 million shares, bringing its stake in the iPhone maker to 15.2 million shares worth $1.46 billion. The quirky billionaire is famous for buying and holding onto companies based on a simple premise like Wal-Mart, which buys at scale and drives down prices to sell goods to lower-income consumers. Buffett started accumulating his investment in the discount giant in late 2005 and since the end of that year, the retailer’s stock has gained 56.7 percent (the issue dipped 0.4 percent on Monday). While it’s difficult to draw direct conclusions from the portfolio shifts at Berkshire, in part because Buffett has brought on board other managers to handle some of the investing, the move from a seller of general merchandise to a seller of ultrapopular smartphones would seem to indicate broader general trends, from the rise of mobile to the increasing competition retailers of all stripes from Amazon. Buffett has dipped in and out of the retail and fashion sectors over the years. The investment house holds a 315,400 shares of Procter & Gamble Co., worth about $26.7 million. The company’s also bought and sold stakes in companies such as Nike Inc. and Seritage Growth Properties Inc., a real estate spin-off from Sears Holdings Corp. arranged by Buffett-admirer Edward S. Lampert. Berkshire also bought underwear maker Fruit of the Loom out of bankruptcy in 2002 and continues to run the company. Buffett, who has backed Hillary Clinton for president, has generally been bullish on the economy. Late last year, he noted: “The interesting thing about the economy is you can give almost the same report ever since the fall of 2009. It really has been growing, is growing, at a couple percent a year, which is not bad. People have gotten more optimistic at times. They thought about a double-dip at times, then they thought it was accelerating.” You're missing something! Activate your FREE PREVIEW now.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 16 August 2016 | MYT 6:36 AM Warren Buffet buys more Apple shares; Soros, Icahn sell Billion Warren Buffett's Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros' firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors Inc said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. NEW YORK: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Monday said it has increased its stake in Apple Inc by 55 percent, boosting its bet on the iPhone and iPod maker even as prominent investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn shed theirs. Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, by 27 percent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Wal-Mart has been in Berkshire's portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Wal-Mart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. "They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year," Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. "If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he's probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time." Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett's largest purchase.

Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros' firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors Inc said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China's policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday's Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co  and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy Inc, and a higher stake in John Malone's telecommunications company Liberty Global Plc. It also reflected Berkshire's more than 14 percent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66. Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Wal-Mart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a "buy" rating on Berkshire. Berkshire's filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz Co was the company's largest equity investment as of June 30, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co.- Reuters Tags / Keywords: Stocks , Earnings , Foreign News , Corporate News , Investing You May Be Interested Breakfast briefing: Wednesday, November 23 Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Trump chooses Governor Nikki Haley for U.N. ambassador - news reports M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex Property Related advertisement Latest News Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Industrials lift Dow to record, techs drag S&P and Nasdaq (Update 1) Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Most Viewed in Business Fraud in Felda Global Ventures M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Malakoff seeks RM785mil compensation from EPCC contractors of Tg Bin plant Petronas able to reduce costs with Blue Ocean Strategy FGV confirms probe is on Felda Iffco’s subsidiary Brexit fallout to cost UK extra £122bil over five years Iraq willing to cut oil output in Opec’s plan to boost prices - PM With US$3b port, Malacca eyes slice of shipping giant Singapore's pie Ringgit opens easier on weak sentiment Bank Negara keeps OPR unchanged at 3% advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Kaya Yurieff Aug 15, 2016 5:29 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Walmart Stores (WMT) were declining in after-hours trading on Monday as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) reduced its stake in the retail giant. Berkshire's stake in the Bentonville, AR-based company dropped to 40.2 million shares during the second quarter from 55.2 million three months earlier, Bloomberg reports, citing a regulatory filing. Berkshire also lowered holdings of Deere (DE) and Suncor Energy (SU) during the second period. The Omaha-based company upped its stake in Apple (AAPL) by 55%. About 9.63 million of Walmart's shares changed hands today vs. its average volume of 6.8 million shares per day. Separately, TheStreet Ratings Team has a "Buy" rating with a score of B on the stock. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, good cash flow from operations, increase in stock price during the past year and notable return on equity. The team believes its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat weak growth in earnings per share. Recently, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.

The retail giant coughed up a rumored $90 million after a company driver crashed into a limousine carrying Morgan and several passengers, one of whom was killed. The insurers, which are trying to avoid taking the hit for the payments, filed documents last week alleging that the chain overpaid in order to avoid bad publicity.   The comedian appeared at the Emmys in September 2015, just over a year after the horrific crash The documents, obtained  by Daily Mail Online, say that the 'exorbitant' settlements should not be covered by them, since there is 'no coverage to the extent which these settlements were paid to avoid adverse publicity'.  They also say that the amount paid out to Morgan and his co-passengers was excessive in comparison to Morgan's actual injuries. They allege that Walmart did not conduct adequate investigations into the 30 Rock star's health before settling.  'Within weeks of Wal-Mart settling with Morgan, Morgan was seen driving one of the most powerful sports cars in midtown Manhattan, driving without any difficulty and clearly showing he was enjoying himself,' the documents state. 'Wal-Mart would have learned that Morgan was capable of doing these things had it done an adequate and reasonable investigation before settling.' Scroll down for video   Morgan was spotted in New York at the wheel of his sports car in November. Insurers are saying Walmart overestimated the extent of his injuries Morgan spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the June 2014 accident before he could return home.  The suit that lists some of the work Morgan has been involved with in the past year. 'For example, since mid-June 2015, Morgan has appeared on national TV, presenting an Emmy Award; hosting Saturday Night Live; appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live; appearing on the Tonight Show; filming scenes for an upcoming Hollywood feature; agreeing to start a half-hour comedy pilot on a cable network; and embarking on a multi-date comedy tour in cities throughout the United States and Canada,' reads the suit. The crash took the life of his friend and fellow comic James McNair and injured three others. The 47-year-old 30 Rock star suffered a traumatic brain injury and numerous fractures when a tractor-trailer slammed into the back of his limo van on New Jersey Turnpike in June, 2014. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board said Kevin Roper was driving 65mph in the 60 seconds before he slammed into the van. The speed limit on that stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike is 55mph and was lowered to 45mph that night because of construction. Morgan spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home. The insurers say that Walmart overpaid the comedian. The 2014 crash killed fellow comic James McNair The insurers claim that Walmart made it seem as though Morgan, 47, would never work again, and point out that this is not the case (Ed Helms, Amanda Seyfriend, Morgan and Leah Remini on the set of their new film in June) Roper took to Twitter to deny claims he was under the influence at the time of the accident, saying; 'I was never charged at the scene of the accident because once again i was not guilty of any crime. Not until all the TV cameras came.' The Georgia resident also stated that he felt 'horrible' and 'wished it was him who was hurt' before writing; 'So yes i am now most likely f****d because i had an unfortunate ACCIDENT with the wrong car that night.' Morgan was forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold after the accident. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Insurers fight Walmart claiming they gave 'exorbitant'...

Published Aug 15th, 2016 3:00 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Despite a hit and miss retail environment, Wall Street analysts expect Wal-Mart Stores will have a decent quarter fueled in part by strong grocery sales. The consensus estimate is for net income to top $3.2 billion in the second quarter, just short of the $3.475 billion reported a year ago. Earnings per share are expected to be $1.02, compared to $1.08 in the year-ago period according to the consensus of 24 analysts who follow the company. Earnings per share are expected to be 5.5% lower than a year ago. Total revenue is expected to be $120.29 billion, flat against last year. Wal-Mart will report second quarter earnings ahead of the market opening on Thursday (Aug. 18). Wal-Mart executives are also expected to give additional financial guidance with this being the earnings report immediately following the recent $3.3 billion announced acquisition of Jet.com. Wal-Mart forecast lower earnings in fiscal 2017 through 2019 as it continued to invest in e-commerce infrastructure and wage growth among its 1.2 million employees. For the first half of Wal-Mart’s fiscal year, revenue is expected to total $236.194 billion, up fractionally from $235.055 billion in the same period last year. Net income for the first half of the fiscal year is expected at $6.279 billion, down 7% year-over-year in part because of the heavy investments in the retailer’s e-commerce division. Daniel Binder, an analyst with global banking giant Jefferies, expects Wal-Mart’s second quarter same-store sales to rise 1.5%, which is modestly ahead of the consensus 1%. Jefferies rates Wal-Mart a “buy” with a target price of $85. Binder believes the U.S. comp sales momentum that Wal-Mart had in the first quarter likely carried over to the second quarter. He also expects a small increase in consumer retail spending over the next few quarters thanks in part to increased wages among lower income consumers. “Our local retail store checks continued to show strong execution with consistency across the market,” Binder noted. Paul Trussell, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said discount retailers like Wal-Mart and Dollar Tree are likely to benefit from a “macro backdrop supporting sustained momentum as spending prospects of the ‘low-end’ customer base improves … supported by higher spending power from lower gas prices and strong employment gains.” Raymond James & Associates is also bullish on Wal-Mart’s second quarter results expecting $1.05 per share. They say comp sales will rise 1.1% for U.S. stores, a hair better than the retailer’s 1% forecast. Sam’s Club is expected to report flat comp sales in the quarter, according to Budd Bugatch, the retail analyst with Raymond James. “Last quarter, food deflation adversely impacted Walmart U.S. comps by 60 basis points (.60) We believe food deflation will once again adversely impact comps this quarter. Within our basket we continue to see deflationary pressure in the meat and dairy categories,” Bugatch noted. “Management remains laser focused on boosting growth in e-commerce and the announced Jet.com acquisition underscores this. While in the long term we believe the Jet.com acquisition will allow Walmart to create a more streamlined and robust e-commerce platform, in the near term we believe there will be little impact to the top line with the potential of increased operating costs in the P&L.” Analysts with L&F Capital Management in San Diego, Calif., noted that Walmart’s grocery business, some 55% of the retailer’s total U.S. sales, put up good numbers in the recent quarter, helped by a slowdown in quick-serve restaurants. The L&F Capital analysts believe Wal-Mart will be a beneficiary of the restaurant slowdown in the recent quarter. McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, Noodle’s, Sonic and Burger King all reported decelerating comp sales in this recent quarter. “Last quarter, Wal-Mart put an emphasis on expanding its U.S grocery business. Management said the Grocery Pickup service would be available in 40 markets by the end of May (versus 22 at the start of the year) and that expansion only continued throughout the quarter, the analysts noted. “Concurrently, there was a massive slowdown in the QSR space this past quarter. The short of it is that QSR prices are inflating while grocery prices are deflating, and this discrepancy is causing consumers to choose dining-in over eating out.” The nationwide rollout of Walmart Pay also took place in the recent quarter and management said transactions through the mobile payment alternative increased 45% in the last week of June and monthly active users jumped to more than 20 million. “We believe the convenience of Walmart Pay, along with additional perks such as the Savings Catcher, helped drive strong traffic through Walmart’s brick-and-mortar locations throughout the quarter,” L&F Capital Markets noted. Despite food demand, low prices and convenience offerings by Wal-Mart, analysts agree there are still some wildcards with respect to the company’s financial performance in the coming quarters. Deep discounters like Aldi and Lidl continued to expand their reach in the United States. There are continued challenges in the United Kingdom with ASDA, which has completely restructured management and operational game plans in part because of Aldi and Lidl. Wal-Mart continues to go toe-to-toe with Visa over card acceptance, actually dropping the option in three stores in Canada. Analysts say if Walmart continues to break ties with Visa there could be some customer backlash. The retail giant also will see hefty adjustments to income from the lopsided foreign exchange rates amid the higher value of the U.S. dollar with respect to its global operations. Lastly, there is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation that continues to loom over the retail giant costing between $100 million and $120 million this year, for a total of $848 million since 2013. Investors have seen the Wal-Mart share price rise 19.3% this year. Wal-Mart shares (NYSE: WMT) were trading at $73.32 in Monday’s (Aug. 15) afternoon session. Shares were down 57 cents on the day, but Wall Street has a target price of $84 for the retailer in the coming year.

Berkshire boosted its stake in Apple by 55 percent to 15.2 million shares, according to a regulatory filing Monday from the billionaire’s Omaha, Nebraska-based firm. The investment was valued at $1.46 billion as of June 30. “Apple’s stock came down substantially in the second quarter,” David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business who has taken students to meet Buffett, said in a phone interview. “Value investors always like the price to go down because it gives them an opportunity to buy more.” QuickTake Apple Apple shares fell shortly after Berkshire took its initial stake, sliding 12 percent in the second quarter. Sales of iPhones have fallen this year as customers upgrade their handsets at a slower pace. That, paired with mounting competition in China, means that the company’s revenue is expected to decline this fiscal year for the first time since 2001.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter Yet with Apple gearing up to introduce a new iPhone this year, the trough of its product cycle may also have presented an opportunity for investors to boost their stakes. The share price averaged less than $100 during the quarter and has rallied 13 percent since July 26, when Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook forecast a sales decline for the fourth fiscal quarter that was less severe than many analysts had expected. Berkshire’s bet stands in contrast to those of other prominent investors. In April, billionaire Carl Icahn said he exited a position in the company because of concern about its relationship with China. David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management disclosed in May that it sold its Apple stake in the first quarter. Buffett has previously said that smaller investments, including the Apple stake, were initiated by his deputy money managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. Even as Berkshire’s stock picks are closely watched by investors, they’ve become less important to its overall performance. During the past two decades, the billionaire has focused more on acquisitions than stocks to generate growth. Wal-Mart Stores Berkshire also trimmed a number of its holdings in the quarter. Its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. -- one of Buffett’s picks -- fell to 40.2 million shares from 55.2 million. The retailer rallied 6.6 percent in the second quarter to $73.02 a share. Buffett’s company also cut holdings of Deere & Co. and Suncor Energy Inc. in the three months ended June 30, according to Monday’s filing. “It’s a little bit of fine tuning,” said University of Maryland’s Kass. Buffett and his deputies “do not make many changes to their portfolio.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Monkey reported loose in Wal-Mart parking lot <!--iframe--> Staff report 6:03 p.m. EDT August 15, 2016 A woman took a video of the monkey she saw in a Walmart parking lot Sunday (Photo: Provided) 1189 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE LANCASTER - A monkey got several minutes of freedom before being retrieved and returned to an RV trailer Sunday night in Lancaster, officials reported. Police call logs indicate the monkey escaped around 7:50 p.m. Sunday from a camper parked in the lot at Wal-Mart, 2687 North Memorial Drive. A woman is said to have opened the camper door when the monkey got free. A video posted online shows the monkey near a Wal-Mart associate. Police did not file an incident report after the monkey reportedly climbed on a Wal-Mart employee. Both police and employees confirmed the associate was not injured and did not require medical attention after the encounter. The caller advised that the monkey was larger than her 2-year-old. Richelle Stewart had just moved to Lancaster and went to Wal-Mart for some paint. She said she saw the monkey running around the parking lot and captured a video. Stewart said she doesn't think the employee was bitten, although she did hear the woman running after the monkey telling the employee not to go near it. Stewart said she's glad no one got hurt and that she posted the video because she thought it was amusing. The monkey was later retrieved and returned to the trailer, according to police. No criminal charges were filed against the owners of the monkey. 1189 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2bjItO0 TOP VIDEOS Jail tour 1:56 Tarhe Wax Museum 0:51 Grandmother raises granddaughters with help 1:33 LHS planetarium celebrates golden anniversary 2:50 Why body cameras fail 0:55 Chipotle opens country's first Tasty Made restaurant in Lancaster 0:22 Man finds, rebuilds car he built in 1963, sold in 1974 2:08 Police video shows response to 'armed' man 1:37 Gears and stones being installed at Rock Mill 0:51 Body found in cornfield near Pleasantville 0:46 Making apple cider the old fashioned way, sorta 1:18 Mount Pleasant rescue training 0:44 Old grandstand demolished after fire 0:42 Fire destroys historic grandstand 0:48 Local farm harvests freshwater prawns 1:00 Inspectors check for card skimmers at gas stations 1:39 Local prawn farm prepares for harvest 1:24 Couple talks about how grief counseling helped their families 3:01 Girl donates birthday presents to dog shelter 1:37 Horse paints way into woman's heart 3:15 Where are the sidewalks on Sheridan Drive?

Two Reasons Target Is Having Trouble Selling Groceries Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Two Reasons Target Is Having Trouble Selling Groceries Image courtesy of Steve August 15, 2016 12:20 pm EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave it's pronounced groce-ray target supermarkets walmart Following the crash of the housing market nearly ten years ago, some big box stores that had previously only dabbled in groceries started to give over more floor space to fresh and frozen foods. Walmart shoppers took to the idea of buying their food in the same store they purchase their TV, cleaning supplies, underwear, sporting goods, and just about anything else. Across the parking lot at Target, things aren’t as rosy. Target sells around $18.5 billion in groceries a year, which may sound huge until you realize that it’s only around one-fifth of the company’s total annual revenue. Meanwhile, more than half of Walmart’s yearly revenue comes from groceries. The Wall Street Journal recently took a look at Target’s fresh food woes and its efforts to course correct. Here are just a couple of the important takeaways: 1. Shoppers Just Don’t Visit That Frequently While Target has many regular shoppers, they may not be regular enough to keep fresh meat and vegetables from spoiling. One Target customer explains to the Journal that she shops at the store once or twice a month to purchase things like cleaning supplies and home décor, and she may pick up an odd food item here or there, but adds that “I don’t go out of my way to do grocery shopping at Target because there are so many other specialty stores.” Data from Nielsen shows that shoppers favor traditional groceries over big box retailers regardless of whether they are buying a week’s worth of groceries or just doing some quick shopping to fill in the gaps. Meanwhile, it appears that Costco and other wholesale clubs are increasingly becoming a destination for shoppers looking to stock up their pantry, fridge, and freezer with food. In 2015, Target’s chief operating officer acknowledged this outsider status: “We’re not really special and we’re not a full grocery. And so we’re sitting in the middle of no man’s land.” 2. Unwillingness To Invest Target actually got into the grocery business more than 20 years ago when it opened its first SuperTarget. However, these mega-format stores with complete supermarkets only account for a fraction of all Target locations. In fact, Target is increasingly looking toward smaller-footprint stores, where you can’t have rows up rows of groceries to choose from. According to the Journal, previous disappointments in groceries have left the Target board of directors gun-shy about investing capital to improve this aspect of the business. Which is problematic because Target’s supply chain has long been set up to handle transportation and distribution of home goods and non-perishable food items. If the company wants to better control the supply chain for fresh food, it will likely need to either go the route of Walmart and invest more money into systemic improvements, or pay more to a third-party provider.

By Josh Kolm August 15, 2016 This year’s back-to-school season has Walmart Canada telling Canadians it can be there for whatever customers need this time of the year – even if it seems like that’s always changing. A new spot for the retailer’s back-to-school campaign, created by J. Walter Thompson Canada, shows a kid, seemingly as prepared as possible to head back to school. But in the time it takes his mom to set up a photo, he seems to age in a blink of an eye. Jennifer Holgate, VP of marketing communications at Walmart Canada, says while last year’s back-to-school campaign focused on how moms know the exact products their kids need, this year’s added in a new insight: that, despite having that knowledge, those needs are changing very quickly. “Mom really feels like their kids are growing up fast,” Holgate says. “A parent feels like part of their role is being able to continuously equip your kids, but you might not realize how much they’ve grown when the end of the summer rolls around. We’re showing that we can be there to help make sure they’re set up to start the new school year right.” The spot is one element of a full omnichannel program for the back-to-school season, which also includes radio, social posts, influencer engagement and in-store signage, with online materials – including its own e-commerce portal – highly targeted at the back-to-school shopper. St. Joseph Communication supported the omnichannel execution, with additional support on the campaign coming from Apex PR, Ruckus Digital and Mindshare on media. Walmart says that value continues to be a major choice driver when it comes to the retailers Canadians choose for their back-to-school shopping, something it capitalized on last year when it’s messaging celebrated “smart shoppers” who were looking for ways to save money and live better, the retailer’s long-standing brand promise. Portions of this year’s campaign also target “back-to-campus” consumers, with online how-to videos – dubbed “Answers to inevitable student questions” – that show lifehack-style solutions to things like cooking cheap meals, folding laundry and fixing devices. Walmart included elements targeted at post-secondary students last year as well, though Holgate says the way it approaches that demo needs to evolve every year as media consumption habits change. While the rest of its back-to-school program primarily target moms, speaking to post-secondary students directly and giving them added value as well is important as they tend to have far more input in back-to-school purchase decisions, if they aren’t doing the shopping themselves. “They’re fun and cute, but also short and poignant and gets our products into a solution that, like anything we do in omnichannel, play well across mobile and desktop and social,” Holgate says. “They also provide utility and extra value to the students. It’s not just about what we sell, it’s about being top of mind by helping them in other ways, like smart, value-driven solutions, as they begin this new journey in life.” Tags: Apex, Apex PR, J Walter Thompson Canada, Jennifer Holgate, JWT, JWT Canada, Mindshare, Ruckus, Ruckus Digital, St. Joseph Communication, Walmart, walmart canada Related Articles Heart & Stroke’s big change Salvation Army’s story behind the holiday card Tim Hortons takes good deeds national Campbell’s brings the Cantina to Montreal Illuminating Audi’s latest advancements Popular Recent Featured Tribal adds to its creative and digital leadership Cossette is the best at CMA Awards Lg2, Leo Burnett take top prizes at ADCC awards Sgsco acquires 5Crowd Why Ikea is playing up its downstairs Careers » Screening Room » Illuminating Audi’s latest advancements SickKids gives it 100% for 100 donors Check it out: CAA calms a temper tantrum Ecobee’s extreme debut Twitter Tweets about "from:StrategyOnline OR @StrategyOnline OR strategyonline.ca" Follow @StrategyOnline Facebook About Strategy strategy™ uncovers and shares the "bold vision, brand new ideas" of Canada’s national marketing community.

About 11:40 p.m., police responded to a call of mace being sprayed at a Wal-Mart at 1300 Desplaines Ave., according to Forest Park police Deputy Chief Mike Keating. A female customer put her keys down while shopping in the sports department and forgot to pick them up, Keating said. When she went back to retrieve the keys, she noticed her pepper spray on her key chain was missing. The mace was soon after sprayed in the store, Keating said. “Somebody sprayed pepper spray throughout the whole building,” an employee told reporters at the scene. “Everybody was coughing…it was dramatic.” Four to five people were taken to a hospital, but their conditions were not immediately available, Keating said. Other victims were treated at the scene. Keating said no one was in custody Monday morning. # Crime Forest Park Previously from Chicago News Judge: Plainfield North, not Fenwick, should play in title game | Chicago Sun-Times Trump picks charter school advocate DeVos as education secretary | Chicago Sun-Times Three charged with stabbing homeless man in South Loop | Chicago Sun-Times Trump's charity admits to violating IRS self-dealing ban | Chicago Sun-Times Currently Trending dear abby Dear Abby: She's 9 and seeks more girls as friends | Chicago Sun-Times chicago news Judge: Plainfield North, not Fenwick, should play in title game | Chicago Sun-Times dear abby Dear Abby: It's risky to share bed with infant | Chicago Sun-Times chicago news Trump picks charter school advocate DeVos as education secretary | Chicago Sun-Times blackhawks Blackhawks stars not carrying their weight on circus trip | Chicago Sun-Times Post to Cancel

  Subscribe! | Login | Search The Changing Nature of Retail Recent moves by Walmart and Macy’s illustrate the challenges all retailers face. By Mark Roberti Tags: Apparel, Inventory / Warehouse Management, IT/Infrastructure, Retail, RFID Channel, Supply Chain PDFEmailPrintDefinitionsSave Article Aug 15, 2016— Last week, Macy’s announced it was closing 100 stores, and Walmart announced it was paying $3.3 billion for Jet.com, a one-year-old e-commerce retailer that tried to take on Amazon directly. Both moves show that conventional brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling to attract shoppers to stores. But the two retailers are pursuing different solutions to the same problem. Macy’s is one of the first companies to attempt to become a true omnichannel retailer. It is using radio frequency identification technology to improve store inventory to the point at which it has confidence to enable you to buy products online (even from your phone while in the store), and then pick up those products in one of its stores, or have them shipped from the store to your home. This transition, of course, takes some time—not just for Macy’s to execute but for customers to embrace. Let me explain what I mean. In the early years of the Internet, many people were afraid to put their credit card number into a website to buy things. Over time, people got used to doing that, and now very few people think twice about it (even with the database breaches that have occurred). Similarly, customers are not comfortable with, or don’t believe in, omnichannel retailing. This past weekend, it was brutally hot and humid in New York, where I live. My home does not have central air conditioning, so I wanted to buy another room air conditioner. I went to the Lowes website because I have no faith that Home Depot will have the stuff it thinks it has (see Is This What Passes for Retailing?). I found an air conditioner that was right for the room size, and the Lowes website said the item was available for me to buy it online and pick it up in the store. I thought about this for a second and then decided not to buy it online. Here’s what went through my mind. I’ll buy it online and I’ll get to the store and look around for someone who can tell me where my item is. It will take 10 minutes to find the right person, who will then take another 20 minutes to try to locate my purchase, and then come back and tell me that the store doesn't have my item. It will take another 10 minutes to refund my purchase and buy a new air conditioner. So instead, I just drove to the store with the intention of buying that air conditioner. My local Lowes had a number of models but not the one I had picked out online. I wound up buying a different model. It’s possible, of course, that Lowes had the model I wanted somewhere (I didn’t bother to ask because that would have involved a 20-minute search), but I, as a shopper, have no faith in store inventory systems, and I believe most other shoppers are the same. And this is the big problem retailers face. People know if they order an item through an online retailer, they will get that item every time (I recently bought a dehumidifier from Amazon and would have purchased the air conditioner from Amazon, except it was so hot I needed it right away). Walmart, in buying Jet.com, is trying to win customers by having a dual-channel strategy. Some people will shop at stores, and the retail giant hopes to win younger shoppers by offering them an alternative to Amazon. Macy’s, on the other hand, is using RFID to build trust among its shoppers so that they will believe that the retailer does indeed have the merchandise they ordered online. It takes time to change perceptions. Eventually, when all retailers are using RFID (and that day is not as far off as many think), shoppers will have as much faith in store inventory as they do in e-commerce inventory.

Written on Aug 15, 2016  Author Adotas  | Tweet By Scott Shamberg, U.S. President of Performics, the performance marketing arm of Publicis Media. Walmart’s acquisition of Jet.com is validation that Walmart has opened the war chest to compete against Amazon. Amazon has been pushing itself into offline channels more successfully than Walmart has through online channels, and now Walmart is making a direct play against Amazon online. Early on, Walmart had its stores and a head start on the ad revenue front via Triad. But Amazon caught up, surpassed Walmart in ecommerce and is progressing in ad revenue. Currently, only 7% of Walmart’s revenue is generated from online sales. When Amazon started to push into the physical world—distribution centers, droids for delivery, etc., it hit close to home for Walmart, and Walmart knew it needed to make a big splash online. Making a Play for Millennials Despite ranking #2 behind Amazon in online retail traffic, Walmart falls behind in online sales. As Walmart taps into Jet.com’s younger audience, it has hopes of stealing some of the highly-valuable—and growing—Millennial demographic from Amazon. Digital-native Millennials are more likely to purchase online vs. Baby Boomers (Walmart’s current main audience). And—according to recent data from Performics and Northwestern University’s research study, the Digital Satisfaction Index™—Millennials are much more comfortable in providing personal information online while shopping vs. Baby-Boomers. This personal info results in personalized experiences and recommendations, something that Amazon currently excels at. Millenials are Walmart’s future audience, and with Jet.com, it will make a run at winning share from Amazon. Expanded Advertising Revenue Beyond B2C, Walmart could also gain interest from brands looking to advertise on Jet.com. Recently, brands have seen success in leveraging retail engine paid advertising—like Amazon’s new Sponsored Search Ads—to capture and convert demand. As many consumers now start their product research journeys on Amazon vs. Google, our advertisers have been increasingly dedicating media budget to Amazon. In the more distant future, look for Walmart/Jet.com to start competing with Amazon for advertising dollars. For instance, Walmart currently partners with HookLogic, a retail search marketing exchange that enables brands to run CPC-based paid search advertising within retail site native search results pages (e.g. Walmart.com search). We could eventually see HookLogic-type ads on Jet.com, or Walmart could even build a sponsored search platform, much like Amazon’s emerging platform. Opportunities like this are very appealing to advertisers, as they enable us to connect to consumers at the digital point-of-sale on Amazon or Walmart.com. Additionally, this acquisition will create more incentive for Amazon to offer the lowest rates, best customer service and fastest delivery speed.

'If you don't do that, you grocery bill, it will be a big one. This way, I save me quite a bit of money.'   Photograph By Vancouver Sun Previous Next 'I check every little store, what thery have for me and for what price,' New Westminster pensioner Vera Bottarel says of her approach. 'If you don't do that, you grocery bill, it will be a big one. This way, I save me quite a bit of money.' Vera Bottarel takes her bargain hunting seriously. To make sure she’s getting the best deal on her groceries for her and her husband, the New Westminster pensioner puts on her sturdy walking shoes and makes a day of it. “I go around and I check every little store, what they have for me and for what price,” she says. “If you don’t do that, your grocery bill, it will be a big one. This way, I save me quite a bit of money.” Bottarel’s weekly shopping trips got easier recently with the opening of a Walmart Supercentre, which sells groceries as well as general merchandise, at Royal City Centre, right above the Save On Foods. It’s this choice, and the proximity of retail grocery options, that has Bottarel and thousands of other Metro Vancouver consumers blessed with a bounty of outlets. “I check the meat upstairs (at Walmart) and I’m going to check it in there (Save On Foods) and then I check the Buy-Low. I check everything and then I go back and check the better price and I buy it,” says Bottarel, who also periodically looks in at Galloway’s, a specialty independent store across the street, Kin’s Farm Market in the mall and the Safeway several blocks away. “When I get tired, I sit down someplace and then I start again.” Save On may be her favourite, but Bottarel is grateful for Walmart when she’s on the hunt for the best price. 'Walmart effect' That an increasing share of the grocery market going to non-traditional retailers like Walmart Supercentres and Costco Wholesale is causing deflation in food prices after they spiked above inflation in 2014 and 2015. It’s particularly evident in B.C. and Quebec. Still, our smaller grocery bills may be a case of short-term gain but long-term pain if the industry further consolidates to increase margins, leaving consumers with fewer choices and eventually higher prices. Some analysts say Canadians should get ready for a grocery price war, thanks to oversaturation in the market, with the traditional stores beefing up their discount brands to head off the non-traditional discounters. Sylvain Charlebois calls it the “Walmart effect,” and says it’s most pronounced in B.C. and in Quebec. “Quebec and B.C. are where prices are dropping the most and that’s where Walmart and Costco have become more aggressive,” says the professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax. Food prices dropped in the Consumer Price Index in B.C. by 0.5 per cent from May to June this year, according to Statistics Canada. The overall inflation rate for consumer goods in B.C. in June was 1.5 per cent. Most significantly, the price of beef in Canada dropped 3.3 per cent in June over June 2015, the first year-over-year decrease since August 2010, and dairy products were 2.1 per cent less in the same period. In contrast, consumers were paying hikes of four to five per cent in grocery prices in 2014 and 2015, which outpaced inflation, says Charlebois. At the time Walmart was expanding and adding fresh products to its stores to compete against Target stores, a threat that never materialized when the U.S. chain pulled out of Canada. That left Walmart in a better position to compete against the traditional stores, says Charlebois. “To Loblaw, Walmart is clearly a threat,” he says. Eight of the 13 stores Walmart bought from Target last year were in B.C. and Quebec, and “Costco has opened quite a few new outlets,” he adds. Loblaw Cos. Ltd. this summer sent a letter to its suppliers, requesting they drop their prices by 1.45 per cent in their shipments beginning in September. And United Grocers, the buying group for a number of Loblaw’s competitors (including Overwaitea Food Group and the food division of London Drugs), sent a letter to the same suppliers, insisting the same price cut, if any, that they grant to Loblaw. “We should expect to be treated competitively,” says United Grocers president Denis Gendron. If the suppliers give cuts to Loblaw, he says, they would expect the same because “our goal is to give our customers the best prices available.” Suppliers have told Gendron the issue is “under review.” But, he adds, “we’re not expecting the suppliers to come to us and say we’ve decided to reduce our prices.” The industry is feeling the pressure from Walmart Supercentres and from Costco, says Gendron, but that’s not new. “And if it weren’t them, it would be someone else.” 'More stores than necessary' Food retailing is big business and players want as much of the pie as they can get. The average B.C. household spends about $8,200 a year, or almost $700 a month, on food, according to Statistics Canada. About $5,700 is food purchased from stores, and almost $2,500 from restaurants. Walmart and Costco are having a growing impact on the industry, once comfortably held by traditional grocers. In 2015, the traditional grocery retailers’ share of the Canadian food market had dropped to 78 per cent, down from 84 per cent five years earlier. And between 2004 and 2015, food sales at general merchandisers grew at a rate of almost 12 per cent a year, according to StatsCan, while the grocery stores grew at three per cent a year. Moreover, drug stores’ sales of food jumped in the first quarter of 2106, up 14 per cent over the same quarter last year. London Drugs (owned by the same family that owns IGA) and Shoppers Drug Mart (bought last year by Loblaw) sell food, including limited dairy, which adds to the competition. Walmart Canada has captured seven per cent of the food retail market and Costco has 10 per cent. Rob Gerlsbeck, editor of Canadian Grocer, says the expansion into groceries in 2014 and 2015 by Walmart, Costco and Target resulted in “more stores than was necessary for the population growth.” He says that oversaturation will likely continue to keep pressure on prices because the grocery square footage was growing at three to four per cent while Canada’s population grows at one per cent a year. “I don’t want to call it a price war, but you’ll see the stores try to convince shoppers to spend money at their stores over other stores for their weekly groceries,” he says. “Walmart’s operating procedures has been low prices — that’s what they hammer and they’re very good at it.” Such an approach has recent roots, he adds. Since the 2008 economic crash “consumers have been shopping more at discount stores and they have continued to be more price conscious.” 'Relentless pressure'   The parent companies have responded by opening up more discount brands, Loblaw is expanding No Frills while Sobey’s has plans to convert remaining Price Choppers into FreshCo. discount outlets. “The choices we have as Canadians is incredible,” says food industry analyst Kevin Grier, who publishes the Grocery Trade Review. “We have lots of competition and huge choice and low-cost food because our grocers are good at what they do.” If Walmart’s approach proves successful, he says, “it’s because Canadians have chosen out of their own self-interest where they want to shop.” Like shopper Rebecca Kapsalis, who says recently outside New Westminster’s Walmart Supercentre: “I prefer Walmart because Walmart has the big savings. You get better quality food at a reasonable price, and I love Walmart. I am so happy that we finally got it here.” That’s not a unanimous sentiment. New Westminster resident Scott Pillsbury points out: “I’m not happy to see Walmart moving in, but if it lowers prices, it’s a good thing. “It’s better to support local products, so I would pay a price for that. I’m not saying I would pay any price for that, but I would pay a little bit more to support something local.” David Ian Gray, of Vancouver’s DIG360 Consulting, says demanding lower prices from suppliers isn’t new — “Walmart is known for grinding suppliers” — and he and others say only time will tell if it’s successful. Price wars in the short run are good for consumers, he says, “but in the long run it’s hard to maintain quality and choice in the face of this relentless pressure. The pressure could really squeeze those without scale,” which is why smaller chains like Choices Market need to differentiate with organics and specialty items. “Consumers do want to have some choice,” says Gray. “Over time you start seeing the big guys getting bigger and it starts to be a harder game to play.” B.C.’s grocery shelf: Who owns what • Overwaitea Food Group is Canada’s largest western-based food store chain.

(WLS) -- Wal-Mart customers and workers in west suburban Forest Park were injured after someone attacked them with pepper spray in the store. A person reportedly had a container of the spray attached to a key ring. She set it down and said someone took the spray and started using it on people.

"People were coughing, a few people got it pretty bad, an ambulance maybe took four or five employees and a few customers," said Wal-Mart employee Chryesse Johnson. "They evacuated the store and they have people in custody but they are not sure they're not sure they have to check the tapes and find out if they were them or not."

Macy’s will close 100 stores, Wal-Mart’s buying Jet.com, and Amazon’s pushing delivery by drone.  We’ll look at where American retailing is headed. In this Nov. 21, 2013, file photo, with the Empire State building in the background, the Macy's logo is illuminated on the front of the department store in New York. (Mark Lennihan, File/AP) It’s a confusing, challenging time for the retail sector. Macy’s is closing 100 stores. Wal-Mart is struggling to grow its online sales. Many traditional malls are dying. Yet TJ Maxx and Marshalls are thriving. So are Home Depot and Lowe’s. And Amazon continues to dominate the online shopping world. What’s a store to do in an era when lots of people shun malls and prefer to shop with an iPad while lounging on the couch? This hour On Point, the changing ways Americans shop, the continuing battle between brick-and-mortar versus online, and how the retail sector is trying to innovate to keep up. — Sacha Pfeiffer  Guests Sarah Halzack, national retail reporter for the Washington Post. (@sarahhalzack) Mark Cohen, director of retail sales at Columbia Business School at Columbia University. Former chairman and CEO of Sears Canada, Bradlees and Lazarus Department Stores. From The Reading List Washington Post: Macy’s to close 100 stores -- "Department store giant Macy’s said Thursday it plans to close 100 stores, a dramatic step that is aimed at helping the chain get ahead of a potentially crippling problem: America, executives say, has too many stores for the online shopping era." The Wall Street Journal: Wal-Mart Deal Could Jeopardize Jet.com’s Sales-Tax Advantage -- "Jet.com Inc. pitches itself as a lower-priced alternative to Amazon.com Inc., partly by not tacking on sales taxes in most states. But tax experts say Jet’s proposed $3.3 billion sale to retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. could jeopardize that price advantage by forcing it to collect taxes nationwide." Bloomberg Business: U.S. Retail Sales Stall as Auto Dealers’ Gain Is Others’ Pain — "Sales at U.S. retailers were little changed in July as Americans flocked to auto dealers at the expense of other merchants. The stalling of purchases followed a 0.8 percent gain in June that was stronger than initially estimated, Commerce Department figures showed Friday in Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.4 percent rise in July. Excluding cars, sales retreated 0.3 percent, the most since the start of the year." +Join the discussion Share View comment(s) Support the news   Next Up Where to now? More On Point or Explore Audio.

See next articles See previous articles Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Advertisement Supported by Tech Giants Gobble Start-Ups in an Antitrust Blind Spot Deal Professor By STEVEN DAVIDOFF SOLOMON AUG. 16, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Credit Harry Campbell Walmart’s $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com can be expected to sail through antitrust review, eliciting barely a peep of objection from the federal government. Like Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, the Walmart deal will probably end up being another example of an upstart internet company being swallowed up to preserve the stranglehold of a giant. This happens because antitrust regulators are stuck in an outdated view of the world, while the internet giants are more attuned to their nascent competitive threats. The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few. Jet.com was created to take on the dominant force in internet sales, Amazon.com. Although traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Sears are dying slowly, unable to adapt to the internet, Jet.com — founded by Marc Lore, who sold the parent company of Diapers.com and other sites to Amazon for $545 million — has been different. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Opening for business just about a year ago, Jet.com was able to achieve scale remarkably quickly, reportedly increasing revenue to more than $1 billion, with more than 3.5 million registered shoppers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Yes, Jet.com has been losing money on every shipment, but remember that Amazon went years without turning a significant profit. Jet.com is still a minnow — Amazon clocks in $100 billion in annual revenue — but it is, as Investor’s Business Daily put it, “one of the few e-tail companies in the U.S. that’s openly challenging Amazon’s dominance.” And now it is being swallowed up by Walmart. This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation, which trails Amazon by quite a distance. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside. The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town. This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off. Antonio García Martínez’s recent book about Silicon Valley, “Chaos Monkeys,” tells how Facebook operates on the model of “we might die any day.” Mr. García Martínez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction. Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or Radio Shack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day. Video Walmart’s New E-Commerce Strategy Marc Lore, left, the chief executive of Jet.com, and Doug McMillon, the chief executive of Walmart, are teaming up against Amazon. By CNBC on Publish Date August 9, 2016. Photo by CNBC. Watch in Times Video » embed If you don’t believe this, there is a poignant passage in “Chaos Monkeys” where Mr. García Martínez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw that there were two companies with “hockey stick growth” that matched Facebook’s own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were an existential threat to Facebook. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for an astounding $21.8 billion. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram, more than 500 million. This is par for the course in Silicon Valley. Google bought Waze for $1 billion in part to prevent Facebook from getting it and in part to buttress its own dominant map technology. The result is that Google remains dominant with only Apple as its main competitor. For a time, the only other competitor to these two was Nokia’s Here maps, which was sold to a group of car companies in 2015 for use in driverless cars and has disappeared as a competitor. The result is a duopoly in map technology. Another Google example is YouTube, which was bought for $1.65 billion in 2006 and is now a constant stream of users for Google. Indeed, YouTube, with more than one billion active monthly users, is a top driver of Alphabet’s user growth. Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling nascent upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft. Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would “lessen competition.” Under the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website. And there are other competitors like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition. This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only an infinitesimally small number of companies can find the key to doing. The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising. Advertisement Continue reading the main story No one knows what might happen to Jet if it remained independent. Perhaps it would fail. Amazon is dominant and Walmart may truly be the only real competitor. The same could be said of any of these acquisitions of high-growth companies. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the eventual death of Jet. This of course would leave its founder and investors much poorer, a true cost. The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies. Rhea protected Zeus from Cronus, which eventually led to Cronus’s destruction. If antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.

Bangladesh exported more than 800 tonnes of mangos, mainly to the European markets, last year, but the amount fell to 300 tonnes this season. The first shipment of 500 boxes of mangos (625 kilograms) was sent in May last year. Exporters have to obtain phytosanitary or quarantine certificates -- relating to the health of plants, especially with respect to the requirements of international trade -- from the department concerned. “Last year I exported more than 100 tonnes, mainly to different stores of Walamrt in London, but this year I sent only 35 tonnes, not to my previous customers, as the agreement with Walmart has been scrapped this year,” said Paritosh Chandra Das, proprietor of Dip International. This year, he sent mangos mainly to the non-resident Bangladeshis. “I could not send mangos to Walmart this year despite a rise in order,” he said. Mango export became difficult this year as the quarantine department asked exporters to pack the mangos in the garden, not in warehouses or elsewhere, so that the produce remains free of health hazardous elements. But packing the mangos in the garden is not possible now, he said. The traders cannot also go for contract farming immediately as the process for such farming is lengthy, Das said. “So, the entire system for exporting mangos has to be revisited,” Das said. The EU last year cancelled 15 consignments of vegetables and mangos as those failed to maintain the health standards of the EU, he said. Some consignments were abandoned this year as well because of the same reasons, he added. Khaledur Rahman, proprietor of Khaled Trade Syndicate, said: “I exported a small quantity of mangos as the authorities asked us to export through contract farming.” Traders and officials from the agriculture and commerce ministries already visited some mango gardens in different districts to get an idea how contract farming can be done, Rahman said. Not only England, some other European countries such as Germany, France and Italy also became a major destination, he added. Muhammad Anwar Hossain Khan, deputy director (export) of the plant protection wing of the Department of Agricultural Extension, said the European Union gave some suggestions on how to improve packaging standards. “We have already contacted some mango growers in 13 districts to encourage them to do contract farming,” Khan said. Farmers and exporters will get higher prices if they follow the European standards, he added. He said they have prepared a national action plan on safe and pesticide-free mango export. “We will submit the action plan to the agriculture ministry this week,” he said. Farmers and traders will have to follow guidelines of the action plan as mango has potential for becoming a major export item, he said. Zahir Uddin Ahmed, additional secretary (export) of the commerce ministry, said: “We are working with different ministries to resolve the problem in mango export. We will soon be able to start export in bulk.” Japan is also a major market for Bangladeshi mangos, he said, adding that traders will have to follow the standards to raise exports.

Game Plan For The Week - Cramer's Mad Money (11/18/16) (Seeking Alpha) The importance of e-commerce sales in the retail world has hit an all-time high. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT)'s high profile purchase of jet.com to take on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) $111 billion e-commerce empire highlights how key an online strategy is for a brick-and-mortar business. Many established stores are struggling to keep up with the new online retail environment, but they acknowledge that it is essential for survival. It may come to pass that companies, which have been around for decades, will cease to exist if they don't alter their e-commerce strategy. Related Link: "The Age Of Amazon": Top Brick-And-Mortar Retailers And How They Survive For example, The Sports Authority could not keep up with Dicks Sporting Goods Inc (NYSE: DKS)'s online presence and went bankrupt. Additionally, Macy's Inc (NYSE: M) has announced it will be closing 100 stores to regroup and redevelop their omnichannel approach. E-commerce retail sales grew 4.5 percent overall in Q2, and it is likely this figure will continue to increase. "We operate in a fast-changing world, and our company is moving forward decisively," said Macy's CEO Terry J. Lundgren in a news release. "This involves doing things differently and making tough decisions as we position ourselves to serve customers who have high expectations." The change can be made successfully, as Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) displayed with their recent Q2 results. Nordstrom.com sales grew 9.4 percent year-over-year to $683 million, just a few months after the company announced heavy mobile investments to boost its e-commerce business. It appears to be working; Nordstrom's stock is up 30 percent in the last month. With e-commerce retail sales now accounting for 8.1 percent of total sales, an online presence and strategy has been more important than ever.

"That crash turned me into an emotional wreck," Morgan said.  "Anybody out there listening, you try to get hit by a truck going that fast with 85,000 pounds of frozen food in the back, watch what it do to you." Morgan said. "It's going to turn you into a wreck." Tracy Morgan thanks his N.J. caregivers, 'You are the people who saved my life'. Morgan was traveling in a limousine bus with his friend and mentor, Jimmy McNair, and three others when they were struck from behind by a Wal-Mart truck. McNair, who was known as Jimmy Mack, died in the crash. When Morgan woke up from a coma two weeks after the crash, he said he was blind, struggling to speak and unable to walk.  "I thought about suicide man," Morgan told Stern. "I was that damaged in the hospital man. I didn't want to live." After he returned home from the hospital, Morgan said he and his wife didn't leave the house for months. "We stayed indoors for five months and then I just said, I got angry, I said, 'F*** that,'" he said. "After seven, eight, 10 months I started to take my life back. I need my life back. I got to live." Kevin Roper, the driver of the Wal-Mart truck, had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash, according to authorities. Roper pleaded not guilty in February to aggravated manslaughter, vehicular homicide and eight counts of aggravated assault. Stern asked Morgan — who settled a lawsuit against Wal-Mart last year for an undisclosed sum — whether he could ever forgive Roper. "One day, I pray to God all the time, for the strength to do that, just the strength, I don't ask for nothing else, just the strength" Morgan said. Morgan also addressed the settlement he received from Wal-Mart, saying "it was more than money." "It was justice for Jimmy, for all those involved. It was just justice I was seeking. I wanted justice for the families." he said. Morgan said he's been overwhelmed with the outpouring of love and support he has received since the crash and now is focused on "giving the love back." "It was bad. It was a bad accident," he said, but "I'm here. I'm a different person." Erin O'Neill may be reached at eoneill@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @LedgerErin.

(Facebook / Richelle Stewart) Josh Elliott, CTVNews.ca @joshelliott14 Published Tuesday, August 16, 2016 12:50PM EDT A Walmart employee out to move a few shopping carts around found himself on the wrong end of a bizarre encounter with a diaper-wearing monkey, in an incident captured on video. The video, which was shared on Facebook Sunday, shows the monkey grabbing at the employee while perched on a cart return corral in the parking lot of a Walmart in Lancaster, Ohio. The monkey can be heard screeching during the short battle. Moments after the scuffle begins, a blonde-haired woman runs in to separate the monkey and the man, screaming: "Let him go! Let him go! Let him go!" She then takes the animal by the hand and leads it away, but not before scolding the employee for putting her pugnacious primate at risk. "If he bites you they'll put him down," she snaps at the man in the video. The woman does not apologize or look back as she walks off with the monkey, which can be seen toddling along beside her. The video was shot from inside a vehicle in the parking lot. After the encounter, a man in the vehicle can be heard telling the bewildered employee: "Man, you could've gotten hurt." It's not the first monkey-and-retail incident to make headlines in recent years. Back in 2012, a baby monkey in a faux shearling coat was photographed at an Ikea in Toronto. The animal, named Darwin, did not harm anyone in the incident, which spawned countless memes online. The Walmart monkey does not have Darwin's fashion sense, as it appears to only be wearing a diaper. Judging by the way it was reaching for the Walmart employee's reflective poncho, however, it may have been looking to accessorize.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A Is Your Brand Trusted? Here's What Happens When It Is—and Isn't by Josh Zywien  |   August 16, 2016  |  2,173 views Tweet Kindle Email Top Think back to the days before Amazon grew into the retail behemoth it is today. Back then, if you went shopping at a mall or a big box store, such as Wal-Mart, you did so knowing that those stores—despite their massive inventory—might not have the exact item you needed. The growth of e-commerce in the mid-2000s helped to eradicate that issue, but it also introduced a new one: Even if you found what you needed online, you often had to pay hefty shipping fees and wait a week (or more) to receive it. Now, compare those experiences with the one Amazon offers its customers today. With a couple clicks, people now have access to a seemingly infinite number of items in virtually every color, variation, and size. And if they're Amazon Prime members, they know that whatever they buy will arrive on their doorstep within 48 hours (and without additional shipping fees). In short, the entire experience is absurdly convenient and consistent—two factors that have contributed to Amazon Prime's now reaching nearly half of US households. The Immense Value of Earning Customers' Trust Not that Amazon is without flaws. To the contrary, it has a track record of extraordinary failures. Its Fire phone was one of the most notable flops in tech history. The unique thing about Amazon, however, is that it's managed to emerge from those mistakes relatively unscathed. So, what separates Amazon from other retail brands—allowing it to survive major errors and grow faster than any retailer in history? One word: Trust. Very simply, because Amazon's customer experience is so consistent and convenient, it allows customers to build a relationship with the brand that's deeply rooted in reliability and conviction. When customers come to Amazon, they do so knowing the company will meet their needs, solve their problems, and conserve their resources (time, money, etc.). Naturally, this relationship generates... Higher senses of empowerment and confidence, leading to more frequent buying patterns Reduced mental and physical anguish, removing the friction associated with purchases Elevated feelings of security and reliability, leading to stronger brand loyalty and commitment These feelings don't only apply to customers' relationships with B2C brands like Amazon. Two sterling examples of brand trust in action are Salesforce and IBM—B2B companies with reputations personified by characteristics such as reliability, quality, and performance. Salesforce and IBM, like Amazon, have a track record of simplifying customers' lives, preserving their resources, and removing the risks typically associated with purchases. And, like Amazon, those companies' track records allow both brands to forge trust-based customer relationships that yield loyalty and advocacy. Four Questions to Assess Your Level of Brand Trust The concept of brand trust is explored in depth in a forthcoming book by marketing researchers C. Whan Park, Deborah J. MacInnis, and Andreas B. Eisingerich: Brand Admiration: Building a Business People Love. I've also written previously about how trust, love, and respect all serve as foundational pillars for the authors' broader concept of brand admiration. But let's refocus just on the idea of trust by answering these questions: Do customers know exactly what they'll get when they come to your brand? Are they willing to almost instinctively buy into your new ideas and forgive your mistakes? Do they exhibit higher rates of loyalty and stronger repeat purchase patterns? What gaps exist in your business that could hurt your ability to build trust? If you're unsure about any of those questions, you'd be wise to invest time and resources into identifying areas where you can better cultivate and foster feelings of trust with your customers. The benefits of doing so can be enormous, and that investment can go a long way toward mitigating the risks and costs associated with adversarial customer relationships. Just ask Comcast, BP, and Bank of America—all of which have spent billions over the last few years to improve their brand's perception and rebuild trust with their stakeholders, with mixed results. If you cultivate and foster brand trust correctly, your company won't need to constantly throw piles of money at rebuilding and repairing trust with customers. Instead, that trust will be part and parcel with who you are as a business, and it will become one of the driving forces behind why people choose to associate with your brand. If you'd like to learn more about brand admiration and the framework that Park, MacInnis, and Eisengerich have developed, check out their brand admiration website, full of helpful information and resources to help you assess your company's level of brand admiration.

Microsoft, Apple, Intel and Salesforce have joined the likes of Walmart and Unilever in ponying up hundreds of millions — or even billions — to buy technology companies in recent months in what can only be described as a feeding frenzy. The list of names scooped up by these buyers reads like a who’s who of high-profile Internet services: LinkedIn, Yahoo, Dollar Shave Club, Jet.com. Others like Twitter, Pandora and Lyft are said to be acquisition targets too. The spree comes as public companies such as LinkedIn and Twitter get hammered for failing to meet Wall Street’s demands for growth, and startups face a volatile market for going public with increased pressure from investors to be profitable. All of the sudden, some public and private tech companies are more interested in ditching Wall Street for the lucrative embrace of a bigger company. And the big companies, once skittish about sky high valuations in tech, are now all too happy to swoop in. “2016 will go down as the year of the lack of the tech IPO and a market of incredibly robust M&A activity,” says Daniel O’Keefe, general partner at Technology Crossover Ventures, an investor in Dollar Shave Club, which sold to Unilever for close to $1 billion. Not a single tech company went public in the first quarter of 2016 and just nine have had IPOs so far this year, according to data from Renaissance Capital. Mergers and acquisitions, on the other hand, are soaring. Deals to buy private tech companies have totaled $318 billion for the year so far, significantly outpacing the $250 billion spent on tech M&A through the first three full quarters of 2015, according to data from PitchBook. And according to O’Keefe, “I don’t think we’re done yet.” Venture capitalists and analysts point to a combination of factors setting the stage for more acquisitions: deflated valuations at certain private and public tech companies; low interest rates that make borrowing to finance deals easier; and corporations with loads of cash on hand. “You’ve got a lot of the large tech companies that have been doing well. They have a lot of cash and they have a lot of shareholder pressure to do something with that cash,” says James Gellert, CEO of Rapid Ratings, an independent research firm. At the same time, the pool of potential buyers increasingly includes tech and non-tech companies whose interests converge in areas like online shopping and self-driving cars. Some of the biggest startup acquisitions of the year came from outside traditional tech companies: General Motors spent a reported $1 billion buying Cruise Automation for autonomous vehicles; Unilever spent about as much on Dollar Shave Club; and Walmart agreed to buy shopping site Jet.com for $3.3 billion. “You have gone through an environment where neither side was buying. Now both the technology companies and the industrial companies are competing for assets,” says Harry Weller, a partner at New Enterprise Associates, one of the largest investors in Jet. That, Weller says, should only continue as more and more companies look to tap into technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing and robotics. Two years ago, some of these same companies might have refused to sell, or simply been too pricey for buyers to justify, thanks to a flood of private capital pouring into startups at high valuations from VCs and mutual funds. “I think we can all say with certainty that it was a robust pricing environment,” says O’Keefe. “I sensed corporates pulling back a bit in that environment.” Fast forward two years — through a turbulent global market, a clogged IPO pipeline and prominent companies like Square forced to go public at lower valuations — and startups finally start to lower their expectations for how much they’re worth. As Jeff Epstein, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, an early investor in LinkedIn, puts it, “Sometimes it takes two or three years for people to psychologically adjust to the new pricing levels.” This German bank is charging customers to hold their deposits Global central banks dump U.S. debt at record pace Related Posts Haters gonna sue: Taylor Swift hit with copyright infringement lawsuit Apple offers free battery replacement for iPhone 6S shutdown problem MSNBC picks up Bloomberg’s Stephanie Ruhle ClassPass: Friend or foe to fitness studios?

Then it went bankrupt. Here's the exclusive inside story of what happened. By Lindsay Blakely & Burt Helm Lindsay Blakely is Inc.'s Los Angeles Bureau Chief. Burt Helm is Inc.'s senior contributing writer. 21 COMMENTS CREDIT: Tomer Hanuka Advertisement Jim Mitchell's morning ritual was as consistent as the Southern California sunshine. After fruit, bacon, and a blueberry muffin at Martha's 22nd Street Grill in Hermosa Beach, the CEO would cruise in his Porsche up Highway 1, to El Segundo. On this particular day in the fall of 2015, Mitchell had settled into his office at children's tablet maker Fuhu and was in the midst of his morning conference calls when a panicked employee from the finance department barged in. "You are not going to believe this," the staffer said. They turned to Mitchell's computer and logged into Fuhu's Wells Fargo account. The balance the day before: $4,512,662.53. The balance now? $0.00. Even before all of Fuhu's money disappeared, Mitchell was having a doozy of a month. Three weeks before, he and his co-founder, Robb Fujioka--Fuhu's mastermind and headstrong president--had been contacted by attorneys representing the company's primary manufacturer, Foxconn. The Chinese giant was more than just a vendor. It was an investor and patron that had been instrumental in launching Fuhu on its meteoric rise. With gross revenue of $196 million and a three-year growth rate of 158,957 percent, Fuhu had earned the top spot on the Inc. 500 list of the fastest- growing American private companies in both 2013 and 2014. But behind the scenes, the company was falling apart. In recent months, it had racked up unpaid bills from just about everyone it did business with. And Foxconn--to which Fuhu owed between $60 million and $110 million, depending on who was counting--had finally reached its breaking point. The lawyers told Fujioka and Mitchell that until they paid their tab, their company would be cut off. Fujioka insisted this was just a negotiating ploy. "There is no concept of bankruptcy or contract law in Asia," claims Fujioka, who considers himself well versed in the Chinese way. Within 48 hours, Fuhu's partners were on a plane to Hong Kong, where they hoped to strike a deal with Foxconn execu­tives. But Foxconn wouldn't budge. To Fujioka, it was all part of the dance. He sent his CEO back to El Segundo, assuming he understood that they would eventually work out a deal. But Mitchell, a former Accenture consultant, wasn't so sure. When he returned home, he phoned up Walmart, Target, and Best Buy to warn them that Fuhu might not be able to fill their Christmas orders. Then he called Christian Donohue, a managing director of Tennenbaum Capital Partners, an L.A. private equity firm that operates a special situations fund for distressed companies. Five months earlier, Mitchell and Fujioka had persuaded Tennenbaum to give them a $10 mil­lion loan to provide much needed cash flow. Once Donohue was on the line, he seemed sympathetic. "Christian's response was, 'This is unfortunate. This is a big surprise to all of us. I feel bad for you, but we will figure out a way to work through it,'" Mitchell later recalled. But by the morning of October 30, Tennenbaum had declared Fuhu in default of its loan agree­ment. Mitchell tried to negotiate, but it was no use. A few days later, Tennenbaum froze the assets in Fuhu's warehouse--then swept all of the cash from its bank account. When Mitchell saw the drained account, he tracked down Fujioka. "Can they fricking do this?" exclaimed Fujioka. Indeed, their lawyers soon explained, they fricking could. The consequences of losing their supplier were laid out in a thick stack of a Tennenbaum loan agreement that the Fuhu bosses had never bothered to read. By December, Fuhu would find itself filing for Chapter 11, concluding a ride neither Fujioka nor Mitchell had imag­ined would end so soon. In January, Mattel bought Fuhu's assets in a fire sale for $21.5 million. Now Fuhu's remaining creditors, which number more than a hundred and collec­tively are owed almost $110 million ($565 million if you count the estimated damages of a class-action lawsuit), have hired forensic accountants to sift through Fuhu's books to see where the money went, what can be clawed back, and whether any funds were misappropriated. How did Fuhu go from 158,957 percent growth to bankruptcy in three years? What happened--according to revenue. VIEW FULL VERSION What happened? When Fujioka and Mitchell volunteered to tell Inc. their story, we leapt at the chance to illustrate, up close and unsparingly, the risks inherent in rocket-fueled growth. We spent hours with the partners, interviewed 15 current and former employees, and reviewed hundreds of court documents, emails, and meeting notes. The rise and fall of Fuhu is a cautionary tale about the seductions of early success and the overconfidence it can breed. But most of all, it's the story of two entrepreneurs who pushed too hard to go big--one whose personal drive led him to take oversize risks against the advice of those around him, and one who failed to stop him. Everything changed for Fujioka the day he saw the five Ferraris parked inside John Hui's 10-car garage. By 2000, the 30-year-old had ascended from assis­tant sales manager at Cort Furniture Rental in Southern California to small-time dot-com entrepreneur. Fujioka had established a formula for hatching discrete tech marketing com­panies--graphic design, Web advertis­ing, email marketing--running a business for a couple of years, and then flipping it for a million bucks or so. Adopted from Korea, he had grown up in suburban Denver among a tight-knit group of second-generation Japanese families whose grandparents had invested in one another's local businesses. Now he was revitalizing their entrepreneurial roots, recruiting his childhood friends to work for their old pal, who, in their eyes, had become the brilliant kingpin of a burgeoning mini empire. "This guy is probably the smartest guy I know," says John Sagara, a buddy hired at Fujioka's ad firm Jump Communications who would go on to work at Fuhu. One of Fujioka's outfits was hired by electronics company Korea Data Systems to run an email campaign. Fujioka quickly realized that John Hui, its owner, was more than just a suit--the Chinese-American entrepreneur was a self-made multi­millionaire. Hui and his brother Steve were co-founders of the PC maker eMachines, which they had sold to Gateway for almost $290 million. It didn't take long for Fujioka to persuade Hui to take him on as his protégé. Fujioka's entrepreneurial enlightenment happened while he was traveling in Asia with the Huis, getting schooled in building fast-growth consumer electronics companies. "How they ran the business versus how I ran businesses was night and day," says Fujioka, noting their commitment to efficiency and cost-cutting. Fujioka also got a glimpse of mogulhood. There was the Huis' high-rolling social circle, which included Foxconn execs. Steve Hui, he was told, had purchased his own private island, while John Hui had that sprawling garage filled with Ferraris. "Two or three million dollars wasn't small where I come from," recalls Fujioka. "But I turned to John and said, 'I'm at this point in my career where I need to stop messing around with this small money.'" The idea for Fuhu, which launched in 2008, was Steve Hui's. The concept was to develop nifty software and license it to hardware manufacturers in the Huis' network. The company would be a partnership between the brothers and Fujioka (the name Fuhu combines the first two letters of their last names). Since Fujioka was admittedly impatient and blunt, they agreed to hire a CEO--a polished salesman who was at ease on country club golf courses. That's when Jim Mitchell's name surfaced. They logged into Fuhu's Wells Fargo account. The balance the day before: $4,512,662,53. The balance now? $0.00. If Fujioka got his grit from hustling, Mitchell got his finesse on a more conventional track. The 40-something from Indiana had spent nearly two decades at management consulting firm Accenture. He'd frequently jet between L.A. and Silicon Valley, catering to clients like HP and Intel, until 2008, when he cashed in his stock options with a plan to travel for a couple of years. But his wanderlust was interrupted by a call from John Hui, whom he'd helped advise at Accenture. Hui pitched Mitchell the Fuhu CEO gig, and then introduced him to his partner-to-be, Fujioka. While it seemed like an odd marriage, Fujioka and Mitchell's dynamic quickly fell into place. Mitchell liked deal making, while Fujioka preferred developing products. The co-founders came to an agreement: The Huis would put up the initial capital, help Fujioka and Mitchell with connections, and then step back and advise as needed. Mitchell would be the face of the business as CEO, while Fujioka would be president and run operations. Fuhu's earliest products were software--a kid-safe Web browser and customizable MP3-player apps. Early on, the relationship with Foxconn would shape both Fuhu and how its co-founders ran it. In 2010, after John Hui had made introductions, Foxconn invested $10 million in Fuhu. This granted Fujioka entry into one of the most powerful Asian companies in the world. "China has relationships that go from generation to generation, and they are based on a code of conduct," Fujioka says he learned quickly. "What you rely on is relationship and honor and ceremony." In 2011, Fujioka spotted an opportunity to do more business with his new investor. Foxconn had a few thousand Android tablets it wanted to offload; Fujioka decided to take the tablets off its hands. The Huis had warned the Fuhu execs to stay away from hardware, a tough business with huge overhead and slim margins, but they ignored the advice. The gamble paid off: Fuhu bundled the tablets with a child-friendly user interface, a playful red bumper, and kids' marketing. This became an early prototype for the first Nabi, which Mitchell persuaded Toys "R" Us to carry. By Christmas, the retailer had sold all of the 10,000 units it had and Fuhu was pioneering an entirely new market: mobile devices for children. Fuhu decided to go all in on kids' tablets, and watched sales soar. In 2012, it introduced three more versions of the Nabi. Mimicking the Apple model, there was an entire Nabi universe--educational software, a specialized user interface, and an expansive line of accessories. By the end of 2012, Fuhu's revenue had reached $118 million--more than 420 times what it had rung up as a software company. Building what they believed would be America's next great consumer electronics company, Fujioka and Mitchell decided to raise more cash. They sought a $65 million fundraising round at a $280 million valuation. Mitchell signed licensing deals with Disney and DreamWorks Animation, persuading the latter to invest $10 million. Fuhu added regularly catered lunches and flew some 200 employees to Las Vegas for a company retreat, where they partied in the Hard Rock Hotel's presidential suite. As Fuhu swelled to over 300 workers in 2013, Fujioka began telling his young staffers he was going to make them rich. Sometimes, he'd award them with fat raises and lofty new titles on the spot. Working there was an adrenaline rush. "I felt like I'd landed on a gold mine," says one former employee. By late 2013, sales had rocketed to $196 million. Visions of an IPO danced in the partners' heads. But Fuhu was hardly prepared to go public. The company's finance department consisted of an accountant, a bookkeeper, and no for­mal budget. So Fujioka and Mitchell started hiring CPAs and financial ana­lysts and began IPO discussions with Goldman Sachs. It was Fuhu's new number crunchers who would warn of the coming trouble. They took issue with the massive revenue projections that Fujioka and Mitchell had sent to the invest­ment bank. An early model had Fuhu going from $200 million in revenue in 2013 to as much as $800 million a year later. However, actual sales never kept pace with the company's ambitions, and the finance department had to keep revising the forecasts downward. By July, Fujioka was telling staff to expect roughly $350 million in annual revenue. Even that felt aggressive to the bean counters. Meanwhile, the nascent children's tablet market was get­ting crowded. In the coming year, Amazon launched a kids' version of its Fire tablet. Sprout, Comcast's children's cable network, introduced its own tablet, which sold through Walmart. Sales of Fuhu's two workhorse products, the Nabi 2 and the Nabi Jr., began to level off. If Fuhu was going to achieve its lofty growth targets--or even keep sales flat--it needed another hit. Fujioka tended to respond to most problems by launching new products, and he wasn't going to get slowed down by market research. Between early 2013 and mid-2014, Fuhu rolled out a bunch of kids' tech toys: a GoPro-style action camera, headphones, and special-edition Nabis. Then came an idea that would put the Nabi brand squarely in the center of the kids' entertainment business, opening the door for content deals and a Netflix-like subscription service. The DreamTab, as it was called, was an upmarket tablet released in partner­ship with Fuhu's new investor, DreamWorks, that would come packed with cartoons and movies. With his eye on doubling revenue, Fujioka persuaded Foxconn to manufacture more than 150,000 DreamTabs. But by the summer of 2014, instead of a hot new product, what Fuhu had was a dud. Consumers shied away from the high price of $269. Reviewers criticized the cross-promotional DreamWorks marketing, calling it crass. Fuhu now had a growing tab with Foxconn and had stuck its distributor with a glut of unsold DreamTabs. Meanwhile, slowing sales scared off investors and the company raised less than half of its $65 million goal. Bankers declined to back a public offering anytime soon. Then, Fuhu was slapped with a class-action law­suit. Allegedly, Nabi 2's batteries were faulty--in some cases, they were literally catching fire. The brewing financial crisis would have tested even the best-led com­pany, but Fuhu was not that. By 2014, CEO Mitchell had slipped further into a supporting role as a one-man sales and investor-relations team, while Fujioka had become the com­pany's leader. And from moment to moment, employees rarely knew which version of Fujioka they would get--the nurturing mentor or the dictator. As Fujioka had done at his prior companies, at Fuhu he hired childhood pals to populate many of the company's senior posi­tions. He also cherry-picked a group called the Partnership, some 30 employees who committed themselves to the collective good of the company. With that honor came the promise of equity, special access to Fujioka himself, and a walkie-talkie--which Fujioka's assistant could use to send for his staff. "It was another form of knowing he could get anybody to drop every­thing at a moment's notice," says one former senior executive. The Partnership provided a powerful incentive for employee motivation, but it also created an organizational caste system. "Just imagine you're in a high school, and all the cool kids get to sit at this cool table," says one former nonpartner employee. "If you're not part of that circle, you don't get looked at and you don't get talked to." In this atmosphere, rumors flew of special perks for Partnership members. Fujioka denies there was any­thing improper about any of the favors he doled out. "We negotiated [auto] leases, and I'm pretty sure there were times when we helped people with their payments," says Fujioka, noting that he gave one pregnant partner three bonus months of paid maternity leave. Jealousy and gossip from nonpartners, he says, were disheartening. "Maybe what they don't understand is that the person [who received extra maternity leave] had two mis­carriages, and it's probably because she was working 13 hours a day. Those kinds of things," he says. "And did it ever come out of pocket? A lot. That's why I hesitate--was that Fuhu or was that me? Because I think 80 percent of it was me." "Maybe there's such thing as $20 million or $30 million between friends. But $100 million? I don't think they're friends any longer." Meanwhile, loyalty was best proved to Fujioka by self-sacrifice. He expected employees to work as doggedly for him as he had for the Huis, who, he says, once made him pull several consecutive all-nighters to write a business plan. John Hui's exercises "were very painful," says Fujioka. "It was really about obligation, responsibility, and servitude." Signs of disloyalty, real or perceived, could flare Fujioka's temper. In one instance, after a junior staffer privately asked the head of HR when he could collect overtime and take vacation, he was dragged before Fujioka and a roomful of partners for a vote on whether he should be fired. The meeting, the staffer later alleged in a wrongful-termination suit that was settled, "was done with oppression and malice" and resulted in "depression, anxiety, humiliation, and emotional distress." Employees say they even­tually learned not to challenge the views of their micromanager boss. "He wasn't listening to the smart, talented people that he had hired," says one former staffer. "Instead, he'd listen to the group that really consisted only of yes-men." The more frustrated Fujioka grew with Fuhu's lagging sales, the more he'd take it out on the staff. At weekly Partnership meetings, he'd sometimes play therapist, encouraging employ­ees to open up in the name of self-improvement. "If you look at anybody great--Steve Jobs, John Hui--they all have this incred­ible strength that has led to their success, but they are very aware of how that translates to weakness," Fujioka explains. Employees' self-described weaknesses--like "not wanting to fight with people I love for fear of losing them," confessed one staffer--would be logged along with a behavior-improving action item, and a consequence if the desired result was not achieved. (This particular individual's punishment: She was not allowed to wear makeup except "for days with meetings with clients/vendors, eye makeup only.") As former Partnership members tell it, Fujioka would then surface these details when they made mistakes. "Initially, it made us feel as though he cared," says one. "What I didn't realize was that, because he knew our flaws, he knew exactly how to manipulate us." Meanwhile, Fujioka and Mitchell kept on spending despite warnings from the finance department. Fuhu grossed only $5 to $10 per tablet, which left little room for extravagance. Yet as tight as the money was, the co-founders opened a posh company gym with personal trainers. Requests for at least $5,000 in petty cash for a trip were not uncommon, according to three executives familiar with the matter. (Fujioka and Mitchell insist that all petty cash requests were appropriate.) Fujioka flew groups of employees--sometimes 10 or more--to Hong Kong for Foxconn meetings, with everyone staying in the five-star InterContinental Hotel. "I did two meetings in 15 days," recalls one former Fuhu man­ager. "My memory is lots of great meals." When finance shared its concerns with Fujioka and Mitch­ell, neither could be bothered. "We didn't really care for how they thought through the numbers," says Fujioka. "It was kind of like, 'Can you go do the stuff that needs to be done for the IPO, and leave us alone?'" By the summer of 2014, the company was burning through cash at an alarming rate. With time run­ning out for an IPO, Fujioka decided to try pulling one last rabbit out of his hat. He called it the Big Tab. The vision of a gigantic mobile tablet had been simmering in Fujioka's mind for more than a year. He and his young son had been playing with a Microsoft touchscreen coffee table, a sort of interactive television mounted on four legs. Parents had always bemoaned screens, yet here were a father and son gleefully tapping and swiping together. What if Fuhu could create a tablet big enough for the whole family to gather around? It might change how families interacted, he thought. It might change the world. With the Big Tab, Fujioka had finally conceived a more profitable tablet. Its roughly $500 price tag could push toward a 20 percent margin on every unit sold. But everything about the Big Tab was risky. Just to keep sales flat from the previous year, Fuhu would have to commit up front to another massive order. If the Big Tab didn't sell, the company would owe Foxconn tens of millions of dollars in addi­tion to what it already owed for the DreamTab. Fuhu's finance team was already concerned, and expressed that to Fujioka. When they told him that their best-case projection for 2014 was $65 million in losses, he was incredulous: "There has to be something seriously wrong with your model," Fujioka replied. The Big Tab was a dou­ble-or-nothing bet--"one of those things where it would either make us or break us," Fujioka says. While he maintains that Fuhu's board members likely knew about his Big Tab plans, he can't recall whether he explicitly sought their approval. (None of Fuhu's board members re­turned calls seeking comment.) Fujioka reassured his em­ployees that Big Tab sales would take care of themselves. "Someone gave him this idea of the 'Tech 250,' which means that the first 250,000 of anything 'cool' just sells," says a former senior executive in finance. "It was the most bizarre notion I had ever heard." As the holiday shopping season approached, it became clear the Big Tab was flawed. The tablet was too clunky for a child to hold, and had less than an hour of battery life. Tech critics scratched their heads--"Wonderfully absurd" wrote PCMag.com. Meanwhile, retailers couldn't figure out where to display the product. Most stores simply wouldn't carry it, leaving Fuhu stuck selling them on its website. By Christmas, fewer than 4,000 units had been sold. "It was a disaster launch," concedes Fujioka. By January 2015, Fuhu's business was in free fall: Annual revenue had plunged by more than half from the year before, to less than $70 million. The finance department was a revolv­ing door: The CFO had left, soon followed by several key fi­nance employees. Then there were the debts. In the fall, Fuhu had stopped remitting payments to its distributor, D&H. The distributor then sued Fuhu for breach of contract, saying it owed D&H $49 million. Meanwhile, Fuhu owed Foxconn tens of millions, at least, for the DreamTabs and Big Tabs. Soon, Foxconn sent finance executives to investigate. Fujioka, confident he understood Chinese business code, insisted the visit wasn't a sign of trouble, but rather a mere for­mality. "They weren't happy with us, but that didn't mean they were going to let us die," Fujioka says. "Apple squeezes them [Foxconn] to a point of almost nonexistence, but they still work together." But Fuhu's finance team didn't buy the spin. As a former senior finance executive puts it: "Maybe there's such a thing as $20 million or $30 million between friends. But $100 million or more? I don't think they're friends any longer." "It was kind of like taking on a credit card. You sign this huge document, you have no idea what it says inside, you are looking at your lawyers, your lawyers are saying it is risky and it is expensive, and you go, 'OK.'" As the company hemorrhaged cash, Fujioka and Mitchell went hunting for more capital. But with declining revenue, Fuhu was no longer appealing to investors. That spring, the co-founders got the $10 million loan from Tennenbaum Capital Partners, along with another $10 million loan from factoring company LSQ Funding Group. Both were secured against Fuhu's assets, but Fujioka and Mitchell didn't worry about the details. Tennenbaum sent over a stack of paper with lots of fine print. "The lawyers were like, 'Do you want to read this now?' and I was like, 'Are you crazy?'" Fujioka says. "It was kind of like taking on a credit card. You sign this huge document, you have no idea what it says inside, you are looking at your lawyers, your lawyers are saying it is risky and it is expensive, and you go,'OK.'" Fujioka and Mitchell continued churning out products and plotting more ambitious ones, like kids' wearables and a line of internet-of-things devices. Nothing took hold. That summer, the co-founders managed to secure a $27 million investment from LG, the Korean technology company that manufactured the glass panels for Fuhu's tablets. But at the company's cur­rent burn rate, the cash would be gone by year's end. Unpaid creditors, including an autism nonprofit to which Fuhu had pledged $500,000 in 2013, continued lining up. Foxconn was running out of patience. In the fall of 2015, it ordered Fuhu to reduce operating expenses. Fuhu hired a restructuring specialist and laid off support staff. Then came that letter from Foxconn's counsel and the abrupt trip to Hong Kong, which ended with Foxconn's cutting off Fuhu's supply and seizing the 522,000 Nabis in its warehouse, followed by Tennenbaum's freezing of the assets in Fuhu's warehouse and its clean sweep of Fuhu's bank account. By December 2015, Fujioka and Mitchell had run out of options. They approached Mattel, which agreed to make a stalking-horse bid as part of Fuhu's Chapter 11 filing. On January 19, after a two-day auction, Mattel emerged as the owner of the failed company with a final bid of $21.5 million. Six months later, Fujioka and Mitchell sit down in Fuhu's conference room, now employees of Mattel. On the table is a folder with a copy of Mitchell's official declaration to the bankruptcy court. He needs to be careful to not stray from his official written statement. "We got read the riot act from our lawyers," Fujioka says later. Fujioka says he wants to come clean about where he went wrong. Eventually he speaks to Inc. for eight hours over three conversations. He owns up to his tendency to cause bottlenecks by micro­managing, and to being too tough as a boss. "It's like father­hood," he says. "If you come from a strict family, you're strict." Later, on the phone, he disputes the rumors about favoritism and overspending. But eventually he admits there was an organizational problem that stemmed from him. "There was a bankruptcy of the business, but there was also a bankruptcy of the corporate culture," he concedes. Fujioka also blames his employees--or rather, he faults himself for not hiring different ones. "There were a lot of partners who just couldn't fulfill what they needed to fulfill," he says. But his self-critique doesn't extend much further. Fuhu's biggest failure, he believes, was being victim to bad timing. The Nabi 2 came at the perfect moment, he says, but the Big Tab was before its time, while the Nabi Pass was too late. He still believes that, were it not for Tennenbaum's sweep of Fuhu's bank account, his company would have bounced back. "I think success is a combination of timing, humility, and timing, right?" he says with a laugh. Perhaps. But many of the sins that spurred Fuhu's demise were timeless: Fujioka developed products in profusion and failed to find new hits, and yet he still bet his entire company on an ill-conceived product he'd never market tested. Mitchell, as CEO, failed to intervene. Together, the two ran a business with slim profit margins that couldn't cover overhead, and a strategic plan based on little more than inherited connections, smooth talk, and misplaced hope in new products. Sitting catty-corner from Fujioka in the conference room, Mitchell is quiet, staring down at the table, his face so flush it's almost purple. Throughout the conversation, he chimes in with an odd fact or observation--the technical advantages of the Big Tab Slim, the 2014 IPO climate--but mostly he sits silent. In the coming weeks, the forensic auditors hired by the unsecured-creditors' committee will pore over Fuhu's books to find out where the money went. In coming months, the remaining credi­tors--more than 100 of them, claiming $110 million in liabili­ties--may go after Fujioka and Mitchell personally to get more money. Already, one IT vendor has sued Mitchell for intentional and negligent misrepresentation and fraud. Fujioka dismisses such inquiries as a witch-hunt. "Total bullshit," he says. The experience has left Fujioka, unlike Mitchell, feeling wilier, savvier, more dangerous. He frames his company's downfall more like a personal rite of passage than a profes­sional disaster. All of his idols--including the Huis, he says--have gone though a major bankruptcy in their careers. "It's a fact of life when you go into the hardware business that you are going to fail, and it's going to be a massive fail," he says, noting that the Huis have continued to be supportive. (Neither returned calls seeking comment.) But in El Segundo, Fujioka's faithful circle is shrinking. More than 200 employees have left or been laid off from the company, including most of his department heads. He shrugs off the notion that partners might be justifiably angry that the equity they were promised has nearly evaporated. He says his mentors had warned him that this, too, would happen. "They said the most heartbreaking thing was watching people they thought of as family walk away," he reflects. In fact, Fujioka says he would pursue the same strategy again--only next time, he'd do it faster. He's not the type to settle for a commodity hardware company or a straightforward software developer, he says. He wants it all. It's his nature. "If you look at Apple's history, it didn't start as a high-margin company," he points out. "It was 15 years in the making before Apple really hit its stride." Fujioka is convinced he still has that Jobsian potential lurking within him. A former Fuhu senior executive credits that confidence to Fujioka's ability to adapt himself toward anything he wants, bringing people along with him. "He sees something, and then he embodies that pursuit," he says. "He can read how to get people to do things for him. For me, it wasn't so much greed around money, but greed around changing the world." By the end of the conversation, the Fuhu offices are mostly vacant. A queasy-looking Mitchell excuses himself to meet his wife and kids for dinner back in Redondo Beach. Fujioka, who has filed for divorce and is dating Fuhu's senior marketing manager, stays behind. He has no plans to go home just yet. He has projects he must plan. Calls to Asia he must make. His glass-walled office looks out onto empty cubicle after empty cubicle. Soon, sitting there, he'll call out for what staff and friends remain. But the office is so empty, it's hushed. From the September 2016 issue of Inc. magazine Advertisement

The report says the child's mother, Mariah Walker, 22, had gone into the Dekalb Street store while she left her two children in her parked car with the air conditioning on.  The toddler, according to the report, got out of her car seat and walked around the Walmart parking lot for approximately 10 minutes before police arrived.  Walker, the report said, returned to her car and found a police officer at the scene. The report said she admitted to leaving her children inside the car while she went inside the store. Walker has since been charged with two counts of unlawful conduct toward a child. The two children were unharmed. ALSO ON WISTV.COM: Second day of massive search for 3-year-old begins outside of Charlotte Copyright 2016 WIS. All rights reserved.

Lyle Bunn STRATACACHE operates over 1.5 million software and appliance installations for more than 425 end user organizations including Wal-Mart, McDonalds, Lowes, AT&T, H&M, Huntington Bank and many others. It has acquired and integrated other businesses such as PRN, Optika, Carmanah Signs and most recently intellectual property from VertiGo and Civiq into its increasing capabilities, and has been strengthened by the addition of deeply knowledgeable personnel. STRATACACHE has 18 corporate locations in North America with others in Europe, Asia and Australia. It has 5 development, 4 hosting sites and 3 network operations centers. STRATACACHE has served end users in direct supply and operates with a comprehensive support model. Scala has a similar 25-year longevity, working with more than 500 partners in 100 countries to operate more than 500,000 displays. Scala’s strength has been in working with channel partners including integrators and distributors while assuring no channel conflict on situations where it would work directly with the end user. STRATACACHE’s corporate health, deep engineering, operating, analytics and client service in its direct sales model and its experience in serving generally larger deployments of place-based media, is an excellent compliment for Scala with its channel strategy and a base of installations that can reasonably be expected to expand based on astute application of the media and ongoing developments. This consolidation of capabilities enables better service of needs on the global stage through the combined strengths of these preeminent suppliers, each of which has been central to digital place-based media application and advancement. In STRATACACHE’s augmenting of its direct supply model with supply through channel partners and integrators as used by Scala, STRATACACHE will move the industry's supply capacities to new levels. Current users of Scala will benefit from a deeper knowledge base and improved corporate stability. In past acquisitions, STRATACACHE has empowered the acquired business unit while allowing them to operate entrepreneurially bringing subject matter expertise and active support to vertical market clients. It could reasonably be expected that Scala operations will be treated in the same way. Innovation is a demonstrated priority of STRATACACHE as indicated by its ongoing developments in areas such as content strategy and composition, analytics, omni-channel, hardware price/performance improvement, display enclosures, tablet and mobile interactivity, anonymous audience detection and identification, traffic tracking, gestural interaction, augmented reality, human vision replication and other areas of digital media areas. So, end users seeking location-based media innovation and the engineering and customer support teams of the two providers will benefit from the merging of innovation programs. And it could be entirely expected that innovation partners of Scala will be welcomed into the bigger sandbox. Dot2Dot Communications of Toronto for example, acts as Scala Canada. As an independently owned and operated partner Dot2Dot has developed the Ad Manager overlay for Scala. It only operates with the Scala CMS and Dot2Dot’s ad management capabilities are introduced to end users by Scala and other partners where third party advertising or sponsor revenues are an element of the digital signage business model. The combination of STRATACACHE’s system capabilities to handle in-store promotional spending and campaigns in large retailers (like Wal-Mart) and the Dot2Dot/Scala partnership bodes well for network operators and end users. The integration of Scala into STRATACACHE operations offers end users an improved entry and migration path in their use of digital place-based messaging and engagement capabilities. The acquisition of Scala by STRATACACHE provides a substantially stronger base of supply from the standpoint of functionality options, alternatives and scalability. Consolidation of supply reflects the next natural stage of organic digital signage industry growth and positions the sector for greater contributions media commerce and the economic success of enterprises, industries, countries, regions and countries. As the pace of technology application accelerates for benefits "in the now,” strength of supply, as reflected in this acquisition agreement is a critical success factor. The accelerated application of digital signage and overall industry development will benefit all. In short; End users will gain a broader and stronger supply option from the expanded STRATACACHE family of providers. The harmonizing and consolidation of research, development, innovation and best practices will accelerate use cases and standards of practice. The struggle of provider sourcing can be streamlined allowing end users to get on with the gaining the benefits of the media. Firms competing with STRATACACHE and Scala will “up their game” in the face of this combined supply capability. This acquisition puts me in mind of The Jungle Book story that many parents have read to their children and is the subject of another recent movie version. It's a jungle out there for retailers, brands and others. But like Mowgli (the jungle boy) who is protected, developed and supported by the panther Bagheera, (representative of the fiercely competitive but somewhat private and elusive STRATACACHE) and a big bear named Baloo (representative of Scala), end users have been in good hands. Their combined contributions equip Mowgli to stand against King Louie who wants to be all-powerful (let’s call this online commerce). The Jungle becomes a better place, just as place-based media through capable champions can do. Integrators and other channel providers will have access to broader capabilities and a growing market for the medium. Scala partners and proponents will benefit from the broader feature set and stability of supply offered by this acquisition. Consolidation has not been expected as a needed feature of and for industry expansion. Sales (for suppliers) and acquisition (for end users) costs have hampered industry growth, detracting from investment on innovations that can significantly advance the use of place-based customer experience and engagement technologies. Technology providers such as IBM, Microsoft, HP, Cisco, Harris Corp, 3M and Google have made splashes in the digital signage lake, but without the significant, long-term implication or impact that large and institutional investors seek. This acquisition of Scala by STRATACACHE is a giant step forward for digital signage and place-based media. More consolidation and expansion can be expected, on the basis that the medium simply makes business and economic sense through the enterprise and value that it delivers. John F. Kennedy said “ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,” as a reminder that value in service is the only basis on which progress can occur. In the 1600’s Martin Luther launched the reformation by challenging “indulges” and institutional authority. The consolidation of STRATACACHE and Scala as the major industry providers signals that the time is come for digital location-based media to reach new levels of enterprise and economic contribution.

It was offensive. And it made me feel violated.” She said she is still shaken up after a man approached her inside Walmart on Sunday. “When I tried to move, he grabbed me from behind,” she said. “Then I screamed; that’s what I remember.” The man then took off through the store. Some shoppers chased him while others checked on the victim. “I said, ‘This guy tried to grab me.’” She said several shoppers surrounded the man in the parking lot near a car with two women in the backseat. “He was reaching for something, so the guy that was trying to help me was scared for his life,” the victim said. The man got away, but the victim said things could have been worse. She wants to thank everyone that helped her. “I’d like to thank all of them,” she said. They risked their lives. They came together--solidarity. You never know when you need somebody.” Officers are still investigating the incident. If you know any information that may help, contact Bartlett Police Department.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe 5 min read Ecommerce 5 Shipping Trends for Small Ecommerce Businesses To Watch Image credit: Shutterstock Amine Khechfé Contributor Chief Strategy Officer, Stamps.com and Co-Founder, Endicia Big Data 3 Ways Big Data Can Help Small Businesses With Shipping Strategies Amine Khechfé ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 15, 2016 Shipping is the final (and arguably most important) frontier when it comes to satisfying customers. Big box retailers have made shipping a priority by routinely examining and revamping their fulfillment methods, resulting in solutions like Amazon Prime, Walmart’s two-day shipping subscription and eBay’s Fast ‘N Free initiative. Keeping an eye on trends and adopting new, relevant shipping methods will not only help improve customer satisfaction, but it will also help small business owners meet their bottom lines and compete with the big dogs. Here are five logistics trends and strategies that all retail business owners should evaluate. 1. Free shipping is expected. According to a Deloitte survey, free shipping is the top priority for shoppers when it comes to retail policies, and nine in 10 shoppers prioritize free shipping over fast shipping when shopping online. For small businesses to remain competitive, and avoid shopping cart abandonment, they’ll need to strongly consider incorporating free shipping as an option. As all businesses know, shipping is never really free. On a basic level, there are a few strategies to help businesses cover the cost of free shipping. First, increase product prices to cover shipping costs. In this case, the customer pays. Second, the business pays the full price of shipping. Third, the company slightly increases prices of products to cover some shipping costs, so that both pay a portion. Businesses can also get creative, offering free shipping when a customer hits a minimum order value. This strategy can help by increasing an average order size; therefore, increasing profits to help offset shipping costs. 2. Deliver packages at a specific time. Some of consumers’ biggest pet peeves are receiving those “sorry we missed you” postage slips on their front door, or even worse, having a package stolen off their doorstep. According to a Temando survey, 76 percent of consumers want a specified time slot for delivery, and 37 percent are willing to pay a premium for it. The good news is that the major carriers’ tracking information have significantly improved, helping recipients know where their package is on its route and the estimated delivery date. In addition, most consumers know roughly when their mail carrier arrives each day and can oftentimes plan accordingly. For even greater control over delivery times, businesses can consider offering local customers on-demand delivery services, such as UberRUSH or Deliv. With these services, shoppers can specify the exact time of day they would like to have their order arrive. To ship smaller items to out-of-town customers with unusual or difficult schedules, USPS also offers a Hold for Pickup option, allowing the customer to pick up the parcel at a specified post office location. It also offers Package Intercept, which allows customers to reroute their domestic packages if they go on a vacation or business trip. 3. Drones will deliver. Drones will soon be able to deliver small items to local areas quickly and efficiently. Amazon and Google are investing in drone delivery, among countless other tech companies. However, there are still operational limitations standing in the way of drone delivery. The Part 107 drone regulations announced recently that it does not cover a variety of operations crucial to delivering packages, such as flying beyond a pilot’s visual line of sight, at higher altitudes and over laypeople. Related: 3 Ways to Grow a Multi-Million Dollar Drop Shipping Business So while they’re not buzzing overhead quite yet, business owners should keep drone delivery on their radar to make sure their business is ready to adapt quickly once regulations allowing drone deliveries are in place. 4. More options drive customer satisfaction. Traditionally, shoppers are given a few shipping options at checkout: standard, expedited and overnight. However, consumers are looking for more flexibility when it comes to how and when they receive their orders. According to an Accenture study, 66 percent of consumers have chosen a retailer based on the number of available delivery options. Related: 5 Keys to Building Your Ecommerce Site To avoid shopping cart abandonment and upset customers, retailers should think about adding additional delivery choices such as local pickup, carrier-specific options, same-day shipping and more. USPS is generally the most affordable option for smaller, lightweight packages while UPS and FedEx are better suited for larger items. Allowing customers to select specified carriers - UPS, FedEx or USPS -- may create satisfied, repeat customers as it gives them some control over the process. 5. Big data transforms shipping. Business data has been around for a long time, mostly sitting in filing cabinets as an untapped resource. Thanks to new technologies, small businesses can now leverage their data to better serve their customers. With the right tools, businesses can automatically analyze information, such as pricing histories, mobile device usage, website traffic, locations, parcels’ time in transit and shipping destinations to make informed business decisions. This eliminates inefficiencies and bias; therefore, reducing overall business costs and improving practices. Related: The 6 Best Ecommerce Platforms for Small Businesses There are countless ways small businesses can gather, analyze and make sense of all the data at their fingertips. For example, Endicia uses package data and predictive analysis to guide ecommerce business owners’ decisions, ranging from where to plant warehouses to how to improve delivery for the end-consumer through forecasted shipping costs and time in transit. By taking a look at where most products are shipped and how long they take to get there, business owners can determine the optimal location for a warehouse that will save the most time and money. Shipping is a challenging aspect of any ecommerce business and every small business will have different tactics and challenges to create the most efficient shipping strategy possible. Keeping an eye on shipping trends and strategies while implementing and tweaking it as needed, will help businesses determine what works best in order to be successful and competitive with the ecommerce retail giants.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, August 16, 2016 Updated: 12:05 PM, August 16, 2016 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> on Monday said it has increased its stake in Apple Inc <AAPL.O> by 55 percent, boosting its bet on the iPhone and iPod maker even as prominent investors like George Soros and Carl Icahn shed theirs. Berkshire owned 15.23 million Apple shares worth $1.46 billion as of June 30, up from 9.81 million shares as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing from Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate. The filing also said Berkshire cut its stake in Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, the world's largest retailer, by 27 percent to about 40.23 million shares from 55.24 million. Wal-Mart has been in Berkshire's portfolio for more than a decade. It was unclear whether Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are investing in Apple. Berkshire owned more than $133 billion of equities as of June 30. Buffett is typically responsible for larger investments such as Wal-Mart, while his deputies handle smaller investments. "They have more of a trading orientation than Buffett, and may view Apple as attractive because the stock appears cheap or may have a catalyst later this year," Jim Shanahan, an equity analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview. "If Warren Buffett is buying a stock, he's probably not going to sell it, or at least not sell for a very long time." Berkshire also owns roughly 90 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, and Fruit of the Loom underwear. It also paid $32.1 billion in January for aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, Buffett's largest purchase. Share prices often rise when investors perceive that Berkshire has given them its imprimatur, including the 3.7 percent one-day boost that Apple got in May after Berkshire unexpectedly revealed it had taken a stake. Berkshire revealed its higher Apple stake on the same day George Soros' firm Soros Fund Management and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors Inc said they dissolved their own Apple stakes. Icahn in April said he had sold his entire Apple stake, citing concerns about China's policies regarding the company. He later said he would reinvest in Apple if his concerns ebbed. Monday's Berkshire filing also disclosed other portfolio changes, among them lower stakes in farm equipment maker Deere & Co <DE.N> and Canadian oil and gas company Suncor Energy Inc <SU.TO>, and a higher stake in John Malone's telecommunications company Liberty Global Plc <LBTYA.O>. It also reflected Berkshire's more than 14 percent stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 <PSX.N>. Shanahan said he believes Berkshire has been shedding Wal-Mart shares at least in part to buy Phillips 66. He has a "buy" rating on Berkshire. Berkshire's filing showed that food company Kraft Heinz Co <KHC.O> was the company's largest equity investment as of June 30, at $28.81 billion, followed by Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N>.

Another customer captured part of the scene on video as she was going through the parking lot. In Richelle Stewart's video, posted to Facebook, the monkey can be seen standing on top of a railing to a cart corral, with an employee next to it. A woman walks up, saying "let it go, let it go" then takes the monkey by the hand and walks off. Police say the monkey got out of a camper that was parked in the lot. They say they were called to the store just before 8:00pm Sunday evening, but no report was taken. No word on who owns the monkey, or where he's from. close News In Pictures Gallery: On the red carpet at the American Music Awards 2016 Body of 10-year-old missing girl taken from church found in a Texas water well Cincinnati Zoo's gorilla barrier wasn't in compliance Community mourns students killed by overturned bus crash Trending 1   Caught on camera a foiled police ambush that happened in Lewiston 2   Community Action Partnership is dedicated to helping the community year-round 3   Camelot students raise an amazing amount of money for Turkey Drive 4   Candidate for N.P.

Inc. dropped 1% in afternoon trade Monday, despite the broad gains seen in the retail sector and the overall stock market, after Jefferies downgraded the consumer electronics retailer on concerns over a weakening 4K TV market. Analyst Daniel Binder cut his rating to hold, after being at buy for at least the last three years. He trimmed his stock price target to $36, which is just 4.3% above current levels, from $39. Binder said he is worried that the 4K TV cycle is maturing as prices fall and competition increases. He said the average selling prices for large screen 4K TVs have dropped 30% on a trailing-12-month basis, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. [: tgt] have "dramatically increased" their product offerings. Wal-Mart increased its shop-keeping-unit (SKU) count on 4K TVs to 9 from a few, while Target has tripled its SKU count to 15 from 5, Binder said. "[Best Buy] has above average market share in 4K TV, but will face stiffer competition this holiday season," Binder wrote in a note to clients. He believes the commoditization of 4K TVs puts same-store sales growth at risk for the rest of the year. Best Buy's stock has soared 13% year to date, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF has climbed 6.3% and the S&P 500 has run up 7.3%. Continue Reading Below Copyright © 2016 MarketWatch, Inc.

 Text Size: A | A A Walmart truck is stuck under an overpass in Schenectady. The top of the tractor trailer has been sheared off after the driver tried to go under the overpass on Crane Street around 1 p.m. The overpass has a 10-foot, 10-inch clearance, which is labeled with signs. The sign, however, is covered with black graffiti. Photo Gallery Stuck under a bridge Enlarge photos | View thumbnails Schenectady police Lt. Mark McCracken said an investigation into the incident is ongoing. It's unclear why the driver tried to fit under the overpass. McCracken said the driver did not sustain any injuries.

Accumulated lead levels can cause serious, sometimes permanent health problems such as brain function in fetuses and young children. Anyone with an affected product should not use it. On Friday, Oriental Packing Co. of Miami, Fla. recalled 377,000 pounds of various curry powders sold under Blue Mountain (Amazon.com), Jamaica Choice, Ocho Rios, Oriental and Grace brands (Walmart). The exact products are shown here: Debbi Snook, The Plain Dealer  And here are the corresponding lot numbers to identify those products in the recall: Debbi Snook, The Plain Dealer  One week earlier, Gel Spice Inc. of Bayonne, N.J. recalled various lots of ground turmeric shipped nationwide, including to larger chains such as Target, and local grocery stores. Those products are identified here: Debbi Snook, The Plain Dealer  Turmeric is seen by many as a health supplement against cancer and other diseases. The contaminations were detected by a New York State Health Department laboratory during routine testing. How lead got into the products has not been announced, although some experts speculate the plants used in the spices can absorb lead from the soil. It can also come from processing or deliberate adulteration to increase yield. Oriental Packing said in an announcement of its voluntary recall that it has ceased production of the curry while the product is being investigated. Consumers are urged to dispose of the affected product or return to place of purchase for a refund. The company answers consumer questions at 1-800-809-9793. Gel Spice turmeric products in the recall should also be thrown out, according to a statement from the company. Questions can be directed to 201-564-0435. Dion Tsevdos, owner of the Urban Herbs stand at West Side Market in Cleveland, and a supplier to many local restaurants, said his inventory is not affected by the recall. "Our supplier is out of New York. They test every lot and had no issues with either of those products." Margie Gibbons of Penzeys in West Milwaukee, WI, said her company is not involved in the recall, either. They import their own product and test shipments themselves. "Religiously," she said.

He later gathered with close friends for dinner but quietly sulked, playing the country song I Dont Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go Bowling on the jukebox. But his wife had a more pressing concern: money. The ousted governor needed a job, the family needed a place to live, and moving out of the governors mansion meant losing the help they had as they raised their 9-month-old daughter, Chelsea. The morning after the election, Hillary Clinton worked the phones from the mansion, calling wealthy friends and asking for help. The world changed. There was a tectonic shift, said Thomas F. McLarty III, a friend of Bill Clintons who served as his White House chief of staff. Bill Clinton was of little use as he fixated on voters rejection. And for the first time, friends said, Hillary Clinton glimpsed fragility in the future she had moved to Arkansas to pursue. She worried about saving for Chelseas college, caring for her aging parents, and even possibly supporting herself should the marriage or their political dreams dissolve. It was up to her to just keep holding things up, said Nancy Pietrafesa, a college friend of Hillary Clintons who moved to Arkansas to work for Bill Clinton in the 1970s. Hillary Clintons relationship with money has long puzzled even some of her closest supporters: Despite choosing a life in government, she has appeared eager to make money, driven to provide for her family and helping amass a fortune of more than $50 million with her husband. But Hillary Clinton can seem blind to how her financial decisions are viewed, and has suffered repeated political damage and accusations of conflicts of interest as a result  from serving on the corporate board of Wal-Mart while her husband was governor to initially accepting a $1.35 million mortgage personally secured by a top fundraiser for the familys Chappaqua, New York, home. Her collection of more than $21 million in speaking fees from a range of groups, including Wall Street firms and other interests, led to one of the most potent attacks against her in this election cycle, given voters anger about economic inequality. Half of all voters said it bothered them a lot that Clinton gave numerous speeches to Wall Street banks, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll conducted in June. Donald Trump has called Clinton totally owned by Wall Street. Trump, whose own finances have drawn extensive scrutiny, may be an imperfect messenger, but Republicans can say, This undercuts everything she is saying about what she wants to do to regulate Wall Street and her economic populist stance, said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. Even some of Clintons allies privately say they are mystified by her choice to make the Wall Street speeches, given the likelihood that they would become an issue in a presidential campaign. And to some of them, her financial moves clash with the selfless Methodist credo to do good for others that she so often says guided her toward a life of public service. But her longtime friends say the contradiction is rooted in Clintons practicality and the boom-and-bust cycles that have characterized her life with Bill Clinton. At no time did those stresses fall more squarely on Hillary Clintons shoulders than in the difficult two-year period in Arkansas when she and her husband found themselves cast out of office, financially strained and deeply uncertain about the future. And the memory of that time shaped her desire to be free from financial burden. Hillary had a couple years of the taste of what it means to be a working mother, without any help, to have to take care of a small baby and care for your job, said James B. Blair, a close Clinton friend and lawyer who offered Hillary Clinton investment advice in the 1970s. The Clintons unexpected ouster from their comfortable life occurred at a time when Arkansas was swirling with new money and get-rich-quick schemes as companies like Tyson and Wal-Mart minted millionaires and new savings and loan institutions were spreading throughout the South. A generation of Ivy League-educated young people, like Bill Clinton, had returned to their home state to make their mark. Money seemed to be all around the Clintons, but they did not have much of their own. And unlike Hillary Clinton, a worrier by nature, Bill Clinton, consumed with his dreams of a political career, seemed indifferent to securing a financial future. He was never interested in money, ever, Blair said. She is the one who had to be sure Chelsea was going to be able to afford college. People close to Hillary Clinton dont begrudge her desire to provide generously for her family, and certainly many presidential candidates and public servants acquire vast personal wealth. Asked in an interview whether earlier financial stresses had prompted her to pursue the lucrative speechmaking, Hillary Clinton said, I really think its much simpler than that, adding that it is typical for secretaries of state to share their views in speeches after leaving office. Thrift store decor It was one of the smallest houses on the block in Little Rocks Hillcrest section, and Hillary Clinton largely bought it with her own money, the month after that devastating 1980 election loss. She filled the rooms with mismatched furniture bought at thrift stores and borrowed from her flamboyant mother-in-law. She converted the windowed attic into a bedroom for Chelsea, parked her Oldsmobile Cutlass in the weedy driveway, and chased after the familys cocker spaniel, Zeke, who liked to chew through the fence. The Clintons had stretched their finances to afford the $112,000 home, which was down the hill from the citys old-money mansions. The sprawling estate of Winthrop Rockefeller, the celebrated former governor, was so close that it practically cast a shadow on the Clintons grassy backyard. Friends described the décor as unsightly, a jarring departure from the governors mansion. That couch just jumped out at me, said Bobby Roberts, a former aide to Bill Clinton, describing a scarlet-colored Victorian chaise that Bill Clintons mother, Virginia Kelly, had lent them. It was in some bright, violent color. And with no parents or in-laws in Little Rock, Hillary Clinton turned to friends and neighbors for help. She persuaded Carolyn Huber, who had helped run the governors mansion while Bill Clinton was in office, to continue to help care for Chelsea, who had grown fond of her. A neighbor, Manuel J. Lozano, recalled: Hillary was running around, and my wife took care of Chelsea here and there whenever she needed help. Bill Clinton had turned down out-of-state job offers in academia and Democratic politics, and instead took the only offer he had in Arkansas, to serve of counsel for $55,000 a year at the Wright, Lindsey & Jennings law firm, where Bill Clintons longtime adviser Bruce R. Lindsey was a partner. But he spent most of his time on the road, often accompanied by Lindsey, trying to win back the hearts of voters. He had to go all over that state, touch base and apologize, and listen to why he lost, Pietrafesa recalled, and every one of those visits was a two-, three- or four-hour ordeal. Hillary Clinton had become a partner at the Rose Law Firm in 1979, and during these lean years she balanced her work there with caring for Chelsea, who celebrated her first birthday and learned to walk in the Hillcrest house, on Midland Street. She often felt on her own as Bill Clinton crisscrossed the state, friends said. She increased her hours to bring in work for the firm, with business not as easy to come by now that she was no longer the governors wife. The whole time period was a point of learning, after the defeat, Jerry C. Jones, Hillary Clintons colleague at the firm, remembered. Friends said she would have focused on public service and charitable work and not gone to work at the firm  an old line practice known for representing the business and political elite in Arkansas  had it not been for her concern about her familys finances. Ann Henry, an Arkansas friend, described Hillary Clinton as an oddity there, where other women, mostly secretaries and paralegals, gawked at her curls and thrown-together clothes. (Hillary Clinton worked at the Rose Law Firm for roughly 15 years, the longest she has worked at any job, though it is not on her official campaign biography.) Im not sure she ever planned to be a corporate lawyer, said Lissa Muscatine, a friend and former chief speechwriter to Hillary Clinton. But she did the work because she had the earning capacity that he didnt have as governor. A frugal father Growing up in the upper-middle-class suburb of Park Ridge, Illinois, Hillary Rodham  whose mother had been raised in poverty and whose Depression-era father preached frugality  babysat and held summer jobs beginning when she was 13. Her father, Hugh Rodham, taught his only daughter fiscal responsibility and how to read stock tables in the newspaper. But he was not one to shower his children with material things. Her mother came from nothing and her father was self-made, so theres always been an awareness of working hard to earn a living, said Lisa Caputo, a friend and former White House aide. There was anxiety, too. The family was never comfortably affluent, and even as Hugh Rodham bought himself a Cadillac, he insisted that his wife and children live modestly. Hillary and her brothers helped out at his drapery business, which eventually closed after sales slowed. By the time she was a student at Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton and many in her generation were expressing skepticism about the pursuit of money. In her 1969 commencement speech, she denounced materialism and corporate greed. Were searching for more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating modes of living, she declared. When she moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and later married Bill Clinton in 1975, the Yale Law-educated couple lived happily earning about $18,000 a year each in their positions as professors. But several years later, as Bill Clinton planned his run for the governors office and the couple worried about starting a family, Hillary Clinton grew increasingly uneasy about their incomes and started to think more seriously about how to build a nest egg. She had been the chief breadwinner and financial decision maker, her best friend, Diane D. Blair, wrote in notes she kept about the era. Arkansas was a small state with overlapping circles of the politically and economically powerful  and many of the Clintons contemporaries were getting rich. The smart guys who were politically active would make that interesting investment that would push them from the ranks of the upper middle class into the wealthy and powerful, said William K. Black, a former financial regulator and professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Hillary Clinton began seeking out investment opportunities, and in 1978 she made one of the most lucrative, if seemingly risky, financial decisions of her life. Blair, the Clintons close friend, had made several million dollars in the commodities market, and urged Hillary Clinton to begin trading, too. With an initial investment of just $1,000, she made nearly $100,000 trading cattle futures in a 10-month period, which helped pay for the down payment on the Midland Street home. But the move later haunted her when the investment became the subject of scrutiny in the early years of the Clinton presidency. It still trails her occasionally: Trump raised it at a rally last month in North Carolina, as he attacked her for being crooked. Look at her cattle futures! he called out to the crowd. More stable Also in 1978, another friend, James B. McDougal, persuaded Hillary Clinton to invest in another venture: the Whitewater real estate development on a brush-covered plot of land in the Ozarks. The Clintons ultimately lost money on the deal, but the development led to an investigation when Bill Clinton was in the White House. The deals were certainly tempting, given the couples income at the time. In 1978, Bill Clinton became one of the youngest, and lowest paid, governors, in the country, earning $33,519.14 his first year in office. Hillary Clintons income from the Rose Law Firm brought their combined wages in 1978 to $51,173. Even though she reaped big rewards on the commodities market, the experience was unnerving. Shortly after Chelsea was born, Hillary Clinton told her broker she wanted out. I couldnt take the stress, she said at a campaign stop in June. She would, however, continue to shoulder her familys financial worries. Not long after Bill Clinton won re-election in 1982, the Clintons sold the yellow house on Midland Street and moved back into the governors mansion, where they once again enjoyed free housing and the assistance of a small staff. Two years later, the state increased the governors term to four years, and the Clintons finances appeared more stable. Hillary Clinton went on to join the board of Wal-Mart, and she continued to work at the Rose Law Firm. By the time Bill Clinton was running for president, they reported $297,177 in total income on their 1992 tax returns, a sum that would put most Americans in the upper income tier, but seemed meager compared with the wealth of his opponents, George Bush and Ross Perot. When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman, Bill Clinton has said. The White House years offered a respite from financial worry. As first lady, Hillary Clinton wrote a book, It Takes a Village, for which she did not accept an advance and donated the proceeds to charity. HRC insists she will have time, wants it to have impact (of course, also wants it to make huge bucks), Diane Blair wrote at the time. Still, the couples earlier financial decisions resurfaced in damaging ways. What started as an investigation into the Whitewater investment spun into revelations of Bill Clintons relationship with a White House intern, which led to the presidents impeachment by the House of Representatives. When the Clintons left the White House in 2000  the first time they were without the safety net of public office in 18 years  they owed $5 million in legal fees and once again felt financial uncertainty. In 2014, Hillary Clinton described her familys situation at the time in words that have bedeviled her candidacy: Dead broke. Once again, the Clintons needed a house, and once again they turned to the help of a wealthy friend. This time it was Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton campaign fundraiser, who offered to guarantee the mortgage on the home they would move into after leaving the White House. But this time, the home  a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial in the tony suburb of Chappaqua, New York  was not one of the smallest houses on the block. Hillary Clinton did not have to call the Roto-Rooter every time the old pipes clogged, or run to a neighbors house to borrow milk and eggs, as she had done in the house on Midland Street. And now it was Hillary Clinton, eyeing a Senate seat from New York, who left her husband at home as she hit the road, crisscrossing the state for her campaign.

Multiple news organizations are reporting the rescue of more than 20,000 people from homes and vehicles as of Sunday.

Certain merchandise priced under $100 was tax free that weekend in Iowa.  The back-to-school shopping season is in full swing, and retailers are hoping to capture every dollar they can after an unusually warm winter torpedoed apparel sales. The season — second only to the holidays as retailers’ busiest — might provide a small boost, but some industry watchers say it’s unlikely to turn the ship for many that are struggling to compete with online retailers such as Amazon. Another challenge: luring the ever-savvy post-recession consumer. “It seems like every season people are asking ‘Will this be the shopping season where things go back to the rate of growth we’ve seen in the past?’ And it typically never is,” said Timothy Campbell, an analyst with Kantar Retail, a research firm in Boston. Retailers are facing another challenging year, with some, such as Kmart, Macy’s and Walmart, saying they will close stores, and an index that tracks the stocks of national retailers is down 5.5 percent over the past year when compared with the broader stock market, which is up 7.25 percent over the same period. Still, the National Retail Federation, a trade group, is much more optimistic. The organization predicts total spending for K-12 and college students is expected to reach $75.8 billion, up from last year’s $68 billion. Many parents might be stocking up this year after scraping by last year, when spending remained basically flat, the NRF said. This “stock up” and “make do” cycle is an effect of the last recession, when many people tried to stretch their dollars as much as possible, spokeswoman Ana Serafin Smith said. “That trend just kept on happening, especially when we’re starting to see millennials, most affected during the recession, are now becoming parents,” she said. “They’re using the same practices they basically have lived through over the last several years.” Joanne Farmer of Glenwood, Iowa, said she’s expecting to spend about the same as she did last year for her three kids, ages 10, 5 and 4. But she also tries to make back-to-school items stretch beyond just one year. “If we get a decent backpack it’s, like, ‘If this one is good next year, you’re using it,’ ” Farmer said. NRF’s survey of 6,809 consumers conducted June 30 through July 6 found that, on average, families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade were planning to spend about $675 on apparel and accessories, electronics, shoes and school supplies, up from last year’s $630.36. Another survey by consulting firm Deloitte of 1,200 parents from June 22 through June 27 found that families would spend about $488 on back-to-school necessities. “I think we’ll find retailers will have a slight boost. I don’t think it’s going to be the kind of boost that will drive them to a different place from an economic perspective,” said Rod Sides, vice chairman and U.S. retail and distribution practice leader at Deloitte in Charlotte, North Carolina. Retailers — especially teen retailers that might be a focus during back-to-school season — have been in a tough place since the recession. Teen retailers like American Eagle, Abercrombie & Fitch and Kearney, Nebraska-based the Buckle are expected, as a group, to report an earnings drop of 45 percent in the second quarter of this year when compared with the same period last year, said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics in Boston. (The Buckle’s stock is down almost 40 percent over the past year.) Meanwhile, earnings for discount stores like Target and Walmart are expected to dip about 8 percent for the same period. “It’s gonna be difficult for the industry to generate the kind of concentrated buzz for these particular things,” Perkins said of the back-to-school season. Campbell, the Kantar analyst, said that’s because, in a nutshell, consumer behavior has fundamentally changed. The economic downturn trained consumers to pinch pennies. Plus, more shopper dollars are being funneled to other expenses: rising health care, child care, housing and education costs. In turn, retailers must respond with constant sales and promotions to keep traffic flowing to their stores. Sales of 30 to 50 percent off are much more common than they were 10 years ago, Campbell said. “You’re just seeing much more than you would 10 years ago,” he said. “Shoppers have become accustomed to that. They’re not just buying things at full price at the drop of a hat.” The constant sales that shoppers have come to expect eat into stores’ profits. One such sale-focused shopper is Omahan Flora Coan. She has her back-to-school shopping strategy down to a science, and it’s all about saving as much money as possible. She took advantage of Iowa’s sales tax holiday, held the first weekend in August each year. Coan budgets to spend between $900 and $1,100 on clothes for her two sons, Jaden, 13, and Wendell, 10. “From a budget perspective it works better. Boys’ stuff doesn’t go on clearance very often,” she said. That’s why she does all of her shopping — jeans, sweaters, shoes and backpacks — for the year during the back-to-school season, when sales are abundant. “I focus more on winter stuff,” she said, because shorts and short-sleeve shirts last only a few weeks into the school year, she said. Many other parents, retail watchers say, are opting to buy what they need as they go. Because retailers are discounting more than ever, they’re cutting back the sense of urgency that once came with shopping “seasons,” like back to school and the holidays. “There is a loss of urgency,” Campbell said, to shop the season, because of nearly constant sales. “That just led shoppers to think they can shop anytime they want and always be able to find deals.” When buying back-to-school items for her two daughters, ages 11 and 6, Omahan Micki Ortez planned to spend about the same as she did last year. But she wasn’t doing all of her shopping in August. “I don’t stock up. I buy just so much at first,” waiting for colder months to buy cold-weather clothes, Ortez said. “I’m a buy-as-you-go.” Brick-and-mortar retailers may have an edge over those that are only online. Unlike during the holiday shopping season, many parents are on the hunt for new clothes for growing kids, necessitating trying things on before buying. In Deloitte’s survey, about two-thirds of shoppers said they would buy school supplies in a store rather than online. Families were shopping the season earlier this year, however. Seventy-three percent of those surveyed by the NRF said they would begin back-to-school shopping about a month to two months out from the beginning of the school year, up from 62 percent last year. That could give retailers with earlier sales an opportunity, Deloitte’s Sides said. But that strategy can backfire, too. The shopping season creeping earlier and earlier is a common complaint during the holidays, when Christmas items are now on display weeks before Black Friday, which traditionally kicked off the season. Some retailers and shoppers, Campbell said, “have been suffering from a back-to-school burnout. Some of the campaigns we’ve seen are very similar to last year, or relatively uninspired.” Contact the writer: 402-444-1414, paige.yowell@owh.com ****** WAYS TO SAVE ON BACK-TO-SCHOOL BUYING MIX NEW AND OLD ITEMS: If a growth spurt doesn’t necessitate buying everything new, focus on a few items and take advantage of help from retailers. J.C. Penney’s website has a section called “Outfits You Love” that suggests ways to mix eight items to create two weeks of looks. DO THE RESEARCH: It’s easier than ever to check prices to make sure you’re getting the best deal. One site, camelcamelcamel.com, monitors prices on millions of Amazon.com products and sends alerts when prices drop. Apps like RedLaser and PriceJump let shoppers scan an item to see if there’s a better price online. TIME YOUR BUYING: Back-to-school discounts have already started, but the trick is knowing the best time to grab certain items. For summer clothes like short-sleeve tops, wait until the last week of August and the first week of September to reap the biggest discounts, said Benjamin Glaser, editor of DealNews, a deal-comparison website. For fall clothes, try to buy the first week of October. For jeans, he said to buy later in October for the largest savings. In years past, Glaser said, he’s seen brands like Lucky, Levi’s and Nautica cut prices by 40 percent to 60 percent during October, with few restrictions. BUY THE BASICS IN BULK: Stock up on items like socks and hoodies. Target’s new Cat & Jack line for kids has offered $4 tank tops for girls. Gap’s Old Navy has up to 60 percent off with styles starting from $4. Old Navy is offering deep price cuts on hooded sweatshirts, selling for about $12, that Andres Dorronsoro, general manager at Old Navy merchandising, calls “extra cozy.” Walmart has basic T-shirts for boys for just under $3 and leggings for girls for just under $4. SHOP OFF-PRICE: Discounters like T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and others are increasingly offering more items in season and are working to better curate them to the local market, said Ronen Lazar, CEO of Inturn, a technology company that works with off-price retailers to help liquidate merchandise. T.J. Maxx says that now through the beginning of September is the best time to catch trends for kids and teens, such as plaid and athletic-inspired clothing. LEVERAGE STORE REWARDS: Choose one store and do most of your shopping there to get the biggest benefit from its rewards program. The Kohl’s programs offers $5 in rewards for every 100 points, or dollars spent. Shoppers also can sign up for programs like Plenti, which let them earn points in one store and use them in another. — The Associated Press More information Parents who scrimp to pay for child care get a break when the last kid finally heads off to kindergarten The cost, which has become the single-biggest expense for many families, forces parents to do more than just tighten their belts. Cutting everyday luxuries such as cable TV, lattes and dinners out barely scratches the surface. Instead, they put off big purchases, like new cars and homes, that drive the country’s consumer economy.

(KSNW) – The northeast Wichita neighborhood has been without Walmart since the beginning of the year. When it closed, it not only affected where families can get their groceries, but also school supplies. Sunday, a local church stepped in to help those getting ready for school. KSN talked to those who benefited from the event. “I’m just so blessed and thankful,” said Maxine Powell-McClellan. McClellan is one of the nearly 300 families came for help with school supplies.. “To have Delrose and come and provide backpacks for my children, even though we still need to get other school supplies, it’s really helped out tremendously,” McClellan added. “A lot of neighborhood kids come here whom some parents aren’t able to drive or can’t get out of the neighborhood,” said Delrose Rev. Kevass Harding. They handed out backpacks filled with food and offered free haircuts for boys and hairstyles for girls. After running out last year, this time, the church supplied close to 400 backpacks. “I think this a great opportunity for them to come and get all the school supplies whether it be backpacks or even the haircuts we give,” said The Grooming Experience barber, Shannon Brown. “It gives them an opportunity to get everything they need without having to travel far or trying to find transportation.” Church members says they noticed a lot of people who live in the neighborhood are in need of assistance after the neighborhood Walmart store closed earlier this year. “With Walmart not being there, it’s a little bit further to go out to be able to get what you need for the school supplies,” said parent, Brandy Knox. “So with this being here at the church, it makes it a lot easier for people in the neighborhood to be able to come and get what they need for school.” And with school right around the corner, Knox is just thankful someone stepped in to help. “Without Delrose, it really would have been a lot more work for me,” Knox said. The church helped 280 families this afternoon. Next year, they’re hoping to expand that number, saying they’d like to get other churches involved to reach a wider number of people. This is the fourth year Delrose United Methodist Church hosted the event.

Skip to content brandchannel: 5 questions news subscribe to our daily email features rio 2016 cannes lions sxsw brandspeak brandcameo glossary events search Target Refreshes Grocery Strategy in Bid For Growth Posted August 16, 2016 by Dale Buss Target has been turning to groceries to try to escape the threatening black hole of retail gloom. Expanding square footage and selection, favoring better-for-you fare over traditional processed CPG brands, adding more organic and gluten-free items, launching a “Made To Matter” campaign with socially conscious brands to help draw millennials into the store—Target CEO Brian Cornell has been doing all of this as part of his unique formula for helping Target survive the tumultuous era of brick-and-mortar retailing. But pivoting more strongly into groceries hasn’t been easy for Target, which expects to report this week that overall sales at existing stores disappointingly declined by 2 percent in its second quarter. The chain doesn’t yet offer the massive grocery presence of a Walmart supercenter or regional discounters such as Meijer in the Midwest, yet Target’s ultimate goal is to serve as a one-shop grocery destination for customers who long have shopped there for apparel, housewares, toys and other staples. “We’re not really special and we’re not a full grocery,” John Mulligan, the company’s chief operating officer, said in 2015, according to the Wall Street Journal. “And so we’re sitting in the middle of no man’s land.” Target’s latest challenge in this regard, according to the newspaper, is with its supply chain for fresh meat, fruits and vegetables: Shoppers aren’t visiting often enough to keep perishable foods truly fresh so perishable foods, which are usually a big traffic driver at grocery stories, have become a drag on Target’s profitability. And Target’s supply chain wasn’t built to transport items with a short shelf life, as the chain sorts everything through just four food distribution centers nationally or through C&S Wholesale Grocers, according to the Journal. A Target spokeswoman said the chain is evaluating and acting on the problem. But in the meantime, while the average Target shopper visits a store less than once a month, they need go there more frequently to turn over fresh produce and other items with a short shelf life. Groceries are about one-fifth of Target’s overall revenue, but for Cornell’s supercenter strategy to work, he may need to up that target.

Kane’s exit completes a spectacular fall for the former county prosecutor who soared to victory four years ago as an outsider who promised to break up an “old-boys’ network” in state government. She squandered her early popularity, feuded with rivals and aides, and ultimately was undone by what prosecutors portrayed as a personal vendetta for her critics and perceived enemies. Now, Kane is facing jail time and cannot even practice private law. 2Lawsuit settled: New York City has reached a settlement of more than $4 million with the family of an unarmed man fatally shot by a police officer in a darkened stairwell in November 2014, the attorney for the family said Tuesday. The city is paying $4.1 million and the city Housing Authority is contributing $400,000 to settle a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of 28-year-old Akai Gurley. Former Officer Peter Liang was on patrol when he opened a stairwell door at a public housing building and suddenly fired. The bullet ricocheted and hit Gurley. Liang was sentenced to five years’ probation and community service; he apologized to Gurley’s family. 3Police shooting: Police say one man was fatally shot in an officer-involved shooting at a Walmart in Lenoir, N.C. Two others are in custody, police in Lenoir say. Police Chief Scott Brown said 32-year-old Carl Marcus Nivins fired at police before one of the officers returned fire, killing him. Brown said officers responded to a report of suspicious activity by Walmart employees. As officers approached, Nivins tried to flee before shooting at the officers. 4Parents charged: A man and woman in Hattiesburg, Miss., were charged with felony child neglect after their 7-week-old baby was found dead in an apartment. Martina Fillingane and Robert Ashcraft, both 40, were charged Monday and are scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. The baby’s body was sent to the state Crime Lab for an autopsy. 5Grisly attack: A 19-year-old Florida State University student with no criminal record fatally stabbed a couple at random outside their house, wounded their neighbor and was biting the dead man’s face when deputies finally subdued him, authorities said Tuesday. Austin Harrouff, a former high school football player and wrestler, may have been on hallucinogenic drugs when he attacked Michelle Mishcon, 53, and John Stevens, 59, outside their home in Tequesta, Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said. Snyder said Harrouff had joined his family for dinner at a restaurant a short distance away when he stormed off, apparently agitated about slow service. His parents were so worried by his behavior that they called police and some of his fraternity brothers in a futile attempt to find him before the attack.

Close share panel Image caption The clothing industry has transformed Bangladesh in the last three decades Nothing has stopped Shirin Begum from going to work every day at a garment factory for more than 10 years - but last month's deadly attack by Islamic militants in the capital, Dhaka, could change that. She walked to work in Dhaka even during Bangladesh's never-ending general strikes, political violence and labour unrest. But now she fears her livelihood is in danger because of the recent jihadist violence. "What will happen to us if the buyers are not going to come to Bangladesh?" says Shirin, a mother-of-two who works as a seamstress at a factory just outside Dhaka that stitches clothes for many Western retail brands. She is one of the four million workers in the industry, which is the world's second largest exporter of ready-made garments, next only to China. In July, militants overran a cafe in an upmarket area of Dhaka killing 20 people, most of them foreigners. Two policemen and the six militants also died. Bangladesh mourns victims of Dhaka cafe attack Country at a crossroads as violence hits Dhaka Is violent extremism on the rise in Bangladesh? A group of Italians who were involved in buying clothes for Western brands were among the victims. Seven Japanese also died in the siege. For the first time, foreigners were taken as hostages and killed in Bangladesh. The massacre has sent shivers down the spine of the industry. Media caption"We want the garments sector to survive - so people like us can also survive," says Shirin Begum Soon after the incident, a number of Western buyers cancelled visits to Bangladesh and many retail brands have started pulling their staff out of the country. Game changer The garments industry has transformed this impoverished nation in the last three decades. It has helped millions of people like Shirin to move out of poverty. That's why many people describe this industry as the backbone of the economy. Last year the country exported about $28bn (£21bn) worth of ready-to-wear clothes and the industry has set an ambitious target of $50bn by 2021. Cheap labour costs have been one of the main reasons Bangladesh has established itself in the global supply chain for low-end textiles and clothing. Many major global retail brands, such as H&M, Walmart, Gap and Marks & Spencer, buy their clothes from Bangladesh. Some in Bangladesh describe the recent upsurge in Islamist violence as a game changer in the country's turbulent history. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bangladesh has also seen a string of deadly attacks on secular writers, bloggers and members of religious minorities No-one knows how far radicalisation has penetrated society. There is a sense of fear and despair. This Muslim-majority nation is on edge following the recent violent incidents. Tarnished image "It will definitely affect our industry very gravely," says Rubana Huq, managing director of Mohammadi Group, which makes clothes for many Western fashion brands. "This has to stop. I don't think the industry or the country can afford any more shocks," she says. The Bangladeshi garments industry is only just beginning to recover from the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, which saw a factory building outside Dhaka collapse, killing more than 1,130 people. Most of those who died were garment factory workers. The disaster tarnished the image of the industry. Following the incident, Western retailers came under intense pressure to source clothes from factories that implement strict safety regulations. Image caption The attacks will "definitely affect our industry very gravely", says Rubana Huq Though some foreign companies have suspended all but critical travel to Bangladesh, they have not yet cancelled their orders. The latest violent incidents will not have any short-term impact as Bangladesh is still an attractive destination for clothes retailers because of its low-cost production. "The medium and long-term impact will be they will try and source their products from somewhere else. That is natural. A buyer would want to stay in a country which is safe," says Rubana Huq. Future questions While China is still the world's leading garments exporter, countries like Cambodia, Myanmar and Sri Lanka are challenging as alternative garment industry hubs. And some Western companies are looking at Ethiopia as a potential option, with factories now coming up there. But the uncertainty over the security situation has forced many Bangladeshi factory owners to reconsider their own plans. "I was planning to expand my production lines for denim products because of the increasing demand," says Fakir Kamruzzaman Nahid, managing director of Fakir Fashion. "But some of my foreign buyers told me that they will not come to Bangladesh for one year because of the security situation. After consulting with them I will decide on my expansion plan." Image caption Some of Fakir Kamruzzaman Nahid's buyers have said they will postpone visits to Bangladesh for a year The government has promised to boost security for visiting foreigners and says it is confident that it can bring the situation under control. Foreign buyers like Yusuke Yamaguchi say that despite security concerns, Bangladesh offers plenty of opportunities. "The risk may be a bit higher here, but many countries face the problem of terrorism," says Mr Yamaguchi, director of One Piece Limited, a Japanese firm that buys clothes from Bangladesh. "Bangladesh is still business-friendly and our business has been growing." The clothing industry says if foreign firms stop buying from Bangladesh it would have a huge social impact. It wants the government to take immediate steps to boost the confidence of foreign buyers. For Shirin Begum the potential is clear. "If they go to some other country to buy clothes, then factories here will be forced to shut down and we will lose our jobs."

The pledge represents a call-to-action for all members of the private sector to improve their communities by eliminating barriers for those with a criminal record and creating a pathway for a second chance. Today we’re announcing a round of new signatories, bringing the total number of pledged employers to 185. The new commitments are from a diverse range of employers including: Walmart, Dropbox, and the University of Pennsylvania. The companies and organizations that have signed the pledge collectively employ over 3 million Americans. Since the President took office, this Administration has been committed to reforming America's criminal justice system and highlighting the importance of reducing barriers facing justice-involved individuals who are trying to put their lives back on track. Over 2.2 million individuals are incarcerated in American prisons and jails, and the vast majority of them will return to their communities. Improving education and job opportunities for these individuals has a recognized effect of reducing crime and will make our communities safer.  By signing the Fair Chance Business Pledge, these companies are: Voicing strong support for economic opportunity for all, including the approximately 70 million Americans who have some form of a criminal record. Demonstrating an ongoing commitment to take action to reduce barriers to a fair shot at a second chance, including practices such as “banning the box” by delaying criminal history questions until later in the hiring process; ensuring that information regarding an applicant’s criminal record is considered in proper context; and engaging in hiring practices that do not unnecessarily place jobs out of reach for those with criminal records. Today’s announcement is further evidence of the private sector’s support for a more fair justice system. Throughout the year, the Administration will continue to highlight businesses that join the Fair Chance Business Pledge. THE FAIR CHANCE BUSINESS PLEDGE We applaud the growing number of public and private sector organizations nationwide who are taking action to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed, including individuals who have had contact with the criminal justice system. When around 70 million Americans – nearly one in three adults – have a criminal record, it is important to remove unnecessary barriers that may prevent these individuals from gaining access to employment, training, education and other basic tools required for success in life. We are committed to providing individuals with criminal records, including formerly incarcerated individuals, a fair chance to participate in the American economy. Companies and organizations interested in joining the Fair Chance Business Pledge can do so by signing up HERE.

Originally launched in 2011, the Federal Interagency Reentry Council brings together representatives from more than 20 agencies across the federal government to expand the range of tools available so that every individual returning from prison or jail has a meaningful chance to rebuild their life and reclaim their future. Co-Chaired by the Attorney General and the Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, the Federal Interagency Reentry Council coordinates and leverages existing federal resources, dispels myths related to reentry and clarifies policies, elevates promising practices, and reduces the policy barriers to successful reentry. National Reentry Week The Department of Justice also released an after-action report today describing the success of this year’s first-ever National Reentry Week. Held during the week of April 24th, this inaugural effort featured more than 550 events throughout the country, as well as several federal, state, and local actions and announcements aimed at improving reentry outcomes and raising awareness of the importance of successful rehabilitation and reintegration into communities. As the after-action report notes, leaders from across the Administration traveled in support of these events, which included: More than 75 resource fairs, connecting individuals with housing, legal aid, community-based reentry services and other vital resources; More than 65 employment-related events, providing recently released individuals with opportunities to connect with employers and job search resources; More than 75 reentry presentations, informing individuals returning home from prison or jail about ways to succeed despite the barriers they may face as they reenter their communities; More than 35 family-related events, providing individuals with information that will assist them with their release; More than 30 stakeholder meetings, bringing together all parties that have a stake in the reentry process; More than 25 graduation ceremonies, marking successful completion of programs ranging from reentry court programs to GED and vocational training curricula; and More than 25 reentry simulations, highlighting real-life issues facing reentering individuals. These announcements build on the Administration’s longstanding commitment to improving reentry outcomes and removing unnecessary obstacles facing formerly incarcerated individuals, including: Establishing the Federal Interagency Reentry Council to lead the Government’s work on the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals returning to their communities from prisons and jails. Proposing a rule “Banning the Box” in federal employment by prohibiting federal agencies from asking questions about criminal and credit history of applicants for tens of thousands of government jobs until a conditional offer of employment has been made. Releasing guidance on the application of Fair Housing Act standards on the use of criminal records by providers of housing and providing guidance for public housing authorities on excluding the use of arrest records in housing decisions. Clarifying that individuals in state or local halfway houses and those on probation or parole are not excluded from Medicaid and describing how states can better facilitate access to Medicaid services for individuals reentering the community. Making available Veterans Affairs services and support to justice-involved veterans in over 350 Veterans Treatment Courts and other Veteran-focused court programs and 1,284 local jails.  Removing unnecessary barriers to college access. The Department of Education issued Beyond the Box Guidance and higher education institutions from across the country joined the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge to voice their support for the reforms needed to expand college opportunity. Establishing the My Brother’s Keeper Task Force in February of 2014, which is charged with addressing persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color and ensuring all young people can reach their full potential. Many of the announcements being made today respond to the Task Force’s May 2014 Report to the President, which included a wide range of recommendations designed to create clear pathways to opportunity and “eliminate unnecessary barriers to giving justice-involved youth a second chance.” In addition, in 2012, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission released updated guidance on the appropriate use of arrest and conviction records in employment decisions and clarified employers’ nondiscrimination obligations.

The home improvement retailer posted $26.5 billion in sales, a 6.6 percent increase from last year’s second quarter. It also netted $2.4 billion in earnings, or $1.94 per share, up 13.9 percent from the previous year. Both figures were company records. The company reaffirmed its sales and earnings outlook for the rest of the year. Unlike some other retailers, Home Depot is clearly enjoying the effects of lower gas prices, low unemployment and rising wages, all of which put more cash in consumer pockets. “We’re fortunate we’re in a space where the customer is willing to spend,” said Craig Menear, the company’s chairman, CEO and president, in Tuesday’s investor conference call. Related: Home Prices Hit an All-Time High: Is This Another Bubble? Here are five reasons why Home Depot is setting records: 1. Amazon is not an issue. While other retailers like Walmart and Best Buy watch Amazon take away customers, Home Depot is largely immune to the Amazon effect. In fact, on Amazon Prime Day on July 12 this year, Home Depot experienced good traffic on their site largely because the event drew so many shoppers online. The company also recently rolled out its “Buy Online Deliver From Store” option that has shorter delivery times and is popular with professional contractors. For the second quarter, online sales for Home Depot increased 19 percent, representing 5.6 percent of total sales. 2. Renovation projects are up. The company is seeing healthy growth in large-dollar transactions. Typically, those $900-plus transactions included only one or two large items like appliances, but now they include 40 to 70 items, indicating a larger project. Home Depot also says professional business outpaced the do-it-yourself business during the quarter, while the gap between high-spend professionals and low-spend professionals narrowed, another indicator of healthy renovation activity. “The project business is alive and well,” Menear said. 3. Household formation is increasing. Young people may not be buying homes, but they are renting them. The number of renter-occupied housing units jumped by 967,000 in the second quarter from the year before. “We serve owned and rental households,” said Carol Tome, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, in the investor conference call. Related: Why You May End Up Living in a Shipping Container 4. Housing turnover is on the rise. Sales of existing homes in June hit the highest level in more than nine years. More turnover spurs remodeling activity as sellers rush to make improvements before putting a home for sale, while buyers renovate what they don’t like in their new houses. 5. Home price appreciation continues. When prices go up, homeowners feel comfortable investing in their homes with improvements and renovations. Home Depot has benefited from the steady rise in housing values, which have increased nearly 35 percent since bottoming in February 2012. Menear noted that industry experts expect that appreciation to keep going for the next couple of years as the number of homes for sale lags the volume of potential buyers. Even in the hottest markets like San Francisco, where prices are skyrocketing, Home Depot is not seeing any signs of a slowdown in its business. “This is a tailwind we see for the foreseeable future,” Menear said.

What does McDonald’s sustainability pilot mean for beef producers? Aug 17, 2016 by Amanda Radke in BEEF Daily RSS EMAIL Tweet Comments 2 McDonald’s vowed to serve sustainable beef in its stores by 2016. Find out about the fast food giant’s pilot project and what “sustainability” is going to mean for producers moving forward. Related Media 60 Photos Of Our Favorite Little Ranchers In Action 60+ Stunning Photos That Showcase Ranch Work Ethics 70 photos of hard-working beef producers What does sustainability mean really? It depends on who you ask. A beef producer might define sustainability as being able to make a living and support his family. He might also view it from the perspective of the land and the steps he makes toward caring for that land, which will ultimately become his legacy to pass on to future generations. A consumer might place different values on sustainability depending on his priorities. The hipster on the coast might think of sustainability as reverting back to the romantic farms of yesteryear. Another might think of animal welfare when they think of the word sustainability. And another might think about the feed given to the animals, the antibiotics used and the way the beef was raised to get to her dinner table. Sustainability and the meaning of that hotly-debated word all depend on the values of who you talk to; however, are we getting closer to a true definition? READ: Contemplating the many sides of sustainability Retailers are a business, just like ranchers, and so sustainability means listening to their customers and meeting their demands. McDonald’s is one of those retailers that has heard the buzzword “sustainability” and has taken actionable measures to define it and serve their customer base. In 2014, the burger giant promised to serve sustainable beef in its stores by 2016. Two years have passed, and we are seeing McDonald’s vow turn into reality, at least in Canada. READ: McDonald's & Walmart demand sustainable beef According to Krissa Welshans for Feedstuffs, “McDonald’s recently announced that it successfully achieved a commitment it made in 2014 to source a portion of its beef from verified sustainable sources by 2016, marking a major milestone in its collaborative partnership with the Canadian beef industry to advance more sustainable beef practices and support the global company’s broader aspirational goal to source all of its food and packaging sustainably. “As one of the country’s largest purchasers of Canadian beef, McDonald’s Canada, through the pilot, tracked the journey of nearly 9,000 head of Canadian cattle, or the equivalent of 2.4 million patties. The cattle spent their entire lives — from "birth to burger" — raised on or handled by verified sustainable operations. Over the duration of the project, 121 cow/calf operations, 34 backgrounders, 24 feedlots, two packers and one patty plant achieved verified status.”  READ: McDonald’s concludes sustainable beef pilot project So what do we know about McDonald’s definition of sustainable beef? McDonald’s is the first pilot project to follow the Global Sustainable Beef principles to fruition, and the criteria outlined address “environmental responsibility, animal health, food safety, worker safety, community responsibility and innovation,” according to Welshans. Despite the fact that the U.S. has the most environmentally friendly livestock industry in the world, the consumer is demanding more. And although McDonald’s asked for producer help in defining exactly what sustainability means, I fear that modern agriculture is losing ground in defining and explaining the ways we are already sustainably raising beef to provide to the world. It’s not too late for us to join in on the conversation; however, times are changing whether we like it or not. We better brace ourselves for a new world where the consumer drives production methods to unchartered territories. Like it or not, consumers determine our success or failure; we can either choose to be a part of the conversation, or we can be left in the dust.

Washington state. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) The Washington Post - The Obama administration on Tuesday finalized new fuel-economy standards for large trucks, buses and other heavy-duty vehicles, the latest in a series of efforts aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions and weaning the nation from its dependence on fossil fuels. The new requirements affect a class of vehicles that includes school buses, large pickup trucks, delivery and passenger vans, garbage trucks and long-haul tractor-trailers. These heavy- and medium-duty vehicles represent only about 5 percent of total highway traffic but account for 20 percent of transportation-related fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Administration officials said they expect that when the new standards are fully implemented in coming years, they will cut more than 1 billion tons of carbon pollution from the atmosphere, save nearly $170 billion in fuel costs and reduce oil consumption by an estimated 84 billion gallons. “The standards promote a new generation of cleaner, more fuel-efficient trucks by encouraging the development and employment of new and advanced cost-effective technologies through model year 2027,” said Gina McCarthy, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, which developed the new rules in conjunction with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “These standards are ambitious and achievable, and they will help ensure the American trucking industry continues to drive our economy – and at the same time protect our planet.” The White House previously has undertaken efforts to curb pollution from cars and light trucks, aircraft, power plants and air conditioning and refrigeration units, in an effort to meet pledges to reduce overall emissions in the United States by at least 26 percent by the year 2030, compared with 2005 levels. During his first term, President Barack Obama also put in place the first national policy to increase the fuel economy of medium- and heavy-duty trucks with model years between 2014 and 2018. Tuesday’s regulations build on those early measures. Unlike some past regulations, the new fuel-efficiency rules for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles have largely been embraced by the trucking industry as a way to cut fuel costs and bolster bottom lines. Leaders from a broad range companies that rely on trucking, including Walmart, Pepsi, Waste Management and FedEx, have endorsed the effort. “It’s a place where you really have interests aligned. … It’s good for business, it’s good the for the environment, it’s good for our economy overall,” Brian Mormino, executive director of environmental strategy and compliance at Cummins Inc., the world’s largest manufacturer of engines for heavy-duty vehicles, said in an interview from China. He said fuel costs are a top expense for many companies, and they welcome any opportunity to become more efficient. “Regardless of whether oil prices are down, that focus on fuel savings is still important.” The new demands for fuel efficiency are likely to lead to more expense vehicles – as much as $14,000 more for a large truck, according to the agency – but lower fuel costs could offset the higher sticker costs in a couple of years, officials said. The measure also requires manufacturers to use lighter-weight materials and more aerodynamic designs to improve the fuel economy of trailers. Administration officials also suggested that the new regulations might eventually help the pocketbooks of ordinary Americans. “This is going to be a net savings to operators of these heavy duty and medium-size trucks. They are going to be able to get places using less fuel, which has a bottom-line impact on the cost of goods, for example, or the price people pay at grocery stores,” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters Tuesday. “So I think this is a very strong economic rule, from the standpoint of job creation and from the standpoint of reducing burden on consumers.” Environmental groups were quick on Tuesday to praise the tighter fuel requirements. “For a long time, an efficiency gap has forced consumers to pay the freight for inefficient shipping,” Jack Gillis, a vehicle expert for the Consumer Federation of America, said in a statement. “These standards will save consumers money, just as other energy efficiency goals have saved families and businesses money on cars, light-duty trucks, and home appliances such as refrigerators and water heaters.” Jason Mathers, director of supply chain at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the rigorous new standards will make the American freight industry much cleaner, while generating new jobs and saving average Americans money. The organization calculates that the average semi-truck today burns 20,000 gallons of diesel fuel each year, roughly equivalent to the amount of fuel used by 50 new passenger cars. Fuel has long been the largest single cost for trucking fleets in the United States, accounting for almost 40 percent of the cost of ownership in 2013, the group said. In addition, officials said Tuesday that the Department of Energy is investing nearly $140 million to improve vehicle efficiency, including projects to develop the next generation of fuel-efficient truck technologies. President Obama on Saturday previewed the released of the new fuel-efficiency standards in his weekly address, and he signaled that the administration plans to roll out more environmental policies before he leaves office in January. In the weeks and months ahead, he said, “we’ll take steps to meet the goal we set with Canada and Mexico to achieve 50 percent clean power across North America by 2025. And we’ll continue to protect our lands and waters so that our kids and grandkids can enjoy our most beautiful spaces for generations.” Filed under: Bus, Environment, Gas Print Email Gmail Related EPA Proposes Huge Carbon-Emission Cuts for Heavy Trucks Obama Wants More Fuel-Efficient Trucks on US Roads UPS Buying 285 Natural-Gas Trucks for Deliveries New Furnace Efficiency Standards Withdrawn Ram Contends Leadership With Heavy-Duty Pickup Capability Subscribe to the Hamodia print edition More in National Trump Taps Charter-School Backer DeVos as Secretary of Education University Cop Shot in Detroit, Not Believed to Be Ambush Court Blocks Federal Plan to Extend Overtime Pay to Many Airline Seeks Court Order to End Cargo Pilot Strike Father of Injured Pipeline Protester Says She May Lose Arm OP-ED Parties Don’t Matter.

Elliott Ravert, 18, of Narvon, is accused of forcing two Philhaven nurses at gunpoint to unlock the ward where Alicia Buzzard, 21, was undergoing care in West Cornwall Township, Lebanon County. 'A fierce wolf': Facebook page offers insight on mindset of man who took woman from hospital at gunpoint Buzzard's mother, Jacqui Shay, told LancasterOnline that her daughter is bipolar and has other mental health issues, and that the family was trying to break off the relationship between the two. They were arrested after being accused of shoplifting at a Walmart store Aug. 12 in Myrtle Beach, S.C., police there said. They are being held in J. Reuben Long Detention Center on the shoplifting charge, police said, and have not posted bail. Ravert is also held on the warrant issued by Cornwall police in connection with the Philhaven incident. He is charged with robbery, aggravated assault and terroristic threats. Myrtle Beach police say Ravert and Buzzard may be staying in South Carolina until their court date Aug. 23 on the shoplifting charge. Cornwall Police Chief Bruce Harris said his department is planning to bring Ravert back next week. He said he is not sure when Buzzard will return to Pennsylvania, but said police are not planning to do so, since so far no charges have been filed against her. "It appears she went of her own accord," Harris said, but added the investigation continues. Cornwall police said Ravert went to Philhaven with a gun at 6:30 p.m. Aug. 9. He demanded to know where Buzzard was, and ordered two nurses at gunpoint to unlock the ward, and took one of their radios so they couldn't immediately call for help, Chief Harris said. Harris said he believes the hospital staff reacted appropriately. "For them to have a person come in and say 'Unlock the door or I'm going to shoot you,' they did the best they could," Harris said. Buzzard, who is from Heidelberg Township, reportedly met Ravert while they were attending an Intermediate Unit 13 school in Manheim, her mother has said. Ravert is a 2016 graduate of Pequea Valley High School. In the wake of the incident, Philhaven has brought in additional personnel from Wellspan to supplement security on the campus, said Brett Marcy, spokesman for Wellspan, which includes Philhaven. Security protocols are also being enhanced, he said. "This incident is exceedingly rare. We haven't had an incident that comes anywhere close to this scale in over 30 years," Marcy said. Philhaven already had "an enhanced level of security, which includes trained and certified security personnel," he said, adding that Cornwall police increased its patrols around the facility in the last week.

Subscribe Home News Baton Rouge residents take stock of their losses Story Comments Print Create a hardcopy of this page Font Size: Default font size Larger font size Posted: Tuesday, August 16, 2016 12:00 pm Baton Rouge residents take stock of their losses By The Washington Post SentinelSource.com Posted on Aug 16, 2016 by Susan Reing BATON ROUGE, La. — People here are used to storms destroying property and upending lives, but those storms are often accompanied by stern cautions and a sense that disruption is on the way. The most recent storm was something different: Rain that just kept coming, until the water blindsided everyone with its volume and its violence. “With a hurricane they kind of warn you. But this, they didn’t warn you,” said Jayda Guidry, who fled her home Sunday before dawn, when her neighbor alerted her to the rising water. “We just thought it was raining.” After four days of rain and flooding, the damage is staggering: Seven people have been killed, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, a death toll that is expected to rise. More than 10,000 people are staying in emergency shelters. More than 20,000 have been displaced. More than 36,000 have registered for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, officials said. President Obama on Sunday declared this flood a major disaster, opening up federal funding to help with home repairs, losses and other damages. This declaration named four parishes — East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St. Helena and Tangipahoa — and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he expected that more parishes would be “added to the declaration on a rolling basis.” The floodwaters have shuttered businesses, schools and government offices in and around Baton Rouge, a city already reeling after a brutal summer. In July, a police officer fatally shot a black man outside a convenience store, sparking tense protests. Not long after, a gunman shot and killed three police officers on the city’s streets. Shelters have been opened across Louisiana. Government offices in more than two dozen parishes across the state were closed again today, officials said. Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge closed its campus on Monday and canceled freshman orientation for new students, but school officials said they would partially reopen the campus today for some activities. Late Monday night, the Louisiana State Police said that Interstate 12 — which had been flooded, requiring troopers to rescue stranded drivers — had fully reopened in both directions between Baton Rouge and the Mississippi state line. After the flooding, it’s not clear how long it might be before things feel normal again. Guidry, in Baton Rouge, said she lost her job at Wal-Mart last week. And now she is worried about what else she might lose. She’s behind on bills. Her husband has a good job at an oil refinery, but his employer has warned that he must show up to work today. The clothes he needs are at home, and retrieving them means taking the risk of becoming stranded out in the flooded streets. Even if they manage to make their way home, they might find nothing but destruction. “I’m just lost. I don’t know what to do,” said Guidry, 48, sitting on a folding chair outside a gymnasium converted into an emergency shelter in Ascension Parish, southeast of Baton Rouge. “I feel like I’m going to have a heart attack.” In some places, the water has receded, leaving a coating of mud and cars parked haphazardly wherever their owners managed to leave them, on median strips and even in the middle of moving traffic lanes. Cleanup has begun in some neighborhoods as residents drag sodden furniture out to the curb. Elsewhere, the water is more stubborn. A half-built apartment building is now half-submerged. In the parking lot of an Albertson’s grocery store, aluminum skiffs float next to swamped cars. Barely visible tops of stop signs hint that what now appears to be a river is actually a street. Inside the emergency shelter in Ascension Parish, evacuees say they are being well cared for as they await whatever comes next. There is plenty of water, food, first aid and donated clothes, plus toys for the kids and generous air conditioning to stave off the August heat. But no one has much more than a few bags of belongings, hastily gathered on the way out the door. Everyone has a story of escape, and amid the rows of Red Cross cots, everyone has a story of what they’ve left behind. Ed Martin, 69, lives in Prairieville on a property that backs up to Bayou Manchac. He woke up in four inches of water on Sunday. By lunchtime, it was thigh-high and still rising fast, and when the National Guard arrived to help, he agreed it was time to go. Martin figures he’s lost both his home and his vehicles, a conversion van and a 1980 El Camino. He recalled his calculations over the cost of flood insurance and his decision not to buy it. “Too late now,” he said. He shrugs. “I just bought a brand new 70-inch TV. Watched it twice,” he said. “What am I going to do about it? I’m not God, and I’m not the weatherman.” Bethany and Ben Ash left home Friday with their two young children. They, too, are trying to get used to the idea that their only remaining possessions might be the few things they stuffed into their car: a few T-shirts and pairs of shorts, a computer and iPad and phones, some books and toy dinosaurs and a carton of milk — and their two dogs: a chihuahua and a dachshund. “There’s this thought in my mind, we just need essentials. We’ll be back in a couple of days,” Bethany Ash said. Hours after they left, she watched a television news reporter interview a man who had swum down their street in chest-deep water. The last update she got on her house was that a family member had seen her neighborhood on the news. “All you could see was rooftops,” she said. Ash said she has put her faith in God and is relying on a network of family that is already organizing replacement clothes and toys for the family. “It’s just stuff; we can replace all of that,” she said. “The important thing to us is that we were safe, the boys were safe.” The flooding isn’t finished yet. As the water moves south and east of Baton Rouge, officials expect rivers to continue inundating communities in Ascension Parish and elsewhere. Guidry, the laid-off Wal-Mart worker, had seen roads become rivers early Sunday morning as she and her family drove from their home in the Sherwood Forest section of Baton Rouge to the shelter in Gonzales. Since then, there had been nothing to do except eat, sleep, worry and wait. She decided she could not wait any longer. She had seen video clips of muddy brown water rising over the lawns in her neighborhood. She needed to know what had happened to her house, and her husband needed to go to work. They set off Monday evening from the shelter, traveling north in a two-car caravan with Guidry’s son and daughter and granddaughter, a cousin and friends. “I’m going home to see if I have a home,” Guidry said. The 20-mile trip took longer than two hours. Airline Highway, one of the few open arteries into the city, was backed up for miles. In halting traffic, Guidry and her family inched through the patchwork of wet and dry land, leaving behind one stretch of brightly lit strip malls for a flood zone where the power was out and shimmering water crept up toward the road. Mud coated streets on the way into their neighborhood and two cars were left abandoned at an intersection, cocked at odd angles. A block from their house, two people walked in the street, dragging bulging plastic bags. But Guidry’s street was dry. Her neighbors’ lights were on. And when she opened the door to her house, she found it just as she had left it. In the living room, a U-shaped couch faced a large flat-screen television. On the wall, a certificate hailed her 15 years of work at Wal-Mart. “It looks fine,” she said, smiling and crediting God with her good fortune. “I ain’t worried no more.” Discuss Print Posted in News on Tuesday, August 16, 2016 12:00 pm.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Brady Dennis August 16 Follow @brady_dennis Traffic slows on Interstate 5 in California. (Nick Ut/Associated Press) The Obama administration on Tuesday finalized new fuel-economy standards for large trucks, buses and other heavy-duty vehicles, the latest in a series of efforts aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions and weaning the nation from its dependence on fossil fuels. The new requirements affect a class of vehicles that includes school buses, large pickups, delivery and passenger vans, garbage trucks and long-haul tractor-trailers. These heavy- and medium-duty vehicles represent only about 5 percent of total highway traffic but account for 20 percent of transportation-related fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Administration officials said they expect that when the new standards are fully implemented in coming years, they will cut more than 1 billion tons of carbon pollution from the atmosphere, save nearly $170 billion in fuel costs and reduce oil consumption by an estimated 84 billion gallons. “The standards promote a new generation of cleaner, more fuel-efficient trucks by encouraging the development and employment of new and advanced cost-effective technologies through model year 2027,” said Gina McCarthy, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, which developed the new rules in conjunction with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “These standards are ambitious and achievable, and they will help ensure the American trucking industry continues to drive our economy — and at the same time protect our planet.” 1 of 18 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Humans’ staggering effect on Earth View Photos Images of consumption are the theme of the book, “Overdevelopment, Overpopulation, Overshoot.” It addresses environmental deterioration through subjects including materialism, consumption, pollution, fossil fuels and carbon footprints.

LINK: The book Pablo Lopez Luz Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The White House previously has undertaken efforts to curb pollution from cars and light trucks, aircraft, power plants and air conditioning and refrigeration units, in an effort to meet pledges to reduce overall emissions in the United States by at least 26 percent by the year 2030, compared with 2005 levels. During his first term, President Obama also put in place the first national policy to increase the fuel economy of medium- and heavy-duty trucks with model years between 2014 and 2018. Tuesday’s regulations mandate that heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans must become 2.5 percent more efficient each year between 2021 and 2027. Regulators will require other vehicles, such as tractor-trailers, deliver trucks and school buses, to have 25 percent lower carbon emissions and fuel consumption compared to existing standards. Diesel engines also will have to become more efficient. Unlike some past regulations, the new fuel-efficiency rules for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles have largely been embraced by the trucking industry as a way to cut fuel costs and bolster bottom lines. Leaders from companies that rely on trucking, including Walmart, Pepsi, Waste Management and FedEx, have endorsed the effort. “It’s a place where you really have interests aligned. … It’s good for business; it’s good for the environment; it’s good for our economy overall,” Brian Mormino, executive director of environmental strategy and compliance at Cummins Inc., the world’s largest manufacturer of engines for heavy-duty vehicles, said in an interview from China. He said that fuel costs are a top expense for many companies and that they welcome an opportunity to become more efficient. “Regardless of whether oil prices are down, that focus on fuel savings is still important.” The new fuel-efficiency standards are likely to lead to more expense vehicles — as much as $14,000 more for a large truck, according to the agency — but lower fuel costs could offset the higher sticker costs in a couple of years, officials said. The measure also requires manufacturers to use lighter-weight materials and more aerodynamic designs to improve tractor-trailers’ fuel economy. In addition, officials said Tuesday that the Department of Energy is investing nearly $140 million to improve vehicle efficiency, including projects to develop the next generation of fuel-efficient truck technologies. Administration officials also suggested that the new regulations might eventually help the pocketbooks of ordinary Americans. “This is going to be a net savings to operators of these heavy duty and medium-size trucks. They are going to be able to get places using less fuel, which has a bottom-line impact on the cost of goods, for example, or the price people pay at grocery stores,” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters Tuesday. “So I think this is a very strong economic rule, from the standpoint of job creation and from the standpoint of reducing burden on consumers.” Environmental and consumer groups were quick on Tuesday to praise the tighter fuel requirements. “For a long time, an efficiency gap has forced consumers to pay the freight for inefficient shipping,” Jack Gillis, a vehicle expert for the Consumer Federation of America, said in a statement. “These standards will save consumers money, just as other energy efficiency goals have saved families and businesses money on cars, light-duty trucks, and home appliances such as refrigerators and water heaters.” Jason Mathers, director of supply chain at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the rigorous new standards will make the American freight industry much cleaner, while generating new jobs and saving average Americans money. The organization calculates that the average semi-truck burns 20,000 gallons of diesel fuel each year, roughly equivalent to the amount of fuel used by 50 new passenger cars. Fuel has long been the largest cost for trucking fleets in the United States, accounting for almost 40 percent of the cost of ownership in 2013, the group said. Still, skepticism remains. American Truck Dealers, a division of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said Tuesday that while it has yet to fully analyze the final rules, “dealers are concerned with the possibility that compliance will prove too complex or expensive for the market (dealer customers) to accept without disruption.” Anna Moritz, a staff attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, said federal regulators didn’t go far enough. “Addressing truck pollution is urgent, but the Obama administration didn’t create fuel-economy standards strong enough to truly curtail this threat to our climate,” Moritz said in a statement. “Federal officials sacrificed a golden opportunity to push this heavily polluting industry toward true technological innovation. Demonstration trucks on the road today achieve better fuel economy than these standards will require a decade from now.” Obama on Saturday previewed the released of the new fuel-efficiency standards in his weekly address, and he signaled that the administration plans to roll out more environmental policies before he leaves office in January. In the weeks and months ahead, he said, “we’ll take steps to meet the goal we set with Canada and Mexico to achieve 50 percent clean power across North America by 2025.  And we’ll continue to protect our lands and waters so that our kids and grandkids can enjoy our most beautiful spaces for generations.” Read more at Energy & Environment: White House takes aim at a fast-growing source of emissions: airplanes Researchers find unsafe levels of industrial chemicals in drinking water of 6 million Americans The world is about to install 700 million air conditioners.

First up, iOttie’s One Touch 2 universal dash mount is marked down to $13, matching an all-time low. The original One Touch won a Kinja Co-op a few years back, and the sequel added a longer telescoping arm, as well as a bigger cradle for today’s skateboard-sized phones. $20 iOttie Easy One Touch 2 Car Mount Holder for iPhone 6s Plus 6s… From amazon 16303 purchased by readers Gizmodo Media Group may get a commission Buy now And if you’ve got $36 to spare, and hate plugging and unplugging a power cord every time you get in the car, the iOttie One Touch Wireless is also marked down to an all-time low price today.

Lenoir Police Chief Scott Brown says his officers "were heroes today." Those four officers were placed on administrative leave after a confrontation with a man ended in an exchange of gunfire and the suspect being killed. It started just after 8 a.m. when employees at the Walmart in Lenoir called police to investigate suspicious activity that may have involved a break-in. When officers arrived, they confronted a man and a woman inside the store and, after asking a few questions, took them into custody.  "I saw a man and woman being handcuffed," said Shaun Helton, who was inside waiting for the pharmacy to open.  That's when police said a third person, later identified as Carl Nivens, had a confrontation with an officer and started running.  Chief Brown said Nivens pulled out a handgun and fired a shot at the officers. Another officer at the front door tried to grab Nivens and started wrestling with him. At that point, another officer fired a shot that hit Nivens.  Medical crews came within minutes, but Nivens died at the scene. Brown said surveillance cameras at the store and body cams on the officers confirm what witnesses and the officers said happened.  "They acted properly, they did what they had to do under the circumstances," said Brown.  The State Bureau of Investigation is handling the case for now. District Attorney David Learner came to the scene to learn more about what happened. He will await a report from the SBI before making any determinations.  Investigators were collecting evidence inside and outside the store for hours, including shell casings and the handgun believed to be the one used by Nivens.  The man and woman who were detained were identified as Natasha Stanley and Jose Flores. Both were arrested on outstanding warrants from Burke County on unrelated charges. With the investigation into Tuesday's incident continuing, officials do expect more charges against the pair. Nivens has been convicted of several charges in recent years, including an assault by strangulation and various other crimes. Brown said it is lucky that the shot fired by Nivens did not hit anyone. The bullet went through a wall in the store and into the game room where several electronic arcade-style games are located. The bullet shattered the glass on one machine but no one was inside the arcade when it happened. The Chief did not know how long the investigation would take place and while the loss of any life, he said, is something no one wanted, "I am as thankful for the safety of the officers as I have ever been in my career, and I've been doing this for 30 years."

For 14 years, Murra convinced two women that she was “the voice of God” — even making them listen to recordings of her reading Bible verses as they cleaned houses, sometimes seven days a week, court documents said. If they didn’t do as she said, Murra convinced the women, they would spend eternity in hell. Last week, a jury convicted Murra, 64, of two counts of forced labor and two counts of “harboring an illegal alien,” according to a news release from the US Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The crimes were committed in Fort Worth and El Paso. When she is sentenced in November, Murra faces 20 years in federal prison for each labor charge and 10 years apiece for the harboring convictions, according to ICE. Olga Murra, 64, was convicted of forcing 2 Mexican women to work w/out pay for several years https://t.co/f7lC4MCHzb pic.twitter.com/epAIGUrlBR — Deanna Boyd (@deannaboyd) August 8, 2016 Murra made the women sleep on the floor and ask permission to use the bathroom, court documents say. They could only talk to Murra — not anyone else in the homes where they lived. She only fed them bread and water. One woman told the FBI that Murra would hit her. Another said she was allowed to sleep on the floor of a bedroom — but if either woman misbehaved, they were forced to sleep in the garage or the backyard. Almost every day, they worked. The women cleaned “on average, three or four homes a day,” according to court documents. They also cleaned Murra’s house and prepared her meals. All the while, the women were turning their money over to Murra from cleaning houses. Murra also made them get jobs at McDonald’s and Walmart using forged documents, according to court papers. Murra was born in the United States, but lived in Mexico from shortly after her birth until September 1997, when she moved to Texas — first El Paso, then Fort Worth. She operated cleaning businesses in both cities, ICE said. When Murra returned to the United States, she brought a 33-year-old Mexican woman with her. A year later, she arranged for another woman, who was 21, to come to the United States, according to ICE. The women would be her slaves for the next 14 years and endured a steady stream of abuse and indoctrination. According to the indictment: [Murra] represented herself to (the victim) as the voice of God on earth, and caused (the victim) to believe (the victim) would go to hell if she did not obey the defendant. Approximately once or twice a week, the defendant required I.G. to attend religious instruction in the residence, during which the defendant preached for two to three hours. Additionally, the defendant required (the victim) to listen to religious recordings when she cleaned homes, which consisted of the defendant reading Bible verses and discussing their meaning. Murra threatened at least one of the women that if she disobeyed her, she would contact immigration and the woman would be buried in a field with other illegal aliens. The United Nations Polaris Project, which tracks human trafficking, estimates there are 20.9 million people across the globe are slaves, trapped in jobs they cannot leave. That’s about three of every 1,000 people in the workforce. Women make up 55 percent of the trafficked, according to the project: Although slavery is commonly thought to be a thing of the past, human traffickers generate hundreds of billions of dollars in profits by trapping millions of people in horrific situations around the world, including here in the US. Traffickers use violence, threats, deception, debt bondage, and other manipulative tactics to force people to engage in commercial sex or to provide labor or services against their will. Homeland Security agents investigated Murra’s case, but it’s unclear how the slaves came to the attention of authorities.

Cassidy Swanson Assignment Editor/Digital Producer KEENE, N.H. — A Keene police officer broke a car window last month to retrieve what he thought was a baby locked inside, only to find it was a lifelike doll. Advertisement Lt. Jason Short was dispatched July 23 to Walmart for a report of a baby in a locked car. It was very hot that day and as soon as Short saw what he thought were a baby’s feet poking out from under a blanket in a car seat, he smashed the window. Short pulled the blanket away and saw what he thought was a dead child. He lifted the baby out and breathed into its mouth, but its lungs did not inflate. A nurse told Short it was a doll. Short saw that the mouth did not open and it had no ear canals, so he concluded it was a doll and canceled a call for an ambulance. Short said the doll’s owner told him it was designed to be as realistic as possible, and that it looked and felt like a real baby. Short would not comment on whether the police have paid to fix the car window. Loading more articles...

Where they’re doing best might surprise you. Steven Malanga Summer 2016 Economy, finance, and budgets It’s been a rough recovery for American labor. In the aftermath of the 2007 financial meltdown and the deep recession that followed it, unions have bled more than 1.3 million members. Sharp declines in construction, manufacturing, and transportation jobs have battered private labor; tax shortfalls and high costs have led state and local governments to pare budgets, and hence public-union jobs. Meantime, unions face growing public resentment. Four states in recent years have adopted right-to-work policies, which let workers opt out of joining unions. Polls show that the public is increasingly questioning the efforts of labor groups and the economic toll they impose. Government unions may have dodged a bullet in late March, when an evenly divided Supreme Court refused to overturn state laws that allow obligatory worker fees, but unions have recently lost other key court cases, undermining their ability to organize. The Great Recession and the underwhelming Obama recovery have, in other words, reshaped the map of labor in the United States. Private unions began to rally somewhat in 2012 but thus far have regained only 42 percent of the members they lost. A disproportionate share of that rebound, moreover, has occurred in right-to-work states—not because these states are welcoming labor environments but because they’ve done better economically than union-friendly states. Public unions have yet to boost their rolls, six years after the recession ended. It was commonly observed, after 2009, that government unions had grown larger in membership than private ones—but this advantage proved short-lived. Three years ago, private unions regained their old lead. Unions typically lose members in recessions. But years into an economic recovery, the striking decline in government-union membership and the limited recovery of private unions bode poorly for the labor movement. And with America perhaps facing another economic slowdown, things could soon get worse for unions. America lost about 8.7 million private-sector jobs by the nadir of the economic downturn that began in late 2007 and continued until mid-2009. Private-sector union membership began dropping in late 2007, too, but it kept on falling for another two years after the recession ended. By the time membership started rising again, in 2012, private unions had shed 15 percent of their membership, or 1.2 million people. Since then, though the nation has regained all the jobs lost in the recession and added 5 million more, private labor unions remain 700,000 members short of their 2008 enrollment, according to unionstats.com. The unions’ most significant shrinkage has come in strong labor states. Of the 28 states at the start of the recession deemed union-friendly—that is, they had laws that compelled workers in unionized businesses to pay dues or fees to the union—all but six have fewer private-sector labor jobs today than they did in 2008. California has led the negative trend, with a staggering 181,305-member decline in private unions as of the end of 2015. New Jersey’s private-union rolls have fallen 79,840, Pennsylvania’s have slumped 71,801, and Illinois’s are down 69,614. The massive losses in these states more than offset labor’s one bright spot: 141,000 new union jobs in New York. In total, the compulsory-unionization states have accounted for approximately 675,000 of lost private-sector union jobs. True, three of these states have recently turned right-to-work, ending mandatory union dues, but two—Indiana and Michigan—sustained all their private-union losses while labor-friendly laws remained in place. Only in Wisconsin did union losses pile up after right-to-work went into effect, which happened last year. Private-unionization rates in pro-labor states plummeted. In Missouri, for example, unionization has fallen from 9.3 percent of private workers to 6.6 percent since 2008, while in California it dropped from 10.7 percent to 8.7 percent. States with laws less friendly to unions, ironically, have been better for union jobs. Thirteen of the 22 states that were right-to-work in 2008 have more private-union jobs today. The biggest gainers include Florida (up 81,174), Texas (31,456), Virginia (16,313), and Louisiana (13,070). Most of these states have low levels of union penetration, however, and the gains have altered that fact only slightly. In Texas, just 2.5 percent of private-sector workers are unionized, the same level as in 2008, all the new jobs notwithstanding. Nebraska, Mississippi, and Georgia saw their unionization rates climb just 0.03 percentage points or less since 2008, despite union membership increases in each state; labor groups still enroll less than 5 percent of private workers in the three states. The unionization rate in Florida did rise by a full percentage point, but even with that rise, only 3.3 percent of the state’s private workforce belongs to unions, well below the national average of 6.7 percent. Some of the recent rebound in private-union employment in right-to-work states owes to job growth. States that began 2008 with right-to-work laws have 41 percent of America’s population but have generated 60 percent of the nation’s new private-sector employment above the prerecession employment peak. And right-to-work states have added more blue-collar work, while the jobs being added in union-friendly states have largely been in industries not heavily unionized, like high technology in California. Since 2010, when manufacturing job losses bottomed out, the sector has regained 821,000 of the 2.3 million jobs lost during the downturn, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics; nearly seven in ten of those positions have been in right-to-work states, including Florida, Georgia, and Texas. One consequence is that manufacturing unions in these states have rebuilt their memberships more successfully than their counterparts in compulsory-unionization states. In the face of this evidence, labor unions have nonetheless blamed antiunion forces for their misfortune. “We recognize . . . that right-wing billionaires’ extremist policies, a rapacious Wall Street and insufficient advocacy from political leaders thwarted further progress,” AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka said in early 2015 about the slow recovery of union rolls. The union’s membership, which had peaked at 13.7 million in 2005, was 12.5 million at the end of last year. To speak of any recovery of private-union membership is somewhat misleading, since nongovernment labor positions created over the last few years are mostly in industries that didn’t lose employment during the recession—indeed, in industries not traditionally associated with labor. Health care, professional and technical services, and real-estate leasing and services have all seen expansion in unionized jobs and, with the exception of health care, an increase in the percentage of workers unionized, too, though from single-digit levels. These industries typically share two characteristics that help unions. First, they involve service work that isn’t easily outsourced overseas. Second, in many instances, the work is connected to government, either through direct funding or through heavy regulation, which makes employers more likely to cooperate with unionization efforts, so as to build lobbying alliances for favorable government treatment. Organizing campaigns for health-care workers in California illustrate how this process works. In 2003, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) launched a drive to unionize private nursing homes, many of which had patients with bills that state Medicaid programs were paying. The union made a pact with the owners of 42 nursing homes, telling them that it would push the state legislature for more funding if the owners didn’t try to block their unionization drive. The SEIU won thousands of new members, and the alliance subsequently gained $2 billion in extra Medicaid reimbursements for nursing homes over a two-year period. Health-care unions have also turned to friendly politicians to help boost enrollment. In several states, Democratic governors have signed executive orders designating government-paid, home health-care workers as state workers, not independent contractors, as they’d previously been categorized. This allows unions to organize those workers into bargaining units, which isn’t possible with independent contractors. In Illinois, for example, Governors Rod Blagojevich and Pat Quinn enacted a series of such orders, resulting in the local SEIU unit signing up roughly 24,000 home health-care-worker members. The organizing drive and election proved controversial, however; many of the workers later said that they knew nothing about these efforts. Home health care has been among the fastest-growing areas of unionization, with 111,000 workers now in unions around the country—a 44 percent increase since 2008. But labor’s new strategy may be only so effective. In June 2014, the Supreme Court overturned the Illinois directives after several workers sued the state, arguing that they weren’t really state employees—because they were hired and fired by those they worked for, not by Illinois. Since the Court’s decision, the Washington Times has reported, at least 8,000 dues-paying Illinois home health-care workers have left the union. Unions that represent grocery stores have lost 103,000 workers, a decline of 20 percent, since 2008. Other major organizing campaigns have also faltered in the post-2008 recovery. Over the last several years, unions have targeted fast-food workers with a highly visible “Fast Food Forward” drive, featuring rallies and sporadic strikes. The campaign’s impact has been nominal, at best. Though union rolls in restaurants rose by 13 percent, or 15,000 members, since 2008, that’s a small chunk of the more than 600,000 new jobs generated by fast-food and other limited-service restaurants over that period. Fast food’s unionization rate, meantime, remains a mere 1.6 percent. So far, the campaign’s failure mirrors unions’ other recent flubs—most notably, the ten-year-plus push to organize Wal-Mart and other discount stores, which has yielded few victories. Indeed, retailing unions, which 30 years ago claimed some 1.25 million organized workers, have yet to regain the jobs lost from the latest downturn. Unions now count only slightly more than 750,000 retail members. More worrying still for labor, retailing’s most unionized sector—supermarkets and grocery stores—continues to shed members rapidly. Unions that represent grocery stores have lost 103,000 workers, a decline of 20 percent, since 2008; the unionization rate shrank to 15.5 percent from 20.6 percent, as the spread of nonunionized food stores—from high-end Whole Foods, which has vigorously resisted organizing efforts, to Wal-Mart super-grocery centers—has eaten into the business of unionized chains. Trumka is right about one thing: unions haven’t won many friends in recent years. Since 2012, four states—Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and, most recently, West Virginia—have adopted right-to-work laws. The surge began when Indiana governor Mitch Daniels, in the last year of his second term, responded to pressure from members of the Republican-controlled state legislature to sign a right-to-work bill. Daniels had shown little interest in passing such a law during most of his tenure, but he has admitted that it sparked renewed business interest in the state: “I may have underestimated the impact,” Daniels said. “We have had a flood of calls and inquiries, starting literally the day I signed the bill.” Michigan quickly followed suit, and then Wisconsin in 2015. In early 2016, West Virginia’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a right-to-work law over Governor Earl Ray Tomblin’s veto. In general, employees’ freedom in right-to-work states to opt out of union membership restrains labor’s growth; right-to-work states have, on average, only about a 4 percent rate of unionization in the private sector, compared with 9 percent in compulsory-unionization states. The rapid addition of new right-to-work states since 2012—it had taken a half-century for the previous group of four states (Wyoming, Louisiana, Idaho, and Oklahoma) to adopt the policy—reflects changing attitudes toward unions. A 2014 Gallup poll found that 53 percent of Americans approved of unions—down from about 70 percent in the late 1960s. More significantly, 71 percent also supported giving workers a choice of whether to join a union, something that unions themselves fight against vigorously. “Americans . . . are clearly less supportive of labor unions, and somewhat more supportive of right-to-work laws, than in the past,” Gallup’s Jeffrey Jones said. Union members might also begin wondering whether labor leaders are their own worst enemies. One of the movement’s biggest campaigns these days, for instance, is to get states and the federal government to hike up the minimum wage. Successful efforts in 12 states in 2014 and 2015 are raising rates—in some cases, dramatically. California and New York enacted laws that will eventually move their minimum wages to $15 an hour. Unions argue that a higher minimum wage helps lift workers out of poverty, but research shows that it also destroys jobs or drives them to less expensive environments. Writing recently in the Wall Street Journal, the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants, Andy Puzder, described growing automation in his business and attributed it to the rising price of employing workers: “Dramatic increases in labor costs have a significant effect on the restaurant industry, where profit margins are pennies on the dollar and labor makes up about a third of total expenses,” he explained. Shortly after California governor Jerry Brown signed the state’s latest minimum-wage boost, Los Angeles–based American Apparel said that it might relocate 500 jobs—not overseas but to another state. Apparel manufacturing has lost 71,000 jobs in California in the last 25 years, a 60 percent decline, and American Apparel was one of the few major employers still in the state. And from the looks of things, union jobs are particularly at risk. The 28 states that since 2008 have raised their minimum wages faster than the federal wage floor increased have borne the vast majority of private-union job losses—560,000 in total. That’s more than three times the losses in states where the minimum wage rose merely at the federal rate, a boost of 70 cents per hour over that time period. As tough as the post-2008 period has been for private unions, their public-sector counterparts have had it even worse. State and local budgets have remained under intense pressure since the recession, as tax revenues have grown only haltingly and government costs—especially employee costs—have risen fast, producing a near-continuous squeeze on finances. In response, state and local governments have slashed about 700,000 jobs. Unionized government workers bore the brunt of cuts, with membership down about 660,000 workers, or 8 percent, since 2008. Most of the lost jobs were municipal—that is, held by workers employed by towns, counties, cities, and school districts. That’s not surprising: local government budgets are largely made up of employee costs. The typical school district budget, for instance, is composed of 80 percent personnel costs, leaving administrators few alternatives but to lay off workers during major fiscal nosedives. As in the private sector, labor-friendly states have taken some of the biggest losses in government-union rolls. Just eight states, led by New York—with the highest rate of public unionization in the country—and including California, Ohio, Washington, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Illinois have accounted for nearly 427,000 lost government-union jobs, 66 percent of the total national reduction in the public sector. Just six of the 24 compulsory-unionization states have more government-union jobs today than in 2008. Public-sector unions have also taken significant hits in two states that have adopted right-to-work rules during the last five years—Wisconsin and Michigan. Wisconsin passed a law in 2011 eliminating mandatory fees for government workers who don’t want to belong to a union and narrowing collective bargaining for many government workers. Unions have subsequently lost nearly 74,000 members in Wisconsin, where previously nearly half of all government workers were unionized. Michigan saw a drop of about 25,000 government-union jobs after the state adopted a right-to-work law in 2012. Some of the nation’s most politically muscular labor organizations haven’t escaped these trends. The National Education Association, America’s largest labor group, has seen its membership fall by 282,000 since its 2009 high, according to the Department of Labor. Education Intelligence Agency (EIA), a blog that closely follows teachers’ unions, has counted 22 state NEA affiliates with fewer members today than they had 20 years ago. Meanwhile, 17 state teachers’-union locals operated in the red during the 2014 school year, the latest for which data are available, EIA reports. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Workers, which represents the largest number of noneducation public workers, has lost 196,000 members. Neither NEA nor AFSCME has avoided shrinking membership in any of the last five years. The outlook going forward isn’t much more promising for government unions—especially because the country may be nearing another economic downturn after more than six years of expansion. If so, local governments are in the weakest position in decades to withstand such a storm. State and local collections of property, income, and sales taxes peaked before the downturn at $1.22 trillion, before falling off a cliff and then recovering only slowly. By the end of 2015, taxes brought in $1.33 trillion in revenue, which represents an average annual growth rate of just 1.25 percent since 2008. The skyrocketing price of benefits negotiated by workers has made it hard to reduce costs, even when governments have reduced their workforce. Rising pension bills are a key reason. Since the financial crisis, annual contributions by state and local governments, including schools, into underfunded pension systems have risen by about $47.8 billion, or 64 percent, to $121 billion, even as government payrolls have shrunk. And paying down retirement-related debts in some states will require years of higher contributions. Union-friendly states will face the greatest financial squeeze. A new study on government pension debt by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research shows that nine of the ten states with the greatest unfunded pension liabilities are union-friendly environments, including Illinois, California, and New Jersey. At the same time, state tax collections have started to slow again, apparently because of a weakening economy. The Rockefeller Institute for Government predicts that tax revenues will likely deteriorate throughout 2016 and 2017. Further, with budgets pressured, public opinion has turned against many government unions. Recent polling by Harvard’s Program on Education Policy and Governance, for instance, found that only 30 percent of those surveyed say that teachers’ unions have a positive impact on schools, while 39 percent view their influence as a negative. Some opponents have taken the case against unions into the courts. In 2012, the parents of nine California public schoolchildren filed a case arguing that the state’s teacher-tenure laws, which grant many teachers virtually permanent employment, regardless of their abilities, violated children’s right to receive an adequate education. A California superior court ruled for the plaintiffs in 2014, but an appeals court overturned that verdict. Now the state’s supreme court must weigh in. A ruling against the union threatens to upend the entire union-backed regime of teacher job security in the state, and could spark copycat suits elsewhere. Government unions narrowly escaped a potentially far more damaging outcome in March, when the Supreme Court failed to overturn a nearly 40-year-old ruling that lets unions collect mandatory fees from workers. In Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, ten teachers objecting to forced fees sued the California teachers’ union. All indications during Supreme Court oral arguments in January suggested that a majority of justices were sympathetic to the plaintiffs. But the untimely February death of originalist justice Antonin Scalia resulted in a 4-4 split in Friedrichs, protecting the fees—at least for now. The lawyers for the Friedrichs plaintiffs have refiled the case, however, and other workers unwillingly paying fees may sue on their own. “We can’t leave this issue for another time,” says Terry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, the public-interest law firm that brought the case. “The Court has already agreed to decide this case and it should hold the case until it can issue a definitive decision.” If Scalia’s eventual replacement (whoever that may be) sees the issue in the same way as the Court’s conservative judges, these kinds of fees may yet disappear. The sudden fleeing of workers from labor’s rolls in places like Wisconsin and Michigan after they ended compulsory unionization suggests what might then be in store for public unions. Such a scenario could make organized labor’s recent struggles seem mild by comparison.

By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Aug 16, 2016, 9:49 am EST     Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Due for Even BIGGER Gains 5 Retail Stocks That May Not Be Around Next Christmas Recent Posts: Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Drug Failure Doesn’t Answer the Bigger Question The Dow Jones Is Completely Defying Expectations Why Medtronic PLC (MDT), Dycom Industries, Inc. (DY) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts The past 12 months haven’t been easy for Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) shareholders. TGT stock is down 12% since its July-2015 peak, and that’s with a 14% bounce up and off June’s low. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) The prod for the weakness? Nothing surprising. Earlier last year, Target announced a swath of layoffs that would not only end up costing the company $100 million, but also sent a troubling message. Then, just when it looked like investors were willing to look past the downside of the layoffs, rumors surfaced that Target may be better served by outright selling its grocery business rather than moving ahead with its expansion plans. As it turns out, the panic behind the pullback wasn’t merited. Target will have a chance to prove it — or disprove it — when it posts its second-quarter results before the market opens this Wednesday. Target Earnings Preview As of the most recent look, Target is expected to report per-share income of $1.12 on $16.17 billion in revenue. 8 Retail Stocks That Will Make You Richer Both would be down from year-ago figures of $1.22 per share of TGT stock and stakes of $17.43 billion. The company offered profit guidance of between $1.00 and $1.20. Just for the record though, Target has historically topped earnings and revenue estimates (though it has stumbled a few times in recent quarters). Same-store sales are projected roll in 0.9% lower. The pros have been mixed on TGT stock of late. A week ago, Cleveland Research lowered its same-store sales outlook for the quarter, projecting sales to fall by 1.5% based on its measure of store traffic. Conversely, Deutsche Bank raised its target price in TGT stock from $78 to $79 this week — in front of earnings — though it is still waiting to see how last quarter’s numbers will unfurl. Meanwhile, The Buckingham Research Group analysts opined this week, “We have been impressed with new management’s decisive actions and evidence of improved merchandising and execution, although the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was a modest setback.” MKM Partners added, “We wouldn’t be surprised by upside EPS at Walmart but think the potential for improving comps is greater with Target, given new merchandise lines in children’s, improvements in grocery and benefits from the CVS partnership.” TGT: Three Things to Think About While investors have plenty to think about with Target Corporation, three factors stand ready to push and pull TGT stock more than any others. Groceries: While last year’s chatter that Target was looking to sell its grocery business ended up being nothing more than a rumor, it has struggled to make food the growth engine it was supposed to be. Just this week, news surfaced that its perishables were expiring too often before being sold. It’s a tacit sign — and the retailer acknowledges this — that it’s not being perceived as a full-blown grocery store yet. Food is a core piece of the company’s future, however. E-commerce: While Target’s e-commerce platform has always been a slick, well-oiled and well-integrated part of the company, it has never been a big part of the revenue mix … even with the prior quarter’s 23% improvement in digital sales. That could be changing soon, though, if a recent hire is any indication. Target has poached Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) supply chain executive Preston Mosier, naming him Vice President of Fulfillment Operations. Given how Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) recently acquired e-commerce outfit Jet.com, Target would be wise to step up its online effort. Home Depot Stock Is STILL a Buy After Great Q2 Earnings New store concept: Despite the fact that Walmart hasn’t done especially well with them, Target is planning to forge ahead with its small-footprint concept, aiming to open 14 more of the 20,000 square-foot sites before the end of 2016. These smaller stores open up new growth opportunities in markets where a larger store can’t be supported, and are integral to the organization’s growth plans in the shadow of a highly saturated general store market. Bottom Line for TGT Stock While the headlines have admittedly looked and sounded dire for Target, they’ve been embellished relative to the headwind the retailer has actually been facing. Either way, the headwind of concerning news seems to be abating, with the bigger growth trend poised to resume. Wednesday morning’s announcement may well convince the market Target is still the real deal. Rival Walmart will announce its quarterly numbers on Thursday of this week. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Hot New Products" at the Marriott Marquis Times Square on April 6, 2015. Photo: Getty Images Wall Street chewed up and spit out the natural and organic food company Hain Celestial Group on Tuesday after an announcement that it would delay releasing its fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2016 results. The Lake Success, NY-based conglomerate said it’s investigating a possible accounting issue in which it might have booked revenue in the wrong quarter. Its stock tanked 26 percent, to $39.35, nearly erasing its gains for the entire year. The owner of such brands as Celestial teas, Earth’s Best baby food and Terra chips, Hain said it had “identified concessions that were granted to certain distributors in the United States” and that it was investigating whether the revenues associated with the concessions were booked during the correct period. Just as troubling, Hain’s chief financial officer and chief accounting officer have left in recent months. The company didn’t name any names, but United Natural Foods and Walmart are its two biggest sales drivers, accounting for 12 percent and 10 percent of revenue, respectively, according to its latest annual report. Once the dominant player in the better-for-you food category, Hain is facing stiffer competition from the likes of Costco — the largest seller of organic foods — and consumer product companies like General Mills, Kellogg’s and Hershey Foods, which have all acquired smaller natural food companies. “They are all building their platforms to compete with Hain,” said Dan Glickberg, principal of Rodeo CPG, a food advisory firm and venture capital fund. Hain founder and Chief Executive Irwin Simon has said during past earnings calls that major consumer packaged goods companies are taking market share from Hain. The company also said it does not expect to achieve its previously announced guidance for fiscal 2016.

August 12, 2016 4:06 p.m. America Reacts With Horror to News That Walmart Now Sells Deep-Fried Twinkies in a Box By Clint Rainey Share Facebook iconShare Twitter iconTweet LinkedIn iconShare Google Plus iconShare Pinterest iconPin It Email iconEmail Comment iconComment Print icon Print Walmart reps call it a “sometimes” food that's "worth the calories." We were warned. Just two months ago, we got word that Hostess managed to turn deep-fried Twinkies — previously only available at state fairs and consumed by people who have a severely depleted sense of self-preservation — into a frozen, boxed product that it could sell at supermarkets. And now, on August 16, these things will have infiltrated more than 4,000 Walmart stores. There are two flavors: “Original Golden” (a.k.a. “yellow”) and chocolate. Both are frozen, and the idea is you reheat them in the oven, but it remains to be seen how many people will even bother with that step. More interesting than the product itself is the reaction to its release. As a result of the release, “Twinkie” has been trending all day on Twitter. But it’s not because of an overwhelming sense of enthusiasm. In fact, in an already-grim year, it seems people feel like these deep-fried creations are the next step toward America’s eventual downfall: Fitting that Deep Fried Twinkies are out the same year expired Twinkie Donald Trump is running for president.— Madison Medeiros (@shmadison) August 12, 2016 The fact that Deep Fried Twinkie's is the number one trending topic right now isn't everything that's wrong with America, but maybe 35%— Lauren Smith (@lsmith1245) August 12, 2016 Between the Whopperitto, all of 2016, & fried twinkies, I think it is safe to say this is peak western civilization. Was a good run, folks.— Christian H. Cooper (@ChristianCooper) August 12, 2016 Enough on the election. Can we talk about what’s really wrong with U.S.: Hostess intros frozen deep-fried Twinkie. https://t.co/cLFxi6OmKP— Todd A. Price (@TPrice504) August 12, 2016 "Deep Fried Twinkies" and #WorldElephantDay are trending at the same time. Eat enough of the former and you'll be one of the latter.— Matt Walker (@funnymatt) August 12, 2016 Hostess launches line of Deep Fried Twinkies. Martin Shkreli immediately buys all domestic insulin manufacturers.— Richard Jeter (@MilesToGo13) August 12, 2016 @CocaColaCo not doing the trick? Do you need your children to suffer with Type 2 #diabetes? America has you covered: "Deep Fried Twinkies".— Music is My Sister (@TurnVinyl) August 12, 2016 Ah, the old deep-fried Twinkie thesis. Doesn't that just end up killing off customers faster though? https://t.co/tP2K8nR9kS— Jason A. Moser (@TMFJMo) August 12, 2016 We live in a world where you can get clear Pepsi and deep fried Twinkie from the liquor store ... What a time— Lil' G.O.A.T (@DjSixsational) August 12, 2016 Honestly please love yourself enough to never eat a deep fried Twinkie— regina phalange (@starIincastro) August 12, 2016 AP Tags: deep-fried twinkieshostesswalmartsweet jesus!

Most Popular {{item.title | formatTitle}} Economics Aug 16 BNN's Daily Chase: Loonie's gains continue, a look inside the portfolios of big U.S. investors By Noah Zivitz loonie, The Canadian Press Noah Zivitz Managing Editor, BNN Follow|Archive The Canadian dollar trades near 78 cents U.S. amid seven-day winning streak The Canadian dollar is into a seventh straight day of gains. The winning streak pushed the loonie above 78 cents U.S. this morning, hitting a high of US$0.7813 immediately after StatsCan reported surprisingly strong manufacturing sales for the month of June. The dollar has pulled back since then, and one investment manager warned Canada's currency is defying economic fundamentals. "Some people have pointed out that the strength in the Canadian dollar is somewhat contrary to the underlying economic data we're seeing in Canada," JC Clark CEO Colin Stewart told us before the latest manufacturing data was released. "Until we see a real pick up in the Canadian economy, there's going to be an upward cap as far as how high that Canadian dollar can move." Stewart went on to point out that if the dollar strengthens too much, some observers will raise concerns the dollar will slow down Canada's manufacturing sector.  Canada's manufacturing sales in June rose 0.8 per cent from the previous month, according to data released by Statistics Canada on Tuesday. Analysts had expected a 0.5 per cent gain. Tracking the smart money It’s Amber Kanwar's favourite day of the quarter because we get to peek inside the portfolios of some of America’s savviest investors. The latest batch of 13F filings revealed Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its stake in Suncor to 1.34 per cent from 1.8 per cent (Berkshire also sold some Wal-Mart stock and picked up more Apple shares), while John Paulson loaded up on Valeant (taking Paulson & Co.’s stake in the drugmaker to 5.49 per cent from 3.82 per cent). Amber will sift through these and other notable moves documented in the 13Fs.  Couche-Tard reportedly closing in on CST brands  The Wall Street Journal is reporting Alimentation Couche-Tard “is the likely winner” in the auctioning off of CST Brands, a US$3.35-billion operator of fuel stations and convenience stores across the U.S. and six Canadian provinces. To be certain, nothing is confirmed and negotiations could stall/fail. But Couche-Tard’s appetite for M&A is well-documented, and the CEO hinted last month that more deals could be in the works (“We continue to grow,” Brian Hannasch said in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings release, “and we do not intend to slow down any time soon.”)  Roots CEO maps out growth strategy  Almost 10 months after Searchlight Capital bought a majority stake in Roots, we’re going one-on-one with the retailer’s new chief executive officer. BNN's Kristina Partsinevelos got a broadcast exclusive with Jim Gabel that will air today. Gabel discusses the iconic brand’s plan for expansion in Canada and Asia – and hints at market share he’s looking to grab from a now defunct retailer. BHP haunted by U.S. shale Once again, BHP Billiton is paying the price for dipping its toe in the U.S. oil and gas sector. The miner reported a FY 2016 loss of US$6.39 billion this morning, weighed down by almost US$8 billion in charges, including a US$4.9-billion impairment on its U.S. onshore assets.  The company also slashed its dividend 75 per cent. CEO Andrew Mackenzie is maintaining a brave face, telling reporters BHP will “start this new financial year with real momentum.”  As for Jansen, that Saskatchewan potash project that factored mightily in the company’s failed attempt to buy PotashCorp, BHP said Tuesday work is “steadily progressing,” and it plans US$200M in capex on potash this fiscal year.  The U.S. vs. Volkswagen We’ll have another opportunity today to compare and contrast how the United States and Canada have responded to VW’s emissions-rigging scandal. The Wall Street Journal says U.S. prosecutors are working toward a settlement in the criminal case against the German automaker. As BNN's Jameson Berkow has been reporting consistently for the last week or so, Canadian owners of the VW vehicles involved in the scandal are facing a much longer wait than their U.S. counterparts for any kind of resolution.    Releases/events: -Notable earnings: Home Depot, TJX -Notable data: Canadian manufacturing sales, U.S. CPI, U.S. housing starts & building permits -0900 ET: Trudeau media avail in Bridgetown, NS -1310 ET: Finance Minister Bill Morneau delivers remarks and speaks to the media in Saskatoon TSX 15,000 watch: Closed Monday at 14,777.02 Last traded at 15,000 on June 4, 2015 Every morning Commodities host Andrew Bell writes a ‘chase note’ to BNN's editorial staff listing the stories and events that will be in the spotlight that day.

Our need is great but our capacity is greater.' Print Email Robert Mann By Robert Mann The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on August 16, 2016 at 7:50 AM, updated August 16, 2016 at 7:34 PM comments Everywhere I've been in Baton Rouge the past two days, I've witnessed remarkable compassion, grace and optimism. Much of this city and region remained under water on Monday (Aug. 15). Tens of thousands are homeless. At least 11 are dead. Life here won't be normal for months, maybe a year. Yet, all I see are people who are thankful, hopeful and determined to rebuild. I see an ocean of generosity and compassion. I see people who know they might have lost so much more and who are profoundly grateful for what remains — their lives and loved ones. On a day when destruction and devastation envelop them, many people I know are not cursing, but giving thanks. At our house, my wife's brother is upbeat as he plans to rebuild his flooded home. He lives near Sherwood Forrest Drive and Old Hammond Highway, a hard-hit area. As of Sunday night, his house and his two cars were under at least four feet of water. I haven't heard him utter a word of pessimism or woe. Like so many, he is hopeful. On Sunday night, I searched Facebook for updates from local friends. So many lost everything. Those who didn't were searching for ways to help: Drake and Jean made me proud they helped rescue over 200 or more people from Belengrath area yesterday.  Baton Rouge peeps, where/how is the best way to help right now? I want to do my part and I want to get the word out to my network.  Baton Rouge: We are dry and have power and wifi. If anyone needs shelter, or just a place to catch your breath, please message me. Our doors are open. Everyone is looking to be useful. I have friends who spent most of Sunday volunteering at area shelters or who dropped off bedding, food or clothing at those shelters. Every other Facebook post I read, it seems, is a story of someone helping, praying for and reaching out to friends and, often, complete strangers. My wife and I watched TV for several hours Sunday morning as two local stations, WBRZ and WAFB, showed a virtual parade of heroes launch their boats from Interstate 12 in search of people stranded in their homes. Most notably, there was the dramatic and unforgettable video of three young men on a boat rescuing a woman and her dog as her car quickly sank. That video literally took my breath. God bless those young men and so many like them who performed countless heroic acts the past few days. Throughout the weekend, concerned acquaintances, friends and family from around the country called or sent us messages inquiring about our wellbeing. Every phone call and email to a friend or business associate in Louisiana the past few days has begun with some form of, "Are you ok?" No conversation may begin without an inventory of yours and your family's wellbeing. On Monday morning, my daughter and I went to the nearby Wal-Mart Market to load up on supplies to deliver to First United Methodist Church for distribution to flood victims. At the store, I saw several friends who were also buying supplies and food to donate to those in need. When we arrived at the church gym on Monday, people were streaming in with various items — diapers, cleaning supplies, food and water. (The church, where we have been members for 23 years, has at least 50 families who report being flooded out of their homes.) At the Wal-Mart earlier, I asked the two female employees at the checkout, "How are things at your house?" One said the flooding destroyed her son's home, but she was thankful he was alive. He would rebuild, she said, betraying no bitterness or woe. Two hours later, my daughter and I swung by Trader Joe's for a few items. Before I could inquire about her wellbeing, the cheerful woman scanning my purchases asked about our home. "We're high and dry," I told her. "How are you?" "I lost everything," she told me, as if describing missing keys, not a submerged home. She had been at work on Saturday, she told us, as the rain fell and the rivers rose. By the time she left work, she learned that her neighborhood near I-12 and Millerville Road was inundated. She has not been able to return to inspect the damage, but from watching TV footage she says she knows her home is still under water. In spite of it all, she did not stop smiling as she bagged our purchases. She assured us that she was thankful for her health and her life. As we left the store, my daughter and I marveled at such extraordinary faithfulness and optimism in the face of destruction and loss. Scanning Facebook late Monday morning, I came across a typically heroic story posted by a good friend, Chris Frink. He's a former journalist, whose wife, Emily, is a Baton Rouge veterinarian. When I asked Chris if I could share his story, he hesitated, not wanting readers to think he was bragging. I responded, "You are telling a compelling story of love in action." Chris's tale is extraordinary but it is also typical of so many I have heard about and witnessed over the past several days: While working in an evacuee shelter today, Emily Taylor met a woman and her elderly mother who worried about four dogs left behind when they evacuated early yesterday. She volunteered me to take them. It turned into a mission from God. We saw God at every important junction in the venture. We found our way to Lisa's and Leila's neighborhood behind Redemptorist High School off Plank Road. Water on their street started about two blocks from the house and got deep quick. Firefighters were running boat rescues but the list people needing saving was long. People before pets. We understood. With no AT&T service finding a boat to help was daunting. Seeking wifi access, Lisa directed me across a jammed Plank Road to a library. It was closed and wifi off. We prayed for a boat. As I pulled back out onto a crowded Plank, we look across the traffic and saw a cluster of boats in the water that lapped up on the intersection. Thank God for Donny Nezat and his family from Port Barre. They took Lisa and I (we left Leila in the pickup with the A/C running) down the street around the block and up to Lisa's doorstep. Her three lapdogs and one pit bull were overjoyed to see her. We struggled loading them into the boat with only two minor dog bites. Lisa and Leila will spend another night in the shelter. Her dogs are at Emily's clinic. Tomorrow, Lisa and I will see if the water's down enough to get the cell phone we forgot to pick up today.  The depth of the water and power of the current were amazing. The devastation was stunning. The recovery will be long. Pray and help. Thank God for folks like the Nezats and all the other people who showed up to help strangers. Louisiana is strong. Our hearts are huge. Our need is great but our capacity is greater. If you wish to help Baton Rouge-area flood victims, there are many good charities accepting donations. My church, First United Methodist of Baton Rouge, is one of them. Here's the link if you would like to help. Editor's note: The first names of the couple described by Chris Frink in his Facebook post, Lisa and Leila, were corrected to reflect changes he subsequently made to his original post.

(AP Photo/Max Becherer) We’re working on compiling a list of local places collecting donations and supplies for Louisiana flood victims. CBS affiliate WAFB tells us that a lot of this flooding happened in places that have never seen water like this, so that’s why many of the victims did not have flood insurance. Check with each individual place you want to donate and ask if they have a plan to distribute the items — national disaster relief agencies like FEMA say that sometimes, cash is best because a lot of physical donations can occlude relief efforts. Disaster relief agencies say the most unhelpful item to donate is clothing. Here’s the list we have so far: USA The University of South Alabama department of athletics is setting up its jaguar trailer in the parking lot of stanky field to accept donations of water and non-perishable food, cleaning supplies, bug repellant and batteries. That’s starting at 7:30 Tuesday morning and running through Sunday. Junior League You can help  by dropping off $20 gift cards (Walmart or Target), diapers (all sizes) and feminine hygiene products to 57 N. Sage Avenue Monday – Thursday 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Questions? (251) 471-3348 or headquarters@juniorleaguemobile.org Freedom Towing Freedom Towing is soliciting 5 cases of bottled water, 5 cases of diapers, or 5 cases of baby formula/baby food. All donations will be accepted and can be dropped of at their office at 5651 Hwy 90. ‬Pet Supplies Plus A truck is departing for Baton Rouge at 7 p.m. on Tuesday night, donations are welcome at the Hillcrest and Airport location. The donations will go to the Denham Springs Animal Shelter. Mobile Theater Guild MTG will be taking supplies through 8/22 which will be transported to Denham Springs, La., from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m. nightly. Water, scrub brushes and cleaning supplies are among the items suggested. It’s at 14 N Lafayette St. Keller Williams Real Estate Keller Williams real estate on Hillcrest road is collecting items through Tuesday to take a truck to LA to the flooded victims. Red Cross You can call 855-489-2528 or sign up online to volunteer at volunteerlouisiana.gov. To help people affected by the Louisiana Floods, visit redcross.org, call 1-800-RED CROSS or text the word LAFLOODS to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to, and help people recovery from these disasters. Salvation Army To help those in these flooded areas across Southeast Louisiana, you can donate by going to http://give.salvationarmyusa.org/gulf_coast_floods. You will also find information on this webpage on how to donate by phone and through mail. You can also donate by texting STORM to 51555 on your mobile device. We’ll continue to update this list throughout today.

Here are five things you must know for Tuesday, Aug. 16: 1. -- Apple (AAPL) shares were rising 0.5% in premarket trading Tuesday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) disclosed it raised its stake in the iPhone maker by 55%. Berkshire Hathaway held 15.2 million shares of Apple as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing. Three months earlier, Berkshire Hathaway held 9.8 million shares.  The company's Apple stake was valued at $1.46 billion as of June 30. Berkshire Hathaway also reduced its stake in Walmart (WMT)  to 40.2 million shares in June from 55.2 million in the spring, and added to its sizeable stake in Phillips 66 (PSX) . Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL?

The fund bought the shares on June 30. ValueAct is known for taking tiny stakes and winning board seats to enact change, as it did at Microsoft (MSFT)  two years ago with just 0.8% of the company.  ValueAct said in a letter to investors that it thought the bank was undervalued, according to Bloomberg. The investor also praised Morgan Stanley for focusing on fee-heavy, asset-light businesses such as wealth and investment management while cutting risky lending. The stock rose 1.2% in premarket trading on Tuesday.

In the clip, which is filmed by an onlooker sitting in her car, the animal is seen jumping off a trolley onto the employee. The two struggle for a brief moment before the monkey's owner gets in between the warring pair. The woman then grabs the monkey's hand and they walk away together, as the employee heads back towards the supermarket . The monkey launches itself at the employee (Photo: Facebook) A man in the car, from which the video is being filmed, shouts to the employee: "Man, whose monkey is that? "You could have got hurt! You could have got sick from that."

INNOVATE Hostess Borrows a Customer Hack and Reintroduces the World to Deep-Fried Twinkies People have been deep-frying Twinkies for years. Now Hostess has decided to get in on the act. By Erik Sherman Erik Sherman's work has appeared in such publications as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times Magazine, and Fortune. He also writes at Fortune.com and Forbes.com. @ErikSherman Contributor, Inc.com@ErikSherman WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement As Apple has found, having to scramble for your next big hit can be a dangerous. There's the chance that interest in the old cash cow starts to drop without something else to take up the difference. You can try to encourage innovation, or sometimes you can see it elsewhere and get on the bandwagon. In the case of Hostess, it only took 14 years. The company has started to sell its first frozen product: deep-fried Twinkies, as the Associated Press reported. If that sounds familiar, it should. Deep-fried Twinkies have been a staple of so-called fair food, the treats served at county and state fairs, since at least 2002, where it was invented in Brooklyn, according to the New York Times. Here's how the paper described it: Something magical occurs when the pastry hits the hot oil. The creamy white vegetable shortening filling liquefies, impregnating the sponge cake with its luscious vanilla flavor (sure, it's imitation, but nevertheless potent). The cake itself softens and warms, nearly melting, contrasting with the crisp, deep-fried crust in a buttery and suave way. The shop adds its own ruby-hued berry sauce, which provides a bit of tart sophistication. What you get from the Wal-Mart (only place selling them for the first three months) freezer aisle isn't quite the same. Available in vanilla or chocolate, a box of seven running $4.76, they come partially fried. You finish them off in an oven, toaster, or fry pan. Hostess worked with Wal-Mart, which suggested the idea and opened a food lab for development. By providing the opening exclusive (and, who knows?, maybe a cut of the profits), Hostess gets to bring a new old concept to market. According to AP, the Hostess vice president of marketing said they had a "retro cool factor." (If 2002 is really retro, I'm really depressed.) Most importantly, it's a product whose general concept, if not exact execution, was not only developed by others but proven for 14 years in public trials. It should be market ready. And with each vanilla Twinkie running 9 grams of fat and 220 calories, compared to the 4 grams of fat and 130 calories of the regular type, maybe Hostess can sell gym memberships afterward. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Aug 12, 2016 Advertisement

The Oracle of Omaha has been beating the market for decades while accumulating positions in some of the world’s most popular companies. Courtesy of a new filing, we now have a peek at how the legendary investor deployed capital in the third quarter of 2016. Many institutional investment managers recently filed their mandatory 13F with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing is a quarterly report of equity holdings required by managers who oversee more than $100 million in qualifying assets and must be filed within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The 13F provides a glance at what firms did in the previous quarter, but investors should keep in mind that hedging and trading strategies of each fund are still unknown. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway made several changes in the three months ended September 30, 2016. The conglomerate sold off its Suncor Energy position, and reduced its stakes in Deere, Kinder Morgan, and Wal-Mart. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway sold about 27 million shares of Wal-Mart. However, stakes were raised in Bank of New York Mellon, Charter Communications, and Visa. New relatively small positions were taken in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Continental. According to CNBC, a new position was also taken in Southwest Airlines, after the September 30 cutoff. The largest investments in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio include some of the most popular blue chips known to Wall Street. Let’s take a look at Berkshire Hathaway’s top eight holdings according to dollar value at the end of September, not including Buffett’s option to purchase 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. 8. Moody’s MCO stock price | StockCharts.com Thanks to a decline in DaVita HealthCare Partners, Moody’s is now Berkshire Hathaway’s No. 8 largest position by dollar value. At the end of the third quarter, Buffett and company held 24.7 million shares of the ratings agency, worth about $2.7 billion. In October, Moody’s reported that revenue jumped 10% in the third quarter compared to a year earlier. Operating income increased 14% from the prior year. “Moody’s revenue increased 10% in the third quarter primarily as a result of record third quarter revenue for Moody’s Investors Service, driven by higher leveraged finance issuance and US public finance activity, as well as solid growth from Moody’s Analytics,” said Raymond McDaniel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Moody’s, in a press release. 7. U.S. Bancorp USB stock price | StockCharts.com The financial industry is no stranger to Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway held 85.1 million shares of U.S. Bancorp at the end of the third quarter, worth $3.6 billion. The position is unchanged from the prior quarter, but a rally in share price this year continues to keep U.S. Bancorp Berkshire Hathaway’s No. 7 largest holding. U.S. Bancorp is based in Minneapolis and has nearly half a trillion dollars in assets. It’s the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association, the fifth largest commercial bank in the United States. The Company operates 3,114 banking offices in 25 states and 4,875 ATMs. In October, MONEY named U.S. Bank the Best Big Bank in a tie with TD Bank. 6. Phillips 66 PSX stock price | StockCharts.com The multinational American energy company was originally thought to be sold off by Buffett in the second quarter of 2015. As it turns out, Buffett had the stake classified as confidential so it wouldn’t show on the 13F and allow copycat investors to run the price up. At the end of September, Berkshire Hathaway held 80.7 million shares (worth $6.5 billion), up from almost 78.8 million shares in the previous quarter, according to the 13F. Phillips 66 is Berkshire Hathaway’s No. 6 largest holding, and appears to be a favorite, especially when its share price dips toward $75. Unlike oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron, Phillips 66 has escaped most of the carnage seen in the energy sector. Buffett told CNBC in 2015: “We’re buying it because we like the company and we like the management very much.” 5. American Express AXP stock price | StockCharts.com Warren Buffett has liked American Express since at least the 1960s. Today, the credit card giant is Berkshire Hathaway’s No. 5 largest holding. At the end of the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway held 151.6 million shares (worth $9.7 billion), unchanged from the prior quarter. American Express shares have struggled in recent years. Costco severed ties from American Express after 16 years in business with each other. American Express was able to make a deal with Sam’s Club, but it did little to comfort Mr. Market at the time. However, shares may have finally found a bottom in January after touching $50, and are in the green this year. Berkshire Hathaway’s positions in Mastercard and Visa come nowhere close to the size of its American Express position. 4. International Business Machines IBM stock price | StockCharts.com If you’re looking for a reason not to follow in Buffett’s footsteps, IBM is it. The company was the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2014, and one of the worst performers in 2015. In fact, IBM’s revenue has fallen for 18 consecutive quarters. Nonetheless, Buffett isn’t giving up and you might not want to either. IBM’s stock price is up double digits this year. IBM is Berkshire Hathaway’s No. 4 largest holding. At the end of the third quarter, the company held 81.2 million shares (worth $12.9 billion). IBM shares also still offer about a 3.5% dividend yield. 3. Coca-Cola KO stock price | StockCharts.com Coca-Cola is the most predictable position at Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett is on record saying he will never sell his shares in the world-renowned beverage company, and can often be seen holding a Cherry Coke. At the end of the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway held the usual 400 million shares of Coca-Cola (worth $16.9 billion), making it the company’s No. 3 largest holding. While sugar water has seen its fair share of problems in recent years, Coca-Cola shares have been holding above $40 since late 2015. Coca-Cola has investments in Monster Beverage, Keurig Green Mountain, and Suja Juice. The company is also making operating changes to drive stronger growth and save $3 billion annually by 2019. Shares are in the red for 2016, and are near long-term support of $40. 2. Wells Fargo WFC stock price | StockCharts.com America’s second most profitable bank is also Buffett’s No. 2 largest holding. Berkshire Hathaway held 479.7 million shares (worth $21.2 billion) of Wells Fargo at the end of the third quarter. Somewhat surprisingly, this was unchanged from the prior quarter. Wells Fargo quickly become Buffett’s most controversial holding in September. The mega bank finally admitted it created roughly 2 million fake accounts, which inflated sales numbers and banking fees. Wells Fargo had an incentive program in place that essentially forced employees to commit fraud or risk being fired for underperforming unrealistic sales goals. More than 5,000 workers related to the scandal were fired. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf also resigned in the wake of the financial abuse. 1. Kraft Heinz KHC stock price | StockCharts.com Berkshire Hathaway’s position in the recently merged Kraft Heinz has been listed on the 13F for the past five quarters. Buffett teamed up with investment firm 3G Capital to takeover Kraft Foods with Heinz. The deal created one of the biggest food companies in history, with over 10 different brands valued at more than $500 million each. More recently, the company has laid off thousands of workers to cut costs and “consolidate manufacturing across the Kraft Heinz North American network.” In August, Kraft Heinz raised its quarterly dividend 4.3% to $0.60 per share. Buffett and company held 325.6 million shares of Kraft Heinz at the end of September, worth a whopping $29.1 billion. That makes it Buffett’s largest portfolio holding.

My Money Blog Early Retirement Investing Guide Money Saving Tips Credit Card Rewards Advertising Disclosure The Vanguard Effect on ETF and Mutual Fund Expenses August 16, 2016 By Jonathan Ping 5 Comments The following chart taken from this Bloomberg article by Eric Balchunas shows the drastic difference in expense ratios when Vanguard has an offering in an asset class or not. Like Walmart arriving in a new town, the entry of Vanguard into a particular investment area causes a collective gnashing of teeth as other fund managers are forced to drop their prices to compete. That dynamic is borne out in the table below, which shows the cheapest ETF fees for products that do or do not have a Vanguard-provided equivalent. This is the “Vanguard Effect”. Here’s my version of explaining how it works: When Vanguard competes in an area, the expense ratios across the board are much, much lower. Note that the cheapest expense ratios you see in those asset classes not necessarily from Vanguard itself. It is often from a competitor like Charles Schwab. When Vanguard doesn’t compete, the expense ratios are much higher. In those no-Vanguard asset classes, the competitor won’t lower prices just because they can. They’ll keep the profit margin as high as they can, as they are bound to serving the business owners as well as ETF share owners. The gap between what they can charge and what they must charge goes to business profits. They aren’t evil, they are just trying to serve their two masters. At Vanguard, the business owner is the ETF share owner. (Vanguard uses the term “client-owned”.) For them, the most efficient way to pass on potential profits is to keep expenses as low as possible. This is why you see DIY investors always wish Vanguard would offer something like an International Small Value ETF or a US Micro Cap ETF. By simply entering the ring, even the expense ratios of the ETFs we already hold from other providers will go down.

Reply Jonathan Ping says: August 16, 2016 at 11:31 am In my opinion, they seem to make their decisions based on demand more from financial advisors and institutional investors, and less from individual investors. Reply Warren Pattison says: August 16, 2016 at 11:33 am Vanguard video about their ETF’s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-OztEe8HW8 But their YouTube channel has a wealth of vids discussing topics with fund managers – I bet there’s some in-depth discussions in one of those. Reply TJ says: August 17, 2016 at 8:46 am I’m curious about the Vanguard’s effect on some of their recent entries, like the international dividend stocks. Reply Geoffrey says: August 21, 2016 at 12:35 pm Careful with ETF’s. They are a sharp knife because of how easy they are to trade. Buy and hold and dollar cost averaging of new investmant dollars has a good long term track record. For most investors 3-5 low-cost index funds plus a money market fund are all most investors need.

If you were offline for any reason, this is a great way to catch up with all the tech-buzz you may have missed! Orkut’s founder, Orkut Büyükkökten, has not given up on the social media dream and has launched another one called ‘Hello’, that wants us to connect with other people who share the same passion and interests. It won’t be directly competing with Facebook for that matter, and will have a different USP. Kerala Tourism Ministry now plans to adorn about 200 taxis in Dubai with Kerala tourism ads that would say ‘A Faraway Land Four Hours Away’. IANS says “The advertisement will focus on the high connectivity, popular destinations, backwaters and ayurvedic therapies of Kerala.” The legend of Apple and iPhones is experiencing its worst ever crisis in India. As per new reports emerging, iPhones sales in India has dropped by 35% during Q2 of 2016, compared to Q2 of 2015. And due to low sales volume, iOS market share has been reduced by 50% as Android is threatening to capture the whole market with massive 97% share. Facebook is in talks with various ISPs (Internet Service Providers) for expanding its Express WiFi programme for its commercial launch in India. Facebook has already completed the pilot-run of Express WiFi with 125 hotspots in partnership with the state-run telco, BSNL. Unlike malwares, QuadRooter is an bug that exists in smartphones running on Android and housing Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets. The vulnerable chipsets pose a threat to 900 million Android devices at the moment, and some of the most popular, ‘secure’ and expensive smartphones out there. Now whenever you search for a restaurant or a cafe on Google Search, you’ll have an option to check it out on Zomato or Swiggy and order food from these two apps. Adding this to its mobile version only right now, Google has closely integrated these two food delivery apps on its search engine. In a somewhat expected move, Reliance Jio has partnered with Flipkart to offer its LYF branded 4G VoLTE smartphones. Flipkart would exclusively sell LYF Wind 3 and LYF Flame 8 smartphone. Jet.com, which was launched in July, 2015, has been acquired by world’s largest retailer Wal-mart for $3 billion in cash and $300 million in stocks, which would be transferred in a phased manner. This acquisition is an interesting case study for the ecommerce industry, especially in India where analysts and experts have already predicted market saturation and low demand. Adidas has got the approval from Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) to operate its retail stores under one wholesale entity. The company to planning to start the operations of these stores in 2017. Online food ordering service Foodpanda, backed by Rocket Internet, has become profitable in two large regions it operates in – Central and East Europe and the Middle East Asian countries. Zomato had also become profitable in 6 regions this year, including the Middle East countries. Once you’ve switched to “Wi-fi only”, the Google Maps app will work completely offline — no Wi-Fi needed! You will still be able to use other apps and the rest of your phone as you normally would. With this new update, they can now store offline areas in SD card too. As per recent data coming from the Indian Govt., it was revealed that during 2015-16, total of 5.24 crore Indians paid income tax, which is 4.2% of the total Indian population. Also, Govt. has identified 1.36 crore Indians who have tax liabilities, but didn’t file any returns last year. From now on, every Facebook user who had used ad-blockers such as Adblock Plus will have to accept advertisements on their desktops. The message is pretty simple: If you want to use a free service like Facebook, then you have to accept advertisements. However, Within 48 hours of Facebook’s announcement regarding their fight against adblockers, they have been beaten hands down. Adblock Plus, which is the leading the crusade against advertisements has announced a workaround which blocks all Facebook ads on desktops. In an industry-first move India’s leading telecom operator, Airtel has started offering extra data benefits to its home broadband users based on the number of Airtel connections (postpaid mobiles or DTH) they have. WhatsApp version 2.16.8 on iOS and 2.16.229 on Android brings this latest update to iPhone and iPad users, who can now leave a voice recording, or a voicemail, if the other person does not pick up the call or cancels it altogether. This feature had been on Android in the beta mode until now. Google had already excluded Flash from their advertising network and now everything on Google Chrome will be supported by HTML5. Flash will not be supported. In one of the most logically-challenged decision ever taken by a state government, AAP led Delhi Govt wants all taxi apps to switch to digital meters instead of GPS-based meters and has decided to completely ban surge pricing. Reliance Jio is planning to offer free Jio 4G SIM to anyone who purchases smartphone costing Rs. 10,000 and above. Under this preview offer, the users were offered unlimited 4G data, unlimited video calls and SMS, 4500 minutes of voice calls, and free access to Jio’s premium services The ongoing Independence Day sales promotions by major ecommerce portals such as Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal has angered offline traders, yet again. Complaints have been raised and notice have been sent to the Commerce Ministry for alleged violation of FDI norms in ecommerce. Kodak, widely known for imaging products and cameras, has entered the television market in India with 5 new HD LED televisions. The super-attractive market has seen the recent launches from LeEco, TCL and RInging Bells. TRAI has unveiled a new portal called TRAI MySpeed Analytics web portal, that will provide information to customers about the network coverage, quality of signals and status of call drops. Call drops have been scrutinized by TRAI for long now, but the telco association has hit back at TRAI every time they try to take an action. According to various reports that JioFi Router (a MiFi device) is now available to anyone starting tomorrow, and not just HP device owners. The JioFi MiFi device is a LYF product and would be available to the masses from 13th August at Reliance Digital, and Digital Xpress Mini stores at Rs. 2,899. Govt. of India has introduced a slew of labor reforms which will benefit all employees and workers in the organized sector. Besides paving way for creation of new jobs, these amendments in the Factories Act, 1948 and The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 will encourage conversion of unorganized sector into organized sector, thereby pushing our economy as a whole. In their annual ‘Richest People in Tech’ ranking for 2016, Forbes has declared Azim Premji as the richest tech billionaire in India with total assets worth $16.1 billion. He has been ranked #13 in the list. Canada-based low-cost tablet and smartphone maker, DataWind has launched another smartphone in its PocketSurfer series. Called as PocketSurfer GZ, the phone is priced at Rs. 1,499 and comes with 1 year free internet browsing. And, finally have a look at our most up-to-date Indian Startup Funding Deal list!

Rachel Aldrich Aug 15, 2016 5:18 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Apple (AAPL) were up in after-hours trading on Monday as Berkshire Hathaway (BKR.A) upped its stake in the company by 55%, CNBC reports.  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway held 15.2 million shares of Apple as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing. Three months earlier, the Omaha-based company held 9.8 million shares. The company's Apple stake was valued at $1.46 billion as of June 30, Bloomberg noted. Berkshire also reduced its Walmart (WMT) stake to 40.2 million shares from 55.2 million. (Apple is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS. See all of his holdings with a free trial.)  Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. TheStreet Ratings rated this stock as a "buy" with a ratings score of B. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, expanding profit margins and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.

Now its unconventional, controversial CEO, Jim Hagedorn, with support from his billion-dollar family, is gambling $400 million to reach a burgeoning market of customers: Pot growers By Dan Alexander Published: Aug 16, 2016 3388 3388 Image: Stephen webster for Forbes Strapped into the pilot’s seat of his private jet, Scotts Miracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn thrusts the throttle forward and hurtles down the runway, a typical start to the day for the former F-16 fighter pilot, who commutes 500 miles from his home on Long Island, New York to his office outside Columbus, Ohio. For an hour-and-a-half every morning and every ­afternoon, Hagedorn sits behind the control stick of his plane, pushes the seat back and lets his mind run wild. His latest idea: “Invest, like, half a billion in the pot business,” he yells over the roar of two engines powering his camouflaged Cessna Citation. “It is the biggest thing I’ve ever seen in lawn and garden.” No one has a better perspective on the lawn and garden business than Hagedorn, who, after watching his father build Miracle-Gro into a national brand, orchestrated its merger with Scotts in 1995 and took over as CEO of the combined company in 2001. Scotts Miracle-Gro, which makes almost all of its money selling grass seed, fertilizer, pesticide and dirt, boosted revenues by 80 percent from 2001 to 2009, riding on the coattails of Home Depot, Lowe’s and Wal-Mart as the retailers built more than 3,000 big boxes across the country. But then the Great Recession hit, and the rapid expansion stalled. Scotts Miracle-Gro’s sales have been stagnant ever since. That hit home for Hagedorn and his family, who collectively own a 27 percent stake that makes up $1.1 billion of their nearly $1.5 billion fortune. Frustrated with the flatlining business, Hagedorn fired more than half his management, shook up his board and gambled heavily on pot growers. That controversial decision was made one day in 2013 in Yakima, Washington, when Hagedorn wandered into a garden centre. The store had hardly any Scotts merchandise, but there was a massive row of equipment for hydroponics, a method of growing that allows people to cultivate cannabis (or any other plant, for that matter) indoors, using targeted lighting and liquid solutions spiked with nutrients. Hagedorn asked to see the store owner, and out walked a short guy with wild hair and a lazy eye. He told Hagedorn that everyone called him an idiot when he first started selling hydroponics equipment, but the stuff was flying off the shelves, with an average receipt of $400—straight cash. It was a starkly different scene from what he’d just witnessed at a Home Depot across town, which had plenty of Scotts Miracle-Gro products but no hydroponics equipment. “Two worlds, same town. I came back, and I told everyone, ‘We’re doing it’,” Hagedorn recalls. “If you don’t like it, leave. We’re doing it. It’s beyond stopping. And we’re not getting into pot growing. We’re talking dirt, fertilizer, pesticides, growing systems, lights. You know it’s a multibillion-dollar business, and we’ve got no growth in our core. Are you guys stupid?” Hagedorn is backing up his big talk with serious cash. He shelled out $135 million last year on two California-based businesses that sell fertilizers, soils and accessories to pot growers, recently spent another $120 million on a still-undisclosed lighting and hydroponics equipment company in Amsterdam and promises to invest about another $150 million by the end of 2016. Altogether, the deals are bigger than the largest single acquisition in the history of Scotts Miracle-Gro, which takes in $160 million of profit on $3 billion in sales annually. “For a lot of conventional companies, I don’t think they’d want to take the risk,” says Hagedorn, a short, bald 60-year-old with sharp blue eyes. “I mean I’ve talked to some other friends and CEOs who basically shake their head.” Among the dissenters is Carl Kohrt, one of six Scotts Miracle-Gro board members to step down in the past three years. “I’m not personally a supporter of the marijuana business,” says Kohrt. “Things change. Laws have changed. Interests have changed. Some personal values have not changed—mine included.” Values aside, the drug industry is a legal minefield. The federal government still labels cannabis as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, in the same class as heroin and LSD. But 25 states now allow medical marijuana, and four (plus the District of Columbia) have passed laws permitting recreational use. In 2013, the Obama Administration issued a memo deferring marijuana regulation to states, while at the same time reserving the federal government’s right to prosecute offenders in the future and challenge the states at any time (perhaps, say, if a new president is elected). Image: Stephen webster for Forbes Former F-16 fighter pilot Hagedorn often flies himself 500 miles by plane and 30 miles by helicopter from Long Island to his office in Ohio Growing up, Jim Hagedorn thought business was boring. His father, Horace, a one-time Madison Avenue adman, co-founded Miracle-Gro in 1951 and spent much of his time on the telephone talking about numbers and marketing plans. Jim was a horrible student who didn’t care about his schoolwork but spent study halls going through encyclopaedias cover to cover. His older sister Susan joined the Weathermen, a left-wing terror organisation that bombed the Pentagon and the US Capitol (she was not involved in either). After she was arrested for conspiracy to commit arson during a riot in Massachusetts, Horace Hagedorn headed north from Long Island to try to get his daughter off the hook. (She ended up serving two years’ probation.) While Horace was gone, Jim, then 15, threw a massive “pot party”, as he terms it, inviting over hordes of young people to get high. His father returned earlier than expected, walked into the ongoing party and burst into a fit of rage. Fearing for his safety, Jim called the police. (“As bad a kid as I was, he never hit me. I thought he was going to kill me this day,” he recalls.) The cops arrived at the door, and when Horace went down to answer it, Jim walked out of the house. He didn’t return for another two years. Hagedorn lived on radical communes, surrounded by guns and drugs. He and his gang of friends stole anything they wanted as their lives spiralled out of control. “Did I do drugs?” Hagedorn asks rhetorically. “I didn’t do heroin—I viewed heroin as a drug that poor addicts use—but when it came to hallucinogenics and speed and marijuana, cocaine. Hell, yes.” After a girlfriend broke his heart, he stumbled home to try to piece his life back together. His father made a donation to a boarding school in Vermont, and the school admitted Jim, by then 17, to its freshman class. Not long after, Hagedorn decided he wanted to be a professional pilot and headed to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. After enrolling, he took the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test, a military version of the SAT. To his surprise, he nearly aced the exam and the school offered him a full ride. Hagedorn’s father had promised all his children that if they earned scholarships, he would give them half of what they saved him. Hagedorn took the money and bought a BMW 5 Series. Six months into flight training, an Air Force major stared down 30 students. “I want everybody who wants to kill people to sit on one side,” Hagedorn recalls him saying. “And I want everybody who is going to fly the killer’s toilet paper around to sit on the other side.” The major walked up to him and asked him to choose his fate. Hagedorn wanted only to be an airline pilot; he was certain the aerobatics of flying fighter jets would make him sick. But so did the idea of being subservient to anyone. “Kill people, sir,” he answered. He flew fighters for seven years during the Cold War. In 1987, Hagedorn left the Air Force as a captain and interviewed at his family’s business, where his father asked him what role he saw himself taking at the company. He responded by saying there was only one job that he wanted—his father’s. Hagedorn was willing to learn the ropes for a few years, as long as he didn’t have to work in sales. His dad hired him and immediately threw him in the sales department.   In 1994, SC Johnson offered the Hagedorn family $400 million in cash to buy Miracle-Gro, and Jim, by that time an executive, came up with a counter-move. What if, instead of selling to the consumer products giant, he proposed a merger with Scotts, a sleepy Ohio business that was six times the size of Miracle-Gro but had slim profits and a market capitalisation of only $300 million. On January 26, 1995, Scotts, run by professional management and owned by institutional shareholders, and the much smaller Miracle-Gro merged in a deal that valued Hagedorn’s company at $195 million. It was less than half the price SC Johnson offered, but there was potential upside. In this deal, Jim and his family took their entire payment in equity and warrants, giving them a 41 percent stake in the merged company. Soon after the agreement closed, the Hagedorns learnt that Scotts’ management team had been inflating sales figures. The company had to restate its earnings in 1996, and the Hagedorns moved to boot the old management team, replacing them with Miracle-Gro folks, including Jim. Five years later, he took the top role himself. Image: Stephen webster for Forbes The Hagedorns kept looking for ways to take down competitors or, if that was not possible, to ally with them. In 1998, Scotts Miracle-Gro struck a $32 million deal to sell Monsanto’s herbicide Roundup and a $300 million agreement for pest-killer Ortho. (Today Ortho does nearly $300 million in revenue, and Roundup brings in $70 million in net profit annually.) The next year Hagedorn shelled out another $350 million to acquire lawn and garden companies in the United Kingdom and new markets like France, Germany and The Netherlands. By 2009, Scotts Miracle-Gro controlled more than half of the market in consumer pesticides, fertilizers, soils and grass seeds.   Hagedorn compares the lawn and garden business to warfare. “Oh, dude, in a lot of ways, I think it’s better,” he says. “Today the way wars happen, you don’t get to keep all the stuff. To me this is one where in commercial combat you kind of rape and pillage, and you keep all of the stuff.” That’s Hagedorn. Wildly offensive, hard-charging and, as even those who detest him admit, deceptively smart. He flies a plane named F-Bomb, draws business lessons from Osama bin Laden (“a massive piece of crap” but “a visionary”) and compares himself to the protagonist in the Showtime series Billions (“so focussed on winning that he’s a little bit of an animal”). There is a softer side. Just ask him about his family. From 1995 to 2007, Hagedorn flew back to Long Island every weekend to see his wife and three kids but spent most of his time in Ohio. After his daughter died in 2007, he started commuting back and forth every day so that he could be home for dinner every night. He typically flies with no one but his German shepherd, Scout, who rides on a built-in dog bed next to Hage­dorn’s seat in the cockpit. “There’s not another Scotts, and there’s not another Jim Hagedorn,” says Mark Baker, a former president of the company. “He is intense. He’s very smart. He’s sometimes exuberant, sometimes brutal—all in the same sentence, same day, same minute.” Hagedorn’s temperament has gotten him in trouble before. In 2011, he told a Wall Street Journal reporter off the cuff that he wanted to target the medical marijuana market. When the story hit the press, Scotts board members were shocked—both by the idea (which they immediately shot down) and the fact that Hagedorn had told a reporter about it before telling them. Two years later, the board was in turmoil for a different reason. On June 3, 2013, Scotts Miracle-Gro announced the resignation of three directors and explained the departures in an awkwardly worded SEC filing. All three had resigned “following a unanimously-supported reprimand of Hagedorn that stemmed from the use of inappropriate language,” the statement said, but none of the departures were “related to any disagreement relating to the company’s operations, policies, practices or financial reporting.” Although the details of what exactly occurred remained secret for years, even to Scotts’ employees, the abrupt resignations of three board members certainly raised eyebrows. “They were the three strongest and the three most willing to challenge Jim,” says one former senior executive. In reporting this story, Forbes uncovered publicly for the first time what actually happened. While discussing the movie Django Unchained with a newly hired African-American employee, Hagedorn repeatedly said the N-word, which is frequently used in the film. After receiving a complaint, the board of directors launched an investigation. The inquiry expanded into a larger review of the “tone at the top” of the organisation, sparking a war among board members. In the end, the board issued Hagedorn a unanimous reprimand, but he remained CEO. The African-American employee at the centre of the episode left Scotts Miracle-Gro and was paid undisclosed millions as part of a severance package that included non-disclosure covenants. Contacted by Forbes, she declined to ­comment. “The catalyst for this whole problem was me,” Hagedorn says. “I get that. I’m not super-apologetic about what happened. I wouldn’t do it again.” The incident left the board less independent than it had been. Six members have left since 2013 and only four new directors have joined Scotts, shrinking the board from 12 people to 10, including Hagedorn, who serves as chairman, and his twin sister, Katherine Hagedorn Littlefield, who is vice chairman. “I want to respect the board,” Hagedorn says. “I don’t feel like I have to get a lot of s*%# from the board.” Back on Long Island, just minutes from the Hagedorn family compound, sits the command centre for Scotts’ marijuana mission, set up in a nondescript white block building. The only sign that anyone of consequence is inside is the 1967 pastel-yellow Alfa Romeo convertible sitting outside. It belongs to Jim’s 31-year-old son, Chris, who is charged with turning his father’s wild idea into a reality. Twenty-seven years after dad Horace (in portrait) gave him a job at Miracle-Gro, Jim Hagedorn installed son Chris as head of his own subsidiary If the Hagedorn family didn’t own 27 percent of Scotts Miracle-Gro, Chris would not have his current job as president of subsidiary Hawthorne Gardening. When he was a teenager, he read an article explaining how the first generation typically creates a family business, the second generation expands it, and the third ruins it. So he decided to stay away from Scotts Miracle-Gro. He studied history at Bowdoin College, where he was admitted with help from his father, who knew the president. After graduation, he spent three years in advertising, writing commercials for fast-food hamburgers, then quit to write a novel. He ended up playing a lot of videogames instead. Eventually he got married and, while riding in the cockpit on the way back from his wedding, gave in and asked his father about joining the company. Jim put him in the marketing department (which Chris didn’t like), then eventually switched him over to the unit that oversees hydroponics (which he found more interesting). “As far as I was concerned, it was just a toe in the water, but [Jim] may have had other ideas,” says Alan Barry, who served on the Scotts board of directors from 2009 until his retirement in 2015. “This was Jim’s way of creating a job opportunity for his son. And it was small, and it would have no measurable impact on the company.” Last year, Chris helped lead the $120 million acquisition of General Hydroponics, which proved to be a tumultuous deal. The day before the agreement was to be finalised, Scotts’ outside lawyers refused to sign off. Their problem: Even though General Hydroponics did not sell marijuana, its founder had been growing cannabis as part of a side R&D operation. Jim Hagedorn wanted to pay the founder a consulting fee to continue working on his research for Scotts Miracle-Gro. But the lawyers refused to go along with it. Seeing no other option, Hagedorn agreed to leave the research out altogether and wrapped up the deal. That legal team has not worked on any Scotts’ hydroponics deals since. Undeterred, Hagedorn recently paid $120 million for a 75 percent stake in an Amsterdam-based lighting and hydroponics equipment outfit.   If Hagedorn’s antics don’t get in the way, his pot strategy may prove to be a success. General Hydroponics and its sister company, Vermicrop, brought in just $50 million in revenues when Scotts bought them in 2015. Now part of Chris’s subsidiary, the two companies have already increased sales by more than 20 percent, roughly four times the growth rate of the rest of Scotts, and operating margins are on track to be about 30 percent higher than the company average this year. The core business has been performing better lately as well, with profits up by 50 percent since Hagedorn fired more than half of his management team in the last four years. Scotts Miracle-Gro shares have increased by 13 percent in the past year (versus –1 percent for the S&P 500). This spring Miracle-Gro took its pot plan on the road. It began selling a new line of hydroponics equipment and soils called Black Magic (created by a scientist at the General Hydroponics office) in 141 Home Depot stores across Colorado and Washington (states where recreational pot is legal) and Michigan (where medical marijuana is legal). A bag of Black Magic costs $16, more than twice as much as typical potting soil. Vegetable growers may not notice much of a difference, and most wouldn’t bother paying the higher price. But one pound of cannabis is worth more than $2,000, meaning the calculus for growing weed is much different than it is for growing tomatoes. With that sort of math on his side, Chris predicts his division will someday be a billion-dollar business. The TV spot that launched Black Magic features tattooed growers working under neon lamps late at night to cultivate leafy greens. It first aired on April 20, the unofficial holiday for weed smokers everywhere. There are plenty of other opportunities, too. Take pesticides. Since marijuana is still a Schedule I drug, the federal government has not approved any pesticides for use on the plant, so growers are using corn pesticides as a substitute. But production at marijuana facilities keeps getting shut down by authorities, who are fine with businesses selling weed in certain states but don’t want people smoking dangerous chemicals. Scotts Miracle-Gro is now working with state governments to secure federal registrations that will indicate which pesticides can be used safely on cannabis. The ultimate plan: Roll out a line of branded pesticides specifically designed for pot. Hagedorn has not given up on growing his own marijuana, either. He is already looking into foreign markets like Israel, Canada and Jamaica, where Scotts might be able to legally set up labs to test its products and conduct cannabis research. Hagedorn’s most eye-opening idea: Someday expanding the company’s research on genetics into cannabis to create GMO marijuana. He says he is not ready to run that idea by the company’s directors—yet. Still he’s got his hand firmly on the throttle. “I’m pretty dominant and forceful here,” he says. “I admit, I’m an acquired taste. There are certain people who would say, ‘I wouldn’t want Hagedorn going out with my daughter. I don’t like how he runs the business’.” None of that deters him.

Covering Innovation & Inequality in Education Topics Blended Learning Teacher Preparation Higher Education Early Education Mississippi New Orleans All Topics About Hechinger About × Close × Menu Column Twitter Facebook Black families are the losers in NOLA’s nearly uncontested school board elections The stakes are high. So why is involvement so low? Degree of  Interest Column by Andre Perry August 16, 2016 Advertisement Democracy is more vibrant when participation is as wide as possible. It’s true on the national stage and it’s true in the New Orleans education arena. One would think that NOLA’s passion for education — the lawsuits, the big-money elections, the heated meetings and writings —would predict hot contests in the local school board election with thousands eligible in each district. But that’s not what has happened here in the Crescent City. Four of the seven district seats were decided before the November elections with little to no opposition. One of those was declared early due to a disqualification – the most tenured board member couldn’t prove she lived in the district. There’s a lot at stake in local school board elections. In recent years, state and local districts across the country have played a real life game of capture the flag in which pro- and anti-reform factions typify the teams. It’s to be determined if the new make up of the New Orleans School Board connotes a winner, but one thing is for sure: everyone loses when elections are not contested. School board elections at the state and local levels have always been incredibly important on setting the direction of schools. This is why Baton Rouge businessman Lane Grigsby‘s Empower Louisiana political action committee has been able to raise more than $2 million in 2015 from New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, Laura and John Arnold, Alice and Jim Walton of the Wal-Mart Waltons and Eli Broad. It’s the reason why American Federation of Teachers invested $450,000 into Jefferson Parish School Board election in 2014. Related: Veteran black principal lifts New Orleans school with strength and love An aside – let’s end the arguments from both sides of that inordinate amounts of money favors the opposition. We should discount the possibility that a shortage of contestants connotes an overall satisfaction with the system. Here’s an example of the high stakes: During the last election cycle, controversial initiatives like Common Core, charter schools, alternate route programs, vouchers and teacher tenure have all been on table for elected boards to consider in Louisiana and other states. Superintendents’ professional fates, depending on the state or district, often rest with elections results rather than academic performance. In New Orleans, the upcoming board will oversee the unification process – the transfer of approximately 50 independent charter schools under the Recovery School District to the Orleans Parish School Board by 2018. Larry J. Sabato said, “Every election is determined by the people who show up.” I get Sabato’s point when it comes to voters, but what happens when actual candidates for public office don’t show up? Numerous empirical studies have concluded there is a positive correlation between civic and social engagement (CSE). “Anyone with even a cursory familiarity with the literature on civic and social engagement may assume that linking education and CSE is an easy task, and can be summarized tidily: education has a universally positive effect on all forms of engagement,” wrote David Campbell. However, Campbell notes that few know why or if there is a positive relationship. The dearth of candidates relative to passion around the issue could be attributed to a number of things. We should discount the possibility that a shortage of contestants connotes an overall satisfaction with the system. Political noise by way of lawsuits and/or protests signifies disagreements with the current direction. It also evidences that engagement exists – but obviously not the kind that leads to a crowded field of contestants. Related: Column How education reform exacerbates sexism Ostensibly, it could reflect the quality or kind of education the population has received. A great educational system pumps the pipeline of elected officials. A negative educational system stifles it. Some will say that would-be elected officials are satisfying their civic and social urges by participating on one of the dozens of charter school boards. But these boards are a point of contention for those who oppose charter schools. From a political frame, the paltry contests could be the result of political strategy and power. Aspirant politicos could be discouraged by the prospects of being hurt politically, professionally or financially in a run. Resources can intimidate unorganized or under-resourced candidates. From this perspective, a short bench of candidates is a kind of waving a white flag. The dearth of politicos could reflect a wanting apparatus to groom people who have the will but not the way. All of these aforementioned reasons can explain the lack of candidates. I lean on philosopher W.E.B. Dubois whose writings’ on the Freedman’s Bureau offer an interesting explanation to the New Orleans case. Du Bois warned us in 1901 that overprotective, paternalistic structures endeavored to help the formerly enslaved, black community end up handicapping them. In the Freedmen’s Bureau’s noble efforts to create a system of free labor, free public schools and black businesses, Dubois said, “it failed … to guard its work wholly from paternalistic methods that discouraged self-reliance.” The parallels to the Recovery School District and the state’s efforts to reform schools are clear. Outside money, national education groups and the overall outlook that New Orleans can be a national model squeezed the political self-efficacy from people. Reforms being done and not by black folk has a negative effect. Sustainable reforms build capacity for local residents to create teacher pipelines, manage schools and run for public office. Having so few candidates isn’t a good sign that the current system is doing that, and it certainly doesn’t bode will for the future. Black folk are not in the position to accept status quo. Healthy debate helps inspire the policy changes that we need. Black families deserve the kinds of debates that typically come from elections. While some may see not having challengers as a political victory, it’s a sign that everyone has lost when schools aren’t able to generate a robust slate of choices to run them.

Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued its recovery. Makers of chemicals and mining companies made the biggest gains, and machinery companies and banks followed. Investors sold government bonds and utility and phone companies. Those stocks climbed earlier in the year as investors sought safety. Stocks have seesawed between small gains and losses for more than a week as investors consider mixed reports on the health of the economy and a decline in corporate earnings. That hasn’t stopped them from setting records, but it’s kept investors wary. “The market has run up in anticipation of better earnings ahead,” said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist for TIAA Investments. “If those earnings don’t come, we have the Wile E. Coyote moment where we’re off the cliff … and we’re gonna fall.” The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 59.58 points or 0.3 percent, to 18,636.05. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 6.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,190.15. The Nasdaq composite added 29.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,262.02. Second-quarter earnings are nearly all in the books, with this week’s releases from retailers Home Depot, Wal-Mart and Target among the last to appear. Corporate earnings are down once again this quarter and investors don’t expect much growth in the third quarter either, but they expect improvement after that. U.S. crude jumped $1.25, or 2.8 percent, to $45.74 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose $1.38, or 2.9 percent, to $48.35 a barrel in London. After a steep slide for most of June and July, the price of U.S. crude gained 6.4 percent last week. Drilling rig operator Transocean added 53 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $10.43. National Oilwell Varco picked up $1.04, or 3.1 percent, to $34.85 and ConocoPhillips rose 81 cents, or 2 percent, to $42.18. Chemicals company LyondellBasell Industries rose $2.16, or 2.9 percent, to $77.49 and mining company Freeport-McMoRan climbed 35 cents, or 3 percent, to $12.17. Aluminum producer Alcoa gained 35 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $10.52. Utility companies took the largest losses, as Southern Co. declined 86 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.49 and Consolidated Edison sank $1.88, or 2.4 percent, to $76.24. Phone companies and household goods makers also slipped. Real estate investment trust Mid-America Apartment Communities will buy competitor Post Properties for about $3.9 billion in stock. Both companies own large numbers of rental properties, and demand for rentals has boomed because people are being priced out of the housing market. The deal values Post Properties at about $72.53 a share based on Friday’s closing prices. The stock rose $5.86, or 9.4 percent, to $68.08 and Mid-America stock lost $5, or 4.9 percent, to $97.15. A survey showed that U.S. homebuilders are feeling optimistic about the market as prices and sales of homes rise. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index rose from last month.

After the Drone pilot lands, the Micro SD memory Card is removed from the Drone.

In order to view the footage drone users have to lug around a laptop with an SD Card Adapter. With the Gigastone device the Micro SD Card can be inserted into the Gigastone CR8600. The Gigastone CR8600 is then inserted into an iPhone or iPad via its Apple Lightning adapter. Using the complimentary Gigastone IOS Software the footage can be: Reviewed. Deleted or Backed Up to Cloud Storage or the iPhone/iPad. Uploaded to YouTube and other Social Channels. Kept on the Micro SD Card memory to save iPhone or iPad memory.

The state's largest independent grocery chain has purchased four Dallas stores in Uptown, Lake Highlands, Lakewood and Northwest Dallas.  Two more stores are in McKinney and Grapevine.  Sun Fresh is in the process of closing these stores. The stores have only been operated as Sun Fresh Markets for about a year.  The transaction will be completed in a few weeks, said H-E-B/Central Market spokeswoman Mabrie Jackson. "We're thrilled to have these properties." The four Dallas stores are former  Albertsons stores. The McKinney and Grapevine stores were Tom Thumb locations. These six stores are among a batch of stores that Albertsons was forced  to sell as part of an antitrust review of its 2015 acquisition of Tom Thumb's parent company Safeway. H-E-B  isn't sure yet how it plans to use the stores.  "At this time, Central Market continues to be the primary format for the Dallas-Fort Worth," said Todd Piland, H-E-B executive vice president of real estate. "We are currently evaluating the feasibility of each site to determine the most effective use of the properties." But still there will be speculation about whether any stores might become H-E-B or Central Market.  It could take several months for these stores to reopen. The stores are located at: -- McKinney  - Hardin Boulevard and El Dorado Parkway -- Grapevine  - State Highway 121 and Hall Johnson Road -- Dallas - McKinney Avenue and Lemmon Avenue -- Dallas - Northwest Highway and Midway Road -- Dallas - Northwest Highway and Ferndale Road -- Dallas - Mockingbird Lane and Abrams Road H-E-B has been buying up land in recent years, but these are the first buildings the retailer has purchased with one exception. A few years ago, Central Market, bought the former Borders Bookstore at the southeast corner of Preston Road and Royal Lane in Preston Hollow and converted it.  H-E-B owns about 20 parcels of land in the North Texas region, including in Allen, Carrollton, Corinth, Dallas, DeSoto, Fort Worth, Frisco, Grand Prairie, Mansfield, McKinney, Murphy and Plano. This acquisition puts H-E-B into more established Dallas neighborhoods in addition to the two fast growing suburbs of McKinney and Grapevine. It operates two Central Market stores in Dallas and one each in Plano, Southlake and Fort Worth.   The H-E-B stores are south of Dallas and Fort Worth in Burleson, Cleburne, Corsicana, Granbury, Ennis and Waxahachie.  "We are evaluating the feasibility of each property acquired in this real estate transaction as part of our long term real estate investment portfolio," Jackson said.  But a move into Dallas with its traditional grocery store is something that competitors have expected for a longtime. Today, H-E-B, which dominates in the state with Wal-Mart, only has a 1.9 percent market share in the Dallas area.  Last year, H-E-B reached the top of the Houston market and this year it widened that lead to a 23.5 percent share. It grew larger than former leaders there, Kroger and Wal-Mart.  H-E-B has taken a different approach to the Dallas market. It first opened in Houston in the 1990s with small 20,000-square-foot Pantry stores. In the 2000s, it started building its larger H-E-B stores there. Ray Schalek, of RLS Supermarkets of Carrollton, approached H-E-B about selling the six stores. In June, RLS sold 11 stores to Houston-based Fiesta Mart. Those stores are in the process of being converted to Fiesta Mart. RLS will still operate the Sun Fresh store at 7007 Arapaho Road in Far North Dallas and two Cash Saver stores in southern Dallas at at 2130 East Ledbetter and 1201 W. Camp Wisdom, Schalek said.  The longtime San Angelo grocer, moved into the Dallas market in 2011 with the purchase of  what was left of the Minyard Food Store chain from a Fort Worth investment firm. He declined to comment on his decision to give up on the Dallas-Fort Worth market at least with the former Minyard, Albertsons and Tom Thumb stores that he converted into Sun Fresh Markets in 2015. Dallas-Fort Worth is one of the most competitive markets in the U.S. Not having a big corporate organization behind him likely made it harder to operate here.  Twitter: @MariaHalkias Related links:  Texas' heavyweight food fight: H-E-B vs. Wal-Mart in Lone Star grocery war Can D-FW grocery stores compete with growing 'basket bandits' threat?

Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued its recent recovery. Makers of chemicals and mining companies made the biggest gains, and machinery companies and banks followed. Investors sold government bonds and utility and phone companies. Those stocks climbed earlier in the year as investors sought safety. Stocks have seesawed between small gains and losses for more than a week as investors consider mixed reports on the economy and corporate earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 59.58 points or 0.3 percent, to 18,636.05. The S&P’s 500 index rose 6.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,190.15. The Nasdaq composite added 29.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,262.02. Second-quarter earnings are nearly all in, with this week’s releases from Home Depot, Wal-Mart and Target. Corporate earnings are down once again this quarter and investors don’t expect much growth in the third quarter either, but they are starting to expect improvement after that. U.S. crude jumped $1.25, or 2.8 percent, to $45.74 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose $1.38, or 2.9 percent, to $48.35 a barrel in London. After a steep slide for most of June and July, the price of U.S. crude gained 6.4 percent last week. Drilling rig operator Transocean added 53 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $10.43. National Oilwell Varco picked up $1.04, or 3.1 percent, to $34.85 and ConocoPhillips rose 81 cents, or 2 percent, to $42.18. Utility companies took the largest losses, as Southern Co. declined 86 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.49 and Consolidated Edison sank $1.88, or 2.4 percent, to $76.24. Phone companies and household goods makers also slipped. Real estate investment trust Mid-America Apartment Communities will buy competitor Post Properties for about $3.9 billion in stock. Both companies own large numbers of rental properties, and demand for rentals has boomed in recent years because many people are being priced out of the housing market. The deal values Post Properties at about $72.53 a share based on Friday’s closing prices. The stock rose $5.86, or 9.4 percent, to $68.08 and Mid-America stock lost $5, or 4.9 percent, to $97.15. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.40 a gallon. Heating oil gained 4 cents to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas held steady at $2.59 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold rose $4.30 to $1,347.50 an ounce. Silver advanced 14 cents to $19.85 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.15 a pound. The dollar fell to 101.25 yen from 101.27 yen and the euro rose to $1.1183 from $1.1164. Japan’s economy grew at a lower-than-forecast 0.2 percent pace in the April-June quarter, as private demand and exports remained weak. That could push the Bank of Japan to take additional steps to stimulate the national economy. The bank approved a new stimulus package earlier this month, but that wasn’t enough to please investors. Germany’s DAX was up 0.2 percent and the CAC 40 of France dipped less than 0.1 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged 0.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 0.7 percent.

News Hain Celestial Crashes On Earnings Delay, Miss On Accounting Woes Hain Celestial tumbled early Tuesday Monday on accounting issues that will delay quarterly results. (Hain Celestial) ED CARSON 8/16/2016 Reprints Hain Celestial (HAIN) lost more than a fourth of its value Tuesday after the organic and natural foods maker late Monday delayed its fiscal Q4 financial results due to accounting concerns. Hain also said it would likely miss its prior fiscal 2016 guidance. Hain Celestial, which supplies Whole Foods Market (WFM), Kroger (KR), Wal-Mart (WMT) and other grocers, said revenue recognition was at issue. Hain said in a statement: "During the fourth quarter, the Company identified concessions that were granted to certain distributors in the United States. The Company is currently evaluating whether the revenue associated with those concessions was accounted for in the correct period and is also currently evaluating its internal control over financial reporting." Hain had been set to report fiscal Q4 results on Tuesday. Hain will also delay its annual 10-K SEC filing. And don't expect good news when results are finally released: "The Company does not expect to achieve its previously announced guidance for fiscal year 2016." Hain Celestial fell 26.3% by the closing bell to 39.35 on the stock market today, tumbling to a 5-month low intraday and plunging below the 50-day line. IBD'S TAKE: "Accounting" is rarely a word that investors want to hear. But expect to hear it often as the SEC is set to enact big changes to revenue recognition rules. For due diligence you should learn more about the SEC revenue rule and how everyone from AT&T to Microsoft is bracing for it.   ED CARSON | Facebook | @IBD_ECarson Share this: Related news A federal judge blocked President Obama's new overtime rule, but Wal-Mart already gave managers a raise.

Global stocks mostly rose Monday, Aug. 15, 2016, despite subdued growth figures for Japan, as investors looked ahead to U.S. economic data this week as well as the minutes to the Federal Reserve's last meeting. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks closed at a record high Monday behind gains for chemical and machinery companies. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued its recent recovery. Makers of chemicals and mining companies made the biggest gains, and machinery companies and banks followed. Investors sold government bonds and utility and phone companies. Those stocks climbed earlier in the year as investors sought safety. Stocks have seesawed between small gains and losses for more than a week as investors consider mixed reports on the health of the economy and a decline in corporate earnings. That hasn't stopped them from setting records, but it's kept investors wary. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "The market has run up in anticipation of better earnings ahead," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist for TIAA Investments. "If those earnings don't come, we have the Wile E. Coyote moment where we're off the cliff...and we're gonna fall." The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 59.58 points or 0.3 percent, to 18,636.05. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 6.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,190.15. The Nasdaq composite added 29.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,262.02. Second-quarter earnings are nearly all in the books, with this week's releases from retailers Home Depot, Wal-Mart and Target among the last to appear. Corporate earnings are down once again this quarter and investors don't expect much growth in the third quarter either, but they are starting to expect improvement after that. U.S. crude jumped $1.25, or 2.8 percent, to $45.74 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose $1.38, or 2.9 percent, to $48.35 a barrel in London. After a steep slide for most of June and July, the price of U.S. crude gained 6.4 percent last week. Drilling rig operator Transocean added 53 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $10.43. National Oilwell Varco picked up $1.04, or 3.1 percent, to $34.85 and ConocoPhillips rose 81 cents, or 2 percent, to $42.18. Chemicals company LyondellBasell Industries rose $2.16, or 2.9 percent, to $77.49 and mining and energy company Freeport-McMoRan climbed 35 cents, or 3 percent, to $12.17. Aluminum producer Alcoa gained 35 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $10.52. Utility companies took the largest losses, as Southern Co. declined 86 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.49 and Consolidated Edison sank $1.88, or 2.4 percent, to $76.24. Phone companies and household goods makers also slipped. Real estate investment trust Mid-America Apartment Communities will buy competitor Post Properties for about $3.9 billion in stock. Both companies own large numbers of rental properties, and demand for rentals has boomed in recent years because many people are being priced out of the housing market. The deal values Post Properties at about $72.53 a share based on Friday's closing prices. The stock rose $5.86, or 9.4 percent, to $68.08 and Mid-America stock lost $5, or 4.9 percent, to $97.15. Water treatment company Xylem announced a $1.7 billion deal for Sensus, a company that provides smart meters, network technology, and analytics used by water, electric and gas utilities. Xylem stock advanced $1.87, or 3.9 percent, to $50.32. A survey showed that U.S. homebuilders are feeling more optimistic about the market as prices and sales of new homes rise. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index rose from last month. In June new home sales grew by the fastest pace in eight years, aided by continuing job growth and low mortgage rates. Toll Brothers gained 89 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $28.86 and Lennar added 55 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $47.30. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.40 a gallon. Heating oil gained 4 cents to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas held steady at $2.59 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold rose $4.30 to $1,347.50 an ounce. Silver advanced 14 cents to $19.85 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.15 a pound. The dollar fell to 101.25 yen from 101.27 yen and the euro rose to $1.1183 from $1.1164. Japan's economy grew at a lower-than-forecast 0.2 percent pace in the April-June quarter, as private demand and exports remained weak. That could push the Bank of Japan to take additional steps to stimulate the national economy. The bank approved a new stimulus package earlier this month, but that wasn't enough to please investors. Germany's DAX was up 0.2 percent and the CAC 40 of France dipped less than 0.1 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.4 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 edged 0.3 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.7 percent.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Salt Lake City police cancel Amber Alert for 3-year-old girl who is found safe in Hawaii BYU football: RB coach Reno Mahe's daughter clings to life after hanging accident Ed Kimball, who wrote warts-and-all biographies of his father, Mormon leader Spencer Kimball, dies | Utah lawmaker accuses charter school of skirting procurement law BYU basketball: Title belt at stake as Cougs get rematch with Valparaiso ELEVATE During National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month the Focus is Keeping Caregivers Healthy   Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

That’s more than the next seven countries combined and 10 times the budget of the State Department. Today on Think, Krys Boyd talked with Georgetown University law professor Rosa Brooks about how the U.S. has blurred the line between war and peace time. She’s the author of “How Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything: Tales from the Pentagon.” The KERA Interview Listen Listening... / Rosa Brooks on … … the growth of the military: “There are more members of military marching bands than there are of foreign service officers of the State Department. The State Department cannot compete when the military moves into areas. It’s just too tiny and too underfunded. And the less it does, the more political leaders turn to the military to take on the tasks that state and USAID once would have done. And the more the military does, the less anybody needs those civilian agencies.” … how the military is like Wal-Mart: “Instead of having to go to five different stores, if you’re saying, ‘Gee, what can we do in Afghanistan?’ And you’re thinking well we want to do some agricultural reform and we need to fight these remaining Taliban groups here and there, and we also need to train judges and parliamentarians and so forth, you can go to the military and say, ‘Just get all this stuff done.’ And the military will say, ‘OK, we’ll get all that stuff done.’ They may not do it that well. It may not be the highest quality, not because they’re not smart people, but because this is not what military people have been trained to do.”    … the casualties of drone warfare: “The Obama administration said that in almost eight years there have only been a handful of civilian casualties, 150, something like that. Other groups, journalists and human rights groups, say that number is vastly higher - possibly even in the thousands. In explaining that your either have to think that the government is lying, which I don’t think is what’s going on, or you have to assume that when the Obama administration and journalists and NGOs talk about civilians they mean something that’s very, very different. And I think this is the profound problem with the process: That at the moment we don’t really know what counts as war anymore. We don’t know who counts as any enemy.”   … why it’s difficult to cut military spending: “It sometimes seems like everybody in Congress has either a military base or a weapons manufacturing industry in their district, which in turn means that everybody wants that [military spending] to continue because it’s good for their constituents. It’s jobs for their constituents, which makes it really, really hard for the military to change.”   Tags:  Military Defense Terrorism TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread. © 2016 KERA News KERA Kids and Family Art&Seek Tellyspotting KXT 91.7 Discussion Policy Contact Us
