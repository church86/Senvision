(Source: Nogales Police Department) Lingering smoke inside the Walmart. (Source: Nogales Police Department) (Source: Nogales Police Department) (Source: Nogales Police Department) NOGALES, AZ (Tucson News Now) - The Nogales Police Department is investigating a suspicious fire at a Walmart in Nogales.  According to a recent release the incident happened on Thursday, May 4, when NPD officers responded to a call around 10:45 p.m. about a possible fire at Walmart.  When NPD and the Nogales Fire Department arrived on scene they found thick smoke inside the store near the garden and hardware department. They quickly moved several shoppers and employees from the store as a safety precaution.   Two quick thinking employees put the fire out, preventing an incident of a much larger scale, stated the release.   Store employees told NPD that a young boy was seen on surveillance cameras setting fire to store merchandise in the hardware and paints department with a lighter and then running away. According to the release a lighter was found at the scene where the fire began.   Officers located the boy, a 7-year-old, in the store parking lot with his mother.  Employees identified him as the child seen on the surveillance video.   The mother told officers that she had been separated from her son for a few minutes and that he was not the one responsible for setting the fire. According to NPD she then told officers she was going to speak to an attorney and that the officers would not be able to speak to her son.  No arrests have been made, though charges of arson, criminal damage, and endangerment were referred to the local juvenile probation department and the Santa Cruz County Attorney's Office on the 7-year-old, according to the release.  Walmart remained closed the rest of Thursday night for clean up and to prevent the risk of smoke inhalation. There were no reported injuries to employees or shoppers.   Final figures for damages and losses are reportedly at $30,000 or higher, according to Walmart management.  The NPD release stated this was not the first fire reported at this Walmart. In a separate incident reported on March 14, the 7-year-old from the May 4 fire and his 11-year-old brother were suspected of setting fire to clothing around 11 p.m.  According to the release employees saw the two boys running from the clothing department where the fire began, and another witness reported they saw one of the boys with a lighter before they left the store. In the March 14 incident, store surveillance also led police to the alleged suspects and the mother stated her children had nothing to do with the fire and she was consulting an attorney. In this case the mother also prevented the children from speaking with the police.   Charges of criminal damage were referred to the local juvenile probation department and the Santa Cruz County Attorney's Office on the two boys.   Walmart employees told the Nogales police that these were not the only fires to have been set at the store, according to the release, there were two previous incidents not reported to the police.  MOBILE USERS: Download our app on your Apple and Android devices.

Rendering courtesy of the city of Eastvale. By Neil Nisperos | nnisperos@scng.com | Daily Bulletin May 5, 2017 at 5:41 pm EASTVALE >> Eastvale city council members recently voted to approve a new shopping center to be anchored by a Wal-Mart supercenter, called Eastvale Crossings. The project, planned for the southeast corner of Limonite and Archibald avenues, was approved unanimously April 26. The Wal-Mart will be 192,000 square feet and also feature a gas station on 25-plus acres, according to city documents. Further development on additional parcels is subject to later Planning Commission review, Eastvale City Manager Michele Nissen, said by phone. The project will also feature a drive-through pharmacy, according to city planning documents. Officials said a time frame for construction has yet to be determined. “The approval is the first step,” Wal-Mart spokeswoman Delia Garcia aid by phone. “We’re very early in the process here.” The project is expected to serve not only Eastvale but the surrounding communities of Ontario, Chino, Norco and Jurupa Valley, officials said. “We know that many of our customers are already shopping at other Wal-Marts in Chino and Corona, and this will be a convenience to our Eastvale customers, but we’ll also serve a broader area,” Garcia said. The new Wal-Mart supercenter is also expected to generate about $375,000 a year in sales tax revenue for the city, Nissen said. Average sales tax revenue for a Wal-Mart supercenter can range from $250,000 to $900,000 annually, Nissen said, so the estimate is conservative. “Those dollars go straight into the city’s general fund,” Nissen said. “Ultimately, it’s up to the City Council and myself to decide how those dollars are spent, but it’s based on the needs of the community.” The new center is expected help to ease a particular challenge for the city, Councilman Brandon Plott said by phone. “For the last six years, we’ve been able to maintain a solvent budget, but it’s been very challenging,” Plott said. “The topic of gaining more sales tax revenue comes up and Wal-Mart brings that to the city.” The project is expected to create 100 construction jobs and 300 new retail jobs for the city, Nissen said. The new Wal-Mart, which will have a full grocery department, should make a meaningful impact on the marketplace, Plott said. “It does bring a level of service to the city that the residents want,” Plott said. “People can shop for something at a lower price and it brings a level of competition to the city, which is good for our local economy. I think people want to pay lower prices for products.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

The company committed to reducing its own emissions 18% by 2025 from 2015 levels, and to cutting 1 gigaton of emissions from its value chain by 2030. As the largest retailer in the world, Walmart’s move was seen as a turning point for the initiative, which champions emissions reduction targets as a way to limit global temperature increases. “It’s the first time we’ve had the ability to understand what we need to do to be in alignment with what climate science suggests should be done,” says Joby Carlson, director of energy and operations sustainability for Walmart. Carlson, who is participating in a keynote session at the 2017 Environmental Leader Conference in June, spoke with us about how the company approaches environmental initiatives while seeing a positive financial return. What sustainability trends are you seeing? The lead up to COP 21 and ultimately the Paris Agreement made 2015 the year of climate in many ways. We saw an alignment across governments and businesses saying there’s a real business benefit to acting on emissions, climate change, and sustainability in general. It can’t all rest on the government. Businesses can take action. The biggest thing that came out was the Science Based Targets initiative. Leading NGOs and the UN got together to develop a methodology to recognize companies and organizations that set reduction targets in line with what scientists tell us is needed to keep global temperatures within 2 degrees Celsius. Finally there’s a common measurement. Before, you never knew if a company was doing enough to be in line with that the planet really needs. Companies can sign up to the ambition of the Paris Agreement. It’s more top-down, where your part is defined. Then you have to figure out a way to get there. You see a lot of major companies trying to understand if it’s right for them.   How does Walmart approach environmental initiatives? We try not to do anything that doesn’t have a good financial return. Sustainability has to hit the balance among the economics, the environmental, and the social side. Energy efficiency has been our bread and butter. We are a low-cost retailer so we are sensitive about the cost of operations. Optimizing and reducing our energy demand has translated into millions and millions [in savings]. In the case of the trucking fleet, we’re saving a billion dollars a year based on fuel efficiency compared with 2005. We’re getting to the point in some of our markets where we’re done with the low-hanging fruit on energy efficiency. Now we’re pushing the envelope. How can we do things differently? What is the role of data systems? How do we engage our equipment manufacturers in thinking about the complete lifecycle of equipment in terms of energy efficiency? That all has direct business value. We’re also number one in the country for the number of facilities with solar energy on the roof. Our onsite solar program is about 15% of our renewable energy portfolio, but those systems allow us to have consistent, stable energy costs. In many cases they’re actually saving us money over conventional energy. Are there any hurdles to expanding renewable energy? The energy policy in the United States is complex. Each state has a different way of treating it. We advocate for certain principles around customers’ access to choice and to low-cost options for clean energy. We go state by state and evaluate which ones have the best opportunities to do renewable energy. There are states that have rules preventing third-party contracts. We joined collective corporate organizations to overcome some of these challenges, and push utilities and states to be more progressive. We’ve looked at doing the same thing internationally as well. In certain markets it’s nearly impossible to do any kind of renewable energy even though there are plenty of renewable energy sources available. It’s a matter of forming policies that enable companies and organizations to do the right thing. What are the biggest challenges involved in pursuing sustainability targets? We’ve grown our sales and operations since the beginning. When you have an absolute emissions reduction, you have to overcome new growth at the same time. For instance, we had a goal in 2005 to reduce our carbon footprint of existing buildings 20% by 2012. We accomplished that, but it’s hard to show because we also grew the company by almost 50% during that time — and that overshadowed the reduction we were getting from existing buildings. Reducing the total emissions while you’re trying to grow means you have to do twice as much. While we are investing in energy efficiency that has a good payback, we have to think about upgrading our data systems, expanding our trucking fleet, remodeling or building new stores. The push and pull between business growth and spending money on improving the efficiency of existing assets is a challenge. What advice do you have for other companies working to balance those priorities? You’re trying to find the sweet spot. We focus on locations that have the highest cost of energy, but make sure we’re doing it in areas that have the most emissions as well. Finding a balance between the business return and the environmental return is a good way of approaching it. We’re also using our scale to drive down costs. We have retail operations in 28 countries. Historically all of them were responsible for buying light bulbs or negotiating costs. But we can gather our collective demand, and we did this a few years ago with a global bid for LED lighting, which ultimately sent a signal to the market. We were able to get a reduced cost for that equipment. That made it possible to go after a technology that wasn’t financially feasible before. What commitments has Walmart made? We aim to reduce our own direct Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 18% by 2025, based on 2015 levels. And because the majority of the footprint is in our value chain, including Scope 3 emissions, we set an ambitious goal of reducing 1 gigaton — 1 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent — up and downstream of our operations by 2030. We can’t do that alone because it requires innovation from manufacturers that produce the equipment for our stores, our trucks, and the millions of goods we sell. The Scope 3 reduction will also take collective effort from a variety of suppliers across industries, looking at what we can do together to address issues deep in our supply chain, on the farm, in the field, in the forest. Which trends do you think will emerge in the next few years? Measurement and transparency are key. One thing we struggle with in our supply chain is having true traceability. We’re working hard on that. There are innovative technologies we’ve started to pilot like blockchain with IBM. We’re at the cusp of thinking about that for sustainability — what are the practices used to produce this item, whether it’s agricultural, apparel, or something else? We will continue to see a focus on climate. I think you’ll see companies that have led on climate and energy topics continue to do that. It doesn’t seem like it will get easier, but people will still hold to their original aspirations on global issues. That’s what we’re seeing in the industry. Joby Carlson will be speaking at the Environmental Leader Conference in Denver June 5-7, 2017. His closing keynote session, The Path Forward for Environmental and Energy Management: New Solutions in a Swiftly Changing Corporate Landscape, starts at 3 pm on June 7.

By Radar Staff Posted on May 5, 2017 @ 16:11PM Anne Marie Kehoe, the Vice President of Toys at Walmart took some time from enjoying all the events going on at The Bentonville Film Festival to speak exclusively with Radar about the significance of Walmart’s collaboration with the summit. Co-founded by Academy Award winner Geena Davis, the mission of the festival is to promote inclusion across all forms of media. “I’m proud of Walmart, and I’m proud of Bentonville,” says Anne. “I think this gives us a chance to showcase who we are and be a part of something bigger than us. As for media’s influence on diversity awareness, she admits, “entertainment is so influential and so I I just appreciate what Geena Davis has done.

By Radar Staff Posted on May 5, 2017 @ 15:32PM David Scott, the Senior Vice President of Talent and Organizational Effectiveness at Walmart could not contain his enthusiasm about the third annual Bentonville Film Festival, and it’s easy to see why not. It looks like a blast! He spoke with Radar exclusively about why inclusiveness is so important to Walmart, who is the founding sponsor of the huge event. “It’s a critical part of just being a part of the community here in Bentonville. Not only from a Walmart perspective. It’s a really important voice for us to have about diversity and inclusion, not just in media, but also the role that it plays in the entire world. So we’re very excited to be a sponsor of The Bentonville Film Festival.” As for why the summit is such a hit, David said, “What an amazing event to bring here to Bentonville! You wouldn’t believe the excitement that it generates just on the street. Whether you’re sitting down having a cup of coffee, walking through the Bentonville Square, sitting on one of the panels, or going to one of the films that are here. Just the sheer energy and excitement that this film festival brings is a highlight for all of us who live in Bentonville.” Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Share Bentonville Film Festival Comments 36 Hot Photos Very Important Photos: Here’s Who We Spotted Out And About In The Last 24 Hours Radar's Free Newsletter TheDailyJuice Thank you for subscribing!

A patent for the invention is still pending after an application was filed in October. It was first unearthed by the consumer blog CB Insights. The move would enable Walmart, the nation's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, to compete with online giant Amazon's Dash button, a device that enables consumers to automatically order replacements for things like soda, over-the-counter medication or toothpaste by tapping a button. Walmart said in its filing the sensors could have other applications, such as tracking consumer data and enabling the retailer to tailor marketing plans to individual consumers. Radio sensors in clothing could track when an article of clothing is becoming ragged and order a new one. Sensors on a gallon of milk could detect when it is approaching its expiration date and order more. Walmart declined to comment on the application and it is common for companies to seek patents on ideas that are never developed or put into use.

This article takes a look at three places we regularly see QR Codes in the world of mobile payments and why we should pay attention. By Heidi Tolliver-Walker Published: May 5, 2017 While QR Codes have been used for years in direct marketing, they are only more recently being used more widely for mobile banking and payments. This is an interesting development and speaks to the growing acceptance of QR Codes as a more sophisticated tool for problem solving and information delivery. Here are three places I’ve seen QR Codes in the world of mobile banking and payments recently and why it matters. Wal-Mart check-out. If you use the self-checkout at Wal-Mart, you will be greeting with a giant QR Code on the payment screen.  The code is part of Wal-Mart Pay, an option first introduced by the retail giant in 2015 and which is now officially available in all 4,600+ stores nationwide. Wal-Mart Pay is a feature built into the Wal-Mart mobile app that allows customers to use a smartphone to pay for in-store purchases. By making it part of an app, Wal-Mart is able to address any security concerns. Everything is stored in a secure, cloud-based environment, and no payment credentials are transmitted at the physical register. Wal-Mart Pay also stores electronic receipts, gift card dollars, and offers other neat features. According to Wal-Mart’s internal statistics, Wal-Mart Pay was up 45% in usage as of July 2016, and 38% of payments come from repeat users. In addition, 82% of customers would recommend the QR-Coded Wal-Mart Pay to others.   First National Bank direct mail. On the back of mailings from First National Bank are QR Codes encouraging people to learn about doing their banking online. The code does not take customers to their financial information, but rather to a mobile site allowing them to watch short videos on the benefits of the service. Customers are directed to their online accounts or to a local branch to sign up. McDonald’s payment window. McDonald’s has been using QR Codes for some time, and like Wal-Mart, the magic happens within the branded app.  McDonald’s first began testing mobile payments in 2014, and by 2018, it plans to have 25,000+ stores using the system. This will help the chain catch up to its competitors, such as Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, and Check-fil-A, which already have mobile payment and customer service apps. Granted, not many printers are going to be helping their customers with mobile apps or payments, but what’s important here is the who and the what. We are seeing adoption 1) by large brands and 2) for sensitive transactions applications, both of which suggest a level of acceptance and trust in these tools. If you have customers skittish about using QR Codes as “new” or “untrusted,” these are three great examples for combatting this misperception.    Tweet       Email    Print    Order Reprints Heidi Tolliver-Walker Heidi is an industry analyst specializing in digital, one-to-one, personalized URL, and Web-to-print applications.

In a patent publicly revealed this week and spotted by CB Insights, the company describes a system of connected sensors that could monitor customers’ product consumption. The sensors would be attached to products and rely on a variety of technology, like radio frequencies, Bluetooth, conventional barcodes, and RFID tags. Walmart doesn’t suggest that any one sensor type would work best; rather, it lays out its options. Apparently it has a lot of ideas: these tags would all track how often a product is used and where it’s located in a home. They could also help Walmart figure out what other products it could market to users based off their purchases. A tag reader installed on a fridge, for example, could scan every item that goes inside. This reader could then track when food is going bad or needs to be reordered. On the other hand, an RFID system could figure out when a person is picking up their toothbrush and use that information to estimate how much toothpaste is left. It could then be automatically reordered. More than anything, Walmart stresses that these tags will help collect valuable data on consumers, which is off-putting, especially if you don’t want your retailer to know everything about your consumption habits. Still, it’s entirely possible Walmart will never actually implement any of these ideas.

Whether it's a dislike of banks, a distaste for their fees, or some other reason, a sizable portion of U.S. households have chosen not to have a checking or savings account at a financial institution, and Wal-Mart has ensured they have a place to go. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 934.15 -3.38 -0.36% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 76.50 +0.16 +0.21% American Express Co AXP ▼ 78.32 -0.01 -0.01% Through its 1,200 money centers, unbanked consumers can meet all of their banking needs at greatly reduced cost. From paying bills to wiring money here or abroad, Wal-Mart has made it cheap, easy, and convenient to bank without a bank. Now it's about to get some sizable competition from Amazon, which recently launched its Amazon Cash program that specifically targets this same subset of the population. Cashing out of banks According to the FDIC, some 9 million households, or 7% of all U.S. households, do not have an account at an insured institution. Moreover, almost 20% of households, or 24.5 million households in the country, are "underbanked" -- they have a checking or savings account, but also used other non-bank services for their banking needs. While conventional thinking has led us to believe that banks are the be-all, end-all of finance, it also shows that a huge swath of the population has a high level of distrust of or dissatisfaction with traditional financial institutions. Wal-Mart offered them a better option. It had once tried to enter the banking industry by applying for an industrial loan corporation charter, or ILC, that would have allowed it to establish a low-cost financial-services arm similar to ones that Target, GE, and others operate, but banks raised a hue and cry against Wal-Mart, and the retailer subsequently withdrew its application. Today, Wal-Mart helps the unbanked by offering an entire suite of financial services, which, in addition to the services mentioned earlier, also lets customers cash payroll and government checks, get prepaid debit cards, and print personal and business checks. Its Bluebird financial accounts, arranged through American Express, essentially allow customers to bank without a bank. Although these financial services total less than 1% of Wal-Mart's annual net revenues, that's still more than $4 billion worth of financial business being conducted, and it recently noted that the volume of money services transactions it's making can be measured "with a B." It's no wonder Amazon.com is looking to get in on the action. Cashing in on opportunity Amazon Cash isn't yet so grandiose as a Wal-Mart Money Center, but it is specifically targeted to the unbanked consumer and may provide a platform for future expansion. Amazon customers won't need a checking account to deposit between $15 and $500 in cash into an Amazon account. Instead, they can go to one of 10,000 retail stores from the likes of CVS, Speedway, Sheetz, and others and simply present a barcode from Amazon that they've either printed out or downloaded to a smartphone. There are also no fees to use the service. This is big because these are customers that have arguably been ignored previously by the e-tailer. Typically, you need a bank account to access Amazon services, and often it pays to be a Prime member. Not so with Amazon Cash, which is open to anyone. As Wal-Mart and Amazon continuously clash for retail dominance, every consumer becomes more valuable. By making its platform more accessible, Amazon can siphon off additional customers, and because Amazon Cash will be available both on smartphones and via analog means -- such as printing out a barcode -- the retailer is able to include the third of unbanked adults who don't yet have a smartphone. Start small, grow big Initially, it would seem Wal-Mart won't lose many customers to Amazon because money deposited at the e-commerce leader can only be spent on Amazon. Even PayPal, which has its own online cash service, is open to use at thousands of retailers, while Wal-Mart customers have an array of financial services available to them at its brick-and-mortar stores, and soon via mobile phone. Yet Amazon is only just tapping into this demographic. It's easy to see that if the unbanked increasingly use the service, Amazon will make more options available, including varied financial services. This is just the first skirmish between Amazon.com and Wal-Mart for the loyalty -- and wallets -- of the unbanked. It definitely won't be the last.

Walmart Files Patent For Amazon Dash-Like Device Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Files Patent For Amazon Dash-Like Device Image courtesy of (Ron Dauphin) May 5, 2017 9:47 am EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler subscriptions of the future walmart tech Subscription Service patent tags tracking your things internet of things In yet another example of Walmart’s effort to increase its online presence and best rival Amazon, the big box retailer has filed a patent for an automatic home ordering subscription system similar to Amazon’s “Dash” buttons.  The patent [PDF] for the subscription system, first discovered by data provider CB Insights, was filed in October, but was just recently published. According to the patent, Walmart’s tech follows the same concept as Amazon’s where a product is easily re-ordered, but goes a step farther. Instead of physically pushing the button, like Amazon Dash, Walmart’s system creates an automatic subscription service that integrates the Internet of Things into actual products and automatically re-orders them when they get low or they expire. You don’t actually have to do anything. To make this work, Walmart would use Bluetooth, radio frequency, infrared, NFC, or other technology in tags that are then placed inside or on the product, according to the patent. This tech would then be able to monitor product usage and automatically re-order the item when it becomes low or expires. In the future, the patent suggests, the IoT integration could be used to sell customers more products. For example, if the tags identify that a customer’s milk is getting low, and it knows that the person likes chocolate, it might suggest chocolate milk. While Walmart hasn’t exactly kept its desire to outdo Amazon a secret, as with all patents, this technology may never see the light of day… or one day you could wake up to a new gallon of milk on the front porch.

(Reuters/Daniel Becerril) Share Written by Chase Purdy May 05, 2017 An invisible eye may soon be tracking how much milk you’re drinking in your own home. Walmart, the world’s largest bricks-and-mortar retailer, is developing technology and has applied for a patent that will allow it to track the way products are used once consumers take them home. If implemented, use of the technology would be two-pronged. It will automatically re-order items, such as toothpaste and milk, when the bottles start running low. And it would also track how frequently products are used. According to the research firm CB Insights, that kind of frequency tracking could tell Walmart how often someone wears a pair of tennis shoes. The company could calculate then how quickly the shoes wear down, and make suggestions to consumers about what pair they might consider ordering next through personal promotions. This kind of technology isn’t entirely new, though it requires less work than what Walmart’s competitors currently offer. Amazon has Dash buttons available for its consumers. When products such as toilet paper, condoms, or laundry detergent run low, shoppers early press a button in their home and an online order is automatically filed. The difference with Walmart is consumers won’t have to do anything to prompt a reorder. “Walmart has filed several other patents that could help to expand their grocery business, and this application could show a continued focus on connecting to shoppers’ kitchens,” according to CB Insights. This desire to plug into consumers’ lives is part of a larger, more emblematic struggle between bricks-and-mortar retailers and online upstarts to figure out how people will shop for goods in the future and how much of it will be done online, through connected devices, home-delivery, and in-store pick-ups.

OSHA cited Wal-Mart and the worker’s employer, Swisslog Logistics Inc., for serious and willful violations for exposing workers to caught-between, struck-by and crushing hazards and for failing to implement lockout/tagout procedures. Wal-Mart and Swisslog Logistics were proposed fines of $139,424 and $126,749, respectively. Ohio manufacturer cited for not installing proper machine guarding following three amputations in two months OSHA issued multiple citations to Napoleon Spring Works Inc. in Archbold, Ohio, after three inspections initiated as a follow-up to a 2013 case and in response to two incidents, on Nov. 2 and Nov. 7 of last year, where employees suffered amputations. In just over two months, there were three amputations at the employer’s facility. The follow-up inspection found that the company had abated the specific hazards cited in 2013, but failed to apply those same safety requirements to other pieces of equipment at the same facility. In these three most recent inspections, OSHA cited the company for violations related to mechanical power press operation, hazardous energy control, machine guarding, electrical safe work practices, and forklift training. Texas lab cited for exposing workers to silica, combustible dust, chemical and other hazards Durcon Inc. has been issued citations for 35 safety and health violations. OSHA inspected the Taylor, Texas, chemical resistant coatings manufacturer in response to a complaint about silica exposure. Inspectors also found other violations including: workers exposed to being struck by falling loads; failing to provide workers with personal protective equipment and effective respiratory protection; combustible waste materials soaked with flammable liquids stored in improper receptacles; and failing to implement a confined spaces program. Nevada cites employer for exposing workers to fall hazards The Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Clay Davis in Carson City for exposing workers to fall hazards. Nevada OSHA inspectors concluded that the company failed to provide proper fall protection for two employees working on a low slope roof 10 feet above a lower level. The violations included failure to provide guardrails, safety nets, personal fall arrest equipment, as well as warning line and safety monitoring systems. The company was previously cited for violations of this standard in 2015 and 2016. California cites company for safety violations following fatal forklift incident The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health cited Good View Roofing & Building Supply Corp. in San Francisco after a worker died when his forklift tipped over the unguarded edge of a ramp. Cal/OSHA inspectors determined that the company failed to inspect and identify workplace hazards, provide clearly written safety instructions on forklifts, and ensure that all workers comply with forklift safety requirements.

Download QR-Code Paralign - Aligning Thoughts Developer: Paralign.me Price: Free+ Apps Walmart Grocery Android Police coverage: Walmart Grocery is a new Android app for all your food shopping needs Walmart Grocery is a new release for Android that simulates the experience of Walmart's Grocery website. Essentially, this is an app that allows you to order your groceries online. The catch is that you will need to drive to the store to pick your items up. So while this is worlds better than having to step foot inside of a Walmart, you will still need to put forth some effort to receive your stuff. This app also comes with the caveat that a Walmart employee will be picking and packing your meats and produce. A scary thought indeed. You can install Walmart Grocery today as a free title with no advertisements or in-app purchases. -- Let us do your grocery shopping. Get the same low prices as your Walmart store. Order from your device, then pick up your items and fresh produce. You can also pick up your groceries at a time you decide is more convenient. Use our check-in feature so your order will be ready and waiting when you arrive. See if we deliver to your door. Download the app and enter your ZIP Code to find out. Download QR-Code Walmart Grocery Developer: Walmart Price: Free HISTORY Vault A&E Television Networks Mobile just published their HISTORY Vault app for Android. It is a monthly subscription video service that streams history related shows and documentaries from the History channel. What is nice about this release is that it gives you a chance to watch shows that are focused on learning about history, instead of the reality shows that normally fill the channel's on-air lineup. There is a free 7-day trial that you can sign up for through the app. Please keep in mind that HISTORY Vault will start to auto bill you at $4.99 a month after the 7-day free trial is over. While this is a free title with no advertisements, you will be unable to access its content until you sign up for the free trial. -- Unlock HISTORY Vault to explore the greatest stories in history including ancient civilizations, the World Wars, space exploration and everything in between. Start your 7-day free trial and then pay only $4.99 per month to watch commercial-free, full-length videos with no TV provider needed, through automatic renewals. New videos are added weekly. Topics range from ancient civilizations to the World Wars to space exploration…and everything in between. Here’s a peek at some of the featured Collections available in HISTORY Vault: Download QR-Code HISTORY Vault Developer: A&E Television Networks Mobile Price: Free+ Mobile Witness Mobile Witness is an interesting new app that allows you to record audio, video, and location data. This information can then be used as a record of proof for many different types of situations. You can even set the app to automatically upload its data to the cloud or your own server. This way there is no worry of losing any of your recorded content, even if your device gets lost or destroyed. There are no advertisements to worry about with this release. Bettery yet, the only in-app purchase included with Mobile Witness costs $2.49 and it is used solely for donation purposes. -- Mobile Witness is an application for collecting potential evidence through your mobile phone by continually recording and safely uploading location, audio, or video footage. Recordings will even continue whilst the screen is turned off. Normal recording applications are not suitable for evidence gathering tasks as they make sounds upon starting the recording and stop recording when the screen is turned off. Alternative upload strategies such as cloud backups fail in situations where the phone may be damaged as they will only upload completed recordings. Download QR-Code Mobile Witness Developer: Beanpod Price: Free+ Shadow Running Many popular running and exercise apps have become bloated. Even if the bloat is not bothersome to you, their high monthly subscription fees can also be an annoyance. Shadow Running offers an app that is a bit easier to use than its competition. You simply record your runs through GPS to then challenge yourself and your friends to complete the same run in less time. There are even audio cues during these excursions to alert you as to how much time you are leading by or running behind. Shadow Running is still currently in testing as an unreleased app, but you can pick it up today for free with no worry of in-app purchases or advertisements. -- Shadow Running is a GPS based, audio running App. Race against previous runs or compete with friends in daily challenges. Plug in your headphones and get audio updates on your progress as you run. The App shows you how far you are ahead or behind your previous runs. Create a group and race against your friends recorded runs with updates as you run. Plug in your headphones and get audio updates from the App while you're running. Compete against your friends in daily distance runs. Win trophies and climb the leader board.

Not only does it allow for plenty of recording options, but it also has a built-in audio and video editor. On top of that, it's compatible with iKlip stands and mounts. This way you have a plethora of recording tools at your disposal. iRig Recorder 3 is offered as a free application that does not contain any advertisements. However, there are in-app purchases included that range up to $7.99 per item. Luckily, all of the IAPs are used to extend the functionality of the app through new effects and editing tools. -- iRig Recorder 3 is a completely redesigned powerful, flexible and easy-to-use audio and video recording app for Android.

But don’t let iRig Recorder 3’s streamlined design fool you… iRig Recorder 3 is a full-fledged, professional audio and video recorder that lets you edit waveforms, apply creative and professional effects as well as share your recordings with the rest of the world. Download QR-Code iRig Recorder 3 Developer: IK Multimedia US, LLC Price: Free+ Wemogee Wemogee is a communication app built for sufferers of communicative disabilities. It allows for an easy and cheap way to communicate through emoji. Even though the design is well thought out, some issues currently make it difficult to use. The main sticking point is that the sign-up process is pretty confusing. While there are only a few fields to fill out, if you miss something as simple as adding a picture to your profile, you will be unable to register. This makes the process doubly complicated as there is also an issue with receiving your verification code. Hopefully, once the bugs are settled, the app will become useable but until then it is a bit of a mess trying to sign up for the service. On the plus side, Wemogee is completely free to install, and there are no advertisements or in-app purchases to worry about. -- This project was created in order to restore the possibility for aphasia sufferers to communicate easily and quickly with their friends and family. In fact, Samsung WemogeeTM performs a dual function: for chatting with people far away and communication support for face-to-face interactions. Through the translation of text to emoji and vice versa, the app allows the person affected with aphasia to communicate only through images. Samsung WemogeeTM is based on a library of more than 140 phrases: in collaboration with a team of speech therapists, a list of the most common phrases in informal chat was defined, relating to basic needs as well as to their emotions. These words were then translated into logical sequences of emojis. Download QR-Code Wemogee Developer: 3x1010 s.r.l.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Medicare and Health Insurance Brokerage Plans Massive Consumer Outreach at Walmart Locations in Fall 2017 John Shinn, Empower Brokerage Instructor Bronson says, “…Empower Brokerage is the most helpful and active FMO I’ve ever seen. We all work very hard to help agents and to make sure consumers have the best, most informative, experience possible.” Southlake, Texas (PRWEB) May 05, 2017 Texas-based insurance FMO, Empower Brokerage, boasted more than 100 insurance agents, stationed in 54 Walmart stores across the country, in last year’s Walmart Retail Program for the 2016-2017 Annual Enrollment Period (AEP) and Open Enrollment Period (OEP). Agents represented the top-rated insurance carriers for both the senior Medicare market, as well as the individual health market under the Affordable Care Act. Carriers such as Humana, Aetna, United Healthcare, Cigna and others were represented. This year they expect an even bigger and better turnout, as people begin to explore their updated options. To prepare for the program, Empower Brokerage is ensuring they provide agents with contracts from the best carriers for both the under and over 65 age market. With so many changes circulating in the healthcare industry, insurance plans, specifically on the individual market, intend to offer more choices. A recent ruling by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) now enables insurers to develop more choices with lower premium options for consumers. In response to this ruling, Empower Brokerage is stepping up their outreach and training programs, to make sure agents know exactly what is available to consumers. “Our Marketing Department is hard at work to make sure everyone knows the latest updates in both the Medicare and Health Insurance product areas. This year promises to be our biggest year yet,” said William Bronson, Empower Brokerage Marketing Director. The Empower Brokerage consumer information for Individual Health Insurance can be found at https://empowerhealthinsuranceusa.com As for the senior market, Empower Brokerage continues to offer the top carriers in the Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicare Supplement market. Since Medicare Advantage is heavily regulated, Empower Brokerage also provides extended agent support, during AEP. Sherri Miller, MA specialist and compliance officer for Empower Brokerage, assists agents prepare for AEP by ensuring agents are properly certified with AHIP and the necessary carriers. Medicare Supplement consumer information can be found at https://empowermedicaresupplement.com Sherry says, “We are extremely vigilant about compliance, and we strive to teach agents how to understand and comply with the latest regulations.” Though contracting and certifying is paramount to an agent’s success in the Walmart retail kiosk program, it’s equally important agents are equipped to market their products. This entails extensive training and compelling marketing materials. Empower Brokerage offers extensive training in their online University, as well as customized individual training. Agents have access to product specialists, sales trainers, carrier reps, and marketing experts to fully learn about compliance, sales, and prospecting strategies. Bronson says, “There’s really not much we won’t do to help our agents become successful. Empower Brokerage is the most helpful and active FMO I’ve ever seen. We all work very hard to help agents and to make sure consumers have the best, most informative, experience possible.” In tandem with training and marketing, Empower also keeps agents up-to-date on the program’s requirements. Not only must agents manage carrier requirements and government regulations, but they must also maintain compliance throughout the entire program. To help them do so, Empower Brokerage conducts a two-part outreach through call campaigns, as well as email. Before the program even begins in October, Empower guides agents step-by-step through the registration process. Andrea Hektner, Marketing Specialist and Communication Liaison for the program, says communication between the FMO and agent is the key to success. She adds, “With carrier certifications, CMS regulation overlays, AHIP, program training, mandatory hours, reporting, compliance, relationships with Walmart management… Agents have to manage so much. We help them manage it all so that they can direct their attention to what’s important – helping clients.” According to program veterans, Empower Brokerage has certainly succeeded in creating a productive experience in the Walmart Retail Program. Agents anticipate the AEP all year long. When it comes, the successful agents are ready. They enjoy year-round business and referrals from their happy customers. The Walmart retail kiosk program helps agents meet people. And, developing a rapport with people is the key to success in the insurance business. Empower Brokerage helps independent life & health insurance agents learn, earn, and succeed.

The Walmart Supercenter is planned for 32 acres in the northwest quadrant of the South 74th Street and Illinois 15 intersection. This summer, the Planning Commission is expected to vote on the final plat for the store, which will also have a Walmart gas station with eight pumps. A spokesman for Walmart could not be reached for comment. John Schebaum, an engineer and designer for BFA Engineering of Washington, Mo., who is representing Walmart during the permitting process in Belleville, told the commissioners that the land is undermined and that further research will be done on how to mitigate the site. Shoppers would enter the stores off 74th Street. Schebaum also told the commissioners a left turn lane would be added on 74th Street for motorists who want to go east on Illinois 15. An engineer told Belleville officials the land for the proposed Walmart Supercenter is undermined, and research will be done on how to mitigate the site. Annissa McCaskill, director of the city’s Economic Development, Planning and Zoning Department, said the city will not pay for this roadwork and that a developer typically has to pay for this type of work. The Supercenter will be 195,000 square feet, which is slightly smaller than the Supercenter on the east side, but it will have all the “bells and whistles” Walmart offers in new Supercenters, Schebaum said. The gas station will have a 1,500-square-foot convenience store, and one other retail outlot would be offered to another business. Schebaum said he did not have information on when construction could begin, but he said the permitting process will probably take at least until the fall. Unlike the Walmart Supercenter off Carlyle Avenue, the developers of this Walmart have not asked for tax incentives from the city. Later this month, the city’s Zoning Board of Appeals is expected to hear requests from Walmart for permission to sell alcohol and for a variance on the store’s sign. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:33 Oakdale Country Kitchen serves 'real home cooking,' made from scratch Pause 0:35 N-word use during jail call part of complaint against judge 3:59 How to make no-avocado dips 2:02 O'Fallon catcher has three hits in win over Mascoutah 1:11 Parolee who lived with judge charged with murder 3:04 Ron Duebbert ousts St. Clair County Circuit Judge John Baricevic 3:44 Chief Judge Gleeson comments on Judge Duebbert 0:41 New St. Clair County Circuit Judge Ron Duebbert sworn in 0:35 Double homicide at East St. Louis salon 4:57 Belleville City Clerk Dallas Cook discusses public safety ahead of mayoral election Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Belleville getting second Walmart Supercenter Belleville Mayor Mark Eckert details the second Walmart Supercenter being planned for Illinois 15 at South 74th Street.

Here's how to save there Before you go, we thought you'd like these... READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Mike Brassfield May 4th 2017 4:37PM When we shop for groceries, we want the meat and produce to be fresh. We appreciate good customer service. And we like a bargain. When it comes to customer satisfaction at the supermarket, you'll see various surveys that rank different grocery stores at the top. Sometimes you're king of the hill, and sometimes you're not. A new survey puts Kroger at the top. Kroger! That's a different result than some other surveys we've seen. Morning Consult, a public opinion data company, got the opinion of nearly 200,000 consumers on 500 of America's biggest brands. When it came to grocery stores, 53% had a favorable view toward Kroger. Whole Foods was second with 48%, and Safeway followed at 40%. Regional chains Albertsons and Publix were each at 33%. If you're going to check out any these supermarkets to see if you like them as much as other customers do, you should check out our tips on saving. Here are our money-saving secrets for shopping at Kroger, Whole Foods and Publix. RELATED: Common supermarket traps you should always avoid: 11 PHOTOS 10 supermarket traps See Gallery 10 supermarket traps Large shopping carts According to Martin Lindstrom, the larger the shopping cart, the more likely you are to spend. The marketing consultant told The Consumerist, "We doubled their size as a test, and customers bought 19% more." Pleasing aromas and colorful sights Walking into a grocery store and smelling freshly baked goods and flowers, especially if you're in a good mood, is a surefire way to get you to throw a few unnecessary items into your cart as your begin shopping experience. Fresh produce first​ After you've already been tricked into picking up a loaf of bread or some flowers, supermarkets also get you by placing the produce in the front of the store. By doing this, they fool you into believing you're being healthier by shopping for fruits and veggies first so you won't feel bad if you decide to stock up on a few unhealthier snacks along the way to checkout, too. Mist on produce You may think the mist on fresh fruits and veggies is helping the produce, but in all actuality, it makes them rot faster. Also, be sure to shake off the access water before purchasing your produce -- the mist tends to add additional weight, making the price go up. Slow, boring music Have you ever wondered why most grocery stores play some sort of elevator music? It's because they want you to take your time while shopping. Many stores play music slower than the average heartbeat, so pop your headphones in and play upbeat music to combat this trick. 10-for-$10 promotions It's common to believe you're getting a great deal during a 10-for-$10 promotion, but say, if a can of beans was originally 87 cents, you're actually paying more versus buying 10 of the same cans when they aren't on "sale." Dairy being in the back of the store The reasoning behind the age-old trick of placing milk and other dairy products in the back of the store may surprise you. Although it forces you to walk through various aisles, the true reason is because trucks unload their shipments in the back of store, and since milk needs to be refrigerated immediately, the easiest place to keep it is in the back. More expensive items at eye level If you've ever wondered why all of the expensive items seem to be the most accessible, there's a reason behind that, too. Supermarkets place cheaper items on the lower and higher shelves and reserve the middle, or eyesight level, shelves for their most expensive products. Buying premium deli products Just because you are buying a seemingly fresh cut of meat or fish from the deli and paying a higher price, doesn't necessarily mean the product is of better quality. Often times, the meat was previously frozen meaning you may have to use it sooner than meat you would buy from the frozen section. Changing the layout of the store... often Don't get too comfortable with your local supermarket's layout. Markets believe that when a person remembers where there items they plan on buying are, they'll spend less time in the store and will ultimately spend less money.

What's the Best Grocery Store? Depends Who You Ask So according to this new survey, Kroger is king. Yay, Kroger! But like we mentioned, different surveys have shown us different results. For instance, the American Customer Satisfaction Index conducts an in-depth survey of customer satisfaction at grocery stores every year. Most recently, the highest-ranking chains in ACSI's survey were Trader Joe's, Publix, Aldi, H-E-B, Wegmans and Whole Foods, in that order. Kroger was in the middle of the pack. Ranked lowest: Walmart. Walmart was also at the bottom of Consumer Reports' grocery store ranking. Consumer Reports surveyed its readers, asking them to rank supermarket chains based on factors like freshness, selection, cleanliness, customer service and prices. In fact, Walmart is routinely ranked the worst for customer satisfaction among grocery stores, even though more Americans buy their groceries at Walmart than anywhere else. Time magazine spells out the reason why Walmart has become Americans' most popular destination for groceries: "For a large portion of shoppers, price simply trumps all when it comes to groceries." If you're shopping for food at Walmart, you're probably doing it to save money. Here's how to save even more money there. Your Turn: Where is your favorite place to shop for groceries? Mike Brassfield (mike@thepennyhoarder.com) is a senior writer at The Penny Hoarder. Full disclosure: He personally shops at Aldi, Publix, Winn-Dixie or Walmart, depending on his family's needs and what's on sale.

City memo: No Wal-Mart coming to Olive and 99; fencing coming to Centennial Corridor area BY DOROTHY MILLS-GREGG dmgregg@bakersfield.com 7 hrs ago 0 THE BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIAN Shoppers bustle in and out of the Walmart on Rosedale Highway in this file photo. City Manager Alan Tandy's weekly memo to the mayor and city council Friday had several items of note: No Wal-Mart at Olive and Highway 99 Walmart announced to city staff that it will not open a Supercenter at Olive Drive off of Highway 99. However, the supermarket chain said it is reviewing sites in Bakersfield to add Walmart Neighborhood Grocery Stores, like the newly opened one in Artisan Square that is near Brimhall and Allen roads. Centennial Corridor-area residents to get privacy fencing Later this month, the city announced, it will begin installing nearly a mile and a half of privacy fencing in several locations along the to-be-constructed Centennial Corridor. These fences will be 8 feet high and similar to those along the north side of 24th Street. They are meant to provide privacy, and they will "shield" residents from future construction activities. The city decided to place these screens after receiving feedback from affected residents during community meetings. These residents are primarily in the area south of California Avenue and north of Stockdale Highway. Exact fence locations can be viewed on the Thomas Roads Improvement Program website: www.bakersfieldfreeways.us.

Straight Talk offers cheap monthly plans with plenty of minutes, texting and 4G LTE data. It is a very attractive option for users who want the new iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus but need a lower monthly bill. With the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus buyers pay the full price for the new iPhone, but the cheaper monthly plan prices still lead to savings over traditional carriers. A Straight Talk iPhone 6 sounds like a great deal, but there are things that buyers need to know before signing up and paying $650 for a new iPhone. You can bring your current iPhone to Straight Talk, or you can now buy a Straight Talk iPhone 6 direct from the carrier or at Walmart. What you need to know about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 before you buy. A Straight Talk iPhone plan starts at $45 a month and $60 a month for international calling. For the lower price there are some trade-offs that you need to be aware of before you buy the Straight Talk iPhone 6. This is a pre-paid carrier, but you can set up an auto-pay plan so you aren’t always entering in codes and remembering a monthly payment. You’ll need to compare a variety of plans to make sure you are getting a deal, but for the same $45 a month you get vastly less data and need to pay for the phone each month on Verizon or $60 a month for just 1GB of data. Here are 7 facts buyers need to know about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 before buying the new iPhone on this popular pre-paid carrier. Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus The great news is that you can buy a Straight Talk iPhone 6 or Straight Talk iPhone 6 Plus. Normally we see some limitations on other carriers, but Apple is letting anyone get in on the iPhone 6 Plus demand. All of these details apply to both of the new iPhones. Read: iPhone 6 Plus Review The Straight Talk iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch display and the iPhone 6 Plus a 5.5-inch display. The iPhone 6 Plus features a higher resolution 1080P display and a camera with optical image stabilization. Both new iPhones use an Apple A8 processor, come with many sensors and an all metal design. 16GB Only, But All Color Options There is no 64GB Straight Talk iPhone 6 available. Like Walmart, the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are only available with the lowest amount of storage. Although a 16GB iPhone 6 is enough for some users, there are good reasons not to buy the 16GB iPhone 6. Straight Talk offers all colors, but only 16GB options. On the upside, you can buy the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in all three colors. This includes gold, solver and space gray. Here’s help deciding which iPhone 6 color to buy. 4G LTE Data for the Straight Talk iPhone 6 Straight Talk started offering 4G LTE data last year, which means consumers can enjoy the same speeds as on major carriers. This is key to a good iPhone 6 experience, since many apps and services assume you are using a fast connection. Watch the iPhone 6 speed test in the video below. Same Network as Major Carriers As the iPhone 6 speed test video shows, 4G LTE speeds and coverage vary between carriers. The good news about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 is that it connects to the same networks as the big names in wireless. Straight Talk does not list the specific networks but it is very likely that the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus purchased from Walmart will run on AT&T. There is a chance it will run on Verizon, but it is less likely. Here’s a look at Straight Talk coverage. Unlimited Data With a Catch When you look at the Straight Talk iPhone 6 plans you’ll see unlimited data listed, but it isn’t unlimited. Despite the need for an asterisk, Straight Talk is more up front than in earlier years. You aren’t cut off after a set amount, but your data is slowed down after you use 3GB of high-speed data in a 30 day period. You’ll still connect, but it will likely be at slower 3G speeds. At the end of the 30 day period you’ll get your high-speed data back. Straight Talk still reserves the right to cancel your line if you use too much data, but the new terms better explain limits and use. Customer Support isn’t Up to Big Names The last time Gotta Be Mobile used Straight Talk and needed support, we ended up bounced between Straight Talk and Tracfone with no real resolution to our problem. Friends and family who switched to Straight Talk and brought their own iPhones found little help when data connectivity failed, despite a simple software solution. You may receive good support, but there is not the same store and support agent availability as with the bigger carriers, so keep that in mind. No Tethering There is no support for tethering or personal hotspots with Straight Talk. That means you can’t use the new Instant Hotspot between your Straight Talk iPhone 6 and Mac running OS X Yosemite. No hotspot or tethering options on the Straight Talk iPhone 6. In fact you can’t use any type of hotspot or Internet Sharing. It is not included in any plans and if you are eventually able to use an iPhone 6 jailbreak to do this, you risk cancellation by Straight Talk. 23 Responses 10/30/2014 Alex Reply What’s wrong with this picture? 10/30/2014 Randal Reply Check out this line of iPhone compatible projectors, display your pictures, iTunes content, and any other apps while on the go with one of these PICO projectors. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjECbaLd_ac&list=UUAgQDzRklgm9Ku7EVkqBbHA 11/16/2014 Amina Reply Is there a trade in option with straight talk?

It seems like the piece just drops right off with no clear ending. Also there is a typo in the silver while explaining the color options. 08/08/2015 marcela Reply if I have an iPhone 6plus 16gb for AT&T will it work with straight talk? 05/22/2016 eagerfortheinfinite Reply Yeah – Straight Talk has “Bring Your Own Phone” 08/28/2015 Joserblack Reply 0==08 my buddy’s mother-in-law makes $63 every hour on the laptop . She has been without work for eight months but last month her income was $21480 just working on the laptop for a few hours. view it now>>>>> Get More 09/09/2015 Olivia Reply @Joserblack, Your buddy’s mother-in-law makes $63/hr, and $21480/mth, last month (from posting) was July. There are 31 days in July, which means your buddy’s mother-in-law would have worked $21480/$63=341hrs, or 341/31=11hrs/day. 11*7=77hrs/wk. I mean, if I was making $63/hr, I’d probably be working 77hrs/wk too, because I’d be making $258k but I don’t think that 77hrs/wk is classified as “a few hours”. 10/20/2015 D Reply Straight Talk customer service is worse than horrible 11/27/2015 J Reply Why do you need customer service? 12/07/2015 A Reply I bought the iPhone 6s and have had a horrible month of the internet working when it wants to 12/18/2015 Stacy Snider Reply I paid a lot for the 5c iPhone in March & half the time or more the Internet doesn’t work, if I hadn’t spent so much for the phone I wouldn’t be as upset as I am. When it says unlimited data I expected to have use of it at all times not only a 1/4 of the time. People I know that bought the cheaper phones have no trouble, so I’m very aggravated!

With them only offering the 16gb memory version of the phone, it is an absolute nightmare! DO NOT RECOMMEND. Will never do it again. They need to offer better versions in the future.

The patent, filed in October, would be the first of Wal-Mart's more than 800 patents and applications to focus on Internet of Things (IoT) and branches into shoppers' homes, CB Insights said. Wal-Mart's system would require less effort than Amazon's, a CB Insights blog post said. "While Dash buttons still require users to press a physical button separate from the product, Wal-Mart aims to integrate IoT into the products themselves for automatic re-ordering with no user input at all," the blog post said.

May 5, 2017 | By Deena M. Amato-McCoy Amazon’s signature Dash button may be getting some competition from a rival very soon.   A patent filing by Walmart reveals that the retail giant could be developing an Internet of Things-based device that tracks how shoppers use products in their homes and then electronically reorders merchandise.   The retailer’s proposed device relies on IoT tags, which could be comprised of Bluetooth, radio frequency identification (RFID), infrared, or near-field communications (NFC), among other technology options. Besides monitoring product usage, this smart tag would be programmed to automatically re-order merchandise, as well as track expiration dates and product recalls, according to the patent filing, called “Retail subscription in Internet of Things environment.”   Walmart’s approach is to put a “modern spin” on subscription services. “Previous generations enjoyed some subscription services, such as the daily receipt of fresh milk from a local farm by a mailman,” the patent reported. “Modern subscription services include the use of computers and the Internet, where a consumer can order online a subscription of goods ranging from wine to razors to the book-of-the-month, which may be shipped from the factory to the consumer’s home.”   The technology would directly compete with Amazon’s vast portfolio of Dash buttons. The Wi-Fi connected devices, which are dedicated to a specific brand, enable Prime members to stock up on merchandise from the brand simply by pushing the button. Product is automatically re-ordered from Amazon.com, and shipped free with Prime shipping. The online retailer currently features a fleet of more than 300 branded buttons, according to the online giant.   Unlike Amazon’s trademark Dash button however, Walmart’s smart device won't require shoppers to push a button to initiate their re-orders. Specifically, the retailer’s proposed device will “associate a tag with items, [be] a tracking device for collecting data on the tags associated with the items, and a management system that monitors changes in the use of items, including analyzing use patterns to determine when items should be replenished, replaced or upgraded.”   Walmart filed the patent on October 19, 2016, but there are no details on when the device will be available.    This is also not Walmart’s first patent filing. The retailer was recently granted a patent that would allow the chain to use drones to shuttle merchandise between departments and dedicated delivery locations within its stores.    Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Bankrupt Gander Mountain acquired Coffee giant to open massive location in Chicago Update on Walgreens-Rite Aid deal Specialty apparel retailer exiting Canada Longtime Nordstrom exec joins DSW in big role President-elect hurting traffic at some major retail flagships Dollar Tree comes out on top Restaurant giant in $1.8 billion acquisition German grocery giant to make a big U.S. debut ahead of schedule Study: Retailers leave money on table due to lack of personalized service Solutions Spotlight Taking Stock of Retail’s Analytics Capabilities When it comes to using data and analytics to drive business results, where does the retail industry stand relative to other industries?

(NASDAQ:AMZN). Source: Walmart We live in a time where companies are willing to go to great lengths to determine new ways of making money, even if it means creating a copycat product of another company’s invention. In this case, Walmart is looking to cash in on the technology set forth by the e-commerce retailer with Amazon Dash, which the company describes as “WiFi-connected devices to place in your kitchen, pantry, or anywhere in your home you use your favorite Prime-eligible products. Simply press the button to reorder when you’re running low, and your products are on their way.” Walmart revealed that back in October, the retailer filed a patent for a device that is similar to Dash, allowing you to press your favorite items at the press of a button by making sure that The retailer’s move is the first in more than 800 patents and applications that revolve around the Internet of Things (IoT) and affects the homes of the company’s shoppers. “While Dash buttons still require users to press a physical button separate from the product, Wal-Mart aims to integrate IoT into the products themselves for automatic re-ordering with no user input at all,” a blog post said. AMZN stock fell 0.8% on the news, while WMT shares wafted up a fraction of a percentage.

(NYSE: WMT) has done something different for its customers who have either a Walmart Credit Card or a Walmart Mastercard Credit Card. The world’s largest retailer is offering no-interest financing for periods of six or 12 months on card purchases. While this may sound like similar offers from lots of card issuers, what makes this different is that not only do Wal-Mart customers pay no interest during the promotional period, interest does not even accrue during the period. Most similar-sounding offers allow consumers to make interest-free payments for a specified period. Provided that the total bill is paid off within the period, the customer pays no interest charges. However, interest still accrues on the debt and is only deferred through the promotional period. If the full amount of the debt is not paid off in that period, the accrued interest is added to the bill. This can be a nasty surprise for many card holders. Richard Cordray, director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, offered this comment on the Wal-Mart program: Deferred-interest products carry risks for consumers. The back-end pricing makes their costs to consumers less predictable and transparent, which often fosters questionable or illegal marketing. We are encouraged by this announcement and we will continue to monitor this development carefully. We hope to see others in the industry reconsider their reliance on deferred-interest products which can impose significant costs on consumers. There are some limits to Wal-Mart’s offer: The new promotional financing offer on the Walmart Credit Card and the Walmart Mastercard Credit Card includes six months zero interest for purchases made in store of $150 to $298.99 and 12 months zero interest for purchases made in store of $299 or more. If you shop at Wal-Mart, this is a deal worth checking out. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Paul Ausick « Has Anadarko Stock Been Punished Too Much?

Should Make The People Rich Technology Doc Portrait PDF Landscape PDF Doc EMail Share Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Available to Premium & Purple Members In the lead-up to our PSFK 2017 conference, we look back at key speakers from past years. Media critic warns companies against recreating the 'Walmart Problem' PSFK 4 may 2017 Leading up to our PSFK 2017 conference on May 19, we are looking back at some of the key speakers from years past. Get your tickets today! Frequent technology critic and author of the recently released book, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, Dr. Douglas Rushkoff spoke at PSFK’s annual flagship conference to shed light on how many of today’s most successful technology companies are creating more societal problems than they solve. Although a corporation-driven economy is not a new model, its problems are aggregated in this digital era. Corporations must make a conscious effort to create an environment that creates value for all, not just themselves. Rushkoff starts off by speaking on the role of venture capitalism in today’s society. He believes that there is no real sustainable revenue model in this digital era. Instead, there is a narrowed mission to simply expand a business as much as possible. The downside to this model, he explains, is that “businesses grow by extracting value from people.” Numerous platform monopolies are starting to form, which limits the growth of other companies and takes away benefits from people. He strengthens his argument by reciting a Deloitte study that states that corporate profit as opposed to corporate size, has been going downhill for 75 years. “Corporations are good at taking money off the table but bad at deploying money once they have it,” he states. “This is just how business works,” is the belief. However, this is an extractive model that takes and does not give enough in return. The ‘Walmart Problem’ is the analogy Rushkoff uses to explain this phenomenon. He gives a general example of how Walmart goes into towns, undercuts local employers and becomes the main source for jobs. As a result, locals are hired part-time and eventually the town goes bankrupt after two or three decades. People simply do not generate enough income to purchase goods. Then the Walmart goes out of business and moves out of town, leaving the town ruined. Rushkoff relates this to digital businesses by explaining, “you end up bankrupting the markets on which your company is depending to sustain itself.” The main problem with digital companies is that this whole process is happens in just a few years. He concludes by asking the audience to keep three words in mind: ‘Make. Them. Rich.’ Companies should start thinking about how they can benefit their users and create a platform cooperative, not a monopoly. Decisions should assist the user in creating and circulating value. He eloquently states, “rather than optimizing for the extraction of capital from a community and its storage in share price—what you can do is optimize your business for the velocity of money and the velocity of transactions through a community?” Douglas Rushkoff +Conference Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder +Corporations Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder +Douglas Rushkoff Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder +economies Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder +Google Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder +PSFK 2016 Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder +Public Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder +retail Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder +Speakers Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder +technology Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder +Walmart Create Alert Create Alert Create Favorites Folder Doc Portrait PDF Landscape PDF Doc EMail Share Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Available to Premium & Purple Members Trending PSFK 2017: How Morgan Spurlock Turned The Ad World Upside Down And Became A Brand Expert Matt Vitone Posted May 4, 2017 Advertising Advertising Yesterday PSFK Conference Interview: Why Building A New Sport Takes Both Innovation and Vision Retail Yesterday Airbnb Has Unveiled A New Tool For Business Travelers Trending Get PSFK's Related Report: Food Debrief Arts & Culture Yesterday Designers New To 3D Printing Exhibit Their First Products Design & Architecture Yesterday Designers New To 3D Printing Exhibit Their First Products Analysis & Newsletters Get Our Newsletter: Non-members can sign up for a free dose of daily and weekly insights.

There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google).

By Alexandra Whyte May 5, 2017 Make room collectibles, the next toy craze is here. Fidget toys or spinners have been blowing up over the past few weeks, and now Hong Kong-based toymaker Zing is bringing its version, called Spinzipz, into the fray. To meet the demand and capture the trend while it’s still hot, millions of Spinzipz stackable spinners are being air-freighted into Target, Toys “R” Us and Walmart stores later this month. The toys, which feature LED lights and sell for US$7.99 apiece, will also be sold on Amazon. For now, Spinszipz are available on the company’s website, where three-pack of spinners (US$19.99) are still available, but individuals are already out of stock. Zing is the company behind Thumb Chucks—two balls on string that twirl around your fingers—and made its move into fidget spinners when it noticed how popular the trend was becoming online. Fidget toys are small pocket-sized playthings intended to keep kids’ hands busy. They are akin to stress balls, allowing children to release pent-up energy. They are also said to be especially helpful for kids with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Digitally speaking, the toys have taken off on YouTube, with one channel dedicated to the trend already amassing 11,000 subscribers and upwards of two million views per video. Google trends are also showing a spike in recent online searches beginning in April for these spinner toy. While fidget toys are becoming red hot, US teachers are trying to put out the flame, at least in classrooms, where they have been deemed too distracting.

Colby St. in Whitehall is expected to open in late May, according to a comment on its Facebook page.  A bright orange Biggby sign went up in late April. A peak inside the front window reveals a mess of furniture crammed into the middle of the space. On the outside, dirt was recently removed for the driveway to a drive thru window. The city of Whitehall Planning Commission approved a special use permit for a drive thru window at the store in February.  MLive reached out to the Whitehall Biggby via phone, email and Facebook, but did not get a response. Biggby's corporate spokesperson also did not respond to phone calls and email. The East Lansing-based coffee franchise has already announced four stores opening in Michigan this year, not including the Whitehall location. But the Whitehall store can be found in Biggby's location finder. In 2016, 23 Biggbys opened - 19 in Michigan.  Biggby is one of the first franchises to come to the White Lake area since the Whitehall Township Wal-Mart was announced. Wal-Mart is scheduled to open sometime in mid-May. Whitehall Wal-Mart to open mid-May after year of construction Biggby was considering a Whitehall location before Wal-Mart was a sure thing, said Amy VanLoon, White Lake Chamber of Commerce executive director. The store's Facebook page has more than 1,000 likes, and has posted a link encouraging people to apply online to work at the location. Options for espresso drinks in the White Lake area include the Book Nook and Java Shop, 8744 Ferry St. in Montague and McDonald's at 190 Whitehall Road in Whitehall Township. The Biggby will "serve a purpose and fulfill a need," VanLoon said. "It's not a Book Nook," she added. "The Book Nook is kind of the living room of Montague. Biggby will offer something different." In addition to coffee and espresso drinks, Biggby offers baked goods and sandwiches and other food. The majority of Biggby's business is expected to come through the drive thru, VanLoon said. Nearby Biggbys are located in Muskegon, Fremont, Spring Lake and Grand Haven. The company was founded in 1995. There are more than 250 locations in nine states: Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Florida and Texas.   Michigan's Best See our choice for Michigan's Best Sub Sandwich 52 of the state's best Top 10 finalists More Michigan's Best » Michigan Prom Prom 2017: Photos, videos from celebrations across Michigan Our favorite photo booth moments Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Connect with MLive Subscribe to our newsletters Like us on Facebook Subscribe on YouTube Most Read Active Discussions About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 MLive Media Group.

A criminal complaint has been issued by Chicopee District Court charging Edward Robichaud, 37, of 93 Grochmal Ave. #86, with criminal harassment, annoying and accosting a person sexually and taking secret photos of intimate body parts, Michael Wilk, Chicopee Police public information officer, said. Robichaud is being accused of following a woman who he did not know through the store on Memorial Drive and taking multiple pictures of her on April 29. Wilk said several people contacted him on Monday saying they saw lewd comments and photos he had published of the woman on Craigslist. Shortly afterward Craigslist removed the posts but some had saved them and sent them to him. Officials for the online company did not respond to requests for comment. The post titled "Chicopee Walmart Goddess" was shared by many people and went viral, Wilk said. "In this post there were 10 photos of a female taken in various positions without her consent or knowledge. The poster put up a very lewd and lascivious post, stating he would pay money to learn her identity," he said. Wilk said he met with Walmart security officials who allowed him to review the store video which showed the victim being followed by a man without her knowledge. Around the same time the victim went to the Police Department after she learned about the posts, he said. "She was extremely distraught and scared as this same male party was able to locate her on Facebook and sent her a provocative private message," Wilk said. Upon further investigation through the messages sent and the video, Wilk said he was able to identify the suspect as Robichaud. Robichaud will be summonsed to Chicopee District Court on May 16 for a hearing, Wilk said.

Similar to most plans, customers don’t pay any interest during the promotional period. But the Walmart offer is different from most others in that the interest also does not accrue during the promotional period.      “Whenever we can save our customers money and help remove unnecessary hassle or burden, we do just that,” said Daniel Eckert, senior VP of services for Walmart, U.S., in a blog post on the chain’s website. “That’s why we’ve decided to simplify our special financing offer on the Walmart Credit Card and the Walmart Mastercard Credit Card.”      The new plan comes with some limits. The six-month period has zero interest tied to purchases made in-store at levels between $150 to $298.99, and on 12 months the total comes at a threshold of least $299.   Login or Register to post a comment. ﻿ Newsletter Sign Up Get the latest news sent to your inbox   Popular Most Commented Bankrupt Gander Mountain acquired Coffee giant to open massive location in Chicago Update on Walgreens-Rite Aid deal Specialty apparel retailer exiting Canada Longtime Nordstrom exec joins DSW in big role President-elect hurting traffic at some major retail flagships Dollar Tree comes out on top Restaurant giant in $1.8 billion acquisition German grocery giant to make a big U.S. debut ahead of schedule Study: Retailers leave money on table due to lack of personalized service Solutions Spotlight Taking Stock of Retail’s Analytics Capabilities When it comes to using data and analytics to drive business results, where does the retail industry stand relative to other industries?

Botanists and conservationists have long fought to save the rare forest, which harbors a menagerie of endangered animals and plants, including one beetle and 31 plants that can be found no where else. Patrick Farrell Miami Herald Environment May 04, 2017 6:00 AM Last remnants of the world’s rarest forest endure By Jenny Staletovich jstaletovich@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Roger Hammer is standing in a forest that used to be the bottom of the ocean, about 100,000 years ago. The ground is pitted with holes, a limestone honeycomb cemented by bits of grain that look like fish eggs and nearly barren of soil. Yet, miraculously, life springs from the rock: slash pines, silver palms, tiny clumps of leafy plants splattered like paint across the rocks and a rainbow of wildflowers that manage to sprout from the bony floor. This plot near ZooMiami is a remnant of one of the world’s rarest forests: pine rockland. It once covered 186,000 acres, colonizing an ancient ridge — the high ground snaking south from Miami under the Upper Keys and reappearing in Big Pine Key. No more. Today, the place where Hammer, an author and former Miami-Dade County senior naturalist, has collected wildflowers for 40 years is down to about 3,700 acres outside Everglades National Park, splintered by development into shards scattered around the county’s south end. So little is left that many of its inhabitants — bats, snakes, butterflies, beetles and a host of plants — are in danger of disappearing, too. You just never know what you might find. Author and botanist Roger Hammer “If you come out at different times of the year, it always changes,” said Hammer, who helped restore the 120 acres of pineland here in Larry and Penny Thompson Park after Hurricane Andrew, pine bark beetles and Burma reed nearly destroyed it. “You just never know what you might find.”   Including, to environmentalists dismay, a Walmart. Just north of the park, in what was the largest remaining tract of Miami’s pine rockland on an old blimp base, a Palm Beach County developer is moving closer to finalizing a shopping center anchored by the big-box store. The project will also include 900 apartments, a parking lot, possibly a school and replace the 90-acre forest with separate 24-acre and 20-acre preserves. It is the first major development on the globally imperiled forest since the county launched a land-buying program to save endangered habitat in 1990. The county now manages about 1,500 acres. New pines grow among old at Larry and Penny Thompson Park near Zoo Miami, which was restored a decade ago after Hurricane Andrew and bark beetles killed nearly all the trees and invasive Burma reed took over. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com To build it, developer Peter Cummings and the University of Miami — which acquired the land at no cost after the base was decommissioned and in the 1990s objected to county efforts to preserve it — spent the past three years conducting environmental assessments. (The plan is now being reviewed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and open to public comment.) They concluded that much of the pineland is overgrown and beyond salvage. Hammer disagrees. “They’re easy to reclaim, but they’re using this false argument that it’s ruined and therefore we need a Walmart,” he said. “That’s bogus.” That’s because Miami’s rockland plants are among the planet’s toughest, from the slash pines that evolved into their own subspecies of super-hard wood, the Dade County pine prized by old-time builders and known to botanists as var. densa, to the obscure tiny polygala, which stands a few inches high and lives for less than a year. They might not tolerate development, but they can survive South Florida’s withering heat, fire season and occasional drought, grow on rocks or take root in chalky soil that piled up in holes in the limestone but retained neither water nor nutrients. Before more powerful tractors came along in the 1940s, farmers struggling to coax crops on the land called it pothole farming. Hammer, a survival instructor for the Discovery Channel’s “Naked and Afraid,” said living amid the pinelands’ stinging nettles, that can cause throbbing pain for days, and poisonwoods would be hard, for man or beast. “This habitat here would be a really tough way to go,” he said. The Florida prickly pear cactus is the state’s most common cactus and one of the largest blooming flowers in pine rockland. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com But what makes it harsh also makes it unique. Sandwiched between the coast and marshes, the pinelands grew in isolation, an evolution of apart-ness that produced a North American version of the Galapagos Islands, with 31 plants found no where else in the world. “They’ve been around for a long time, but they’ve been in pockets with the ups and downs of sea level,” said Tom Lodge, author of “The Everglades Handbook.” “If we are to preserve that heritage for people to see and enjoy for the future, we’ve got to be extremely careful. Because it’s so small, you could easily extinguish some of the species that require the habitat.” Although what’s left might just look like open land awaiting the next strip mall, and not like much of a forest to Northerners used to towering canopies, pinelands have dramatic beauty. It’s just small-scale.Up close, it’s a determined beauty, and the reason why environmentalists have fought so long and so hard to save it. High on Hammer’s list are wildflowers, plants with hairy stems and spiky leaves and beautiful bell-shaped flowers. One day this week, it took him about “10 seconds” to find the tiny heart-shaped leaves of one of the forest’s rarest plants, the deltoid spurge (spurges were once used as laxatives because of the bitter milky sap they produce) that now inhabit the Earth only on pine rockland between Sunset Driver and Southwest 264th Street. Deltoid spurge, one of five endangered or threatened plants in pine rockland, can now only be found between in pinelands east of Everglades National Park, between Southwest 72nd and Southwest 264th streets. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com “There’s cactus and coontie that dates back to the age of the dinosaurs,” he said. “It’s a pretty harsh environment but really one of the most floristically rich habitats we have.” As he walked around Thompson park, Hammer pointed out flowers that shined like jewels against a gray-green canvas: the pineland poinsettia, another spurge and the tougher-looking cousin of the crimson holiday plant; the lavender flower of the oakleaf fleabane, which early settlers stuffed in mattresses to keep away fleas; and the bright yellow trumpet of a groundcherry, which grows berry-sized tomatoes wrapped in papery husks. A Deering partridge pea, named for industrialist John Deering, is one of the many wildflowers that grow in pine rockland and is considered very rare outside Miami-Dade County. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com The forest is probably best known for as the source of hard-as-rock slash pine, marketed by lumberyards as Dade pine to distinguish its unique strength and which, along with the quarried oolite floor, helped build many early homes in South Florida. “Still today you have to drill a hole with a drill. You can’t pound a nail in it,” Hammer said. The forest also grew to perfectly reflect the environment in inhabited. From the beetles to the butterflies to the bats, each filled a niche in a very tight web. Miami tiger beetles, which can now only be found on pineland around the old base, controlled the ant population. Butterflies pollinated flowers. Bats ate bugs. Seasonal fires thinned the pine and kept live oaks and other taller trees from growing too big, which allowed the plants to grow on the rocky floor. The forest survived as long as nature took its course and the floor remained intact. 1,500 acresThe amount of remaining pine rockland maintained by Miami-Dade County When Hurricane Andrew plowed across Larry and Penny Thompson Park, it snapped some trees and left others bent “like fishing poles,” Hammer said. The rockland pine store much of their resin in their roots, which keep pine-boring beetles at bay. But with the winds wrenching the trees from their shallow purchase, the trees lost their best defense. Ips pine bark beetles killed what was left and invasive Burma weed — an Asian grass that escaped a Coconut Grove test garden decades ago to become one of the biggest threats to pinelands — quickly took over. To save it, Hammer and work crews attacked the towering grass with metal-bladed weed whackers, then knocked out new sprouts with herbicide. In other overgrown tracts around the county, they used chainsaws to thin the hardwoods first, then set fires to restore the seed banks. “If you cut all that down and burn it, those seeds sprout right away,” he said. Unlike its larger cousin, the pineland poinsettia has spikey long leaves and delicate flowers and is a state-listed endangered plant. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com The key is keeping the ancient ocean floor intact. Once the rock is covered with fill and paved over for parking lots or buildings, it’s gone forever. “There’s probably more plants per acre in this type of habitat than there are in most habitats in Florida,” Hammer said. “To say this is all screwed up and this is no good and get rid of it, it’s so bogus. This cost a lot of money. Don’t get me wrong. It’s thousands of dollars of acres because you’ve got people out here working every day. …But there’s just these little parcels here and there that make up what’s left.” Follow Jenny Staletovich on Twitter @jenstaletovich If you go Many of the pine rocklands around Miami-Dade County are open to the public.

Wal-Mart is still desperate to out-Amazon Amazon. It’s no secret that America’s biggest retailer sees Jeff Bezos as its arch rival. Recently, Wal-Mart has patented an automatic ordering device designed to work more easily than Amazon’s Dash button, offered up discounts intended to directly compete with the e-tailer, and even begun experimenting with automation. This week's Bloomberg Businessweek cover story asks the billion-dollar question: can Wal-Mart's new e-commerce efforts ever pull the rug from beneath Amazon? You might be pretty disappointed by your Tesla Model 3. The automaker's first mass-market car is expected to start rolling off production lines this year. But this week Elon Musk has taken pains to remind people that they shouldn't expect too much: "We want to be super clear, the Model 3 is not version 3 ... [it's] a smaller, more affordable version of the Model S with fewer features." And as production lines gear up, Wired reports that the firm is struggling more than ever with quality control of its other vehicles. Time to manage expectations. Ten Fascinating Things For years, advertising firms promised that targeted ads could give big-name brands laser-focused marketing. Now some are questioning whether it works. What happens if you toss aside the structural parts of a cell, keeping just the good stuff, like DNA, within? Perhaps a whole new approach to biotech. This frankly unsettling robotic snake is able to climb up metal walls. A new 3-D printing approach can embed copper wires and glass fibers into objects, turning the results into self-contained electrical or optical devices. Facebook's virtual reality unit, Oculus, has shut down its film studio. That may be a sign of things to come as firms try and actually commercialize VR. Cheap stuff is so tempting—and a new breed of websites selling goods direct from Chinese factories know it. Is this the future of consumerism? Anyone who learned to code in the 70s (or 80s, or even 90s) will be familiar with FORTRAN. Now NASA wants to make it 10,000 times faster. Uber’s facing federal investigation by the Justice Department over its controversial greyball software, which it allegedly used to deceive regulators. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that 50.8 percent of American homes have at least one cell phone but no landline. Once the preserve of nerds, memes are now mainstream culture. The Atlantic explores what happens when they cross over into the real world. Quote of the Day "The guys with hoodies have changed our world. But they’re not the only technologists." — AI researcher Fei-Fei Li describes a new initiative that she’s leading along with Melinda Gates to diversify the field of machine learning.

(WKRN) – One man was arrested and police are searching for two others wanted for credit card fraud at Middle Tennessee Walmart stores. Hendersonville officers were called to the Walmart on Anderson Lane to investigate suspicious credit card activity. The investigation led to the arrest of David Rios, 24, of Hialeah, Florida. Hendersonville police reported Rios was located at the store with an altered debit car, which had stolen credit card information re-encoded on its chip. Rios previously used the card at additional Walmart stores in Gallatin and Lebanon, according to police. Police are searching for two other men who were with Rios. Rios was booked into the Sumner County jail and charged with criminal simulation, theft of property under $1,000 and 12 counts of fraudulent use of a credit card.

He is the former China Correspondent for The WorldPost, and is currently writing a book on Chinafornia (Counterpoint Press, 2018). This piece is part of a special RCW series on the U.S.-China geopolitical relationship. The views expressed here are the author’s own. X Story Stream recent articles Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... For half a century, the U.S.-China relationship was almost exclusively the purview of political and business elites: Henry Kissinger scheming with an aging Mao Zedong; CEOs salivating over a billion new customers. It was something that ordinary Americans only experienced in the form of pink slips at their factories or “Everyday Low Prices” at Wal-Mart. But, in the last five years, all of that has changed. Chinese citizens, companies, and capital have arrived on U.S. soil in force, and they’re making their impact felt across small towns, college campuses, and corporate America. The trend is national, but the epicenter is in California. As the top destination for Chinese investors, students, tourists, and homebuyers, California is the living laboratory for a new paradigm in U.S.-China relations. This new paradigm is built on grassroots ties and face-to-face interactions. I call it Chinafornia. Chinafornia is the fluid ecosystem of entrepreneurs, students, investors, immigrants, and ideas bouncing back and forth between the Golden State and the Middle Kingdom. It’s the Chinese undergrads flooding onto California campuses and the Silicon Valley startups angling for a toehold in China. It’s the Chinese families buying up beachfront property in San Diego and the Los Angeles welders building Chinese-funded skyscrapers. It’s Chinese governors studying California carbon markets and California mayors courting Chinese manufacturing investment. Chinafornia is where the rubber meets the road in an era of deep, multifaceted engagement between the world’s two superpowers. This engagement is bringing the U.S.-China story down from the realm of geopolitics and directly into the lives of ordinary Americans. It’s creating jobs, funding long-stagnant development projects, and giving a boost to cash-strapped public universities. But it’s also creating new anxieties and frictions. Under normal conditions, a boom in investment is considered a win for local citizens. But when that money comes from far away investors -- especially from a country with a vastly different culture and an authoritarian government -- the influx creates thorny tradeoffs. Every benefit California derives from these interactions comes with a potential dark side, one that threatens to spark a nativist backlash against the new arrivals. For a glimpse into how these trends are playing out in real time, let’s take a tour of Chinafornia on the ground. Start in San Francisco’s Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood, the poorest and last predominantly black part of the city. Chinese investors have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into transforming the neighborhood’s abandoned navy shipyard into the city’s largest new housing and retail development in decades. The funding comes from the controversial EB-5 program, which grants green cards to foreign investors who create ten new jobs in America. More than $400 million from EB-5 investors -- 80 percent of them Chinese -- finally got the long-delayed Hunters Point project off the ground. Today, as the money pours in and the buildings go up, local Hunters Point residents look on with hope for new jobs -- and fear of being displaced by foreign-funded gentrification. For Chinafornia’s impact on higher education, head down to the University of California, San Diego. Ten years ago there were 70 undergraduates from mainland China at the school. Last year that number had skyrocketed to 3,534. It’s a transformation that has been replicated across the UC system, with the number of Chinese students multiplying by a factor of 10 in the last decade. The reason for that boom? Voracious Chinese demand for U.S. higher education, paired with a dramatic decline in state funding for public universities. International undergrads pay approximately three times the tuition of California residents. Since the global financial crisis, ramping up Chinese enrollment has become a quick fix for universities facing devastating budget cuts. But it’s also stirring resentment among locals, who fear admission to their public universities is being auctioned to the highest bidder. Hollywood and Silicon Valley face a different kind of Chinafornia conundrum: While the transpacific flow of funding and talent reaches new heights, the Chinese government has tightened censorship to levels not seen in decades. Chinese tech and film investors are also pouring into California. They’re seeking out unicorn startups and filmmaking know-how. China’s tech juggernauts have all established research facilities or investment beachheads in Silicon Valley and Chinese filmmakers are looking to work with -- or outright acquire -- their American peers. But when Silicon Valley and Hollywood execs return the visit, they are rebuffed. Many of Silicon Valley’s flagship companies -- Facebook, Google and Twitter, to name a few -- are outright blocked in China. Hollywood studios face sharp limits on the number of films that can enter China and they are often forced to sanitize scripts for fear of offending Chinese government censors. But the lure of a billion-person market remains strong: It has Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg studying Mandarin and Minnie Mouse dressing in a cheongsam at the new Shanghai Disneyland. That attraction and repulsion leaves America’s two cultural powerhouses facing loaded ethical questions. How far will they bend to Chinese government demands to ensure market access? How can they engage ordinary Chinese people without abandoning their commitment to free expression? Across these industries -- real estate, education, technology, entertainment, and many more -- we see the foundation being built for a new brand of U.S.-China relations. It’s one that’s full of new possibilities, but also creates local divisions with global implications. How we navigate these tradeoffs will set the stage for the most important bilateral relationship in the world. It’s up to the people of Chinafornia to get this new engagement right -- to guide these flows so they expand horizons and open opportunities for people in both countries. Let’s get to work.

The charges come after a chaotic scene in Clarksville on April 23, where police said the bounty hunters shot at the four people in the sedan and chased them for seven miles. Not one of the men in the sedan was wanted on outstanding charges. In fact, the Clarksville bounty hunters were looking for someone else, and there is no indication that any of the victims fired at the defendants or were even armed, police spokesman Jim Knoll said in an email. Bail bondsmen are empowered to hire or act as bounty hunters to bring in people who violate the terms of jail bonds, but they can't use deadly force unless it's self-defense. This combo of booking photos released by the Clarksville, Tenn., Police Department shows, top row from left, William L. Byles, Kenneth Chiasson, Antwon D. Keesee and Jonathan Schnepp; bottom row from left, Roger D. West, Prentice L. Williams and Joshua Young. AP Killed was 24-year-old Jalen Johnson, a father of three from Clarksville. His family called him an innocent man who died in an act of terrorizing violence. Johnson's uncle, Toni Jenkins, told The Associated Press that his nephew and the three men in the car with him had no idea why people would suddenly block their car in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Fearing an attack by gang members, they tried to flee. The bounty hunters, Jenkins said, started shooting in the parking lot and continued to fire on them during the chase, even ramming the Nissan along the way. Clarksville police would not confirm or deny these details, but authorities have said they are troubled by how the bounty hunters put people at risk. The Montgomery County grand jury charged all seven men with first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, three counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, attempted especially aggravated kidnapping, four counts of aggravated assault, employing a firearm in commission of a dangerous felony and felony reckless endangerment, police said. Some of the men charged were bonding agents and others were strictly bounty hunters, Knoll said. The men charged include: William L. Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Antwon D. Keesee, 32; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Roger D. West, 31; Prentice L. Williams, 34 and Joshua Young, 27. They do not yet have court dates or attorneys listed, the Montgomery County Circuit Court Clerk's office said. All the men are from Clarksville, a city about 50 miles northwest of Nashville near the Kentucky state line.

The Herald Bulletin of Anderson, Ind., reported that a jury on Thursday night found Mark Emerson guilty of murder and four counts of kidnapping, among other charges, after an eight-day trial. Emerson was arrested on June 22, 2015 at the Hermantown Wal-Mart — a drive of about 700 miles from Anderson — after his estranged wife managed to run and seek help. The woman told Hermantown police that she and her three daughters were kidnapped from her home in Indiana by her estranged husband, Emerson. She told police that Emerson broke into her home, fatally stabbed a man there — 25-year-old Cody Gay — and forced her and the children into a car. She said that Emerson planned to flee to Canada, and had stopped at the Wal-Mart to shoplift items to return in exchange for gift cards. When the woman was left alone in the car, she ran to the nearby Kolar car dealership to get help. The Hermantown Police Department reported that four of its officers, as well as a St. Louis County sheriff’s deputy, traveled to Indiana last week to testify at the trial. A Kolar employee who spoke with the woman after she fled the car also testified at the trial, the Herald Bulletin reported.

By Jeff Bryant / Education Opportunity Network May 5, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Zócalo Public Square / Flickr President Donald Trump’s adamant promotion of “school choice” and his selection of Betsy DeVos for education secretary have put advocates for charter schools in the Democratic party in a bind, and now they’re scrambling to keep the luster of the well-polished charter school brand unblemished. Their latest tactic is to carefully distinguish charters from the system of school vouchers Trump and DeVos favor, but they serve this cause poorly by making erroneous claims about how the charter industry works in most communities and what these schools do to harm public education. The latest misfire comes from David Leonhardt’s op-ed in Monday’s New York Times in which he takes on DeVos and her preference for vouchers while denigrating charter skeptics as people who need to get “an open mind.” It’s a precarious tightrope Leonhardt attempts to walk, and he stumbles quite badly. First, A Little Background First, it’s important to understand the source of the school choice schism in the Democratic party goes back 25 years, Jeffrey Henig explains in Education Week, when proponents of school choice came up with two different ways to achieve their goals: school vouchers and charter schools. While conservatives favored vouchers, which were a creation of free-market economist Milton Friedman, political centrists and some left-leaning people became infatuated with charters because they were birthed by “business-oriented moderates and technocrats” who became the predominant force in the Democratic party during Bill Clinton’s presidential administration. Around the turn of the century, these two strains of school choice advocacy united after pro-voucher forces, largely funded by the Walton Family Foundation (of Walmart fame), encountered a series of stinging defeats at the ballot box and a rising tide of anti-voucher sentiment among the general public. Voucher advocates welcomed their union with charter school fans because it gave their cause a bipartisan aura and some support from the civil rights community. “Charter proponents … welcomed the political and philanthropic support of the pro-voucher forces,” Henig writes, because they needed rightwing leverage and money to undermine opposition coming from teachers’ unions and public school advocates. For conservatives, the bipartisan unification for school choice established the slippery slope to potentially privatize public education. Moderate and lefty supporters of charter schools, on the other hand, got a Faustian bargain that gave them “education reformer” cred and the favor of Wall Street investors in exchange for colluding with the right wing. With Trump and DeVos, the bargain Democrats made on charter schools has come due. What Leonhardt Gets Wrong So what’s a charter-loving Democrat to do? Based on what Leonhardt writes for the Times, many are choosing to re-up their support with false claims and deceptive rhetoric. Leonhardt begins his column by calling attention to a new study showing the voucher program in the District of Columbia has had a negative impact on student achievement – a worthwhile news item to note for sure. But it becomes quickly apparent Leonhardt brings the subject up not to lambast DeVos but to miscast charter school skeptics as actors in a “caricature” debate over the fate of public education. That’s a convenient strawman that leads him to state there are those who “conflate vouchers … with charter schools,” but he cites no credible sources to substantiate his belief that critics of DeVos and school choice are incapable of distinguishing between charters and vouchers. Most concerning about Leonhardt’s column, though, is the many misleading statements he makes about how charter schools operate and what their impact is. He cites a few credible studies showing positive impacts of charter schools on student achievement, but he doesn’t appear to have read credible reports that have found otherwise. For instance, the most rigorous and most expensive study of charter school performance commissioned by the US Department of Education found no overall positive effect for charter schools. A recent study of charter schools in Texas found charters overall have no positive impact on test scores and have a negative impact on earnings later in life. So it’s totally misleading for Leonhardt to argue charters have “flourished” (whatever that means) when their track record is decidedly mixed at best. Leonhardt then piles on one misleading statement after another. His assertion that “charter-school systems are subject to rigorous evaluation and oversight” is counter factual to reports from the charter industry itself that show only about 3 percent of charter schools are closed for under-performing, and even those that are closed have operated an average of 6.2 years. In Ohio, only one of 10 charter school students attend a school rated high performing. In Michigan, charter schools score worse on national assessments, known as “The Nation’s Report Card,” than their traditional public-school counterparts, yet their numbers continue to expand every year. In Louisiana, charter-school students perform worse than public schools on eighth-grade reading and math tests by enormous margins – 2 to 3 standard deviations. And if you want to find out how charter schools spend the money they get from taxpayers, your job isn’t easy. Neither the federal government nor the states have created a place taxpayers can go to see how much in taxes these schools get and what they do with the cash, including what happens to real estate the schools purchase with the public’s money. Leonhardt’s next howler is his assertion, “Local officials decide which charters can open and expand.” Actually, most often state boards or independent charter granting entities make the decisions to open and close charters, not local officials. If you’re a local official in most states – including Arizona, Florida, California, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, – you have no idea if a charter school will pop up in your district and no control over what kind of students the charter will appeal to and how the charter will impact your budget. In most states – including Florida, Tennessee, California, Illinois, Colorado, and Alabama – local officials who deny a charter application or seek to close a charter are frequently overruled by appointed boards set up by state officials whose political campaigns have been well supported by the charter school industry or its wealthy promoters. The lack of local control endemic in charter school governance is by design. In its rankings of state legal statues governing charter schools, the charter industry lists “the existence of independent and/or multiple authorizers,” not local control, as a chief determiner of whether a state gets a top grade or not. Leonhardt is wrong on this point as well: “Many charters are open to all comers.” Numerous studies have found charters tend to serve lower percentages of students who have disabilities or whose first language isn’t English. I’m sure Leonhardt can find an inclusive charter here or there, but the fact remains there are no regulatory or statutory requirements that prevent a charter school operator from saying to a family, “Your child isn’t a good fit for our school,” and any attempt to put those requirements onto charters would be fought tooth-and-nail by the charter industry and its powerful lobby. Who Really Needs “An Open Mind” Lastly, Leonhardt offers a “political compromise” of “fewer vouchers, more charters,” and he accuses anyone unwilling to take that deal of not having “an open mind.” But expanding charters comes at a considerable cost to taxpayers as many of these schools continue to fleece the public coffers while traditional public schools lose vital resources. According to the latest accounting of charter school fraud, waste, and mismanagement, conducted by the Center for Popular Democracy, public funding of charter schools has grown to $40 billion annually while oversight of these schools has languished. CPD has identified over $223 million in public fund misuse by charters but argues this is merely “the tip of the iceberg.” The total estimated loss may top $2.1 billion, CPD calculates. As charters expand, the cost to public school systems is considerable, and many districts increasingly face financial insolvency as they lose students to these schools. Maybe that’s a subject Leonhardt can open his mind to.

Cummins was seen near the restaurant around 8am. Elizabeth and Cummins went on the run in a Nissan Rogue, which the teacher had borrowed from his wife that morning.  Her disappearance sparked a nationwide manhunt and Amber Alerts in several states before they were finally tracked down. Cummins faces life in prison on a charge of taking a minor across state lines for sex. He has not yet entered a plea to the charges, but his lawyer has released a statement saying he has 'no history of violence and no criminal history whatsoever'.  The moment Elizabeth is seen getting in the vehicle was the beginning of a 39-day life on the run for the teacher and student, which also saw them staying in Motel 8s and a nudist commune. The pair disappeared from Columbia, Tennessee, on March 13. They traveled to Alabama the next day then on to Oklahoma where they were spotted on March 15 before dropping off the radar until April 20 when they were found in a cabin in northern California  DailyMail.com revealed that the pair had previously spent ten days hiding at a hippy commune near the cabin where Cummins was arrested, the Black Bear Ranch, where they posed as a married couple and were seen 'making out' like lovers by a camp fire While at the commune the pair frequently spending entire days in bed in this attic, even though the group expects at least four hours of work a day from everyone According to an inventory of items confiscated from the cabin by the FBI, there were four bedrolls, two vacuum filters, coconut oil, and socks. The FBI also confiscated beer cans and tissues. Police got a tip about Cummins' whereabouts the night before his arrest from the caretaker of the cabin, 29-year-old Griffin Barry. Barry, who is originally from Nashville, said he let the couple stay in the cabin in exchange for work and realized who the two were when a neighbor showed him a picture of Elizabeth's missing person poster.  That's when it all came together for Barry and he called to tip off police. Looking back, he said there was something suspicious about the couple. Barry is set to receive $10,000 reward for his role in Cummins' arrest. Barry says the two first came through the area two weeks ago, looking for the Black Bear Ranch Commune, and were going by the names John and Joanna.  The couple, claiming to be 38 and 24 years old, had run out of gas and Cummins told a sad story about how they lost all of their possessions in a house fire in Colorado and didn't have any money left. So Barry decided to be a Good Samaritan, and gave Cummins money, gas and directions to the commune.   'I put some gas in his car and gave him $40 dollars and said if it doesn’t work come back I’ll feed you, you know what I mean?' Barry, 29, told WKRN.  Police say Cummins (left) switched the license plates on his car several times and disabled its GPS system to avoid detection as he fled with Thomas (right) This cabin in California was the final stop on a cross-country, 39-day life on the run for Cummins and Elizabeth Cummins and Elizabeth did in fact make it to the commune, where they spent 10 days sleeping on a filthy mattress in the attic of a communal building. But the members of the nudist colony sensed something was off with the two and decided against letting them into the group permanently. After getting kicked out of the commune, Cummins and Thomas returned to Cecilville on April 18, and Barry offered to let them sleep in one of his unfinished cabins in exchange for work. 'In my head I'm thinking he had a house fire and lost everything,' Barry said. 'I came out here on a prayer and people helped me out and got me on my feet and hopefully I can pass it on.' After his arrest, Cummins' wife claimed he had admitted he's slept with the teen and begged her forgiveness after he was caught. Jill Cummins, who filed for divorce from Tad Cummins after he ran off with Elizabeth, said her husband made the confession during a phone call from jail. Jill Cummins told Inside Edition she had asked him straight out; 'did you sleep with her?' 'Yes I did,' he replied, according to his wife who said she hadn't wanted to hear any details of their relationship, but she had already known the truth. 'I just wanted to hear it from him to me.' Jill Cummins, the wife of Tad Cummins, who went on the run with his 15-year-old student claims he admitted he's slept with the teen and begged her forgiveness after he was caught Prosecutors in Sacramento claimed that Tad Cummins changed his license plates, paid in cash and even planned to take a boat from San Diego to Mexico, to keep one step ahead of the police. Once across the border, he may have been planning to take her even further in to South America, they said. The documents, filed in federal court on April 24 ahead of his first hearing claim he admitted to switching license plates on his car several times and disabling its GPS system to avoid being caught. He paid for essentials, including chocolate for the teenager, with cash and only took back roads to avoid roadside surveillance, they claim.  'The defendant had plans to attempt to escape across the United States border to Mexico. He then planned to seek passage to countries further south of Mexico. 'In furtherance of this plan, the defendant procured a small watercraft and conducted a test run to cross into Mexico across the water from San Diego.  'The defendant also considered the feasibility of a land crossing into Mexico,' they said.  Cummins appeared in court for his first hearing. According to the prosecutors, he planned to take Thomas to Mexico, and then on to countries further south Cummins spoke only briefly in court to confirm his identity, and agreed to be returned to Tennessee to face trial there, according to WAAY TV. Judge Kendall Newman agreed that Cummins should not be allowed any release terms after being told by the prosecution that he had played a 'cat and mouse game' with officers who were hunting him. Assistant US attorney Jason Hitt added that Cummins had used 'his position of trust as a school teacher' to commit the alleged crime. That - and Cummins allegedly having two guns in the vehicle when he and the missing girl were found - make him a danger, he said. He also had at least seven pills of erectile dysfunction drug Cialis, they said.  'During his flight, the defendant engaged in a daring cat-and-mouse run from law enforcement in order to further his own prurient desires while engaging in a number of sophisticated maneuvers to avoid being caught,' prosecutors said in the documents. 'His actions in evasion were criminal.' THE PAIR'S FLIGHT FROM JUSTICE January 23: Tad Cummins is spotted kissing Elizabeth Thomas, his student at Culleoka High School, by another student.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen An Arizona woman made a harrowing discovery when she opened the zipper pouch of a purse she purchased from Walmart — what appeared to be a note written by a stricken Chinese prison labourer. Story continues below Christel Wallace of Sierra Vista, Arizona found the note in the purse she bought for her daughter-in-law Laura Wallace, KVOA reports. READ MORE: Rana Plaza disaster: Canadian Tire, other major brands urged to fully report supply chains The note, which Laura shared on Facebook, claims to be a cry for help from an inmate languishing in Yingshan Prison in Guangxi, China, according to this translation provided by the Huffington Post: “Inmates in the Yingshan Prison in Guangxi, China are working 14 hours daily with no break/rest at noon, continue working overtime until 12 midnight, and whoever doesn’t finish his work will be beaten. Their meals are without oil and salt. Every month, the boss pays the inmate 2000 yuan [about $290], any additional dishes will be finished by the police. If the inmates are sick and need medicine, the cost will be deducted from the salary. Being a prisoner in China is even worse than being a horse, cow, sheep, pig or dog in the U.S.” The authenticity of the note hasn’t been verified. Walmart’s supplier standards state that all labour involved in producing and supplying products for sale at its stores must be voluntary. A spokesperson told KVOA that the retail giant is unable to comment on the note “because we have no way to verify the origin of the letter.” READ MORE: U.S. bans import of goods produced by slave labour Laura Wallace told KVOA that she hopes the note will help raise awareness about working conditions in penal labour camps. “I don’t want this to be an attack on any store… That’s not the answer,” she said. “This is happening at all kinds of places and people just probably don’t know.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Magazine store Nick Kozak,Toronto Star Mohammed Polani, owner of the Daily Planet, is closing his magazine store in the Whitby Mall Shopping Centre when his lease runs out. Five Points Mall Vince Talotta,Toronto Star The enclosed part of the Five Points Mall in Oshawa is slated to be demolished. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Francine Kopun TORONTO — Mohammed Polani remembers the days when the Whitby Mall Shopping Centre was packed with people who would line up outside his store at 7 a.m. to buy newspapers and magazines. They were educated and literate, with a wide variety of hobbies and interests — diverse enough that he could sell magazines with titles like Vintage Fire Truck and Equipment and Wrist Watch Magazine and the Harvard Business Review. "As long as there was a proper anchor, things were good," says Polani. "The mall was like a can of sardines; it was very busy until about 2000." Then his clientele in the mall's office space began to be relocated, as their companies were bought, sold and restructured. The Woolco anchor store was replaced by a Walmart which was replaced partly by a Sobeys with no access through the mall. A second-hand store replaced a Staples. The new generation of workers in the mall's office spaces are more interested in Facebook and Instagram than they are in the magazines Polani sells, and they can access an infinite number of articles for free online. At the end of his lease, Polani will hand in the keys to his store, Daily Planet, joining a long list of retailers calling it quits in an unforgiving retail environment that is adding up to one long headache for mall owners. Whitby Mall isn't the only property struggling to attract and keep tenants. While top-tier malls, including Yorkdale Shopping Centre and Toronto Eaton Centre are by all accounts flourishing, many neighbourhood malls appear to be an anchor away from a potentially fatal downward spiral. Others are clinging to their original retail purpose while waiting for redevelopment. No one is predicting the kind of retail apocalypse in Canada that swept across the United States after the financial collapse of 2008, leaving even large malls across the country abandoned. The single most important difference is that the U.S. had too much retail to begin with and still does. Industry estimates peg the amount of mall space in the U.S. at 25 square feet per person, whereas in Canada it's closer to 15 square feet per person. But the sector is in upheaval. The retail industry is the single largest jobs category in the country, employing 1.96 million people in 2016, according to Statistics Canada. Most retail workers — 1.7 million — are employed in shopping centres, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centres. There are 3,742 shopping centres in Canada measuring more than 40,000 square feet, including strip malls, according to the council — up from 3,496 in 2012. Historically, malls were anchored by department stores at either end, but the department store sector is in decline in the U.S. and Canada. "Over the five years to 2021, the industry is forecast to continue contracting," according to an industry report, "Department Stores in Canada," from market research firm IBISWorld. "Malls used to rely on their anchors and the anchors are changing faster than anyone imagined they would," said Mary Mowbray, senior vice-president, group sales for real estate firm Colliers International, pointing to Target, which cycled in and out of shopping malls in two years. Some malls have already backfilled — or failed to backfill — the 133 large spaces left by Target when it abruptly pulled up stakes in 2015. The failure of a retailer such as Sears Canada — working on another turnaround strategy after years of diminishing returns and selling off stores — would send shock waves across the already fragile retail ecosystem. Sears has closed 11 department store anchor locations across Canada since 2012. It still anchors 93. RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust had 26 Target stores, and while CEO Edward Sonshine managed to extract a $132-million payment from Target in bankruptcy and many of the locations were leased to new tenants, others remain empty two years later, such as the one at Five Points Mall in Oshawa. Now the enclosed part of Five Points Mall will be demolished. The area where the empty Target store is located has been sold to a self-storage company. It will remain a shopping centre, but not enclosed. Enclosed malls are too expensive to operate — the taxes are high, they're expensive to heat in winter and cool in summer, said Sonshine. "That type of space, unless you're part of a very large centre, it's obsolete," he added. The softness in the sector is being driven by a large number of retail failures, including once-dominant brands such as American Apparel, Mexx, Jones New York and Tip Top Tailors, and Canadian mainstays such as Danier Leather and Jacob. A few brands and retailers are in expansion mode, but they aren't expanding as fast as other retailers are falling, and the result is a large number of vacant storefronts in malls. The growth of online sales is another contributing factor. According to an estimate by Colliers International, online sales of $23 billion in 2014 replaced 76.7 million square feet of bricks and mortar stores. That's roughly equivalent to the shopping centre inventories of Vancouver, Halifax, Ottawa and Victoria combined, according to the report. "My caution to anyone in the shopping centre industry is that this is a very fragile situation in my view," said retail consultant Doug Stephens, author of the newly published book "Re-Engineering Retail, The Future of Selling in a Post-Digital World." Online sales are not just cutting into sales at bricks-and-mortar stores, online shopping is recalibrating what people think shopping should be, Stephens said. Shopping online is frictionless, and shoppers can get almost unlimited information about the products they're buying. "All that is changing our consumer brains to expect more when we actually make the effort to go to a shopping centre," Stephens said. "Thirty years ago the shopping centre was really the apex of convenience. Pre-Internet, where else could you go for shopping? That has been usurped by the Internet. The biggest big box of them all is the Internet, specifically Amazon." Even mall owners are getting out of the mall business. Canada's top commercial real estate development and investment firms have pared down their mall portfolios by half in recent years. Cadillac Fairview began shrinking the number of its retail assets 10 years ago, from about 40 to the current 20 retail assets across the country, according to Salvatore (Sal) Iacono, executive vice-president, operations. In the past five years, Cadillac Fairview has invested $2 billion in developing and redeveloping the mall assets it kept, including Sherway Gardens and Toronto Eaton Centre. Oxford Properties Group has pared down to fewer than a dozen malls, and also invested $2 billion in redeveloping its remaining mall assets, including expansions at Yorkdale and Square One, which it co-owns with the Alberta Investment Management Corporation. Ivanhoé Cambridge, which owns Vaughan Mills, Fairview Mall and Oshawa Centre, has 28 mall properties in Canada, including five owned with Cadillac Fairview, down from 48, according to Claude Sirois, president, retail, Ivanhoé Cambridge. Some malls have redevelopment potential, although that can take years — even decades. RioCan's Sonshine has described his retail empire, with more than 300 locations across Canada, as a land bank with some of the best future redevelopment sites in the country. "Every shopping centre ever built is at a major intersection and a good location. As the country fills in transit and infrastructure over the next 10 years — and it's not just a Toronto phenomenon, it's happening in Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa — it unlocks opportunities," he told analysts on the company's most recent earnings call. The new owners of the Whitby Mall Shopping Centre purchased it last year, with an eye to its long-term potential as a mixed-used development, including homes. "In our mind, we were buying land with income," said Adam Paul, CEO of First Capital Realty, the same firm that redeveloped Hazelton Lanes into Yorkville Village in Toronto. "Our immediate plans are to continue to run it because we are receiving an acceptable return on it. We will work with the city and the community and existing retailers to determine what the appropriate redevelopment will look like and the timing. But I know it's not short term."

Whitehead“We’ve reached the point where state actors can penetrate rectums and vaginas, where judges can order forced catheterizations, and where police and medical personnel can perform scans, enemas and colonoscopies without the suspect’s consent. And these procedures aren’t to nab kingpins or cartels, but people who at worst are hiding an amount of drugs that can fit into a body cavity. In most of these cases, they were suspected only of possession or ingestion. Many of them were innocent But these tactics aren’t about getting drugs off the street These tactics are instead about degrading and humiliating a class of people that politicians and law enforcement have deemed the enemy.” - Radley Balko, The Washington PostApril 19, 2017 "Information Clearing House" -  Daily, all across America, individuals who dare to resist—or even question—a police order are being subjected to all sorts of government-sanctioned abuse ranging from forced catheterization, forced blood draws, roadside strip searches and cavity searches, and other foul and debasing acts that degrade their bodily integrity and leave them bloodiedand bruised.Americans as young as 4 years old are being leg shackled, handcuffed, tasered and held at gun pointfor not being quiet, not being orderly and just being childlike—i.e., not being compliant enough.Government social workers actually subjected a 3-year-old boy to a forced catheterization after he was unable to provide them with a urine sample on demand (the boy still wasn’t potty trained). The boy was held down, screaming in pain, while nurses forcibly inserted a tube into his penis to drain his bladder—all of this done because the boy’s mother’s boyfriend had failed a urine analysis for drugs.Americans as old as 95 are being beaten, shot and killed for questioning an order, hesitating in the face of a directive, and mistaking a policeman crashing through their door for a criminal breaking into their home—i.e., not being submissive enough.Consider what happened to David Dao, the United Airlines passenger who was accosted by three police, forcibly wrenched from his seat across the armrest, bloodying his face in the process, and dragged down the aisle by the arms merely for refusing to relinquish his paid seat after the airline chose him randomly to be bumped from the flight—after being checked in and allowed to board—so that airline workers could make a connecting flight.Those with ADHD, autism, hearing impairments, dementia or some other disability that can hinder communication in the slightest way are in even greater danger of having their actions misconstrued by police. Police shot a 73-year-old-man with dementia seven times after he allegedly failed to respond to orders to stop approaching and remove his hands from his jacket. The man was unarmed and had been holding a crucifix.Clearly, it no longer matters where you live.Big city or small town: it’s the same scenario being played out over and over again in which government agents, hyped up on their own authority and the power of their uniform, ride roughshod over the citizenry who—in the eyes of the government—are viewed as having no rights.Our freedoms—especially the Fourth Amendment—continue to be torn asunder by the prevailing view among government bureaucrats that they have the right to search, seize, strip, scan, spy on, probe, pat down, taser, and arrest any individual at any time and for the slightest provocation.Forced cavity searches, forced colonoscopies, forced blood draws, forced breath-alcohol tests, forced DNA extractions, forced eye scans, forced inclusion in biometric databases—these are just a few ways in which Americans continue to be reminded that we have no control over what happens to our bodies during an encounter with government officials.For instance, during a “routine” traffic stop for allegedly “rolling” through a stop sign, Charnesia Corley was thrown to the ground, stripped of her clothes, and forced to spread her legs while Texas police officers subjected her to a roadside cavity probe, all because they claimed to have smelled marijuana in her car.Angel Dobbs and her 24-year-old niece, Ashley, were pulled over by a Texas state trooper for allegedly flicking cigarette butts out of the car window. Insisting that he smelled marijuana, the trooper proceeded to interrogate them and search the car. Despite the fact that both women denied smoking or possessing any marijuana, the police officer then called in a female trooper, who carried out a roadside cavity search, sticking her fingers into the older woman’s anus and vagina, then performing the same procedure on the younger woman, wearing the same pair of gloves. No marijuana was found.Leila Tarantino was subjected to two roadside strip searches in plain view of passing traffic during a routine traffic stop, while her two children—ages 1 and 4—waited inside her car. During the second strip search, presumably in an effort to ferret out drugs, a female officer “forcibly removed” a tampon from Tarantino. Nothing illegal was found.David Eckert was forced to undergo an anal cavity search, three enemas, and a colonoscopy after allegedly failing to yield to a stop sign at a Wal-Mart parking lot. Cops justified the searches on the grounds that they suspected Eckert was carrying drugs because his “posture [was] erect” and “he kept his legs together.” No drugs were found.Meanwhile, four Milwaukee police officers were charged with carrying out rectal searches of suspects on the street and in police district stations over the course of several years. One of the officers was accused of conducting searches of men’s anal and scrotal areas, often inserting his fingers into their rectums and leaving some of his victims with bleeding rectums.Incidents like these—sanctioned by the courts and conveniently overlooked by the legislatures—teach Americans of every age and skin color the painful lesson that there are no limits to what the government can do in its so-called “pursuit” of law and order.If this is a war, then “we the people” are the enemy.As Radley Balko notes in The Washington Post, “When you’re at war, it’s important to dehumanize your enemy. And there’s nothing more dehumanizing than forcibly and painfully invading someone’s body — all the better if you can involve the sex organs.”The message being beaten, shot, tasered, probed and slammed into our collective consciousness is simply this: it doesn’t matter if you’re in the right, it doesn’t matter if a cop is in the wrong, it doesn’t matter if you’re being treated with less than the respect you deserve or the law demands.The only thing that matters to the American police state is that you comply, submit, respect authority and generally obey without question whatever a government official (anyone who wears a government uniform, be it a police officer, social worker, petty bureaucrat or zoning official) tells you to do.This is what happens when you allow the government to call the shots: it becomes a bully.As history shows, this recipe for disaster works every time: take police officers hyped up on their own authority and the power of the badge, throw in a few court rulings suggesting that security takes precedence over individual rights, set it against a backdrop of endless wars and militarized law enforcement, and then add to the mix a populace distracted by entertainment, out of touch with the workings of their government, and more inclined to let a few sorry souls suffer injustice than to challenge the status quo.“It is not only under Nazi rule that police excesses are inimical to freedom,” warned former Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter in a 1946 ruling in Davis v. United States: “It is easy to make light of insistence on scrupulous regard for the safeguards of civil liberties when invoked on behalf of the unworthy. It is too easy. History bears testimony that by such disregard are the rights of liberty extinguished, heedlessly at first, then stealthily, and brazenly in the end.”In other words, if it could happen in Nazi Germany, it can just as easily happen here.It is happening here.Unfortunately, we’ve been marching in lockstep with the police state for so long that we’ve forgotten how to march to the tune of our own revolutionary drummer. In fact, we’ve even forgotten the words to the tune.We’ve learned the lessons of compliance too well.For too long, “we the people” have allowed the government to ride roughshod over the Constitution, equating patriotism with blind obedience to the government’s dictates, no matter how unconstitutional or immoral those actions might be.As historian Howard Zinn recognized:Our problem is civil obedience. Our problem is the numbers of people all over the world who have obeyed the dictates of the leaders of their government and have gone to war, and millions have been killed because of this obedience… Our problem is that people are obedient all over the world, in the face of poverty and starvation and stupidity, and war and cruelty. Our problem is that people are obedient while the jails are full of petty thieves, and all the while the grand thieves are running the country. That's our problem… people are obedient, all these herdlike people.What can you do?It’s simple but as I detail in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the consequences may be deadly.Stop being so obedient. Stop being so compliant and herdlike. Stop kowtowing to anyone and everyone in uniform. Stop perpetuating the false notion that those who work for the government—the president, Congress, the courts, the military, the police—are in any way superior to the rest of the citizenry. Stop playing politics with your principles. Stop making excuses for the government’s growing list of human rights abuses and crimes. Stop turning a blind eye to the government’s corruption and wrongdoing and theft and murder. Stop tolerating ineptitude and incompetence by government workers. Stop allowing the government to treat you like a second-class citizen. Stop censoring what you say and do for fear that you might be labeled an extremist or worse, unpatriotic. Stop sitting silently on the sidelines while the police state kills, plunders and maims your fellow citizens.Stop being a slave.As anti-war activist Rosa Luxemburg concluded, “Those who do not move, do not notice their chains.”You may not realize it yet, but you are not free.If you believe otherwise, it is only because you have made no real attempt to exercise your freedoms.Had you attempted to exercise your freedoms before now by questioning a police officer’s authority, challenging an unjust tax or fine, protesting the government’s endless wars, defending your right to privacy against the intrusion of surveillance cameras, or any other effort that challenges the government’s power grabs and the generally lopsided status quo, you would have already learned the hard way that the police state has no appetite for freedom and it does not tolerate resistance.This is called authoritarianism, a.k.a. totalitarianism, a.k.a. oppression.As Glenn Greenwald notes for the Guardian:Oppression is designed to compel obedience and submission to authority. Those who voluntarily put themselves in that state – by believing that their institutions of authority are just and good and should be followed rather than subverted – render oppression redundant, unnecessary. Of course people who think and behave this way encounter no oppression. That's their reward for good, submissive behavior. They are left alone by institutions of power because they comport with the desired behavior of complacency and obedience without further compulsion. But the fact that good, obedient citizens do not themselves perceive oppression does not mean that oppression does not exist.Get ready to stand your ground or run for your life, because the American police state is coming to get you.Constitutional attorney and author John W.

jezebel Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root jezebel Kim and Kanye's Clothing for Kids, Reviewed  Kelly FairclothYesterday 3:40pm Filed to: kids clothing reviews the kids supply north west kim and kanye literally just set your money on fire instead 116 5 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Kim and North at a Selena Gomez event, 2017. Photo via Getty Images. Despite the fact that children grow like weeds and you can get a perfectly adorable ensemble for a reasonable amount of money at, say, the Gap, people just keep making fancy fashion lines for kids. The latest to the party are Kim and Kanye with their newly launched line “The Kids Supply.” Advertisement Of course, a “Kardashian Kids” clothing line already exists, available now at a Babies R Us near you. It’s cute, if nothing special. But it’s got a rather more pre-Kanye vibe. For instance, hard to imagine Kim putting North—a child who has worn Supreme and Balmain—in this: (It also looks like it’s languishing; the Facebook page is barely updated, ditto Instagram, and the clothes are all on sale.) Advertisement The Kids Supply, by contrast, is a Kim and Kanye project, an outgrowth of his Yeezy collections. “For the past few years Kanye and I have made almost all of our kids clothes and we have collaborated on a new kids line !” Kim announced on Twitter, adding, “All of my friends would ask where we get our kids clothes so now they will be available! Tomorrow’s drop is so sick!” Now that it has arrived, some thoughts. Well, first, perhaps more of a question: Does one really need chokers for children? Photos via The Kids Supply. These sweatsuits seem pretty functional, up the wear and tear of being worn by a small human bent on destruction. However, they are $125 and $105. Camouflage hoodies for children are also available on the Walmart website, attractively priced between $13.25 and $15.28.  Photos via The Kids Supply. Preventing sunburn is important. These $35 hats are therefore functional. Photos via The Kids Supply. These t-shirts are $28 and nothing special besides boasting the logo. Why bother? Photos via The Kids Supply. Here is a $45 t-shirt covered in flames that would be a very special Christmas gift for the world’s most enthusiastic pint-sized Kanye West fan. He will outgrow it immediately. If he just likes extremely metal flame details, you can probably find that for a fraction of the price almost anywhere that sells aggressively gendered children’s clothing. (Which is almost everywhere that sells children’s clothing.) Photos via The Kids Supply. These dresses are 100% silk. They are beautiful, like fancy slips from a Pre-Code Hollywood film. Which, frankly, makes me uncomfortable as all hell! They will almost certainly fall victim to finger paints or grass stains or melted popsicle or just a simple rip within the first 24 hours of purchase, because—again—this is supposed to be clothing for children. They are $125 each. Photos via The Kids Supply. This is a reversible bomber jacket, made of “100% washed silk quilted filled and embroidered,” specifically with “Calabasas” in big loopy font and also a map of the area. It costs $240. Presumably even Kim and Kanye would put something like this on North for five minutes to take the picture—or to let the paparazzi take the picture—and then swap it out for some practical cotton thing that cost $15, before it gets smeared with ketchup. Half impractical items and universally overpriced, I give this collection two stars. However, I would pay good money just to see the expression on any childcare provider’s face at drop off one of these silk items.

By Killian Wright-Jackson A post shared by flo$$. aka fucci (@karlie.floss) on Mar 25, 2017 at 11:51am PDT At 25, stylist, creative director, and image architect Farren Fucci has achieved what many dream about. In March, he styled Rihanna for a Paper cover story. (He’d previously dressed Bella Hadid for the magazine in December 2016.) She was dressed in vintage Chanel, unbuttoned and topless, a sweaty bottle of 40oz beer in her manicured hand. There was a sumptuous fur coat worn with a sports bra; and her hair shifted from seafoam spikes to lavender tresses and citrus ponytails. Throughout the editorial each look was an amalgamation of luxury, mundanity, and blackness. And they were all created with the kind of context that can only be lived; the kind that a million black girls know but never name. Those smoky nights where one poses against a bag of chips in a nearby bodega, decked out in club-ready couture. I first saw Fucci’s work on Twitter in December. A lot of my friends followed him and retweeted his Carrie Bradshaw thread, a sermon about hoeism. His posts featured style moments from old television shows, forgotten editorials, and underrated runway collections. They were high-fashion, but also street, sexy, and prim. It was his Polyvore mood boards, though, that really helped him gain visibility in the fashion world. They showed that he was capable of styling seriously, with a careful eye, and caught the attention of Rihanna long before the two worked together. Fucci’s is the kind of Twitter page that makes you forget about time, sifting through GIFS forever, saving looks to your phone for reference. When we met in March through a mutual friend, Fucci stood tall at 6 feet 3 inches, dressed in baggy leather pants, a motorcycle jacket, and Chanel sneakers. He was reserved and quiet, but I was full of excitement. Fucci’s not just in fashion, but creating it. He’s also black and gay. When I was working in fashion I rarely saw anyone who looked like me. Black bodies are rarely embraced in that realm and almost never arbiters of style. Often we exist only as inspiration, as halves of a whole and as littered affectations. Despite a few hiccups in our plans to set up an interview, we finally spoke over email, FaceTime, and a phone call about fashion, empowerment, and being a creative. ADVERTISEMENT What’s your earliest memory of being interested in fashion? When I saw 2004 Rasta Collection for Dior by John Galliano. I was like 13 years old. It was a photograph of Gisele Bundchen by Nick Knight. That was the first image I cut out and put on my wall as a child. I really wanted to be her, she was so badass. I didn’t know anything about her but I knew I loved that outfit. But before then my introduction to fashion was playing with Barbies and Bratz dolls. I took styling them so seriously; I would cut their clothes and make them shorter. I thought their bodies were banging and I always wanted to show that off. I used to fucking murder that game My Scene online. Oh, that was my shit! What do you think attracted to Barbies, Bratz, the female form? Honestly, before I was born the doctor told my mom I was a girl and I just thought for a moment, before I had the tools and the language, that I was born in the wrong body. When I dressed Barbie I felt like I was dressing myself. Back then as a kid, you weren’t really allowed to express yourself outside of gender norms and to do anything outside of masculinity was considered “wanting to be a girl”. And I think at that time, I ran with that. Do you think that played a part in the sort of self-loathing you’ve addressed on Instagram? Yes, I grew up in a small ass town and I think a smaller town breeds even smaller minds. Anything I did, even my basketball movements were nitpicked. If I did anything “feminine”, like play video games online as a girl character and my mother would come and turn the game off. She’d make me go outside and play basketball. I was forced to do things I didn’t want to do. It was always go outside and shoot and practice. And how did that impact you? When I was seventeen years old, I became homeless. I had a boyfriend and my grandparents were very religious and my mom was homophobic. One day I came home from my boyfriend’s and my mom told me that my grandparents said I needed to leave. I didn’t ask any questions, I left. There wasn’t anything I could do. I was who I was and no one was going to change that. It was very difficult, doing everything on my own. I was raised upper middle class, my mother and grandparents gave me a lot, but when I came out there was no more of that. I was working at a gas station, Chilli’s, Wal-Mart, and a clothing store called Maurice’s. It was a hustle, everyday. I stayed with a friend for about three months and then I made it to college. During that time, I was in a physically abusive relationship. Rated R had just come out and that’s what really linked me to Rihanna. We seemed to be going through the same thing. I played “Firebomb” everyday. Every word still hits me. There was so much going on and I ended up moving to another city just to get away. It was dark and scary, but there were fun moments. I went to clubs for the first time, I smoked. I was a bit lost, unstable, but I learned so much. def framing dis. such an amazing experience. the opportunities already rolling in, i appreciate you more than you know. @badgalriri 📸 : @rihannaoverdose A post shared by flo$$. aka fucci (@karlie.floss) on Mar 3, 2017 at 11:19am PST You posted about “that moment when you finally become comfortable in your own skin” and learning to love yourself, how’d you arrive at that moment? ADVERTISEMENT It was more so a fake it until I make it kind of thing. I knew that no one was gonna treat me with respect, no one else was gonna love me, unless I did first, or at least act like I do. I realized that me beating myself up and being unhappy wasn’t fueling me, it was putting me in situations that I didn’t need to be in. Around people who weren’t good for me. I got tired of it and I cut it out. Your entry into the fashion realm looks unprecedented and tremendously fast to an outsider. What were your early days of styling before your big breakthrough? Before I started doing the styling and stuff like that, I was at the point where I had to jump all in. Last year, I gave God an ultimatum and said if I don’t make it quick or fast I don’t know how much longer I can live on this planet. I was at the point where I was nearly about to give up because I wanted to create and the job I was at was not challenging me in anyway. Literally within a week, I jumped full force into that idea. Every time 11:11 hit, I would pray and tell God what I wanted. As soon as I started doing that pattern, (I believe full-heartedly in numerology and I read that 11:11 is the Angel’s time or the time that God hears you the most) I posted the picture of the Hillary Clinton shirt and that day Rihanna hit me up. What happened after Rihanna got in touch? When I first started posting looks, I didn’t expect anything to happen. When I was in the city to give Rihanna the shirt, I thought about the Paper interview in which they christened me “Rihanna’s favorite.” At first I didn’t like that, I thought it was a bit pretentious until she called me that herself. But when I was in New York City, I hit up Sandra, who wrote the piece. She was really an advocate for me, she got the vision. We had an impromptu meeting and I told her my vision for Bella. Me and Bella had become really cool through DM’s and texting, really a lot of life advice and suggestions and that eventually lead towards some fashion ideas. The whole idea from our shoot with Bella was to make her break out of the shell that I felt the fashion industry was putting her in. I felt like fashion wasn’t allowing her to be as edgy as she could be and I wanted to help show that. They already had a concept with a cover for someone else but when I told them the idea they were amazed and decided to go with that instead. Rihanna rented out an entire nightclub just so the two of you can grab a drink, what is it outside of styling that you think makes her feel comfortable with you? I think it has a lot to do with my transparency. I share a lot of things online and I’m genuine in that way. After we shot the Paper cover, I asked her why me out of all of her millions of fans, and she said that my genuineness and authenticity speaks through my social media and it even made her feel comfortable enough to do something as bold as give me her personal number.

Listen to that, follow your heart, it will all come true. It’s gonna be hard as fuck, but believe you can get out of any rut.” Why are you so transparent online? I used to be very reserved and quiet in real life. Social media was a way for me to share my thoughts, I’m better at writing my feelings and ideas down. It was easy for me to say whatever I thought and there was no one that could stop me, so why not be transparent? I’ve thought about making another instagram but I don’t really care. I’m gonna say what I want from my page, I don’t need to hide. I’m not scared of anyone. There was no decision making to be transparent, I just have nothing I feel I need to hide. You either like me or you don’t. How do you choose the women you work with? It is only through social? I like edgy girls. I like girls who smoke weed and wear Chanel. A bad bitch, someone who is confident in her sexuality. That’s my favorite type of woman. I always want to celebrate her sexy, I think regardless of body type, hair color, ethnicity, there’s that innate sex appeal I try to bring out. I like to work with women I actually like as people and they have to have good energy. ADVERTISEMENT You’ve talked a lot about your “hoesthetic” for women, wanting them to feel liberated and empowered, are the approaches to this aesthetic different for women of color whose bodies are often policed and criticized, is there a different responsibility you feel you might have when dressing the black body? I don’t approach it differently at all. I believe every woman should be allowed to dress the way that they want and that’s how I create looks. We use our own gaze, not the white one, not the male one, not one focused on “class”. This is their world. We dress for ourselves here. If you understand good, if not, next. Most people seem to have forgotten that there was a time when men who were interested in fashion were immediately thought of as gay. Musicians, athletes, and celebrities have changed that publically. Contemporary media outlets often cite straight male rappers as “fashion icons” but very rarely do gay men who started certain trends get press. What are your thoughts on that? I think that’s pretty wack. I was wearing shit that straight men are wearing now when I was in eleventh grade. That was in 2006. It’s interesting because minority groups create these trends that the mass take on years later but now I’m happy we are starting to see change. There are gay men who have paved the way for me and others. Men like Andre Leon Talley and Edward Enninful. I hope one day I become a fashion icon but I do feel like the pit that gay men are in sometimes starts in our own communities. A lot of times gay men, in my experience, have been unsupportive and catty in fashion. I think there’s a territorial type of thing. They’re territorial towards friends who happen to be their clients and I’m a new person that a lot of people want to work with. I don’t think they think there’s enough room for all of us. There’s still that idea that there can only be one. I don’t compete with anyone. You automatically lose when you do that. There’s so much of a fight with gays and fashion but how can we advance as a community if we aren’t even for each other? Do you think fashion truly believes in that rhetoric? I don’t think they believe that fully, but I think they have favorites. It’s all about connections, it’s all about how you move. If I would've came into the industry with 100 followers and no network, I would’ve gotten treated with a who are you? The thing that leveled the playing field was that I had Bella and Rihanna in my corner, truly there to help me. It wasn’t that a magazine could ask me to style them, they didn’t even have them to style. It was known, they were doing it to work with me. Paper had been actively trying to get Rih and they couldn’t. Having the pop star and model of our time endorse me definitely has given me so much. If it wasn’t for Rih or Bella, I’d probably still be posting Polyvore looks on Twitter. They have the world’s stage, not just fashion’s. I’m forever thankful that they’ve given me this platform. A post shared by flo$$. aka fucci (@karlie.floss) on Jan 17, 2017 at 8:14pm PST Now after directing and styling two magazine covers of your own what do you think about most fashion covers today? I think people need to take more risks. Stop making models look the same in every shoot. Transform these girls. Allow them to really model. Make them a character. Bella had so much fun becoming another person on set. I think people get so scared of being labeled a cultural appropriator but there are still so many ways to transform someone without offending. Fashion needs to get back to that. Bring theatrics back. Transformation. Even on the runway shows, why are they only just walking down the runway. Do something else, we need more, we want more. What would say to the dreamers facing obstacles that might feel permanent, the one’s who haven’t never interned, and are miles away from big cities? It might seem lame but look at me. I was from North Carolina, the most boring place. Don’t give up. That is it, believe in yourself. If it’s something you want to do, pursue it. You know your purpose, it’s that little thing you keep thinking about. Listen to that, follow your heart, it will all come true. It’s gonna be hard as fuck, but believe you can get out of any rut.

Steaks and burgers cooked inside on the stove just don’t taste the same. The problem is that I hate to clean the grill. All that baked-on goo hardly ever comes off without spending 20 minutes scraping. This is where the Grillbot comes in. It’s a small round robot that’s about the diameter of a gallon paint can, and can scoot about and clean every inch of your cooktop. Grillbot has an internal rechargeable battery and three replaceable brass bristled brushes on the underside. It’s much larger than I envisioned it being when I was first asked to check one out. If you have a really small grill, you may find Grillbot too large. I use one of those cheap charcoal grills from Walmart since I had to leave my good gas grill behind when it wouldn’t fit in the moving truck a few months back. It is a 22-inch grill and has one of those warming racks higher up under the lid. After I charged up the Grillbot, I went outside to see if it would clean the baked on goo out of my grill and it did a very good job. The first time I started it up, it did get caught under that warming rack as the Grillbot is a bit too thick to fit under the rack with the lid closed. However, you do have to clean the grill with the lid closed or the Grillbot will tumble out on the floor. Unlike when you do it by hand, you have to use Grillbot when your grill is cold, or you’ll melt the robot into oblivion. The Grillbot randomly ambles around under the closed lid of your grill cleaning away and when it hits the sides of the closed grill, it turns around and goes another way sort of like those bumper cars you played with as a child. It’s a noisy little beast, so do your neighbors a favor and don’t use this thing at midnight. It also makes the lid of the grill jump around like it’s about to explode. In fact, I used that noisy, ambling little bot to freak out my daughter by telling her that it sounded like an animal of some sort was on the patio and sending her to check it out. She thought a snake was trapped inside the grill. It was epic. You can choose three settings for the cleaning time on the bot, one press gives a 10-minute clean, two presses is 20-minutes, and three presses is a 30-minute clean. You get a five second delay to give you time to get it on the grill surface and close the lid. I tried a 20-minute clean on my dirty grill and it finished just as clean as if I had stood there with my normal brush scrubbing away. It’s not like you can’t tell when the cleaning is done based on the lack of noise and motion, but it does have an alarm that beeps as well. The big thing I liked about the Grillbot is that while it was scrubbing away at the grill, I was inside getting the steaks ready and came out to a grill ready for some heat. A basic Grillbot like mine will set you back $119.95(USD) which is well worth it. You will never have to clean your grill by hand again.

A small creek would rise fairly quickly, and will come down fairly quickly,” said Mark Fuchs of the National Weather Service in St. Louis. “Eventually, that water goes out to the larger river, which is the last thing to rise and the last thing to crest.” Aerial photos and video from the St. Louis region and other areas show the devastating impact of the flooding that has caused as many as a dozen deaths and shut down transportation in parts of the region. Brian Emfinger, a reporter for CNN affiliate KATV, took aerial images and video of flooding near Pocahontas, Arkansas, in the northeastern part of the state, where floodwaters overtopped a levee. Gov. Asa Hutchinson posted an aerial photo of a Walmart in Pocahontas surrounded by water, as well as the flooding that has impacted roads nearby. In the past week, flooding has caused seven deaths in Arkansas, including a 10-year-old who was climbing a fence to avoid the water and was swept away, according to the state’s Department of Emergency Management. Five people have died in Missouri due to or related to the flooding, officials said. St. Louis area flooding The flooding impacted more than 100 highways in the St. Louis region, according to Tom Blair, an official with the Missouri Department of Transportation. The Meramec River, which travels through suburbs of St. Louis, rose to a record 46.11 feet after weeks of heavy rainfall. In Fenton, Missouri, drone video shows submerged homes, with roofs peeking out. Three hours to the southwest, in Willow Springs, Zeb Cheek and his family lost almost everything. “We lost our car, our cat, and nearly everything else in the house. And we no longer have a home,” he said. “We managed to save my work computer, some clothes, our dog and a few photos.” Cheek and his wife rent their home, but he suspects the landlord will have to strip the house to its joists to salvage it. The area has seen minor flooding before but Cheek, an aerial photographer, says it’s never been like this. “My wife collected some clothes and our kids while I went to warn the neighbors to get out,” he told CNN. “In the time it took me to get back, roughly 10 minutes, the water had risen from my ankles to my waist. I was barely 100 feet from my front door and didn’t hear my wife calling for me at the top of her lungs.” Escaping the house, however, didn’t guarantee the family’s safety. “The waters were roaring … badly,” he said. “When we left, the water was coming into our van, and we were nearly trapped.” The Cheek family is staying at a home arranged by their church. Illinois is next Meanwhile, residents of central and southern Illinois prepped for their own coming floods as rain continued to fall. The Mississippi River that separates Missouri and Illinois is projected to reach 48.5 feet on Saturday near Cape Girardeau, just below its record high of 48.9 feet. Forecasters said the time to be worried about moderate to heavy rainfall in those states is between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., mainly in southern Illinois. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency enlisted inmate crews from the Department of Corrections to sandbag communities expecting rising floodwaters. In eastern Illinois, officials in Villa Grove said they had prepared boats for possible rescues and police were ready to block off streets in case of flooding, according to CNN affiliate WCIA. Traci Belshe, who lives in the community southeast of Champaign, told WCIA that previous flooding has caused more serious issues. “We’ve had people trapped in their homes, having to be boat rescued out while that gas leak is occurring,” Belshe said. “I myself have been trapped in this home three different times.” The man who was the subject of an iconic Ferguson photo has died 8 charged with involuntary manslaughter in Penn State hazing death Related Posts California’s death penalty process upheld by federal appeals court Fisherman finds baby miraculously alive in sunken car hours after wreck Rare humpback whale sighting dazzles Rhode Island Lamar Odom says ‘Hi’ to Khloe Kardashian, source says Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The Meramec River, which travels through suburbs of St. Louis, rose to a record 46.11 feet after weeks of heavy rainfall. In Fenton, Missouri, drone video shows submerged homes, with roofs peeking out. Three hours to the southwest, in Willow Springs, Zeb Cheek and his family lost almost everything. “We lost our car, our cat, and nearly everything else in the house. And we no longer have a home,” he said. “We managed to save my work computer, some clothes, our dog and a few photos.” Cheek and his wife rent their home, but he suspects the landlord will have to strip the house to its joists to salvage it. The area has seen minor flooding before but Cheek, an aerial photographer, says it’s never been like this. “My wife collected some clothes and our kids while I went to warn the neighbors to get out,” he told CNN. “In the time it took me to get back, roughly 10 minutes, the water had risen from my ankles to my waist. I was barely 100 feet from my front door and didn’t hear my wife calling for me at the top of her lungs.” Escaping the house, however, didn’t guarantee the family’s safety. “The waters were roaring … badly,” he said. “When we left, the water was coming into our van, and we were nearly trapped.” The Cheek family is staying at a home arranged by their church. Illinois is next Meanwhile, residents of central and southern Illinois prepped for their own coming floods as rain continued to fall. The Mississippi River that separates Missouri and Illinois is projected to reach 48.5 feet on Saturday near Cape Girardeau, just below its record high of 48.9 feet. Forecasters said the time to be worried about moderate to heavy rainfall in those states is between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., mainly in southern Illinois. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency enlisted inmate crews from the Department of Corrections to sandbag communities expecting rising floodwaters. In eastern Illinois, officials in Villa Grove said they had prepared boats for possible rescues and police were ready to block off streets in case of flooding, according to CNN affiliate WCIA. Traci Belshe, who lives in the community southeast of Champaign, told WCIA that previous flooding has caused more serious issues. “We’ve had people trapped in their homes, having to be boat rescued out while that gas leak is occurring,” Belshe said. “I myself have been trapped in this home three different times.” Flood waters from the Meramec river are receding.

(AMZN), Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) Are Solid Long-Term Buys View All Posts The modern day juggernauts of the technology space have been unstoppable recently, and that has many investing historians and purists worried. Source: Shutterstock Most investors are familiar with the tech and telecom crash that began in 2000 and totally collapsed in 2001. Ironically, many of the second-tier tech names driving the current sector rally were the key players back then as well. So are we setup to experience a similar crash? No. Let me tell you why. I’ll be the first to acknowledge the fact that market crashes are inevitable. They’re simply a part of investing. Picking a top is a fool’s errand, however, especially when you could ride the wave higher. A better comparison to the current tech rally is the run of the so-called Nifty 50 — a group of the 50 most popular large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s. These names, which included stocks like McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Xerox Corp (NYSE:XRX), Eastman Kodak Company Common New (NYSE:KODK), Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) and Polaroid, were considered buy-and-hold slam dunks, and were found in accounts earmarked for widows and orphans. The investment proposition was clear: these were giant, dominant companies without peers or competition. Before tripping into a two-year slump that began in 1973, the Nifty 50 changed hands at price-earnings ratios between 46 and 90. Today, those companies driving the market as a whole higher are Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) — and they’re what I like to call the technology juggernauts. These giant conglomerates have their tentacles in everything from consumer products to financial services to travel and more. And the key is that their only competition is with each other. The tech juggernauts aren’t really judged on their P/E ratios — although it is worth noting that they’re down significantly from the nosebleed levels of the crash. Instead, investors give the benefit of the doubt on things like barrier to entry, market share gains and massive revenue growth. Just consider Amazon’s first-quarter revenue growth through the years: 1997: $16 million 2007: $3 billion (+18,650%) 2017: $35.7 billion (+1,090%) Of course, these stocks have stumbled from their fair share of earnings misses, broad market corrections and periodic short raids, but here they stand living up to the hype and creating even more hype. Just as great empires come to an end, eventually, too, will the current tech run led by the four horsemen. But for now, if this is the new Nifty 50, I would say it’s not even 1970 yet.

They thought they found their man inside a Nissan. When they tried to serve a warrant, that's when things escalated. The case in Clarksville, Tennessee, is noteworthy for many reasons. The bounty hunters ended up shooting and killing an innocent man. And, more importantly, they broke the law when they did so. What happened It was sometime before 12:30 a.m. late last month when the bounty hunters came across the Nissan Altima in the parking lot of a Walmart. This is what happened next, according to police: The Altima pulled off the parking lot, almost hitting the men. The pursuers jumped in their cars and chased it, firing shots. The car finally pulled over. There were four men inside. One of them, Jalen Johnson, was dead. What happened next Bounty hunters aren't law enforcement agents and aren't protected by the same laws that cover other officials. They can legally fire only in cases of self-defense, Clarksville Police spokesman Tim Anderson told CNN. "Not sure why they fired on the car or the thought process," he said. The bounty hunters and the bail bondsmen are facing 16 charges, including murder. CNN's Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(2:35) Facebook Twitter Facebook Messenger Email comment 10:41 PM ET Darren RovellESPN Senior Writer Close ESPN.com's sports business reporter since 2012; previously at ESPN from 2000-06 Appears on SportsCenter, ESPN Radio, ESPN.com and with ABC News Formerly worked as analyst at CNBC Facebook Twitter Facebook Messenger Pinterest Email print comment A day after LaVar Ball's Big Baller Brand unveiled a line of shoes for his son Lonzo, Ball justified the premium price of them without giving specifics as to how many pairs have been sold on the company website. Much of social media was up in arms at the price of the main shoe, the ZO2, which retails for $495. When asked Friday about how he came up with the price point, LaVar said on ESPN Radio's The Dan Le Batard Show that he was the sole decision-maker. "I figure that's what the shoe is worth," LaVar said. "When you are your own owner you can come up with any price you want." LaVar also defended the $220 price of the sandals his company is selling with Lonzo's new logo on them. "Prada and Gucci is selling theirs for what they want," LaVar said. "Ours is better than that. It feels better." Editor's Picks Ball debuts shoe line; main pair to cost $495 Big Baller Brand rolled out Lonzo Ball's debut shoes on Thursday with the ZO2 ($495), the autographed ZO2 Wet ($995) and the ZO2 Signature Slides ($220). LaVar says he isn't, at this point, saying who makes his shoes and what it costs him to make them, nor is he revealing how many pairs of shoes have sold other than saying that sales are "going good" and that all the profits would be going to Lonzo. After the shoes went up for sale online at around 3:55 p.m. ET Thursday, LaVar, Lonzo and the Big Baller Brand trended nationally on Twitter. Former NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson showed proof he bought a pair, while Shaquille O'Neal, who has a signature shoe that sells for less than $60 at Walmart, scolded the Balls for charging so much. "Everybody ain't going out to buy no Rolls Royce," LaVar told Le Batard on Friday. "But they might get them a little car to get them from A to B. Just like Shaq was saying. Bring the shoes down for the kids to buy. How about, 'You already got that covered, so let them buy your shoe?'" In an interview with ESPN's Ramona Shelburne earlier this week, Lonzo Ball said he believed his shoe would sell and that he loved the fact that he was so involved in the making of his sneakers. "What kid, you know, that's 19 can make his own shoe the way he wants it?" Lonzo told Shelburne in an interview for ESPN The Magazine. "How he wants it to feel? So it's a dream come true for me, just because I love shoes, and just the process behind the whole thing is actually really cool." The Balls were turned down by the major shoe companies -- Nike, Adidas, Under Armour -- after LaVar insisted on doing a licensing deal for his Big Baller Brand instead of a standard endorsement deal. LaVar told The Dan Le Batard Show that the people at Under Armour were the most dismissive of his approach. "When I went to that meeting, they were looking at me crazy at the first take," LaVar said. As for his critics, who say he should have taken a traditional deal for Lonzo -- which he says would have been $2 million a year for five years -- he says the goal is to add a couple of more zeros. "All the other people on the outside is saying I'm costing them millions; you god dang right I'm costing them millions because it ain't about millions with us," LaVar said. "It's about them B's -- billions. "The people that are complaining are the ones who can't get the shoe and don't want the shoe and that's fine because there's a lot of people out here that want the shoe and can get the shoe." The shipping date on the shoes is Nov. 24. Facebook Twitter Facebook Messenger Email comment Sponsored Headlines Comments ABOUT COOKIES We use cookies to offer an improved online experience.

Like lots of preteen girls, I had a thing for horses, and the closest, cheapest, and easiest way for my parents to let me get my fix was to send me off for the weekend to a camp run by a local religious group. I was, in Christian horse camp parlance, “unchurched,” and the evening sermons, led by a Cool Guy youth pastor, were a new experience—especially the one focused on the evils of the Nike slogan, “Just Do It.” We should not, we were told in no uncertain terms, “just do it,” and it was the special job of girls to make sure that when we were with boys, no one “just did it.” I came home asking my parents for a promise ring, a silver band you wear on your wedding ring finger to symbolize a promise not to have sex that you trade out for a wedding ring from your husband. “Jill, you are twelve,” my mother said. “I think you’re a little young to be making this decision.” She told me, though, that it was my body and I could and should do what I wanted with it. So I got myself a little band and put it on the third finger of my left hand. In 1995, the year I bought myself that ring, I became one of 2.2 million adolescents across the United States to take a virginity pledge. According to a study conducted a decade later, nine in ten of those pledgers didn’t adhere to their promise. Studies also found that virginity pledges actually increased risky sexual behavior, such as not using birth control or condoms, and pledgers are as a result as many as eight times more likely than the general population to contract a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Virginity pledgers are also more likely than their nonpledging peers to engage in sex acts that they believe preserve their technical virginity but are often less pleasurable for women, such as fellatio and anal sex.

As I write this, abercrombie kids sells a fragrance to its prepubescent audience called Sparks Fly. Walmart sells girls’ tights that look like thigh-high stockings; according to the sales page, “These adorable faux thigh highs are sure to spice up any ordinary outfit.” The store also sells leopard-print girls’ panties branded Sweet n Sassy, an underwear set printed with the words “I [Heart] My #Selfie,” a child-sized coconut bra, and a training bra that reads “Sweets for you and me.” According to a 2012 study, when offered a choice between a sexy doll wearing a black miniskirt and bra top and a doll in jeans and a sweater, 68 percent of girls between the ages of six and nine said they wanted to look like the sexier doll. Another study of girls’ clothing sold at fifteen national retailers found that 31 percent included sexualizing features, such as emphasizing girls’ chests or backsides, or displaying sexualized writing. In ads and in pop culture, adult women are routinely made to look younger or invoke sexiness and childishness at the same time (Katy Perry performing in a schoolgirl uniform), while girls are adultified, dressed and made up to look older than they are (children’s beauty pageants have little girls in heavy makeup, large wigs, and fake teeth). In ads and in pop culture, adult women are routinely made to look younger or invoke sexiness and childishness at the same time, while girls are adultified, dressed and made up to look older than they are It’s not news that women and girls are objectified in media, advertising, and American culture. Women who mostly fit a very narrow beauty ideal appear in women’s and men’s magazines—often posing in ways that suggest sexual readiness. The many seemingly interchangeable sexy women surrounding male stars in music videos is common enough to be a misogynist cliché: the “video ho.” Women on film are routinely sexually desirable but also keep their mouths shut—just 30 percent of speaking roles in the seven hundred biggest movies went to women between 2007 and 2014, and not a single woman over the age of forty-five held a lead part. One 2008 Wesleyan study looked at 1,988 ads from fifty American magazines and found that women were presented as sex objects in half of them. The bombardment of hypersexualized images of women has serious cultural, social, and psychological impacts on women, girls, men, and boys. According to the American Psychological Association, self-objectification occurs when people “internalize an observer’s perspective on their physical selves and learn to treat themselves as objects to be looked at and evaluated for their appearance.” That’s now endemic among adolescent girls, who see images of women and girls in media and couple them with the judgment and negativity leveled at actually sexually active women. Of course girls and young women internalize the message that their job is to be aesthetically pleasing and sexually enticing without being sluts who have too much sex (what counts as “too much” is never defined). Girls and young women internalize the message that their job is to be aesthetically pleasing and sexually enticing without being sluts who have too much sex (what counts as “too much” is never defined) It’s the Paris Hilton ideal. Hilton was famous in part for her sex tape, in which she often looked bored during the actual sex but more animated and sexy-acting when she knew the camera was turned on her. At the height of her fame, she tellingly revealed in New York magazine, “My boyfriends always say I’m not sexual. Sexy, but not sexual.” While the “be sexy” message is a broader one coming largely from mass media, popular culture, and advertising, the “don’t be sexual” message is often more formalized, coming from parents, schools, religious institutions, and peer policing. At the same time girls in kindergarten are learning that their bodies exist at least in part for the aesthetic gratification of others, they’re also hearing that normal sexual curiosities are no-nos, inappropriate, or dirty. As girls hit puberty, this combination of sexualization and sexual shame gets worse. In late elementary school sex education classes, where those classes even exist, information about the penis and ejaculation is front and center. For girls, though, the education is about the inside parts that make and carry babies—ovaries, fallopian tubes, the uterus. In many diagrams of the female reproductive system, there’s no clitoris, and certainly in sex ed programs there’s almost never discussion of the female orgasm or the reason most people have sex, which is for pleasure. There’s usually no discussion about same-sex relationships or intercourse, let alone the existence of transgender people. And thanks to $1.7 billion spent since the 1980s on sex ed that tells students the only appropriate sexual choice is remaining abstinent until marriage, if you stepped into an American classroom any time in the past three decades, you might have heard a teacher read a script like this: “Girls need to be aware they may be able to tell when a kiss is leading to something else. The girl may need to put the brakes on first in order to help the boy.” “A guy who wants to respect girls is distracted by sexy clothes and remembers her for one thing. Is it fair that guys are turned on by their senses and women by their hearts?” Fewer than half of all states mandate the teaching of sexual education in public schools; thirty-three states require HIV/AIDS education. Yet thirty-seven states require that when sex ed is taught, abstinence until marriage be covered—and twenty-five of them say that abstinence must be stressed. As a result, more than 75 percent of high schools teach abstinence as the most effective method of preventing STIs and pregnancy, while just over a third teach how to correctly use a condom. This is the flip side of the hypersexualization coin. In both the demands that girls look sexy for male approval and that they refuse sex to control male desire, it’s male desire at the center, and girls’ feelings, desires, and priorities orbiting around it. Jill Filipovic is the author of The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness, from which this essay is adapted.

Catherine Hettinger has been watching from the sidelines as children and adults clamor to get their hands on the anxiety-reducing device she invented more than two decades ago, but had long stopped manufacturing. She’s also been watching as one large company after another produces a version of the toy, without needing to pay her anything since her patent expired earlier this year. Now, with interest in the spinners showing no sign of slowing, Hettinger is looking to get in on the action herself. She recently launched a new website, where she intends to sell her original circular version of her fidget spinner, which does not include the prongs seen on some of the most popular spinners sold on Amazon and at Walmart. To fund her efforts, which will include recreating the mold for her spinner, she’s mobilizing a network of fellow inventors and plans to do a Kickstarter campaign. She’s also looking to sell her Florida home. “I like the confirmation that I knew the product would work, and I knew people would use it,” Hettinger told MONEY. “It takes money to make money. To actually launch the product nationwide is often beyond the reach for the original inventor.” “The best thing is to actually have people buy your product,” she added. “Right now, I’m hopeful.” Hettinger invented the fidget spinner in the 1990s in an attempt to provide a product to children and adults that would help calm nerves and ease stress. She sold a couple thousand devices at fairs around Florida and broke even financially, though she wouldn’t divulge how much she made at the time. She also pitched the device to toy companies like Hasbro, but had no luck. “It’s a long shot,” she said of selling a product. Over the past few months, the toys have become so widespread that teachers across the U.S. are now banning them from their classrooms, saying they’re too distracting. But even though the fidget spinner could have been Hettinger’s big break, she doesn’t seem to mind the device’s sudden popularity. In fact, the product’s success has only confirmed her confidence in it. “Maybe if it was some kind of exploitative product - like a new style of cigarettes - and my only motivation was to make money, I’d have a different attitude,” Hettinger said. “But I am just thrilled.” This article was originally published on Money.com Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

Please enable Javascript to watch this video "For Mothers day I'm saying don't do the usual gifts of candy or flowers but instead do something a little bit more unique like pampering mom, bring the spa to her. And for this I love the spin spa spinning spa brushes. These are spa luxury that she can do in the comfort of her own home." "There are two devices, spin spa body or spin spa face. For the body it comes with five different brush attachments so she can do a lot of things from cleansing to exfoliating to massaging. While the spin spa facial product you can use to remove dirt oil and impurities from the face it's a spa experience that she can use on a daily basis. These are two excellent products, they're widely available. The body one is $19.99 the face one is $12.99 you can get them at Walmart, Bed Bath and Beyond, Ulta, Sally Beauty, CVS or Rite Aid." "Now the next one is more of an indulgent product that you would get for mom, something that she wouldn't normally purchase for herself and that's fragrance. For that I love the Vera Wang Embrace. This is part of their iconic collection, they're body mists. So you could buy one or you could buy them all and she could sort of layer them together and create a signature sent." "There are four fragrances, there's the rosebud and vanilla, green tea and pear blossom, periwinkles and iris, or marigold and gardenia. All beautiful scents $9.99 at Walmart stores, a great buy." "And lastly for a sort of special experience for mom I think we probably all love and that's breakfast in bed. Now this is Nature's Path organic granola it's delicious, it's healthy for mom the kids can easily use this to create breakfast in bed. They just have to rip off the top, open the resealable pouch, they can pour it over fruit or a yogurt and create sort of a yogurt parfait for mom. They can really be a part of the experience, like they're doing it for their mom themselves, it makes it more special." "Now the granola itself is organic, non GMO, gluten free, made with whole grains super foods it comes in three delicious flavors, coconut cashew, vanilla pumpkin seed, or blueberry and pecan. They're all rich in fiber, they're made with premium ingredients like chia seeds and coconut and dry blueberries. So three really different experiences but all will make mom feel special and loved." For more information about these great products you can go to spinspa.com, naturespath.com and walmart.com.

"The smaller rivers always recede sooner. A small creek would rise fairly quickly, and will come down fairly quickly," said Mark Fuchs of the National weather Service in St. Louis. "Eventually, that water goes out to the larger river, which is the last thing to rise and the last thing to crest." Aerial photos and video from the St. Louis region and other parts of the central US show the devastating impact of the flooding that has caused as many as a dozen deaths and shut down transportation in the area. Brian Emfinger, a reporter for CNN affiliate KATV, took aerial images and video of flooding near Pocahontas, Arkansas, in the northeastern part of the state, where floodwaters overtopped a levee. Gov. Asa Hutchinson posted an aerial photo of a Walmart in Pocahontas surrounded by water, as well as the flooding that has impacted roads nearby. In the past week, flooding has caused seven deaths in Arkansas, including a 10-year-old who was climbing a fence to avoid the water and was swept away, according to the state's Department of Emergency Management. Five people have died in Missouri due to or related to the flooding, officials said. St. Louis area flooding The flooding impacted more than 100 highways in the St. Louis region, according to Tom Blair, an official with the Missouri Department of Transportation. The Meramec River, which travels through suburbs of St. Louis, rose to a record 46.11 feet after weeks of heavy rainfall. In Fenton, Missouri, drone video shows homes and streets submerged in water, with roofs peeking out. Illinois is next Meanwhile, residents of central and southern Illinois prepped for their own coming floods as rain continued to fall. The Mississippi River that separates Missouri and Illinois is projected to reach 48.5 feet on Saturday near Cape Girardeau, just below its record high of 48.9 feet. Forecasters said the time to be worried about moderate to heavy rainfall in those states is between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., mainly in southern Illinois. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency enlisted inmate crews from the Department of Corrections to sandbag communities expecting rising floodwaters. In eastern Illinois, officials in Villa Grove said they had prepared boats for possible rescues and police were ready to block off streets in case of flooding, according to CNN affiliate WCIA. Traci Belshe, who lives in the community southeast of Champaign, told WCIA that previous flooding has caused more serious issues. "We've had people trapped in their homes, having to be boat rescued out while that gas leak is occurring," Belshe said. "I myself have been trapped in this home three different times."

Jalen Johnson, 24, was an innocent father-of-three who was mistakenly identified as a wanted felon who had jumped bail. A grand jury has brought a string of charges against the seven bail bondsmen and said they did not follow the correct procedure when trying to detain a fugitive. Just after midnight on April 23, Johnson and four friends were sitting in a Nissan sedan in a Walmart parking lot in Clarksville, Tennessee. The seven bounty hunters thought they were closing in on William Ellis, who was wanted on a number of court warrants. For some reason they began firing into the car. The driver sped off, with the bounty hunters in two cars in hot pursuit. © AP Photo/ Mark Lennihan Nowhere to Hide: IRS to Hire Bounty Hunters to Go After Tax Scofflaws They chased the innocent men for six miles before ramming their car and firing more bullets into the vehicle. Johnson, who was sitting in the back, was fatally wounded and the driver was also injured. Jeffrey Milan told The Leaf Chronicle newspaper: "They killed my cousin and tried to kill everybody in the car and all for nothing. They never had the right person. The person they wanted is still out there, still out on the streets." Clarksville Police spokesman Jim Knoll said: "After an exhaustive investigation, numerous man hours expended interviewing individuals, processing crime scenes, and sorting through statements and evidence, the information was presented to the grand jury for consideration." William Byles, 31, Kenneth Chiasson, 38, Antwon Keesee, 32, Jonathan Schnepp, 31, Roger West, 31, Prentice Williams, 34, and Joshua Young, 27, have all been charged with first degree murder. They have also been indicted by the grand jury on 15 other charges, including attempted murder and the aggravated kidnapping of Johnson's friends, Jaydon Hogan, Marquentas Gold and Tyrone McKeage. In Tennessee, bounty hunters can carry weapons but may use deadly force only in self-defense. None of the men in the car had been armed. Bond was set at US$300,000 for each man. But the dead man's uncle, Ronnie Milan, objected to them being offered bail. "He can't get out of the casket, so they shouldn't be able to get out on bond. He was 24 and healthy as a tree and now he's dead and gone," Milan said. There are 14,000 bail bondsmen in the US and thousands of bounty hunters. The most famous of them is Duane "Dog" Chapman, who had his own TV series "Dog: The Bounty Hunter." Chapman made international headlines in 2003, when he captured Max Factor cosmetics heir Andrew Luster, who had fled to Mexico and was convicted in absentia of drugging and raping several women. Last month it was reported that the IRS were planning on hiring bounty hunters. In most US states suspects are freed from custody on the posting of a bail bond, the cost of which depends on the severity of the offence and the risk of absconding. In most cases relatives put up collateral — cash or property — which can be forfeited if the person vanishes. Bonds are provided by a bail bondsman, who is effectively gambling on the defendant turning up at court. In the Quentin Tarantino movie Jackie Brown, Robert Forster plays bail bondsman Max Cherry, who takes a bond out on Pam Grier and ends up involved in a violent struggle with Samuel L. Jackson's character, Ordell Robbie. ​A premium is charged for each bond, which is where the bail bond firms make their profits. If the defendant goes missing the bondsman stands to lose his money, which is where the bounty hunter comes in. He, or she, is given the task of finding the miscreant and bringing them back. In 1998, Betty Caballero, a pregnant woman miscarried after being beaten by a bounty hunter who mistakenly targeted her while looking for a woman who had skipped bail, sued the bail bonds firm but lost. ...

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Video shows flooding overtaking town Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Video shows flooding overtaking town 00:46 Story highlights Extensive rainfall causes severe flooding in the St. Louis area Larger rivers have yet to crest, the National Weather Service says (CNN)Heavy rain pounded the Northeast on Friday afternoon, with streets in New York turned into flood zones and travel hindered across the region. Some of the city's mass transit was delayed, with entrances to Penn Station temporarily closed, and some motorists had to be rescued from stalled cars, CNN affiliate WABC reported. Video and photos showed pedestrians trudging across streets in water up to their shins. "Be safe and stay dry, NYC," the mayor's office tweeted. "There's a flood warning in effect until this afternoon at the earliest." The chance of rain is about 60% for Saturday, the National Weather Service said, with a tenth to a quarter inch of rain possible. #abc7ny #FloodAlert @LeeGoldbergABC7 West Side Highway disaster! ☔️🙁 pic.twitter.com/kjKnMUaXkQ— Sher41864 (@Sher41864) May 5, 2017 @Gothamist @ABC7NY flash flood on Westside Highway pic.twitter.com/44b06pHhqW— James Tang (@jtangmills) May 5, 2017 Read More Meanwhile, the Midwest dealt with an ongoing problem. Some rivers and streams were receding after days of rain caused widespread flooding in the central United States, but the region wasn't yet out of danger: forecasters said the Missouri and Mississippi rivers would crest Saturday in and around St. Louis. "The smaller rivers always recede sooner. A small creek would rise fairly quickly, and will come down fairly quickly," said Mark Fuchs of the National Weather Service in St. Louis. "Eventually, that water goes out to the larger river, which is the last thing to rise and the last thing to crest." This is the levee that was holding back the water. It was overtopped yesterday and sometime late yesterday or this morning part of the levee began to be washed away. #pocahontas #flooding #aerialphotography #arkansas A post shared by Brian Emfinger (@brianemfinger) on May 3, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT Aerial photos and video from the St. Louis region and other areas showed the devastating impact of the flooding that has caused as many as a dozen deaths and shut down transportation in parts of the region.

Asa Hutchinson (@AsaHutchinson) May 2, 2017 Five people have died in Missouri due to or related to the flooding, officials said. St. Louis area flooding The flooding impacted more than 100 highways in the St. Louis region, according to Tom Blair, an official with the Missouri Department of Transportation. A child walks in his flooded neighborhood Thursday in Arnold, Missouri. The Meramec River, which travels through suburbs of St. Louis, rose to a record 46.11 feet after weeks of heavy rainfall. Highway exit signs were submerged in floodwaters on Highway 141 on Thursday in Valley Park, Missouri. In Fenton, Missouri, drone video showed submerged homes with roofs peeking out. Three hours to the southwest, in Willow Springs, Zeb Cheek and his family lost almost everything. "We lost our car, our cat, and nearly everything else in the house. And we no longer have a home," he said. "We managed to save my work computer, some clothes, our dog and a few photos." Cheek and his wife rent their home, but he said he suspects the landlord will have to strip the house to its joists to salvage it. Zeb Cheek says he never expected floodwaters to rise so high or so fast. The area has seen minor flooding before but Cheek, an aerial photographer, said it's never been like this. "My wife collected some clothes and our kids while I went to warn the neighbors to get out," he told CNN. "In the time it took me to get back, roughly 10 minutes, the water had risen from my ankles to my waist. I was barely 100 feet from my front door and didn't hear my wife calling for me at the top of her lungs." Escaping the house, however, didn't guarantee the family's safety. "The waters were roaring ... badly," he said. "When we left, the water was coming into our van, and we were nearly trapped." The Cheek family is staying at a home provided by their church. Illinois is next Meanwhile, residents of central and southern Illinois prepped for their own coming floods as rain continued to fall. The Mississippi River that separates Missouri and Illinois was projected to reach 48.5 feet on Saturday near Cape Girardeau, just below its record high of 48.9 feet. Forecasters said the time to be worried about moderate to heavy rainfall in those states was between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., mainly in southern Illinois. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency enlisted inmate crews from the Department of Corrections to sandbag communities expecting rising floodwaters. In eastern Illinois, officials in Villa Grove said they had prepared boats for possible rescues and police were ready to block off streets in case of flooding, according to CNN affiliate WCIA. Traci Belshe, who lives in the community southeast of Champaign, told WCIA that previous flooding has caused more serious issues. "We've had people trapped in their homes, having to be boat rescued out while that gas leak is occurring," Belshe said. "I myself have been trapped in this home three different times." CNN's Samira Said, Janet DiGiacomo, Chuck Johnston, David Williams and Jeanne Bonner contributed to this report. Content by LendingTree Mortgage rates drop. Do you qualify for the lowest rates?

Whether you’re trying to find clients through your colleagues, on LinkedIn or a freelancer platform like Contently or Upwork, you should consider how to differentiate yourself from competing freelancers that offer similar services. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE Daniel DiPiazza, a serial entrepreneur, writer and owner of the popular blog Rich20Something, suggests understanding the different ways of developing your own USP or unique selling proposition. In DiPiazza’s new book, Rich20Something: Ditch Your Average Job, Start an Epic Business, and Score the Life You Want he shares how to create a freelance career for yourself based on his experience as well as the success of other leading entrepreneurs. Here are five examples of how to stand out as a freelancer according to DiPiazza: 1. Offer a lower price. One of the best ways to stand out in the beginning of your freelance career is by offering your services at a lower price initially to compete with more established contractors. As you’re able to build your client base, certainly raise your prices to equal the value you’re giving to customers. This is a short-term differentiator unless you’re like a Walmart that’s built on the foundation of affordable pricing. DiPiazza stresses that the quality of your work still needs to be very high. “That’s key, since most people expect that lower prices equate to lower-quality work,” said DiPiazza. “Blow their expectations out of the water and you’ll most certainly draw attention, recognition, and a steady stream of new business.” 2. Be more convenient. By saving a client time, being easier to work with, having a systematic and logical workflow in place or presenting another form of convenience to your client offerings will help you stand out significantly. Many freelancers offer their skillset to customers without packaging their services in a simple and easy to use way, missing out on an opportunity to make their products or services easy to access says DiPiazza. 3. Brand yourself. Providing better quality or a more appealing aesthetic can help your services stand out amongst potential clients. When your products or services are at a higher quality, your work speaks for itself. You’ll need to understand what other freelancers are currently offering and take your work to the next level. Not the top priority on day one of starting your business, but establishing a stronger aesthetic by building a branded website, creating credibility points like writing for an industry publication and more, can help showcase the level of quality your offerings provide. “The quality and attention to detail you put into your products and services are huge factors in a customer’s buying decision,” said DiPiazza. Don’t let the way you’re presenting your business to customers be the reason why they decide to work with someone else. 4. Variety gives clients options. There are certainly pros and cons to this approach, but often times providing a few related services gives customers flexibility in how they partner with you. For example, if you provide infographic design services, it’d certainly be helpful if you were skilled as a copywriter as well to impact your infographic offerings and present another useful skillset to companies. Consider what other related skill sets would make sense for your business and dedicate time to learning and gaining experience in this area. 5. Superior customer service or guarantee. Most companies don’t prioritize customer service in any shape or form, let alone on Twitter, Yelp or other online customer channels. “There’s a huge opportunity here for you to rise above and provide 1st-class service and a better overall experience,” suggests DiPiazza. Bonus: Walk the talk. I’m always blown away by the number of freelancers that don’t follow their own advice that they share with customers. I’ve seen web designers with awful websites, freelance writers who don’t write on their own blog and social media marketers who aren’t active on social media. You don’t need to be everywhere and do everything, but you’ll stand out to customers in your industry if you publicly act on the skills and advice you provide to clients. Taking action and showcasing your approach and experience is far more beneficial than simply talking about it over email or on your website.

Jalen Johnson, a 24-year-old father of three, was shot and killed at the scene in Clarksville, Tennessee, police said. Another man was injured. The altercation began on April 23, according to authorities, when Johnson and three other men were in a local Wal-Mart parking lot. According to a charging report obtained by PEOPLE, the bounty hunters thought that a certain fugitive was in the car. But, according to Clarksville police, the man they sought was not in the car, and none of the men in the vehicle had any warrants on file. Jonathan Schnepp William Byles The confrontation led to a car chase that ended in gunfire, authorities allege. The men inside the vehicle were unarmed. A grand jury met earlier this week and handed down charges against William Byles, 31; Kenneth Chiasson, 38; Roger West, 31; Jonathan Schnepp, 31; Prentice Williams, 34; Antwon Keesee, 32; and 27-year-old Joshua Young. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Click here to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter. The men have all been charged with a litany of offenses, PEOPLE confirms, including first-degree felony murder, three counts of attempted second-degree murder, three counts of aggravated kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, three counts of aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and employing firearms in commission of a dangerous felony. Antwon Keesee Roger West Prentice Williams MCSO The men are being held on $300,000 bond. They have not yet entered pleas, and it’s unclear if any of them have retained attorneys. Johnson’s family says that they are incensed at the killing and hope justice is served. “He can’t get out of the casket, so they shouldn’t be able to get out on bond,” Johnson’s uncle, Ronnie Milan, told the Leaf-Chronicle. As the case against the men continues, the Johnson family is mourning the loss of a man who they say never hurt anyone. “He was 24 and healthy as a tree,” Milan said, “and now he’s dead and gone.” Related Articles Amanda Knox fires back at Donald Trump, who was ‘very upset’ she supported Clinton Demi Lovato to Star in YouTube Documentary ‘I Am: Demi Lovato’ Baylor University frat suspended for hosting racist ‘Mexican-themed’ party More On: People magazine Jalen Johnson Share this Article Join the Conversation Herald Columnists Joyce Ferriabough Bolling Bolling: Adam Jones incident becomes a teaching moment for Boston Jessica Heslam Heslam: Sex trade raids free 10 victims Lindsay Kalter Kalter: Bay State facing premium problems Joe Battenfeld Battenfeld: Gov.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Apple’s cash pile of $250 billion fuels expectations April 30, 2017 by yalibnan 2 Comments In its quarterly results on Tuesday, Apple Inc. likely will report that its cash hoard has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled milestone for a private corporation that raises a question: Why would any company want to hold that much money? Apple has added to its pile at a blistering pace, doubling it in just over four-and-a-half years. In the last three months of 2016 it wracked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. Its current total, not accounting for debt, exceeds the market values of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and that of Procter & Gamble Co., and outstrips the foreign-currency reserves of the U.K. and Canada combined. The stash has drawn fresh attention recently as President Donald Trump tries to revamp the U.S. tax regime. Apple, like many big companies, keeps most of its cash offshore — some 93% of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities as of December — to avoid U.S. corporate taxes that executives consider too high. The Trump administration this week proposed a one-time tax holiday to encourage companies to bring that cash home, and said it wants to slash the U.S. corporate-income-tax rate to 15% from 35% and largely exempt future foreign profits. That could make it easier for Apple to put its money to use, through acquisitions or by doling out more to shareholders. The latter prospect has propelled Apple’s stock to record highs. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enable it, and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans. One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefitting investors including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January. Wall Street analysts tend to focus more on companies’ net cash position than the headline number. Apple has racked up some $88 billion in debt to fund payouts to shareholders. But even subtracting that, Apple would be left with more cash than the total stockpile of Microsoft, the next richest tech company, which boasts $126 billion in cash, not accounting for debt. With the exception of financial companies, Apple’s stash exceeds that of any other U.S. company in recent history, said Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “I have never seen a company in this kind of extreme position, barring a winding-down,” she said. “Apple’s a cash box right now.” Former executives say Apple’s thrift has deep roots, inspired in part by a brush with bankruptcy in the late 1990s. That forced Chief Executive Steve Jobs to arrange a cash infusion from Microsoft Corp. and set his resolve to keep reserves for future emergencies. Mr. Jobs also believed Apple could better boost its stock price by using its money to develop new products than through buybacks or dividends. His biggest product, the iPhone, has only supercharged the cash machine. Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the devices in the decade since it was introduced, and today claims 91% of all the profits in the smartphone sector. Mr. Cook has been somewhat more accommodating of shareholder desires than his predecessor. He started a dividend-and-stock-buyback program in 2012 that has since sent more than $200 billion to shareholders. And he has invested more in some areas, such as R&D. But the CEO also stared down Carl Icahn in 2013 and 2014 when the activist investor bought a stake in Apple and demanded it increase buybacks. And Apple remains frugal in other realms, such as marketing. It spent less than $1.8 billion on advertising last year — not even half the amounts laid out by smaller rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., according to company filings. Apple also avoids large acquisitions. It bought at a rate of 15 to 20 companies a year over the past four years, generally spending several hundred million dollars on companies it can easily assimilate. Its biggest deal was the $3 billion it spent to buy Beats Electronics LLC in 2014. The swelling war chest has fueled hopes for bigger deals to vault Apple in new directions such as self-driving cars and entertainment. At Apple’s 2015 shareholder meeting, one investor asked Mr. Cook about buying Tesla Inc., which today is valued around $51 billion. The CEO didn’t directly respond. Robert Nichols of Windward Capital Management Co., an Apple shareholder, says it should buy Netflix Inc., valued around $65 billion, to jumpstart its video-streaming business and bolster its position against Amazon. “You can either build [content and distribution] or you can buy it,” and buying would help Apple gain ground where it is behind, he said. With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S. Either way, there is a growing sense that Apple’s cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. “If this a rainy day fund, they’re saving for a millennial flood,” said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.   FOX Filed Under: Business News vs Facebook tries to fix violent video problem with 3,000 new workers http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-crime-idUSKBN17Z1N4 elie meanwhile chinese are working under shitty conditions in apple factories.

They'll be sold mostly on the Parkway Apr 24 More from Suzette Parmley Arrow icon On April 21, struggling women’s apparel chain Bebe said it was closing all 180 stores – the latest casualty amid a steady stream of defaults, bankruptcies, and closures over the last year. While experts say more closures are coming, something else is occurring: The losses of traditional retail jobs are being absorbed by the likes of Amazon, with its new fulfillment centers and warehouses. States such as New Jersey are showing retail job growth, while Pennsylvania has stayed relatively flat despite the swoon in traditional retail. Of course, neither state is keeping up with the national rise in retail jobs.  But shopping is taking a new form, experts say, thanks to the internet. Michael Niemira, principal of the Retail Economist LLC, likened online shopping to the catalog sales of the early 20th century that supplied goods to consumers in areas where stores did not exist.  “Today, some communities are losing stores that are not profitable, and the online distribution is filling the gap as catalog sales once did,” he said.  The survivors will "stay alert to demographic and shopping trends" with fewer stores. It’s why Target Corp. is going with smaller format stores while investing $7 billion in new IT over the next three years. And it's why megastore Walmart went on a shopping spree, starting last year, to buy online firms, such as jet.com, to offset its weaknesses. Its latest target, reports suggest, is online men’s fashion retailer Bonobos. Digitally native brands, such as Away, Bonobos, and Warby Parker, are creating a new kind of retail store, suggested David Bell, a marketing professor at the Wharton School. It's a “zero inventory, high-experience store" in which customers enter an amazing space, get a  brand experience, and buy items that are shipped to them. Information gathering and fulfillment used to occur under one roof, creating the need for large stores to hold all that inventory, Bell said.  But that model is fading. "Retail of the future will look more like a Tesla showroom than an old-school dealer lot, with 1,000 cars -- except the one that you want -- sitting out in the rain,” Bell said. The powerhouse King of Prussia Mall is expected to fare much better in the new world than its competitors on the lower end.   Still, David Simon, CEO of KOP's owner, Simon Property Group, stressed the need for change. "I’m hopeful that retailers will focus on improving their in-store experience, and that could be a lot of different ways,” Simon told analysts two weeks ago. “That could be through technology, that could be through a better look and feel.” Richard Hayne, CEO of homegrown Urban Outfitters Inc.,  said the U.S. overbuilt retail space in much the way it did in housing.    Retail added too much space in the 1990s and early 2000s, creating "a bubble, and like housing, that bubble has now burst," he said in a March 2017 earnings call. "We are seeing the results; doors are shuttering and rents retreating.” Retail bankruptcies over the last 12 months are near recession levels, said RBC Capital Markets retail analyst Brian Tunick. These include BCBG, Payless, PacSun, and department store closures (45 Macy’s, 140 JC Penneys and 150 Kmart/Sears stores in fiscal 2017). Yet there are hopeful pockets. Growing are value-oriented chains such as Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Ross, and TJX, owner of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, as well as beauty retailer Ulta. Non-store retailers, which include online shopping, showed significant growth over the last five years in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. These retailers, such as Amazon, run establishments classified as distribution centers, and can augment their workforce with employees from temporary help agencies.  Amazon employs more than 7,500 full-time workers in New Jersey in seven fulfillment centers. In Pennsylvania, the majority of warehouse jobs are in the Lehigh Valley to staff new facilities, according to commercial real estate firm CBRE Inc. Total warehouse jobs have spiked 38 percent over the last five years, reaching 75,354 last year, state records show. The Philly region is perfect for distribution centers serving the East Coast, noted Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics Inc. Fulfillment jobs are helping offset store job losses, he said, "but will not be enough to make up for broader losses in the industry,” as chains keep cutting stores and employees (Target, Kohl’s) and robotics are introduced. Perkins said retailers will need to step up their online game to compete with Amazon's coming one-hour delivery and its potent two-day Prime delivery (for paying members). “Many chains are still taking four to seven days on delivery, which is way too long,” Perkins said. Amid the retail carnage, trendy eyewear company Warby Parker, which began online, has been adding stores aggressively. It now has 50 stores, including one in Center City that opened in January. The company said it will open 25 stores this year. Mark Petrie, 50, of Lake George, N.Y., is a longtime Warby customer who knew what he wanted when he stepped into the Center City store Thursday:  big, chunky glasses with black frames.  He said he had "been online a million times but it's hard to try glasses on online."  "That's why having this store is so great,"  said Petrie, a real estate agent. "We don't have one in Lake George." Petrie, who is relocating to Center City with his husband, moved around the store at 1523 Walnut St., trying on pairs before a full-length mirror. The store sits in the former space of Le Bec-Fin restaurant, two doors from a Bonobos, which opened last fall. "I like instant, total gratification," he said.  And he got it. A pair of $95 Nash glasses with dark, tortoiseshell frames. Then there's Rosemarie Monzo Mazzeo, 46, a physician who lives on the Main Line. She has bought more items online with Lilly Pulitzer over the last five years, especially on clothes she thinks will sell out. For other stuff, she visits the retailer at King of Prussia Mall and Suburban Square. The high-end women’s clothier is adding four to six stores a year, including one opening at the Jersey Shore this month, and is investing heavily on its website. Fourth quarter sales – which included a  significant increase in online sales – went up 26 percent in fiscal year 2016 over the previous year. “It’s like being in an adult candy store with all the beautiful colors and textures,” Mazzeo said of each visit. “It’s a fun experience and it’s become a bonding experience between me and my daughter.” Read more by Suzette Parmley Published: May 5, 2017 — 3:01 AM EDT Thanks for your continued support...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman How To Profit From ‘Crisis Investing’ Shutterstock photo When trouble strikes, you can often find excellent investing opportunities… Just think back to the financial crisis in 2008-2009 and all the bargains that materialized — even outside of the stock market. Granted, hindsight is always 20/20, but even the best companies in the world were trading at historically cheap discounts. Today — over eight years into a bull market — it’s becoming tougher and tougher to find great companies trading at discounted prices. There’s a glut of stocks whose fundamentals simply don’t support their sky-high valuations. And despite new record highs in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, there are plenty of reasons for concern: the S&P 500’s lofty P/E ratio and an outrageously high debt-to-GDP ratio, just to name a couple. Of course I don’t know when the next crisis is going to hit (but you can be sure my subscribers and I over at Top Stock Advisor will have some dry powder on hand to pick up what should be some lucrative investing opportunities). But that doesn’t mean we can’t currently find deals in what I like to call „crisis investing.” You see, companies often experience their own crises — scandals or other public relations disasters that prompt investors to dump shares, sending prices plummeting. Sometimes shares stay down for good reason, but other times shares only stay depressed because investors simply neglect the companies after leaving them for dead. But if you can find a company that’s had its own internal, temporary crisis that’s caused its stock to tumble — providing you the opportunity to swoop in and pick up shares at bargain prices — then you could make a fortune. The Time To Buy Is When There’s Blood In The Streets Sometimes that window of opportunity is slim. Take Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), for example. In 2012 shares of the retail behemoth suffered a small blow when news came out that it was involved in a massive bribery scandal. Shares tumbled roughly 9% in only three days. Investors quickly realized that they overreacted and piled back in… but those that bought when others were fearful were rewarded for their contrarian view: We’ve also witnessed how this sort of „crisis investing” can pay dividends with a company like American Express (NYSE: AXP ). You may recall that American Express has actually survived a number of scandals throughout its history. The most prominent is probably the Salad Oil Swindle of 1963. (If you’re not familiar, look it up. I promise it’s a real thing.) After the stock price had collapsed from the scandal, Warren Buffett stepped in and took a 5% stake in the company, on which he made a cool $20 million profit. (Then later regretted selling and bought more shares.) When I first recommended shares of American Express in my premium newsletter, Top Stock Advisor , the company wasn’t going through a scandal per se, but many investors considered it a crisis. American Express had lost its co-branding partnership with Costco (Nasdaq: COST ). Investors fled the scene, essentially leaving American Express for dead. The stock tumbled 45%. We stepped in and picked up shares for only about seven times its cash earnings, a valuation the stock hadn’t seen since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. Since September, when we added this exceptional business with a great brand at a discounted price (due to the Costco crisis) we’ve been rewarded with a nice 23% return, more than double what the S&P has offered over that same period. There are numerous stories like Wal-Mart and American Express, where share prices were negatively affected by their own internal crises. However, not all have made the strong recoveries and proven to be lucrative investments like the ones above. The key to finding winners in this space is really pretty simple. It’s the same concept that we employ at Top Stock Advisor when looking for stocks to add: buy great companies at great prices and hold on to them for the long haul. Just think back to the 1987 savings and loan crisis, when the Dow dropped 22% in a single day… think you could have picked up some good deals then? Or how about the bear market of 1973-1974, when the market lost 45% in roughly 22 months — allowing Warren Buffett to purchase a stake in the Washington Post Company (NYSE: WPO ), an investment that earned 100-times what he paid. It’s for this reason that Buffett says „Be greedy when others are fearful…” In fact, that’s exactly what my Top Stock Advisor subscribers and I did with our latest pick. It’s a company that’s suffered its own setback that sent shares plummeting. But like many of the crises we’ve talked about, it is only temporary, and more important, it’s a fixable problem. Keep this in mind when looking for „crisis” investments. By being „greedy” when others are „fearful,” you’ll be able to take advantage of these situations and be one step ahead of the crowd.

Apple’s cash pile has swelled to $250bn, a sum bigger than the market value of Wal-Mart or Procter & Gamble. It also eclipses the foreign currency reserves of Britain and Canada combined. Apple’s lucrative products help explain why the cash pile has burgeoned; so does the group’s historic tendency to avoid big acquisitions as well as dividends or buybacks. Ninety per cent of the money is held overseas to avoid high US corporate taxes. Viewpoint “French productivity, measured by GDP per hour worked, is higher than in Britain to an almost embarrassing extent. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics this month showed that productivity in France is 29.4% higher… I have always argued that this is because Britain is a higher-employment, lower-investment economy than France, where restrictive labour laws discourage employment and, where it is an alternative, encourage firms to invest. While a machine gets on with it, a French worker responds with a Gallic shrug. But that French worker has significantly more capital equipment than their British equivalent.” David Smith, The Sunday Times More from MoneyWeek KIDS' PORTFOLIO Investing for your children's long-term future is an excellent idea.

Picture: Instagram Fox News Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend LOSING weight is difficult, and after you’ve put on extra kilos, your body will never be the same. But that doesn’t mean you don’t earn bragging rights for lowering that number on the scale. Take it from Jessica Weber, a 23-year-old from Illinois, USA, who weighed 173 kilos at her heaviest, but has dropped 90 kilos in 15 months after overhauling her diet. A post shared by Jessica Weber (@jessica_vsg44) on Apr 18, 2017 at 9:24am PDT PEOPLE reported that Weber, a Walmart associate, has been documenting her weight loss on Instagram to help others on the same journey stay positive. “I wanted to be open about it on Instagram because I wanted people to realise what obesity does,” Weber told the magazine. “That they can make changes, but they’ll also face problems with loose skin in all areas. I want people to not be scared, or feel hidden of what they accomplished after weight loss.” Weber went on to explain that she set out to lose weight after a heart-wrenching talk with her mother. “My mum actually started crying, and told me she thought I’d die before her,” she told the website. “It just hit me hard, and I knew I had to start losing weight. It became my motivation.” Weber transformed her body by following a low-carb, high-fat diet, but she has to remind herself daily of her mission. “So many people don’t understand that it’s a mental battle more than physical,” she told PEOPLE. A post shared by Jessica Weber (@jessica_vsg44) on Mar 21, 2017 at 3:13pm PDT Posting the first image of her slimmer body with excess skin also wasn’t easy, but, she told the website, her courageous move has paid off. “I was extremely nervous. I almost didn’t share [the photo] because I thought it would get so much hate,” she told PEOPLE. “I’m glad I did because I was overwhelmed with kindness and love.” Here she is at ages 21, 22 and 23: A post shared by Jessica Weber (@jessica_vsg44) on Feb 14, 2017 at 2:43pm PST In time, Weber hopes to undergo a tummy tuck to get rid of the excess skin that has resulted from her dramatic weight loss. But for now, she continues to rack up likes on her Instagram photos. A post shared by Jessica Weber (@jessica_vsg44) on Mar 2, 2017 at 12:04pm PST One of her most popular posts from about two weeks ago has garnered 26,500 likes and counting. In the caption, Weber declares, “I will not hate my body anymore!” This article originally appeared on Fox News.

LOUIS (AP) - A man has died after his vehicle was swept off a road near a flooded creek in Missouri, marking the 10th death blamed on flooding in the Midwest, authorities said Friday. The Missouri State Highway Patrol said the 69-year-old man was trying to cross a flooded road across Dry Fork Creek when his car was swept away Thursday night. His body was recovered several hours later. Heavy downpours that started last weekend have caused waterways to surge in Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois and other states. Six deaths are now blamed on flooding in Missouri, while four occurred in Arkansas. Geese swim through floodwater from the Meramec River on Electra Drive in Arnold, Mo., on Thursday, May 4, 2017. The floodwater has slowly started to recede. Heavy rain last weekend created a flooding mess in Missouri, Arkansas and neighboring states, and several inches of mid-week rain have helped keep the water high. (David Carson/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) Many rivers are subsiding and some evacuated residents are being allowed to return home, though the Mississippi River is still rising in some areas. The surging waters prompted the U.S. Coast Guard to close a 77-mile (124-kilometer) stretch of the river in southern Illinois from Chester to Cairo late Thursday. About 14.5 miles (23 kilometers) were closed earlier this week in St. Louis. The closures mean barges carrying agricultural goods and other products have been sidelined. It's unclear when the spans will reopen, though crests are expected along the river this weekend in communities south of St. Louis. But there was encouraging news in an evacuated eastern Missouri town on Friday, where local officials were confident the area would stay dry even as more sandbags were piled on top of levees. West Alton's 500 residents live near the confluence of the Missouri and the Mississippi rivers - the nation's two largest rivers - about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of St. Louis. Both rivers were at major flood stage and water was seeping over levees at West Alton, but emergency manager Gary Machens was confident the levees would hold. "We're not going to lose it," Machens said, though he acknowledged it was touch and go. "When you get water running over the levee, it's pretty serious." Elsewhere in eastern Missouri, residents of a levee-protected part of Valley Park began returning home Friday. They were evacuated Monday amid concerns the levee might not hold, but the area stayed dry.

Also staying at the shelter are Zach Thellman, 22, and Kayla Anton, 25. All three were forced to leave their homes because of rising floodwater and they all spent the night at the shelter on Wednesday night as well. (David Carson/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) Tammy Neeley and her husband Jonathan moved all of their belongings from their garage into their home and stayed through the flood in downtown Pacific on Thursday, May 4, 2017. The Neeley's lifted their home 9 feet with the help of a grant in 2008 after a previous flood. Pacific officials estimate 170 homes and businesses were flooded. (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) The town of West Alton, Mo.,, which lies between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, is under an evacuation order Thursday, May 4, 2017, due to concerns that the Missouri River levee may be topped. Someone who apparently evacuated their home in the 1100 block of Salle Road Thursday May 4, 2017, just outside of town, had a sense of humor, placing a life jacket on their ornamental front yard goose.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Site Archive Foreman makes bid for 8th term on Hornell Common Council Thursday May 4, 2017 at 11:12 PM May 4, 2017 at 11:12 PM By Jason JordanThe Evening Tribune HORNELL — A member of the Hornell Common Council hopes to extend his long-time legacy of service, announcing a bid for an eight term as alderman.  Joseph Foreman has represented the city's 5th Ward for 28 years, making him the longest serving member of the council. The ward encompasses an area wedged between the Canisteo River and Hakes Avenue east to west, and includes part of Genesee Street, Pearl Street, Platt Street, Sawyer Street and others.  Foreman is a retired college professor, who now teaches courses online. On the council, he heads up the Finance Committee, the Planning and Development Committee, and is a member of the Youth and Recreation Committee. "There's a lot of projects coming down the road between the Common Council and on the IDA board that I've had a lot of input and contact with and I really want to see those projects come to fruition and see them through to the end," he said. In his time in city government, Foreman is most proud of being part of the effort to establish one of the city's biggest economic drivers.  "I'm very proud of the Walmart/Wegmans project coming to fruition years ago and the Lowe's project," he said. Foreman sees similar economic progress coming down the line in the future, and wants to be a part fostering an atmosphere that can help make similar projects a reality.  "Keeping taxes in check, which I think over the years we've done an outstanding job with. Our taxes are extremely low. As far as yearly increases, we haven't had any property tax increase for several years, continuing good service to the citizens of Hornell," he said, outlining several priorities. Foreman believes the city is on the right track for growth in the future, hoping to stay the course. "There's nothing obviously wrong with the way things are working," he said. In the 5th Ward however, Foreman hopes to make progress in addressing abandoned and unoccupied homes.  "We have absentee landlords, dilapidated buildings and houses in the neighborhood that need to be addressed," he said. Hornell's leadership has been key in forming a Land Bank for Steuben County, a fund that supports the redevelopment of abandoned properties, something Foreman says he's an advocate for. The city's Codes Office has also ramped up enforcement effort with landlords and banks owning property. "It can be frustrating, because a lot of these properties are owned by banks that are hard to get to cooperate and bring these houses up to code, Foreman recognized. "That's our main concern." Foreman plans to run a restrained campaign in the coming months as he seeks the Democratic party line, instead relying on his long history of service.  "I'm going to continue doing what I do as far as being an Alderman and helping everyone that I can within my ward. It' won't be a door to door campaign because everyone knows me from the past 28 years and knows how to get a hold of me, so I'll keep it low-key," he said.  This year, state and local primary elections will be held on Sept. 12 if necessary, and the General election will take place on Nov. 7.

Tiffany Craig, KHOU 8:06 PM. CDT May 04, 2017 Are you tired of spending time at the grocery store? There's a shopping trend that might be right for you. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST HOUSTON – Are you tired of spending time at the grocery store? There's a shopping trend that might be right for you. You order online and pick it up curbside. Some call it the future of food shopping. "It's convenient for us that's why we do it," shopper Laura Smith said. Vanessa Haines will tell you the same thing. She's a mother of four and works full-time. "I'm home in 30 minutes," said Vanessa. "I can't do that normally." Some of your favorite stores have a growing number of locations offering the service. H-E-B has Curbside. Walmart has Grocery Pickup and Kroger has ClickList. Jason Payne is with Kroger. "Customers absolutely love it," he said. The service appeals to parents, older folks and anyone with a disability. It also attracts shoppers who tend to overspend. "We hear from customers all the time that it's a money saving thing for them," explained Payne. "It keeps them from impulse buying." Kroger and H-E-B offer the first few uses for free and then the charge for a personal shopper is $4.95. "$5 is absolutely nothing compared to what I actually end up saving because I'm not buying random things by walking through the store," admitted Vanessa Haines. Walmart offers the service for free with a minimum purchase of $30. Even picky produce shoppers are in luck! You can describe how you want your fruits and vegetables. The only complaint we've heard is an occasional expiration date issue. "We're expecting a 3-5 day shelf life on these items and not for something to go out of date tomorrow," said Laura Smith. About 90 percent of what's in store is available online and the prices are similar. © 2017 KHOU-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Hundreds of birds die after flying into Galveston skyscraper Online criticism of 'Miss Black University of Texas' pageant Alleged drunken driver crashes into HPD officer SWAT standoff ends with officers shooting, killing armed woman Warrant issued for suspect in teen's fatal shooting during Subway robbery Bill would eliminate vehicle safety checks Weekend traffic alert: I-45 Gulf Freeway shut down Houston Uber driver: Cabbie hostility is out of control Verify: Is rape considered a pre-existing condition under new health care bill?

(WAVY) — One of the good Samaritans who helped Portsmouth officers arrest a resistant burglary suspect has been identified as a Coast Guard member. Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Roger Brown was walking toward the exit of the Wal-Mart at 1098 Frederick Boulevard around 8:15 p.m. on April 27 with his car keys in one hand and a single bag in the other. The plastic bag contained frozen fruit that he planned to make a breakfast smoothie out of the next morning before he went to work at the Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center on Base Portsmouth. Before the automatic doors slid all the way open, Brown said he heard sounds of a scuffle and a voice yelling, “Get down, get down!” Outside, two police officers were wrestling with a man who had managed to pin on of the officers to the ground. Police said the suspect was punching the officer in the face. “It took me a second or two to realize what was happening,” said Brown. “Then I kicked off my flip-flops, threw my keys and my groceries down, and took action.” One of the officers was working part-time at the store that night when he recognized 32-year-old Clinton Pickens, who matched the description of a suspect wanted for burglarizing five local businesses between April 19 and 25. Gallery: Portsmouth police search for serial burglar The officer talked to Pickens until a second officer arrived to help taken Pickens into custody. “As soon as the second officer got there, the suspect became violent and started assaulting the first officer,” said Detective Misty Holley of Portsmouth police. “He became extremely aggressive.” Brown jumped right in and pulled Pickens off of the officer and then helping the police get the suspect on the ground. Clinton T. Pickens (Photo: Portsmouth police) Another good Samaritan rushed over to assist Brown and the officers. Brown said the man restrained the suspect’s legs while the officers put him in handcuffs. “It all happened quickly, and I didn’t catch his name,” said Brown. “But he was a great help.” Detective Holley says Brown and the good Samaritan were key in resolving the situation. “The officer sustained minor facial injuries and bruising,” Holley said. “If Petty Officer Brown and the other good Samaritan hadn’t reacted so quickly, it could have ended up much worse.” Brown, who has served in the Coast Guard since 2003, said he originally joined looking for a change and a way to find direction in his life. While he now works as an electronics technician and provides technical support for Coast Guard cutter navigation systems, Brown previously served as a boarding team member aboard the 210-foot Cutter Resolute out of St. Petersburg, Florida. During his tour aboard the Resolute, Brown was part of law enforcement missions as a boarding team member. He went through countless hours of tactical training, which he said came in handy during the struggle with Pickens. Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Roger Brown with his wife, Jennifer, and daughters, Bella and Sophie. (Photo via U.S. Coast Guard) “It’s been a while since I’ve used those techniques,” he said. “But you never forget them.” But Brown said you don’t need tactical training to help police officers or others who are in trouble, you just need to act quickly and do what you can. “You’ve got to look out for your local law enforcement members,” said Brown. “You never know when you’re going to need their assistance in return. It all comes back around full circle.” Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Ager Mohsin Hasan has been on the run since Friday after his girlfriend, Melinda Vasilije, was found stabbed to death in her apartment in Kitchener, Ontario. The couple were believed to have been in an on-again, off-again relationship, but the victims’ family says the pair recently split. On Tuesday, three days after Ms Vasilije’s death, an apparent confession was posted on social media. The note, which included details about how events unfolded, was seen by news.com.au but has since been deleted. It also included a number of photographs of the pair posted earlier to Snapchat and a text message exchange attributed to the couple. Police have confirmed they are investigating the post and it could be used as evidence. Meanwhile, the 24-year-old is still on the run. It’s believed he fled across the border to the United States, where a person matching his description was seen outside a Walmart in Pennsylvania in the hours after his girlfriend’s body was found. Police have urged him to turn himself in. Waterloo Police issued a statement to reporters on Tuesday. “At this point we believe that Ager Hasan is responsible for the death of Melinda Vasilijie and as such there is a Canada-wide warrant issued for his arrest on one count of second-degree murder,” an officer said. “Our major crime unit is dedicated to investigating this incident … we are continuing to liaise with our US counterparts to locate Hasan. “The families involved in this investigation have been very co-operative. “Right now our investigators are attempting to locate as much information as we can as to the whereabouts of Mr. Hasan. The information we have right now is that he is somewhere inside the United States.” In a statement to media, police said the post was being evaluated by investigators. “Information like this is potential evidence and, as such, needs to be authenticated and verified,” Waterloo Regional Police spokesman Michael Haffner said. “We don’t want to jeopardize that process and cannot comment any further on evidence. “We would continue to encourage Mr. Hasan to turn himself into U.S. authorities.” The 24-year-old’s brother, Jag Jamil, told local news station CTV Kitchener that he believes the post confessing to Ms Vasilije’s murder was made by the man police are pursuing while he has been on the run. But he said he did not believe his brother was guilty of murder. “I don’t believe he did that at all but I believe if he did that, it was in self-defense (because) I cannot see my brother doing that or intentionally doing that to anybody,” Jamil told the network. “He’s scared — he feels awful for what happened, he feels awful for Melinda’s family,” he said. More On: murders The rise of the social media killers Runaway teen charged in fatal shooting of gas station attendant These popular vacation spots are death traps for Americans Scientists to identify Nazi victims using brain samples Jamil said he had not spoken to his brother since he had been on the run but that the relationship between he and Vasilije was “loving”, despite their recent split and police having been called to the young woman’s apartment earlier in April to attend a domestic dispute. Investigators told media that three hours after Vasilije’s body was found, Hasan crossed the Peace Bridge from Ontario to New York State in a black Honda HR-V. About an hour later, a man matching his description was seen affixing stolen US license plates to the vehicle in the car park of a Walmart in Pennsylvania. In a GoFundMe account established to raise money for Vasilije’s funeral costs, friend Tia Wojteczko said the 22-year-old as a “beautiful woman.” “Melinda … didn’t deserve any of this. We want to remember her for all she was, she was kind, gentle, pure and sweet,” Ms Wojteczko said. “For all who knew her she had such an uplifting personality and made everyone around her happy. We will never forget her, her memory lives through all of us. “Rest in the sweetest peace Melinda Vasilije.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under canada ,  manhunts ,  murders ,  new york ,  social media ,  stabbings Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Trump touts 'great' relationship with Australia, honors ve...

Chinese grow wary of GMO Crushing blow? Chinese grow wary of GMO Posted Apr. 28th, 2017 by Reuters News Agency By Dominique Patton BEIJING, April 28 (Reuters) – A Chinese consumer backlash against genetically modified (GMO) crops is beginning to dent demand for soy oil, the nation’s main cooking oil, and could spell crisis for the multi-billion-dollar crushing industry, which depends on GMO soybeans from the United States and elsewhere. The effects on import demand are not yet an issue, but it could be in the future. The U.S. Departent of Agriculture expects China’s soybean imports from all sources will rise 5.7 percent in 2016-17 to 88 million tonnes. China: Vegetable oil food use, thousand tonnes. Source: USDA Crop year Soy Rapeseed Peanut Palm Sunfl’r Other Total ’16-17 16,000 8,350 3,052 2,900 1,325 1,281 32,908 ’15-16 15,300 8,350 2,887 2,800 1,379 1,272 31,988   The governments of China and other countries say GM foods are as safe as conventional foods, but wealthier urban Chinese consumers are replacing soyoil with oil processed from crops that have not been genetically modified, such as sunflower, peanut or sesame,. A Nielsen survey last year showed about 70 percent of consumers in China limited or avoided at least some foods or ingredients, compared with a global average of 64 percent, with 57 percent naming GMOs as undesirable. “Everyone says soyoil has GMOs,” said Mr Liu, a 70-year-old Beijinger, shopping with his wife in Walmart. “Better not eat too much. Apparently they’re not safe. It’s like those hormones. I’m just as afraid of eating GMOs as hormones.” That sentiment is already hurting retail sales. Supermarket sales of soy oil fell one percent last year to 35.7 billion yuan ($5.19 billion), data from Euromonitor shows, versus growth of between two and six percent for alternatives. “Non-GMO oil is gradually replacing (soy oil),” said Johnny An, supply chain director at food-service firm Aramark, which serves meals in banks, government offices and schools in more than 60 Chinese cities. ADVERTISMENT A few years ago, 10-20 percent of Aramark’s customers asked for oil from non-GMO crops, he said. Now it’s more than half. The mood is causing headaches for crushers, said Paul Burke, Asia director at the U.S. Soybean Export Council, forcing them to find new markets for their soyoil, though it had not yet had a noticeable impact on bean imports, as demand for soymeal used for animal feed, the larger byproduct of soybean crush, is still robust as China expands its livestock industry. PREMIUM PRODUCT The Nielsen survey found that more than four in five Chinese shoppers would be prepared to pay more for GMO-free products, and a 5-litre bottle of GM-free soy oil already sells at a 20 percent premium to oil produced from GMO soybeans, but that isn’t translating into a boon for the nation’s soybean crushers. China is the world’s top soyoil consumer – it will use 16 million tonnes this year – but the crushers rely on the United States and Brazil, which grow GM-soybeans, for 86 percent of China’s 84 million tonnes of soybean imports. In China, which does not permit planting of GMO soybeans, labour costs are high and productivity low on small farms, making non-GMO beans costly to grow. They sell for a third more than non-GMO beans planted elsewhere. Processors such as China Agri Industries, a unit of food and grains trader COFCO and one of the country’s top crushers, told Reuters it needs to improve its sourcing of non-GMO materials, to meet “escalating market demand”. In the meantime, processors are losing money as increased competition with other edible oils and a ballooning glut has pushed soyoil futures in China down 18 percent so far this year to multi-year lows. Some crushers are taking radical steps to find more GMO-free beans. Henan Sunshine Oils and Fats wants to buy as much as 37,000 acres of land in Ukraine to grow and process crops such as non-GMO soybeans, rapeseed and sunflowers, said Yang Renyi, group vice-president and general manager of the international affairs department. ADVERTISMENT Yang’s team made two trips to Ukraine last year to look into the feasibility of producing, storing and processing oilseeds there. “If we managed to get a large area of land to grow oilseeds, we possibly will spend at least 200-300 million yuan (US$29-$43 million) there,” said Yang. Non-GMO oils already account for a fifth of the firm’s sales since it started marketing the new offering late last year, he added. SHAKEN FAITH The shift in attitude against GMOs in China has been fuelled by social media and campaigning by high-profile personalities. The agriculture ministry has sought to assuage consumers’ fears, launching education campaigns and banning advertising that promotes non-GMO products as healthier. But years of food scares have shaken consumers’ faith in Beijing’s ability to guarantee the safety of the nation’s food supply. Cooking oil is a particularly sensitive topic after a scandal over the use of recycled oil known as gutter oil, a few years ago, so shoppers are wary. “Before everyone said soybean oil has GMOs, now the advertising is all about non-GMO soyoil. But we still don’t buy it,” said Maxine Li, a 28-year old bank worker, shopping at the same Walmart. “We think peanut oil is a bit healthier.   ADVERTISMENT Popular articles Farmers overcharged nearly $100 million in CGC… Survey reveals ‘amazing’ soil loss in Great… Police warn about illegal left turns Grain bag slashing angers farmer Genesis plans huge fertilizer supercentre west of… About the author Reuters News Agency — Also by this author U.S. flour millers scramble for… USDA pig report likely will have little… EU nations vote against GM crops, but… RobertWager I find the attempts to convince people that China is not going full speed on GE crops a bit funny.

No one is forced to buy from Syngenta because it is a Chinese company. grinninglibber respond to market demands or die. Rob Bright Funny how it’s the wealthiest ctisens who are openly avoiding GMOs. Of course this two-tiered food supply issue is relevant to North America, too, simply because organic is priced so much higher here, and the only way to ensure you aren’t eating GE foods is to buy organic. At least in China they label GMOs by law. Here, in our so-called democracy, we aren’t allowed to know if our food is GMO or not. They simply refuse to label it, and our governments ignore the fact that 80% of citisens want them labeled. Happy Farmer Here is a fact that I did not see in the article – There are NO GMOs in any canola oil. None,nada. This is a fact. So if anyone is avoiding canola oil an the grounds that it contains GMOs, they are wrong. Here is the science, When GE canola is crushed to separate the oil from the meal the GMO component remains in the meal, NOT in the oil. If you want to avoid canola oil due to the refining process, that may be the better choice. There are also new canola crushing options beginning in Canada. You have the option to buy Cold Pressed, Non-GMO, Non- refined canola oil. Check out “North Prairie Gold”. This oil is even healthier than Extra virgin olive oil. MCR I’m not so sure about this. First, the term GMO (genetically modified organism) refers to the canola plant as a whole. The entire Canola plant *is* a GMO. The oil is drawn from a GMO. So saying “there are no GMOs in canola oil” is kind of like saying “there are no olive trees in olive oil.” Second, traces of plant DNA can be found in plant oils. Not much, but a little. If the plant’s genes are altered, those altered genes *might* be found in the plant’s extracted oil. Third, some people (probably many) would avoid oils from a GE plant not just because of the perceived quality of the oil, but because they prefer not to support genetic engineering of plants. Happy Farmer MCR, in a nutshell the canola plant has been modified, not the oil. While I appreciate your concern regarding the plant and oil, it is not true. The GM modification to the canola plant is made to 1(one) gene and this gene is a protein. Processing canola into oil and meal separates the GM portion to be contained in the protein meal. The result is NO GMOs in any canola oil. You can check out the Canola Council of Canada’s website for more info. If anyone has other reasons for not using traditional canola oil, please check out the Canola oil I mentioned in my previous post. richard The Chinese are a shrewd culture….they will not subject themselves to corporate wheedling and techno pipe dreams when it is clear that the no GMO Euro model has produced as much oilseed in the last twenty years, without paying tithes to the one trick pony MON-o-cult Latest opinion pieces Dairy tirade from U.S. won’t finish supply… From the Archives: Drought threatens as Alberta… Agri-tourism boosts rural communities There’s no law in averages Clock ticks down on Liberals’ chances of… Show me the data to prove a product’s benefits Podcasts Brought to you by: Featured bloggers Ed White Ed White has specialized in markets coverage since 2001 and has achieved the Derivatives Market Specialist (DMS) designation with the Canadian Securities Institute.

Buy this photo Staff photo by Kathy Aney James Thomas keeps an extra battery in reserve to power his Phanton 4 drone for up to 22 minutes of flight time. The drone is designed to return to the user before the battery dies. Buy this photo The drone hovered a few feet off the ground, sounding like a small swarm of bees. Cows on the grassy pasture nearby paid it no mind. James Thomas of Hermiston sent his four-bladed DJI Phantom 4 Pro soaring. Seconds later it disappeared from sight somewhere above Hat Rock State Park on the Columbia River. “It practically flies itself,” he said. “It’s a very smart drone.” The contraption would fit in a plastic milk crate. Thomas, 25, operated the drone with left and right joysticks on a hand-held console, akin to a video game controller. He connected an iPad tablet that displays images from the drone’s ultra-definition camera as well as flight information, including speed and altitude. The manufacturer advises a top speed of 45 mph, he said, but with a tailwind he has seen it reach 55. The signal from the console is good within three miles, he said, and a pair of antenna attachments boosted the distance to five. Still, he held off flying the $1,000 device all the way to the Washington side of the river. “Since we’re so close to the Columbia, with the weather, I’m kind of scared to do it,” he said. Thomas also said he flies it no higher than 400 feet, the Federal Aviation Administration’s ceiling on recreational drone use. He paid $25 to register the drone with the agency. He said two years ago he saw a drone in action and “thought it was so cool.” This year he convinced his girlfriend, Mariah Rincker, 25, of Hermiston, to buy the Phantom 4 with her tax return, with the promise he would pay her back. “He loves it,” she said. “It’s crazy how much stuff he’s done with it already.” He has had the drone for about eight weeks. They planned to visit his family in his hometown of Lebanon, Oregon, the same day the drone was to arrive. “I simply refused to leave until this thing came in the mail,” he said. His interest in flying, however, sprouted years before. “My stepdad was a pilot, so I love seeing things from the air,” he said, which even grew into him flying for the Civil Air Patrol. Thomas also said he was “big into photography” in high school, and the drone allows him to pursue that as well. He said he used the drone to shoot video of the Umatilla River flooding in Hermiston, which he gave to a Tri-Cities TV news station. Thomas works at the Hermiston Wal-Mart Distribution Center. On his days off, he said, he, Rincker and her 2-year-old son “try to go somewhere cool that has nice scenery.” Their best trip yet was April 21 to Wallowa Lake, where he took photos of mountain clouds reflecting off the high lake’s placid waters. He said his sister picked one image for her birthday present. He recalled he crashed the drone into a tree on an early flight and lost the drone on Hermiston Butte when “something went crazy with it.” His best guess was interference from the communication towers. Their visit to the wind farm at Finley Buttes did not pan out. Rincker said they found signs prohibiting drones. And the airport at Joseph, Thomas said, has a “huge no fly zone” that prevented the drone from working. He has flown at the Eastern Oregon Regional Airport, Pendleton, he said, which requires calling the tower operator for permission. While at the Hermiston Municipal Airport, he has to keep an eye out for LifeFlight aircraft. His biggest fear of flying, though, is hitting a bird. He also said eagles are a concern because they have attacked drones. Rincker credited the drone with getting them outdoors but said she has yet to fly the drone. Thomas said when his girlfriend tried, the weather soured. Thomas added they are looking at flying over the Painted Hills and Hell’s Canyon. And he just might fly it this weekend over Hermiston, he said, to take in the big Cinco de Mayo celebration. ——— Contact Phil Wright at pwright@eastoregonian.com or 541-966-0833.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Narendra Modi Donald Trump Bahubali 2 Exam results 2017 IPL 2017 News Analysis Farm-friendly, the US way Not being able to manage farm surpluses and absence of commitment to help farmers at times of glut have been the bane of Indian agriculture Shares1 Devinder Sharma | Sat, 6 May 2017-08:05am , DNA Their aggressive procurement strategies to offset price crashes hold important lessons for India After two years of back-to-back drought, a bountiful monsoon in 2016 was expected to bring cheer to farmers. But while foodgrain production certainly increased, the resulting glut in the market, especially for pulses, chillies, mustard, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and now turmeric, has left farmers high and dry. Prices crashed, and with the government failing to step in to purchase the surplus, farmers were devastated, being forced to dump the harvest on the highways in protest. While chilli cultivators in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana took the extreme step of putting heaps of chillies in some market yards to light them up, it soon turned into a hot political battle. As YSR Congress Chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy went on a hunger strike demanding compensation for farmers, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who hails from the region, met Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh in New Delhi, seeking government intervention. Attracted by higher prices and favourable weather conditions, farmers put in their best to achieve record production. But their excitement was short-lived. Prices crashed across the country, leaving farmers in the lurch. Ironically, Telangana government itself had advised farmers to shift to chilli, maize, and soya, so as to reduce the acreage under cotton. But against last year’s price of Rs 12,000 per quintal for dry chillies, this year, the prices have crashed to Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000. In the case of pulses too, the government had raised the procurement prices to provide an added incentive to growers. But against the procurement price of Rs 5,050 per quintal for tur dal, farmers failed to get anything higher than Rs 4,200. While production touched a record high, unbridled imports exceeding 90 lakh tonnes hit the domestic growers. Not only from Mozambique, with which India has a tie-up to grow and import pulses, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has made it clear that the government intends to import more. “We are talking to all African nations for pulse imports. Other pulse-growing nations are also being contacted,” he recently told newsmen, not realising that an ad hoc food import policy can play havoc with domestic production. But is this the way the United States, from where we borrow most of the farm policy approaches, operates? Does it leave farmers to face the vagaries of the market? How does the US cope with the situation of farm surpluses? Are the private markets, and the retail giants like Walmart, so transparent and efficient that they don’t allow farmers to face any situation of distress arising from price crash? In the US, the government invariably steps in when farmers suffer from a slump in market prices. When private markets fail to rescue farmers from a price crash, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) moves in immediately to manage the surplus. In 2016, when there was a crash in market prices, the USDA procured 11 million tonnes of cheese worth $20 million from farmers. “This commodity purchase is part of a robust, comprehensive safety net that will help reduce a cheese surplus that is at a 30-year high, while moving high-protein food to the tables of those most in need,” the then Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack had said, adding “USDA will continue to look for ways within its authority to tackle food insecurity and provide for added stability in the marketplace.” Earlier too, the USDA purchased 10 million pounds of strawberries, and directed the procurement to schools as well as to the needy. It purchased $6 million of fresh tomatoes in 2011 to help growers faced with oversupply. Since 2002, the US Farm Bill provides for income support to farmers under what is called ‘price-loss coverage’ system. In 2014, the income support helped peanut growers emerge out of the crisis emanating from a price crash. Unlike the Market Intervention System in India, which is essentially aimed at consumers when food inflation soars, the US has instead put in a strong safety-net mechanism for farmers. It is the absence of strong commitment to help farmers at times of glut that is turning out to be the primary reason for the continuing farm crisis. Not being able to manage farm surpluses has been the bane of Indian agriculture. The author is an agricultural policy analyst.

You clearly don’t have tween-agers. Your Tupperware supply is safe. And the odds of the finish on your dining room table getting eaten by a homemade concoction run amok is slim. But for a certain swath of the population, Slime is a four-letter word that invokes panic regarding the local supply of Elmer’s Glue and contact lens solution. It is what has swallowed your child whole and spit out a 10- or 11- or 12-year-old entrepreneur who when not making Slime, is busy selling Slime, recording videos of her squishing Slime or listening to the sounds of Slime in pursuit of relaxation from the stress of producing and selling Slime. Read more from the Slime series: SLIME (Part 2) Slime: How tweens make it, tape it and rake it in SLIME (Part 3) Is it safe to use Borax for DIY Slime? SLIME (Part 4) Slime: The soothing sounds of Slime. ASMR anyone? Slime dates back to the invention of the classroom demonstration. You really can’t find a science teacher who hasn’t in some way combined various household materials to make a gooey, yet pliable wad in the name of introducing the wonders of chemistry to kids who’d rather be doing just about anything other than learning the wonders of chemistry. Slime has lurked in the nation’s hands-on science museums and summer camps, outliving pet rocks and hanging with the vinegar and baking soda volcano set, for as long as the grownups in their employ can recall. But sometime in the last six months, something changed. And by December, 10-year-old Lola Matos of Jupiter was among the throngs asking Santa for jugs of glue. Because surely he’d have an easier time laying hands on the material than she and her mom. The essential ingredient: Glue Nora Maciak, 12, is a sixth-grader is in the slime business. She keeps slime stocked in her bedroom dresser and makes batches regularly in Jupiter, Florida on May 1, 2017. (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) The Palm Beach Post “When this first started, we’d have to search five or six stores to even find glue. All the stores were out. Walmart. Publix. Sold out. You’d run into a clerk and they’d tell you we have no glue even before you told them what you were looking for,” recalled Jennifer Matos, Lola’s mom. In Wellington, Destiny Smith’s mother developed a strategy for these shortages: Ace Hardware. And buy it by the gallon. Some Slime ingredients vary by chef and recipe. Shaving cream. Food coloring. Foaming hand soap. But almost without exception, the key ingredient to Slime is glue. The folks behind Elmer’s aren’t fools. They pedal this stuff by the jug. The Slime ingredient list now adorns the screaming orange boxes in which the glue is shelved. Elmer’s parent company, Newell Brands, reported they saw a rise in sales over the second half of 2016. In December, those sales had more than doubled, reports CNBC. Troll the aisles of Michael’s craft stores, Office Depot and Target and you’ll find Slime stations – get there on the right day and the stations are stocked with every ingredient needed to make the glop that can be molded and pulled like taffy, but doesn’t drip. Go at the wrong time, and only the odd glitter bottle remains. Office Depot, where a gallon of glue is selling for about $16, has hosted two national Slime events where kids are walked through the steps of making slime. Slime: It’s educational, too Slime does have its teachable moments. And not just in chemistry. Slime is a secret weapon for a lot of animals, including the hagfish, said Alexandra Laing, who works in Palm Beach County’s curriculum department. The hagfish can secrete stringy proteins that turn into slime when they come in contact with seawater. Word is they can mix up buckets of the stuff in mere minutes “But it also relates to humans,” Laing said. “We make six cups of slime a day that coats the insides of our digestive system. It’s in the lining of our nose and mouth.” As educational as it may be, one Michael’s clerk confided, “I have a lot of parents who can’t wait for this fad to end.” Count Destiny’s mom, Latoya Mills, among them. “It clogged my sink and got into the finish of my sofa. I can’t keep Ziplock bags in stock. All my containers are gone. I have no containers. None,” Mills said. Who knows what’s happening in the landfill with the discarded batches. Perhaps this will go the way of other recent fads. Is anyone still flipping plastic water bottles? At least some moms say the next fad on the horizon is at least less messy: Fidget spinners. Look it up online.  View Comments 0 Most Read Aldridge steps up to help Spurs down Rockets 103-92 Palm Beach County mugshots: Arrest photos from Palm Beach County Miami Dolphins rookie Isaac Asiata: Good person but a nasty (expletive) | The Daily Dolphin Things To Do Add Event + See More Weather and Traffic 65 33401 0 Most Read Aldridge steps up to help Spurs down Rockets 103-92 Palm Beach County mugshots: Arrest photos from Palm Beach County Miami Dolphins rookie Isaac Asiata: Good person but a nasty (expletive) | The Daily Dolphin Things To Do Add Event + See More More from palmbeachpost.com Topics News Sports Life News Records: Aaron Hernandez was Bloods gang member Sports NHL Playoffs 2017: Schedule, scores, live updates, results for Friday (05/05/17) games News UK law student caught using invisible ink during exam Lisa Ann Green Thomas J.

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Opinion Commentary: CRASH! Florida remains 1 of 8 states without serious texting, driving laws High school student leading fight to ban texting & driving in Florida CBS Miami’s Vanessa Borge reports. CBS Miami’s Vanessa Borge reports. Scott MaxwellContact ReporterTaking Names Privacy Policy Texting while driving is a deadly epidemic in this country. Nearly nine people die every day as a result of distracted driving, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The numbers for accidents in general are even higher — about one every minute. That means that, in just the time it took you to read this far in this column — CRASH!! — another life was probably affected, maybe ended. It’s a problem more prevalent than drunken driving. For all those reasons, most states — 42 of them — have banned texting while driving. And for all those reasons, safe-driving advocates and victims of past crashes hoped Florida would join them this year. But we did not. As legislators once again held countless hearings on issues the booze lobby, pot lobby, gun lobby and insurance lobby wanted them to consider, the bill to ban texting while driving simply collected dust. “We didn’t even get a hearing — not one hearing — in the transportation committee,” said Rep. Emily Slosberg, the South Florida Democrat who sponsored the bill. “It’s just not a priority because there aren’t lobbyists up here pushing it.” CRASH!! (Another minute passed.) Technically, Florida does have a ban on texting and driving. But, unlike those other 42 states, it’s what’s called a “secondary offense,” meaning cops can’t stop drivers unless the officers see the drivers committing some other infraction. As Slosberg noted: “Every other infraction, including [not wearing] seat belts, is a primary offense.” The inconsistency makes little sense to law-enforcement leaders. “I just don’t understand why we haven’t followed the other states,” said Orlando Police Chief John Mina. It’s not about making more arrests, Mina said. It’s about changing behavior: “I think it would stop the vast majority of law-abiding people who will decide: OK, now it’s a law.” Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings agreed, noting that such laws wouldn’t just protect other drivers, but pedestrians as well. CRASH!! That was the last sound WKMG-Channel 6 anchor Matt Austin heard before he blacked out last year. Austin regained his senses in the middle of an intersection with something wet running down his neck. It was blood. The child safety seat in the back of his car had flown forward when a texting driver rammed into his car, ripping off the back of Austin’s scalp. During his recovery in the week that followed — much of it in dark room where he couldn’t read or even watch his own TV station — Austin decided to do something he hadn’t ever done before: actively lobby to get a law changed. “I never wanted to blur this line,” he said. “But this isn’t a partisan issue. It’s something the public overwhelmingly supports. I’ve been contacted by people with stories about moms dying, kids dying … something needs to change.” So Austin, a father of three, took his own story to the airwaves and started interviewing legislators, asking why they wouldn’t change the law. Few of them actually seemed opposed to the idea. It was just that few of them seemed very passionate about championing it, either. “I finally realized: It’s not that there’s money pushing them not to do this,” Austin said. “It’s that there’s not money pushing them to do this.” That became extra clear during a trip to Tallahassee when Austin stood outside a legislative chamber with the father of a child killed by a distracted driver as lawmakers debated a tweak in the state’s liquor laws … for six hours. The grieving dad was incensed. He couldn’t even get legislators to hold a hearing on the texting law. But the lobbyists for Wal-Mart, Target and the liquor stores — all fighting over their right to the public’s booze money — scored undivided attention. CRASH!! Slosberg said she will try again next year. She has a bipartisan coalition of co-sponsors. And in a ray of hope, she said legislative leaders have agreed to hold a workshop on the matter this fall. There is a contingent opposed to texting laws on the grounds that texting is a civil liberty. But that argument doesn’t take much thought to refute. Drinking beer is a liberty, too. But you don’t have the right to do it while driving. Quite simply, you don’t have the liberty to engage in behavior likely to kill people. There are details that need fleshing out — rules about checking phones at stoplights or for GPS purposes, the amount of the fines, etc. But the important thing is to have the discussion; something most states have already done, but which Florida has not.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Following the fatal shooting of a clerk in the Charlotte Pike Exxon market in downtown Nashville, workers spent days preparing the store to reopen. At first glance, nothing seemed out of place inside the Exxon market on Charlotte Pike Friday. The isles were fully stocked, the day's rain showers were heard throughout the store, but there was no one behind the counter. A sub-contractor worked to repair the flooring. She chipped away at the tiles just as Daniel Clark and Trinity Quinn were accused of chipping away at the heart of this community.  On Tuesday night, they were accused of walking into the market with a plan to steal a set of keys. The van they arrived in was out of gas in the Wal Mart parking lot just down the road. Working behind the cash register, was 58-year-old John Stevens. When the duo left, he was dead and they were on the run. The evidence left behind could still be seen in the store.  "Over here where the cashier works you'll see some shots, you see behind telephone," one subcontractor explained. They were working in order to re-open the store on Saturday. Meanwhile, the memorial of flowers outside the front door continued to grow. Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

His aim: to bring such politics into the mainstream and to push progressivism into the dustbin of history. Pool/ABACA/ABACA/PA Images. All rights reserved.“Darkness is good: Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power. It only helps us when they get it wrong. When they’re blind to who we are and what we’re doing.” The shocking election of Donald Trump in November 2016 was in no small part due to the work of Stephen Bannon, who offered this quote in a post-election interview. Bannon, who took over Trump’s campaign in August, pioneered Trump’s winning strategy by focusing on Mid-Western states and engineering an advanced social media campaign that spent $150 million on targeted Facebook ads in the weeks before the election. Although few had heard of him before he took over Trump’s campaign, Bannon had long worked toward his goal of building a right-wing populist movement in the United States and around the world. Born in Virginia in 1953, Bannon worked for the Navy, Goldman Sachs, and in Hollywood before beginning his political activities. In the 2000s, he produced documentaries about Ronald Reagan and Sarah Palin, painting them as conservative heroes. Bannon’s films, were “peppered with footage of lions attacking helpless gazelles, seedlings bursting from the ground into glorious bloom;” Bannon was once described as “the Leni Reifenstahl of the Tea Party movement”. His 2010 film, Generation Zero, is replete with such evocative imagery. It offered a historical explanation of how the Financial Crisis came about, and argued that the present crisis was part of a historical cycle of crisis, resolution, complacency, and decline. David Kaiser, who was interviewed for the film, would write in an op-ed after the 2016 election, “In 2009, when Bannon and I met, I hoped that Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress would use the economic crisis of our own age to revive the values of the New Deal. Bannon obviously had other ideas about where the crisis would lead.” While working in the film industry, Bannon met and befriended Andrew Breitbart, conservative media pundit and outspoken critic of the ‘liberal mainstream media’. The two were kindred spirits, with similar aims; Bannon once said that, “Our vision – Andrew’s vision – was always to build a global, center-right, populist, anti-establishment news site.” After the death of Andrew Breitbart in 2012, Bannon took the lead in turning Breitbart into a tabloid-style website with allegiance to right-wing populist movements worldwide. Sensational headlines have allowed for the viral spread of Breitbart articles on Facebook, which, according to Bannon, has been instrumental in the growth of Breitbart during Bannon’s tenure; the two billion page views Breitbart.com received in 2016 beat the Washington Post, Fox News and Huffington Post. Bannon resigned from his role at Breitbart before working for the Trump campaign, and has since severed ties with the site. However, Bannon left his mark before leaving Breitbart. Ben Shapiro, a former editor of Breitbart, wrote that, “[Bannon] turned [Breitbart] into Trump’s personal Pravda.” The populist, anti-establishment news site was meant to serve as the voice of a burgeoning political movement that Bannon hoped could overthrow what he described as a “compromised political class” which engaged in “crony capitalism” to the detrimental of regular people. Political elites, for Bannon, are responsible for the current crisis and should be vilified for their actions. Bannon described the “global Tea Party movement” as a “reaction to centralized government, whether that government is in Beijing or that government is in Washington D.C., or that government is in Brussels.” Opposition to centralized government, and the elitism that it purportedly leads to, is “The central thing that binds – together – a centre-right populist movement of the middle class, the working men and women of the world who are just tired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos.” Bannon’s speeches, like his films, paint a picture of a world on the edge, in which he and other patriots were the only hope for the salvation of Western Civilization. In a 2010 speech to the Liberty Restoration Foundation, a Tea Party organization, Bannon expounded on the view presented in Generation Zero by saying that the present crisis was comparable to other crises in American history. At the end of this speech, he spoke directly to the audience, saying: “I know all of you guys read history books since you were kids, and you all think, “Hey, if I was there during the Civil War, I'd be right in the middle of it. Or if I was in the Revolution, I would be right there. Or World War II, or the Great Depression. I would be there, in Normandy, I'd do all that." We have that opportunity today, right? They're gonna look back at these ten years, fifteen years -  it's gonna take us that long – but we can do it.” Bannon continued, saying that, “[if the United States is to survive the present crisis] and it takes 20 years to get through this, it's gonna be because of guys like you. And if you quit, we are done. We're gonna be something very different on the other side.” He repeatedly emphasizes the historical significance of the audience’s actions in supporting the Tea Party and the burgeoning conservative-populist movement, calling them “the thin blue line” that could save the West. At one point in the speech, when describing his trips around the country giving speeches, he noticed that, “It's always the same hundred guys, men and women, every time I go. That’s the scary thing. You are the guys that are really gonna save us.” When describing the popular force behind the Tea Party movement, Bannon spoke of ‘Walmart Nation’: “They're the ones that hold our social organizations together, build our cities, run our little leagues, fight our wars. It’s the backbone of this country. And they’re enraged.” Bannon went on: “The anger of the tea party; it’s not racism, they’re not homophobes, They're not nativist. What they are is practical, common-sense, middle-class people that understand that understand that they're paying for their own, and their children's own, destruction.” In response to allegations that such politics were based in racist or xenophobic sentiments, Bannon argued that they are “washed out” of the movement over time, saying that, “when you look at any kind of revolution – and this is a revolution – you always have some groups that are disparate. I think that will all burn away over time and you’ll see more of a mainstream center-right populist movement.” The characterization of his populist movement as centre-right, rather than far-right, shows Bannon’s long-term aims. The theoretical concept of ‘hegemony’, originally conceived by Antonio Gramsci in the early twentieth century and later developed in the work of political theorists Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, is valuable in understanding the political work of Bannon in the rise of right-wing populism in the United States and Europe. Gramsci, a leader of the Italian Communist Party and Marxist theorist who worked in the 1920s, offered his theory of hegemony as a way of understanding how capitalism persisted despite being based on the exploitation of the majority by the capital-owning class. Capitalism was justified and perpetuated by the dominance of liberal ideology, in which the ownership of private property and the moral virtue of entrepreneurship and private enterprise. This ideology was accepted by the working class, creating a system in which domination by the majority was exercised through consent rather than coercion. Liberal hegemony, in the time of Gramsci, had evolved to accommodate the demands of early social democratic parties which sought to represent the interests of workers in parliament. By offering concessions to these parties, rather than the structural reform of capitalism that would help them to achieve true equality, liberal hegemony could fend off the revolutionary movements which sought its destruction. The concept of hegemony was incorporated into the theory of populism developed by Laclau and Mouffe in the late twentieth century. According to their theory, a populist political movement required the construction of an antagonistic relation between the “People” and an exploitative “Elite.” This antagonism could take many forms: in Marxist discourse it was between the proletariat and capitalists, and in right-wing discourses it is between an ethnic people and invasive foreigners. Laclau, in his essay Toward a Theory of Populism, wrote that, “The emergence of populism is historically linked to a crisis of the dominant ideological discourse which is in turn part of a more general social crisis.” The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s was, according to thinkers like Francis Fukuyama, the beginning of a political era that had gone “beyond antagonism.” The problems of such thinking were apparent to Chantal Mouffe, who argued that the Third Way approach to governance ignored the essentially antagonistic nature of politics. Despite the defeat of Western liberalism’s primary ideological opponent in the Soviet Union, the fundamental antagonisms that constitute society still existed, and would bubble under the surface of neoliberal hegemony until a breaking point was reached.   After the Financial Crisis of 2008, Europe and the United States were ripe for a new narrative, a counter-hegemonic project that could explain, on its own terms, the reasons for and solutions to the Great Crisis. Well aware of the opportunities that the crisis made available, Bannon went about constructing a ‘People’ that would be the core of his right-wing populist project. Economic anxieties were blamed on political and economic elites who collaborated to enrich themselves at the expensive of everyone else. ‘Others’ posed a threat to the Judeo-Christian values on which Western Civilization was based, which had been passed down as a part of the “Burkean compact” for 2,500 years. A return to ‘economic nationalism’ would revitalize the economy, bring jobs and prosperity to the American people, reunite the American people around traditional values, and save the American project from the grasp of the insidious ‘globalists’, whose policies of open borders and free trade could be blamed for the marginalization of the (white) working man. In an era of economic uncertainty and cultural division, the appeal of such a simple explanation for the crises of the day cannot be understated. David Kaiser, the historian who wrote about his involvement in Generation Zero after the election, concluded his piece with the following observation: “Apocalyptic rhetoric and apocalyptic thinking flourish during crisis periods. This represents perhaps the biggest danger of the Trump presidency, and one that will bear watching from all concerned citizens in the months and years ahead.” By building alliances between different parties and political groups around the world, constructing an ideological worldview which can underpin their various political projects, and disseminating this worldview through Breitbart, Bannon has been instrumental in the rise of right-wing populist politics in the United States and Europe. His aim is, above anything else, to bring such politics into the mainstream and to push progressivism into the dustbin of history. Those on the left who wish to offer their own alternative to right-wing populism ought to consider why right-wing parties have risen to power in recent elections, while social-democratic and left-wing parties have floundered. The strategic tools employed by Bannon and his allies may be useful to those who wish to unite people around opposition to social and economic injustice, rather than around fear of outsiders and change.

The Berkshire Hathaway CEO said this week in an interview with CNBC that Bezos “is the most remarkable business person of our age.” “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again,” Buffet added. Buffett was impressed with Bezos’ ability to grow two seemingly different businesses—retailing and cloud computing—into multi-billion dollar behemoths that are shaking up their respective industries. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Previously, Buffett expressed strong support for IBM when he bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock in 2011 based on its share price at the time. By the end of 2016, Berkshire Hathaway owned about 81 million IBM shares. However, Buffett told CNBC that he sold one third of those shares in the first and second quarters of this year, hinting that he had lost some confidence in the company. Amazon, on the other had, appears to have now caught Buffett's attention. Amazon’s (amzn) core online retail business currently accounts for 34% of all U.S. online sales. Wall Street firm Needham & Company recently projected that percentage would grow to 50% in 2021. Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, continues to grow at a rapid pace since debuting over a decade ago. Revenue in that business, which sells computing resources on-demand to business customers, jumped 43% year-over-year to $3.7 billion in Amazon’s latest quarter. “To succeed in two different big businesses in a huge way, I can’t think of another example like it,” Buffett said. Although Amazon’s retail and cloud computing businesses may seem totally unrelated, they do share a common core—they both make it relatively easy for people to buy things online.

AWS, on the other hand, makes it easier for companies to buy their computing resources online so they don’t have to build their own data centers. Additionally, both Amazon's retail business and AWS share common resources like the company's many vast data centers and in some cases, developers, which helps the overall company save money. Amazon’s explosive growth in both of these areas has stolen sales from consumer rivals like Walmart (wmt) and Target (tgt) as well as business-focused competitors like Hewlett Packard Enterprise (hpe) and IBM (ibm). As for IBM, Buffett doesn't seem to expect much progress against AWS anytime soon. The investor told CNBC that he sold a third of his stake in IBM worth a little over $4 billion at its current stock price and that the company’s turnaround has been “tougher than they thought, and it’s been tougher than I thought.” For more about technology and finance, watch: “IBM is a big, strong company, but they got big strong competitors too,” Buffet said. He didn’t say who IBM’s “strong competitors” were, but considering his praise of Bezos and Amazon, it’s pretty easy to guess who he's referring to.

By Nazuk Kochhar A post shared by demarcus - sotc (@standing_on_the_corner) on May 5, 2017 at 6:02am PDT On The Welfare Line With My Grandma: A Film Festival Of Forgotten Nuyorican Cinema, is happening this weekend in New York City. Set to feature six films from the ‘70s and ‘80s, the festival commences tonight at 6 p.m. at New York City’s The New School University Center with The Devil Is A Condition, and concludes Sunday evening at 5 p.m. with Natas Es Satan. The festival was organized and curated by Brooklyn’s Giovanni Cortez — who also makes music as Standing On The Corner — with the help of Luna Olavarría Gallegos and Christian Martir. Below, Cortez details the inspiration for the film festival, the role Nuyorican cinema played in his life, how he hopes to shed light on the cultural genre, and what he hopes attendees get out of the event. GIOVANNI CORTEZ: The conception of the film festival came from a combination of two of the biggest time consumers in my life: my affinity for the search of lost/unseen content (in a vinyl context, "digging") and my major in school of journalism and design with a focus in archiving. I spent a lot of my time growing up denying or misplacing my identity, making conscious efforts to connect with cultures other than my own due to shame. What that resulted in was an overcompensation in my adult life which I've since learned to tame, but one product of that was a milieu of what I call "cultural artifacts;” this is a collection of Puerto Rican material of all mediums (books/zines, records, film). I treat them almost as we treat imprints of dinosaur prints due to the fact that in a sense these things practically never happened. It's corny to consider the “tree falling with no one around to hear it question,” but I really do consider it in all this work I do. I acknowledge that it may also be short-sighted to reduce the value of work to how much it was seen, though this is where a lot of my work as an "archivist" stems from — the ability and will to breathe new life into things that missed in one way or another. That is the idea of the film festival. The role that "Nuyorican cinema" has played in my life is actually in its non-existence. It didn't exist to me growing up and still only sort-of exists right now. Part of the project is to acknowledge that Nuyorican cinema isn't a recognized genre, but this is my case and claim — that perhaps should be considered one. One thing that my institution has hipped me to is this concept of a "canon." As arbitrary as it may seem, this is my proposal of a Nuyorican cinema canon, assembled from Wal-Mart $1 bin dvds, storefront flea markets, and the dustiest corners of New York City's library collections. ADVERTISEMENT The Devil Is A Condition is the film that started the whole thing for me, equally on the basis of the form as well as the content. I describe it as a perfect culmination of all the things I am interested in (along with something like "I can't believe this exists”). The documentary, directed by Carlos de Jesus, explored the housing conditions and needs of the poor puerto rican and black communities together during the late ’60s and ’70s, set to the soundtrack of free jazz and poetry. Part of the film that really stuck with me was the exhibition of black and puerto rican together, due to that being my experience in New York. In New York at least, the destinies of African Americans and Puerto Ricans feel inextricably tied and I think recounting that exchange/relationship is important now more than ever especially in a place like my institution where race relations are convoluted and often end up in division. “This is where a lot of my work as an “archivist” stems from — the ability and will to breathe new life into things that missed in one way or another. That is the idea of the film festival.” What I hope to come from this event is a legitimization of "Nuyorican cinema" in a more official sense. We can say it exists because it’s found, can be compiled and put into a festival for the public, but what’s equally important is the conversation of maintenance and restoration. as much love I have for the “underground” or “forgotten,” maybe there is a way these original film reels can be recovered and represented. I think these films deserve it in a sense that they are both cinematically competent enough and also culturally important. Another step of that is treating this as we treat Russian cinema or French cinema institutionally; put them in a classroom, start a discourse. I named the showing of these films, and the culmination of all the work, On The Welfare Line With My Grandma after the similar sensation that struck me while putting this together as I used to feel as a kid with her. Educated in a New York School, I got through E.S.L. and learned english enough to be the intermediary between her and the social service agency. In this analogy, the university in which I am showing these films, as well as the members of it, serve as the welfare office: two institutions in which the responsibility to transfer information correctly is a true responsibility. While the former entails the acquisition to keep fed and clothed, the latter demands for cultural security; to uphold the culture that I owe a lot of my world too. I hope to host this again throughout the city in the summer so more dates and films to come. My ultimate goal is to be able to host all of these things in one place, whether that be a physical space or digital. I run into conflict with the word "museum," but a site in which all the music, literature, and film of the Nuyorican experience lost for all the reasons everything gets lost for people of color, can have a home and be accessible.

Trampoline Market - Drivers and Forecasts by Technavio Technavio has published a new report on the global trampoline market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Technavio has published a new report on the global trampoline market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 05, 2017 04:03 PM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Technavio analysts forecast the global trampoline market to grow at a CAGR of almost 5% during the forecast period, according to their latest report. The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global trampoline market for 2017-2021. Technavio presents a detailed picture of the market by way of study, synthesis, and summation of data from multiple sources. The analysts have presented the various facets of the market, with a particular focus on identifying the key industry influencers. Factors like increasing consumer demand for safe trampolines, the rising number of trampoline parks, and growing income levels have led to a significant rise in demand for trampolines globally. The growth in online retailing is another factor that has had considerable impact on the global trampoline market. Trampoline manufacturers organize several events to promote their products, which helps to increase sales of the equipment. Looking for more information on this market? Request a free sample report Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio consumer and retail analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global trampoline market: Popularity of trampolining as a sport Trampolining was introduced in the 2000 Olympics at Sydney. The induction of the sport into the Olympic Games has brought much value to trampolining, as the Olympics is one of the most prestigious ways toward international identification for a sport or its organization. Trampolining has found considerable success in such international games because it involves high-flying exploits and acrobatics. Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead retail goods and services research analyst at Technavio, says, “Gymnasts at the Olympics compete in four disciplines - individual trampoline, synchronized trampoline, double-mini trampoline, and tumbling. This popularity of trampolining has also encouraged parents to involve their children in such activities, both at recreational as well as competitive levels.” Focus on children’s physical development Parents are increasing their focus on children’s development from a young age, and this factor, in turn, has led to a rise in the demand for outdoor sports equipment including trampolines. Outdoor recreational sports equipment enhances children's physical fitness. “With children being increasingly addicted to computers, television shows, and smartphones these days, parents are increasingly looking at opportunities that allow their children to get involved in different physical activities,” adds Brijesh. Rise in online sales E-retailing is the fastest-growing sector in the global retail market. The popular players in the global online retail market for freestanding playground equipment include Amazon and Walmart. The growing number of online websites offering a wide range of trampolines with additional features has increased the demand for these products, especially among working parents who seek easy accessibility and convenience. Online retail channels also provide detailed information on products including quality, safety measures, and user guidance, which has also increased the demand for e-retailing among customers. For instance, tablets, given their large and more tangible interfaces as well as their frequent usage, typically through Wi-Fi connections, are suitable for purchasing children’s products online and make the process far easier for parents.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) By Sari Horwitz By Sari Horwitz May 5 at 3:54 PM Follow @sarihorwitz The front-runner to oversee the Justice Department’s civil rights division is a former Bush administration official and veteran conservative Washington lawyer who has represented several companies that were sued for discrimination. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recommended to the White House that Eric S. Dreiband head the civil rights division, which oversees the Justice Department’s policies on issues such as voting rights, police brutality and transgender rights. In one of his most high-profile cases, Dreiband represented Abercrombie & Fitch before the Supreme Court two years ago when the clothing retailer was sued for refusing to hire a 17-year-old Muslim woman because she wore a headscarf that conflicted with the company’s dress code. Abercrombie & Fitch said it didn’t have a reason to know that the woman’s headscarf was clothing required by her religion. In its Supreme Court brief, the company argued that people applying for jobs should not be allowed “to remain silent and to assume that the employer recognizes the religious motivations behind their fashion decisions.” The Supreme Court disagreed in an 8-to-1 ruling for the Muslim woman. Muslim woman Samantha Elauf, right, who was denied a sales job at an Abercrombie store in Tulsa in 2008, stands with U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lead attorney Barbara Seely at the Supreme Court in 2015. (Jim Bourg/Reuters) Dreiband is a partner at Jones Day, which has at least 14 attorneys who have joined the Trump administration. At the firm, he has successfully represented tobacco company R.J. Reynolds in an age discrimination case and Bloomberg in a pregnancy discrimination case. Dreiband was also involved in a recent Supreme Court case, representing the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, which sued the Obama administration over the contraceptive coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act. The ACA required group health plans and issuers of health insurance to provide coverage for contraceptive methods, but there were exemptions for religious employers. Religious organizations had to certify that they had religious objections to providing the coverage. Dreiband and other Jones Day lawyers, including Solicitor General nominee Noel J. Francisco, argued that the law imposed a substantial burden on religious organizations — and also made religious organizations complicit and violated their constitutional protections. The Supreme Court passed on making a decision in 2016, largely because it was still deadlocked after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death. Dreiband, who is from Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Ind., received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University, where he majored in history. An offensive lineman for his college football team, he tried out unsuccessfully for the St. Louis Cardinals NFL team after graduation. He earned a master’s degree in theological studies, with a concentration in ethics and public policy, from Harvard University a law degree in 1992 from Northwestern Law School. From 1997 to 2000, he worked for Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr and led the investigation and successful prosecution of President Bill Clinton’s former associate attorney general, Webster Hubbell. Under the Bush administration, he served as deputy administrator of the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division and general counsel of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Leslie Silverman, Bush-appointed vice chairman of the EEOC, said that Dreiband was “well respected by the staff.” “He has incredible integrity, he’s very bright and he really believes in the civil rights laws,” Silverman said. At the EEOC, Dreiband was involved in another a lawsuit with Abercrombie & Fitch — but this time on the other side. In 2004, the EEOC joined a private class-action discrimination lawsuit against Abercrombie & Fitch, alleging that the company promoted whites at the expense of minorities. The company agreed to settle the case and was ordered to pay $40 million to black, Hispanic and Asian employees and job applicants. He also represented the commission in a suit against a meat processing plant in Chicago for discriminating against African American and women workers. The case was settled for $2.5 million. Civil rights advocates said they do not know much about Dreiband’s background. Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that “it will be important for the Senate to carefully review his record if he indeed is the nominee because he has been on both sides of civil rights matters.” “His experience handling some civil rights matters does not answer key questions about his views on voting rights, policing reform and other core aspects of the division’s work,” Clarke said. Dreiband did not respond to requests for an interview. A spokesman for Jones Day also declined to comment. In 2013, Dreiband co-wrote a piece in Forbes magazine opposing “ban the box,” an effort by civil rights advocates to prevent employers from asking about an applicant’s criminal record when they apply for a job. Several companies, including Koch Industries, Walmart, and Bed Bath and Beyond have joined the ban-the-box movement in recent years. But Dreiband wrote in his article that “if the government is entitled to have law-abiding workers, then surely private employers are as well.” If nominated and confirmed, Dreiband would take over the division at a time when Sessions has begun to reverse Obama administration policy. In a lawsuit against Texas, the civil rights division dropped its long-standing position that Texas intended to discriminate in its strict voter ID-law — a position upheld by a federal judge in Texas two months later. [Justice Department changes its position in high-profile Texas voter ID case] In Baltimore, the division tried to delay a hearing on a sweeping police reform agreement while Sessions asked his prosecutors to review all such reform agreements with troubled police forces nationwide. And in February, the division’s civil rights attorneys joined the Education Department in revoking federal guidelines specifying that transgender students have the right to use public school bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. Last month, a group of conservative lawyers wrote a letter to Sessions, urging him to rid the civil rights division of “ideological rot.” The lawyers accused President Barack Obama’s civil rights division of serving “purely ideological ends with rigidity unmatched in other federal offices.” J. Christian Adams, who signed the letter and heads the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation, said the head of the civil rights division is “the most important position” Sessions will fill at the Justice Department. In response, a group of liberal organizations, including the American Civili Liberties Union, People for the American Way and Public Citizen, wrote Sessions, saying that “the division’s career staff must not be politicized by the incoming Justice Department political appointe . . . and must be free to pursue the division’s mission without inappropriate political interference.” Julie Tate contributed to this report.

They thought they found their man inside a Nissan. When they tried to serve a warrant, that’s when things escalated. The case in Clarksville, Tennessee, is noteworthy for many reasons. The bounty hunters ended up shooting and killing an innocent man. And, more importantly, they broke the law when they did so. What happened It was sometime before 12:30 a.m. late last month when the bounty hunters came across the Nissan Altima in the parking lot of a Walmart. This is what happened next, according to police: The Altima pulled off the parking lot, almost hitting the men. The pursuers jumped in their cars and chased it, firing shots. The car finally pulled over. There were four men inside. One of them, Jalen Johnson, was dead. What happened next Bounty hunters aren’t law enforcement agents and aren’t protected by the same laws that cover other officials. They can legally fire only in cases of self-defense, Clarksville Police spokesman Tim Anderson told CNN. “Not sure why they fired on the car or the thought process,” he said. The bounty hunters and the bail bondsmen are facing 16 charges, including murder.

Create an Account By editorial board • May 5, 2017 Tweet For now, the gross receipts tax appears to be only plan in play The governor and Legislature are battling on two fronts to balance the state budget for the next biennium. On the first, the government has no choice but to curb spending. The Oregon Constitution requires the state to balance its budget ever two years to prevent the kind of out-of-control debt and spending we see at the federal level. Accordingly, Gov. Kate Brown released a three-point plan last week to help cut a $1.6 billion deficit by pruning expenditures.  Brown proposed a task force to identify elements that can be privatized or leveraged, impose market-driven compensation for salaries and crack down on  unpaid tax obligations to the general fund, currently running half to three-quarters of a billion. Many won’t like the resulting cuts to services and grants, but they are essential. A bipartisan letter from the Ways and Means co-chairs said as much, noting, “Without action to contain the growing costs of state government now, the structural imbalance will cause even greater deficits in future years.” But over the long haul, cuts won’t be enough. Changes to the tax code are needed in order to raise additional funds more efficiently.  Legislators seem set on a corporate gross receipts tax of 0.25 percent to 1.0 percent. And either would be much easier to swallow than that outlandish 2.5 percent written into last year’s failed Measure 97. Oregon’s current corporate income tax is abused by large corporations. There are myriad methods they can use to dodge net income numbers and take advantage of tax credits, thus incurring a smaller tax payment than warranted. A gross receipts tax is much easier to manage on the state side and much more difficult to abuse on the business side. However, research shows corporate activities taxes tend to translate into higher prices for consumers. Ultimately, the company is able to pass on much of the burden. That’s particularly true of retailers with the capital to produce their own ingredients and create their own products — companies like WinCo, Safeway and Walmart. They enjoy a huge advantage over smaller, locally rooted businesses in passing costs along. Secondly, a receipts tax can prove devastating for mid-range businesses, which may easily log $5 million to $10 million in sales without finishing the year in the black. They could be tagged with tax bills of $50,000, $100,000 or more despite turning no profit. Unfortunately, there seem to be few alternatives on the horizon. As Sen. Mark Hass told The Oregonian: “If anyone has a better plan to look at how to reform and modernize corporate taxes, bring it forward.” For the sake of a healthy and diverse business community, we’d like to see something new emerge. In the meantime, it appears we’re stuck with this one. Related Articles AN F.A.Q.

Police in Canada say they are "evaluating" the post by a user claiming to be Ontario man Ager Hasan who is wanted in connection with the stabbing of Melinda Vasilije last week. The 24-year-old lead suspect is believed to have fled to the United States, where police are hunting him. Police believe Mr Hasan is responsible for Ms Vasilije’s death. The 22-year-old was found dead in an apartment she shared with a friend in Kitchener, Ontario at around 3am on 28 April, after police responded to an emergency call. She died from multiple stab wounds inflicted in a “targeted” attack, police said. The post on Reddit, titled 'Wanted for Kitchener murder my side',  included photographs of the couple together and screenshots of what appeared to be their last text messages. The conversation ended with the man claiming to be Mr Hasan arriving at Ms Vasilije's door and asking her to “buzz me up” on the night of the murder. An excerpt from the Reddit post purporting to be by Ager Hasan (screenshot) According to the post, Mr Hasan and Ms Vasilije had split after an argument a few weeks before she was killed. On the night she died, they made up after they “cuddled, kissed and talked about everything," the post claimed. But as he was preparing to leave, the post claims Ms Vasilije asked Mr Hasan if he had been with other women during the break in their relationship. A second excerpt from the Reddit post purporting to be by Ager Hasan (Screenshot) When he admitted he had she flew into a rage, which culminated in her grabbing a knife. The purported Mr Hasan said he then stabbed her multiple times in self-defence. “The fact is no one is more destroyed than I am. She was more than a girlfriend, a soon to be fiance [sic], she was my everything. What happened that night was nothing but tragic,” read the post, which has since been removed and the user (Redasblue101) suspended. According to police Mr Hasan fled to the US shortly after the murder, where he was last seen on 28 April at around 10am allegedly stealing a licence plate from a vehicle in a Walmart parking lot in Erie County, Pennsylvania and putting it on the black 2016 Honda HR-V he was driving with Ontario plate BPKT509. In addition to second-degree murder, Mr Hasan is wanted on three counts of 'breach of recognisance', Waterloo Regional Police Inspector Mike Haffner told Global News. The breaches of recognisance refer to a 'domestic-related incident' on 3 April, he said, when Mr Hasan was arrested for two counts of assault during a break-and-enter. In the post on Reddit, the user appeared to refer to this incident, explaining how: “Melinda and I got into an argument via text and our relationship ended. I went to her apartment that day, to try and talk. “Upon arrival I was confronted by Anna’s brother and her boyfriend. A physical altercation [took] place and the police were involved." Anna is believed to be Ms Vasilije's flatmate. As a result of the incident, Mr Hasan was restricted from Ms Vasilije's town of Kitchener and barred from contacting her, according to police.

          Skip to content News Today on WZ PC PS4 Switch Xbox One 3DS Vita Mobile Retro Tabletop Games Reviews Previews Features Daily Scoop Weekend Pipeline Insert Quarter Opinions Continue Countdown Etcetera WZ 101 Staff / Contact Us Opinion: I Couldn’t Give Two Loots About Destiny 2 The Games of May 2017 Warpback: What We Played in April 2017 Grand Theft Auto IV: Nine Years Later Kickstart This! Safe House Pyre Hands-On Preview: Supergiant Hits Their Stride With This Upcoming Arena Action RPG Weekend Pipeline: 5/5/17 – Cinco De Mayo and Pokemon Go Posted on May 5, 2017 by Brittney Williams My fellow gamers, it’s that time again! The weekend has arrived, and if we want to make the most out of it, then we must plan accordingly. Undoubtedly, some of you will probably spend your Friday night celebrating the holiday, which may or may not lead to a serious hangover in the morning. But Cinco De Mayo only lasts for one day, so you’ll want to map out the rest of your weekend activities in advance. Because let’s face it, if you find yourself slouched over a toilet in a dingy dive bar tonight, and with your head banging like the rhythm of a dancehall beat tomorrow morning, you’re likely not going to have the mental fortitude to effectively schedule in anything else. In-Game Events/Free Previews ROKH Closed Beta – This weekend, ROKH will begin a limited, Closed Beta, ahead of its May 16th Early Access release. The closed beta will allow players to explore and survive on Mars. ROKH is a survival game, set on the fourth planet from the sun. The mission of ROKH is to gather resources, and convert Mars from being a hostile planet into one hospitable for settlers from a dying Earth. Cooperative play is encouraged, by implementing trades, and bartering. ROKH is bought to us by a team comprised of the great minds behind games such as Half Life 2, Dishonored, and Assassin’s Creed. Tom Clancy’s The Division Free Weekend – This weekend, Tom Clancy’s The Division is free to play for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One users. The event began on Thursday, May 4, and will end on Sunday at 4:00 PM for PC players, and on Monday at 3:59 AM for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players (all times Eastern). Those who choose to take advantage of the free weekend event will have full access to the game. And if you like what you see, you’ll have the option to purchase The Division at 65% off. But beware; you’ll only have until May 15 to seize the deal. However, Xbox One players without a Gold subscription will need to make the purchase by May 8. Pokemon Go Grass-Type Increase – Haven’t been able to find that coveted Bulbasaur? Well, your luck is about to take a turn for the better. From Friday, May 5, to Monday, May 8, Pokemon Go will see an increase in Grass-Type Pokemon throughout the game. So if you’ve been looking to level up your Chikorita, now is a great time to catch ’em all. Additionally, if you’re in the Charlotte, North Carolina area, Niantic is hosting its first major Pokemon event on Sunday, May 7. Players will venture out into the city, following along with an official map, highlighting PokeStops and Gym locations. Participants will also receive special stickers from Niantic, as an added incentive to get out and play. Sales and Discounts Mega Man Legacy Collection at Amazon – Amazon is at it again with the great deals. This weekend, the Mega Man Legacy Collection is only $6 if you get the digital version. Considering that Amazon is currently selling the physical version for $17.72, buying the digital version is a great alternative. The digital version usually retails on Amazon for $14.99, so this deal offers consumers a 60% discount. BioShock Weekend Sale at WinGameStore – If you’re looking to finally get into the BioShock series, WinGameStore has all three games, plus some DLC, on sale this weekend. Prices have dropped by as much as 75%. BioShock: The Collection for instance has seen a 73% price drop, being marked down to only $15.99. So if you’d like to traverse the turbulent waters of Rapture, or visit the not so friendly skies of Columbia, you’ll want to take advantage of this deal while you still can. Ducktales Remastered – If you’re not interested in the Disney Afternoon Collection, but you’d still like to play Ducktales, Amazon comes to the rescue. Ducktales Remastered is on sale this weekend, for only $3.74. That’s 75% off from its usual retail price. Although, keep in mind, this is only for the digital version. Still, it’s a worthy investment. Skylanders and Disney Infinity Clearance – Walmart has a ton of Skylanders and Disney Infinity sets on clearance this week. Skylanders Superchargers figures are as low as $2.88, while most sets are averaging around $14.96. Disney Infinity is pretty much dead, as all support has ended for the game. However, offline play is still very much a thing. So while retailers are scrambling to rid their shelves of Disney Infinity stock, now is the time to snag as many of these collectible figures as you can. Conventions Interestingly, and a bit unbelievably, gaming conventions are at a complete and utter standstill this weekend. I’d love to say that it gets better next weekend, but it doesn’t. Be sure to check out Weekend Pipeline in the coming weeks for further updates. Esports Events DreamHack Open Tours – Like conventions, there’s not a whole lot going on in the world of esports this weekend. However, now that DreamHack Austin is over, DreamHack Open Tours is set to begin, on Saturday, May 6 in France. The tournament will last until Monday, May 8, and competitors will go head-to-head for a shot at the whopping $100,000 prize pool. Official DreamHack Open titles are Counter Strike: Global Offensive and StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, so if you’re looking to get your esports fix, you’ll want to tune in. As For Me… As per usual, my weekend is looking rather dull. I’ll likely continue working on a website for a client. And assuming that I have any free time, I’ll continue my playthrough of Persona 4. Since my husband has been away for work all week, he’s probably going to take over the TV in our living room. But if he doesn’t, then I’ll try to fit in some Watch Dogs 2, Paladins, or Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 ReMix. As usual, have a great weekend, and happy gaming! Who's Got Next?

Hasbro now sells the stress-relieving toys that are sweeping the country, as well as causing some trouble in classrooms. Hettinger said she got the idea for the toy, which sells for about $5, when she saw young boys throwing rocks at police officers in Israel. She wanted to find a way to distract young kids and give them something soothing to release pent-up energy. “It started as a way of promoting peace, and then I went on to find something that was very calming,” she said. Hettinger, who began imagining the toy as early as the 1980s, initially considered a soft rock for kids to throw, but then developed the idea for the fidget spinner more than 20 years before they became the hottest toy of the spring and potential relief for some people who suffer from anxiety and attention deficit disorders. But the craze came a little too late for Hettinger, whose patent on the original product expired earlier this year. That means companies like Hasbro can sell their own versions of the toy without Hettinger, who insists she’s not upset about missing out on the toy industry’s latest fad. “Maybe if it was some kind of exploitative product — like a new style of cigarettes — and my only motivation was to make money, I’d have a different attitude,” she said. “But I am just thrilled.” Children, college students and adults alike are scooping up the toys as a way to help them focus or release nervous energy. They come in a variety of colors and sizes and are markedly inexpensive — most versions can be bought for less than $5, although some made with copper or other metals can be pricier. Chains like Walmart and Toys ‘R’ Us are reportedly having a hard time keeping them in stock, and a search of Amazon’s top 20 best-selling toys and games on Friday revealed that 17 were fidget spinners. (The other three toys were fidget cubes, a six-sided plastic toy with multiple stress-relieving activities.) “When you start seeing these things flying off the shelf at your local 7-Eleven, you know things are heating up,” said Hettinger, who isn’t sure what’s behind the sudden surge in interest in fidget spinners. She speculates it might have something to do with the recession of 2008, with people looking for cheap ways to have fun. “That was always the concept — to help people,” she said. “I experienced it for myself … There’s a real need for this.” Hettinger, of Orlando, is now focusing on how to sell her original spinners and get them into the mix of the toys flying off the shelves. She’s launched a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of more than $23,000 and hopes to deliver her Classic Fidget Spinner as early as next month. “Kids are required to sit 7 solid hours in chairs and this is sparking a revolution to at least keep them from getting in trouble,” the website reads. “No animal sits still for long and we can’t either.” Not everyone is a fan of the fidget spinner, however. Schools in several states, including Illinois, Minnesota and Massachusetts, have banned the toys, claiming they’re too distracting for classrooms, USA Today reports.

But the one thing all of these hairstyles do have in common is volume—lots and lots of soft, bouncy, gravity-defying volume, which, as anyone who has ever tried to create by themselves knows, is an incredibly difficult look to get at home. MORE: Lucy Hale Gets Cystic Acne, and This is How She Treats It Hey, we’re big fans of sleek, flat-ironed hair, too, but sometimes, we want to play around with having Victoria’s Secret-level hair. You know, the kind that looks like it’s being perpetually inflated by a soft breeze from the shores of Ibiza? So we asked hairstylist and all-around wizard Jasmine Santiago to show us exactly how to create bouncy, messy, voluminous hair fit for a photoshoot, sans a ton of tools (or skills). Click through our gif-filled tutorial ahead to find out exactly how to get the look at home, and try not to freak out too much when you realize it’s only four steps long. Photographer: Tory Rust Model:  Olga with MSA Models Makeup: Ashleigh Ciucci Hair: Jasmine Santiago MORE: The 5 Coolest, Under-$20 Makeup Brush Sets to Instagram Right Now 0 Thoughts? 1 of 5 STEP 1: Roll it out Surprise! Hot rollers weren't just for your mom in the '80s—they're also truly one the of best ways to get bouncy, Victoria's Secret-level volume that seriously lasts. To start, brush through your hair (if you have curls, blow them out or lightly straighten them, first), then section off a three-inch chunk of hair at your roots. Lift the hair up and pull it forward at an angle, then place a heated roller underneath the ends and roll it down, securing the roller against your scalp with the included clip. Repeat with the front sections of hair on either side of your part, then continue with the rest of your hair. PRODUCTS TO TRY: 1. T3 Volumizing Hot Rollers Luxe, $119; at T3 2. Conair Jumbo Roller Instant Roller Heat Setter, $34; at Ulta 3. Remington H9096 Silk Ceramic Heated Clip Setter, $34; at Walmart Photo: Tory Rust STEP 2: Wait Taking your rollers out too soon is the enemy of volume and happiness. Seriously—wait until your rollers (not just your hair, but the actual rollers) are totally, 100-percent cold before unrolling them. Photo: Tory Rust STEP 3: Unravel Now for the fun part: The big reveal. Starting with the last roller you rolled, remove the clip and gently unravel the hair. Continue unclipping and unrolling, letting your curls hang loose and untouched. Photo: Tory Rust STEP 4: Add some texture To keep your volume from deflating by the end of the hour, you'll need to add some grip and texture to your (now) ridiculously soft hair. Blast your hair from root to tip with a veil of texturizing spray, then gently brush through your curls with a paddle brush, like the EcoTools Smoothing Detangler Brush, until your hair is soft and bouncy. PRODUCTS TO TRY: 1. Living Proof Full Dry Volume Blast, $29; at Living Proof 2. Garnier Fructis Dry Touch Texture Tease Spray, $4.29; at Garnier Fructis 3.

Leasing of the 84-unit, $12 million first phase is underway. Sunrise Management, a San Diego-based specialist in management of multifamily properties, has been named to handle all marketing, management and leasing for Town Center Villa. The new multifamily residential development is situated in El Centro, Calif., the county seat of Imperial County, directly east of San Diego. Located at 2100 North 10th Street in El Centro, the $12 million first phase of the 240-unit project is now complete and features 84 residences currently available for lease. The entire development will be built out in three phases, with the second and third phases earmarked to collectively provide an additional 158 residences. “The team at Sunrise Management knows this market very well and it sets us apart from competing properties,” Sunrise Management vice president of marketing Melissa Deen told MHN. “In addition to digital marketing efforts, we also put heavy weight on grass roots and guerilla marketing [and are] focusing on partnerships with local businesses.” Designed in a Spanish style with a modern motif, Town Center Villa offers one and two-bedroom residences ranging from 700 to 1,045 square feet in size. The open floor plans feature quartz countertops, wood plank-look flooring, icemaker-equipped refrigerators, ceiling fans, generous double-vanity sinks in master baths, walk-in closets and patios. Select units feature attached garages. Common-area amenities include a pool and sundeck, spa, 24-hour fitness center, clubhouse, resident business lounge and secure gated access. Town Center Villa offers a convenient location close to public transportation, the 8 Freeway and a wide variety of shopping destinations ranging from Lowes to Target, Costco and Walmart. Nearby natural areas promise to offer residents attractive recreational opportunities. Such scenic attractions include Cleveland National Forest, Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and North Algodones Dunes Wilderness. “The biggest challenge we have at Town Center Villa is that it is beautiful luxury community with a limited market for prospective residents,” Deen explained. “El Centro is a relatively small community, and this property is top of the market. This hurdle is being surmounted by Sunrise Management due to our marketing efforts. “We have found that while the existing market is limited, it is also up and coming. Digital marketing is key, and we have attracted many new residents relocating to El Centro from online advertising.” Los Angeles-based YK America is the owner and developer of the property.  Los Angeles-headquartered TSA Architects designed the community, and the contractor is El Centro-based Mike Mordah Construction. “The Imperial Valley area is experiencing steady job growth, and we’re thrilled to offer these luxury homes to those looking to live here,” Deen concluded.

The House Financial Services Committee backed Chairman Jeb Hensarling’s legislation in a party-line vote Thursday, sending it to the full House for consideration. While approval is likely in the Republican-dominated House, a Senate bill needed for the plan to become law would face a tougher path because the party’s narrower majority in that chamber would require it to have some Democratic support. Hensarling’s bill would scrap measures opposed by Wall Street including the Volcker Rule ban on banks trading with their own capital. It would restrict the power and autonomy of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and eliminate limits on how much banks can charge retailers for consumers’ debit card purchases. Less appealing to big banks would be the legislation’s repeal of Dodd-Frank’s orderly liquidation authority, which enables regulators to safely shut down a failing institution. They also dislike the prospect of having to raise billions of dollars in new capital to reach the bill’s threshold for banks to qualify for relief from some rules. “Dodd-Frank has made it more expensive for American families to save and borrow while also creating a regulatory climate that has hurt small business growth nationwide,” said Representative Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican who is vice chairman of the Financial Services Committee. President Donald Trump promised to overturn Dodd-Frank rules as part of a broader effort to unshackle banks and spur economic growth. Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive who leads Trump’s National Economic Council, in a statement Wednesday called Hensarling’s bill “an important step forward on a key priority of this administration.” House Speaker Paul Ryan has said previously he wants the legislation to have a floor vote “as quickly as possible” after its approval by Hensarling’s committee. When the full House takes up the bill, they’ll need to deal with the contentious issue of whether it should include a repeal of Dodd-Frank’s Durbin Amendment, which limits how much money banks can collect from retailers when consumers swipe their debit cards. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. have argued that the government shouldn’t set charges. Retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. say lower transaction fees would lead to lower prices. Stuck in the middle are lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who want cordial relations, and campaign contributions, from both industries. Hensarling’s bill was advanced after three days of debate within his committee. Democrats used procedural moves to slow progress, including demanding a reading of the nearly 600-page measure and offering more than a dozen amendments, none of which were adopted. “The bill is rotten to the core and incredibly divisive,” said Representative Maxine Waters of California, the panel’s top Democrat. “It’s also dead on arrival in the Senate, and has no chance of becoming law.” I Bloomberg News Comments Login or Subscribe Get us in your inbox Sign up for Payments Update CardLine Compliance Investment Merchant Technology Wallet Morning Briefing PayThink ISO & Agent Weekly Sign Up Subscribe Like what you see?

There’s nothing too visual about the teaser — what we do get are a few lines of dialogue that set up the main conflict of the series. It comes down to political differences between the king of the Inhumans Black Bolt (Anson Mount) and his brother Maximus (Iwan Rheon). “Are we supposed to follow our king and remain as silent as he is?” asks Maximus. This is sort of a joke, since Black Bolt’s power involves being able to level cities with just the sound of his voice. Latest entertainment videos Also Read: 'Marvel's Inhumans' Costumes Draw Jeers: 'Discount Halloween Store,' 'Walmart' “You’re talking about betraying your brother. You’re talking about treason,” responds another character, either Medusa or Crystal. “I’m talking about his freedom, freedom for all Inhumans,” Maximus concludes as a logo appears on screen. As many suspected, the plot will involve an internal war between Maximus and Black Bolt who, in the comics, are brothers but also mortal enemies. This is the latest push by Marvel to market its latest TV outing. On Thursday, Entertainment Weekly published a first look at the core cast in costume, which didn’t go over so well with fans. “Inhumans” is set to premiere in IMAX on Sept. 1 before airing on ABC Sept. 26.

The Economic Collapse – by Michael Snyder One sector of the economy that is acting as if we were already in the middle of a horrible recession is the auto industry.  We just got sales figures for the month of April, and every single major U.S. auto manufacturer missed their sales projections.  And compared to one year ago, sales were way down across the entire industry.  When you add this latest news to all of the other signals that the U.S. economy is slowly down substantially, a very disturbing picture begins to emerge.  Either the U.S. economy is steamrolling toward a major slowdown, or this is one heck of a head fake.   One analyst that has been waiting for auto sales to start declining is Graham Summers.  According to Summers, the boom in auto sales that we witnessed in previous years was largely fueled by subprime lending, and now that subprime auto loan bubble is starting to burst… Auto-loan generation has gone absolutely vertical since 2009, rising an incredible 56% in seven years. Even more incredibly roughly 1/3 of this ~$450 billion in new loans are subprime AKA garbage. In the simplest of terms, this is Subprime 2.0… the tip of the $199 TRILLION debt iceberg, just as subprime mortgages were for the Housing Bubble. I’ve been watching this industry for months now, waiting for the signal that it’s ready to explode. That signal just hit. The signal that Summers is referring to is a persistent decline in U.S. auto sales.  It would be easy to dismiss one bad month, but U.S. auto sales have been falling for a number of months now, and the sales figures for April were absolutely dismal.  Just check out how much sales declined in April compared to one year ago for the biggest auto manufacturers… General Motors: -5.8 percent Ford: -7.1 percent Fiat Chrysler: -7.0 percent Toyota: -4.4 percent Honda: -7.0 percent For auto manufacturers, those are truly frightening numbers, and nobody is really projecting that they will get better any time soon. At the same time, unsold vehicles continue to pile up on dealer lots at a staggering pace… Meanwhile, inventory days are still trending higher as OEMs continue to push product on to dealer lots even though sale through to end customers has seemingly stalled. GM, one of the few OEMs to actually disclose dealer inventories in monthly sales releases, reported that April inventories increased to 100 days (935,758 vehicles) from 98 days at the end of March and just 71 days (681,402 vehicles) in April 2016. So why is this happening? Of course there are a lot of factors, but one of the main reasons for this crisis is the fact that U.S. consumers are already drowning in debt and are simply tapped out… Now, a new survey from Northwestern Mutual helps to shed some light on why Americans are completely incapable of saving money. First, roughly 50% of Americans have debt balances, excluding mortgages mind you, of over $25,000, with the average person owing over $37,000, versus a median personal income of just over $30,000. Therefore, it’s not difficult to believe, as Northwestern Mutual points out, that 45% of Americans spend up to half of their monthly take home pay on debt service alone.…which, again, excludes mortgage debt. When you are already up to your eyeballs in debt, it is hard just to make payments on that debt.  So for many American families a new car is simply out of the question. And it isn’t just the U.S. auto industry that is in trouble.  The credit card industry is also starting to show signs of distress… Synchrony Financial – GE’s spin-off that issues credit cards for Walmart and Amazon – disclosed on Friday that, despite assurances to the contrary just three months ago, net charge-off would rise to at least 5% this year. Its shares plunged 16% and are down 27% year-to-date. Credit-card specialist Capital One disclosed in its Q1 earnings report last week that provisions for credit losses rose to $2 billion, with net charge-offs jumping 28% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. If you didn’t understand all of that, what is essentially being said is that credit card companies are starting to have to set aside more money for bad credit card debts. Previously I have reported that consumer bankruptcies and commercial bankruptcies are both rising at the fastest rate that we have seen since the last recession.  This trend is starting to spook lenders, and so many of them are starting to pull back on various forms of lending.  For example, Bloomberg is reporting that lending by regional U.S. banks was down significantly during the first quarter of 2017… Total loans at the 15 largest U.S. regional banks declined by about $10 billion to $1.73 trillion in the first quarter, compared with the previous three-month period, the first such drop in four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. All but two of those banks missed analysts’ estimates for total loans, as a slump in commercial and industrial lending sapped growth. This is how a credit crunch begins.  When the flow of credit starts restricting, that slows down economic activity, and in turn that usually results in even more credit defaults.  Of course that just causes lending to get even tighter, and pretty soon you have a spiral that is hard to stop. Just about everywhere you look, there are early warning signs of a new economic downturn.  And just like we saw prior to the great crash of 2008, those that are wise are getting prepared for what is coming ahead of time.  Unfortunately, most people usually end up getting blindsided by economic downturns because they believe the mainstream media when they insist that everything is going to be just fine. Thankfully, there are at least a few people that are telling the truth, and one of them is Marc Faber.  Just a few days ago, he told CNBC that the U.S. economy is “terminally ill”… “Dr. Doom” Marc Faber says the U.S. economy is “terminally ill,” and the current outlook doesn’t seem to be improving. “The U.S. has run a deficit for [so long],” he said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Futures Now.” “The conditions today are more fragile than they were ever before, and unless somebody comes and introduces minus 5 percent interest rates, I think the economy is really not in such a great shape.” “I’m actually amazed that people are so optimistic,” the editor and publisher of the “Gloom, Boom & Doom Report” added. I have to agree with Faber on this point. We are more primed for a major economic downturn and a horrifying stock market crash than we were back in 2008. It isn’t going to take much to push us over the edge, and with our world becoming more unstable with each passing month, it appears that our day of reckoning is likely to come sooner rather than later.

According to February 2017 comScore MMX data, Apple and Google Shopping placed fifth and sixth, respectively, among the UK’s top 10 retail companies as ranked by unique visitors to their desktop brand sites. Those two choices were nowhere to be found on the comparable list from March 2016. Those additions displaced UK apparel retailer Next and grocery chain operator J Sainsbury (Sainsbury’s) from the top 10 list. Other homegrown retailers feeling the squeeze were department store and grocery operator John Lewis Partnership (John Lewis, Waitrose), which dipped one spot to seventh; electronics and mobile phone retailer Dixons Carphone (Carphone Warehouse, Currys PC World), which fell one position to eighth; and department store and grocery chain Marks & Spencer (M&S), which fell two spots to 10th. Walmart, owner of grocery chain Asda, also lost ground, sliding from fifth to ninth. The only homegrown retailers to hold their places on comScore’s list were Home Retail Group, owner of general merchandise retailer Argos and home decor merchant Habitat; and grocer Tesco, at third and fourth, respectively. Among the list’s members, only M&S has revealed any plans that might push it back up among the UK’s top online retail destinations. Steve Rowe, the retailer’s CEO, told The Guardian last week that M&S would begin testing a full-fledged online grocery shopping service this fall. Currently, M&S only provides shoppers the ability to buy some party food and gift items online for in-store pickup. —Cliff Annicelli New Report in eMarketer PRO This Week Advancing Programmatic Advertising As programmatic advertising matures, buyers and sellers no longer see it merely as a means of automating processes, but rather as an advanced method of controlling ad campaigns—and better targeting the audiences that come with them.

Salone Monitor.com Online Reviews By Salone Monitor Search Main menu Skip to primary content Home Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Post navigation ← Previous Next → Hair Bow Business: 11 Tips to Start Selling Hair Bows Posted on May 5, 2017 by admin 1) Caution! Don’t Start Online”…”Yet: Everyone wants to sell on the internet as it opens your business up to the entire world. Many people try to immediately start selling online via a website only to find out they make very few sales. Why? No one is finding their site. Selling online is great, but it can take time to get sites set up or traffic to your site. Simply put, starting a website will get you nowhere if you don’t get traffic to see it. There are lots of variables in getting your website noticed by Google but we will save that for a later article. Easier ways to begin selling online are by listing your bows on eBay or Etsy. Both of these sites allow a beginner to showcase their products with ease. If your product is priced competitively and you have good pictures to display, you should be able to start selling right away via these sites. 2) Local Business Marketing: We recommend this as one of the best ways to start selling your hair bows and ribbon products. This is why we listed it as the first “do” item. Many people try to immediately start selling online via a website. Selling online is great, but it can take time to get sites set up or traffic to your site. To get off to a quick start, focus your efforts initially on your local market. Find local boutiques and children’s stores and drop by with examples of your products. Be sure to have an idea of how you both will benefit from working together. You can sell your bows at a wholesale price or work out a commission for the store if they agree to sell your hair bows. Get in touch with the local schools cheer leading and dance teams. Consider creating school fundraisers and doing “hair bow parties”. Hair Salons are also great avenues to sell your bows. Finally, do what we did starting out and sell at some nearby community craft shows or public events where a booth can be purchased. 3) Social Networks: Facebook and Twitter and similar networking sites are the rage these days. Don’t forget to use these sites to market your business. Learn the options of each type of site and focus your efforts on getting followers by posting great relevant posts. Use these sites to show pictures of your creations and post bow ideas to your followers. Announcing promotions and sales are a must on social networks. 4) Blogs: There are lots of Blogging sites you can use. Blogger and Word Press are two popular options where you can easily create a blog for your business. Post pictures and write about your products. Come up with creative designs that will catch the eyes of your readers. Make sure you link your blog to your website which can help drive sales 5) eBay and Etsy: Rather than starting with a website, start generating business online with eBay or Etsy. These sites already have huge amounts of shoppers and you can list your bows here for a small fee. Both of these sites allow a beginner to showcase their products easily and effectively. Key points to selling via these sites: price your hair bows competitively and use good pictures and descriptions. Once you have developed a good number of sales through these sites, it may be time to consider starting your own branded website. 6) Starting Your Own Website: We started our first website at WahmShoppes. For $8 per month, you can open your very own e-commerce store. Customize the look of your store by using any of their various templates. It takes time to start getting web traffic organically. If your budget permits, Google Ad words is an immediate way to start driving traffic to your website. With Ad words, you only pay when someone clicks on your ad. Be careful as it can be quite expensive, especially if people are just clicking and not buying. Gaining traffic organically is a whole subject to itself but make sure you submit your site to the search engines and to some online directories to start. To take online payments, we suggest using PayPal and/or Google Checkout to save on monthly merchant account fees until your volume may dictate a merchant account will pay for itself. 7) Ribbon Suppliers: If you are going to sell hair bows, you are going to need lots of ribbon. Sure you can go to Wal-mart or Hobby Lobby but generally the selection will be less and the prices will be higher versus finding a niche online store that serves the hair bow industry. Look for a company carrying abundant variety, quality products, great pricing, excellent customer service and ships promptly. You want to build a long-term relationship with your supplier and these points mentioned are key to your sanity and success. Be sure you can get color cards from your suppliers so you can accurately match multiple colors on the bows you create with real samples. Don’t rely on images on a computer monitor for color matching. Let your customers use the cards to pick out their colors for a custom bow made to their specifications. Do a web search on a search engine for “hair bow supplies” to come up with a list of good suppliers. 8) Hair bow Templates: Save yourself lots of time and frustration. Use hair bow templates! Create a consistent bow size every time and eliminate your grosgrain ribbon waste by using a template. By doing a search online for “hair bow templates” you will find several retailers offering templates you can purchase online. 9) Hair bow Instructions: There are so many different types of hair bows you will never learn them all. Many sites sell instructions but others offer them for free. Search around on Google and even EzineArticles to find an abundance of free instructions. If you prefer video tutorials, check out YouTube for some excellent videos to view. 10) Shipping: The goal of every business is to get to the point where they have so much business they can’t keep up. When we got to this point we purchased a shipping tool called Ship Rush. This program ties your computer and electronic scale together and allows you to click and copy the customer information right off the email or customer receipt. It then quickly prints out a custom shipping label for the US Post Office or UPS without you having to type in any address information. Trust me, it will become a huge time and money saver as your business grows if you ship out a lot of packages. 11) Financial Software: The number one reason businesses fail is by failing to understand and manage their finances correctly. Your business finances must stay organized and your cash flow needs to be handled carefully. With money coming in and out constantly, this can quickly become a real challenge. Using accounting software such as Quicken or QuickBooks can keep your finances organized. Talk to your CPA to see what they recommend.

Norman, who helped to revive food retailer Asda in the 1990s, will join M&S at a critical time. The company's food business is thriving, but its clothing division has struggled to deliver growth for more than a decade. "I'm under no illusions about the extent of the challenge facing the business," Norman told Reuters. M&S shares rose as much as 6 percent as investors welcomed the appointment of Norman, whose CV is packed with UK and international experience, including an extensive track record in the retail industry. M&S said Norman would become non-executive chairman on Sept. 1, succeeding Robert Swannell, who will retire from the board having served six years in the job. Norman will receive an annual salary of 600,000 pounds ($776,040) for the chairmanship, which although part-time is one of the most prestigious in corporate Britain. Analysts said Norman's turnaround experience could be highly valuable to M&S. "The combination of Norman and (CEO Steve) Rowe should be a force for good for M&S ... we welcome this appointment," said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black, who has a "hold" rating on the stock. Others, however, said there was a danger Norman could go beyond the chairman's brief of running the M&S board and keeping investors onside. "It will be interesting to see how much of a 'back-seat driver' Archie Norman is to CEO Steve Rowe," independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said. Norman was a member of a three-strong team that established and built general merchandise retailer Kingfisher in the 1980s. When Norman joined Asda as CEO in 1991, the supermarket was on its knees, but he transformed the business and then sold it to Wal-Mart in 1999 for a multiple of eight times its starting share price. He has also chaired broadcaster ITV and been deputy chairman of Australian retailer Coles. He currently chairs investment bank Lazard in London and craft retailer Hobbycraft and is an advisor to Wesfarmers. He worked for management consultants McKinsey before joining Kingfisher. Norman is also well-connected politically, having served for eight years as a member of Britain's lower house of parliament, representing the Conservative Party in Tunbridge Wells, southern England. "Having conducted a very rigorous appointment process, it was clear to us that Archie was the best person to be chairman," said Vindi Banga, M&S' senior independent director. On Wednesday, M&S said it had hired Halfords boss Jill McDonald to head the clothing division, freeing up Rowe to concentrate on running the overall company. McDonald will also join in the autumn. Swannell will leave M&S having steered a smooth succession for the chairman's job. Shares in M&S were up 4.9 percent at 17.6 pence at 1053 GMT, valuing the business at 6.1 billion pounds ($7.9 billion).

Future plans are hitting a road block Mike Brookbank 8:13 AM, May 5, 2017 8:17 AM, May 5, 2017 Share Article Previous Next What's next for the Geauga Lake property? Future plans are hitting a road block Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next AURORA, Ohio - Plans to redevelop a once popular piece of real estate in Northeast Ohio just hit a major roadblock. It's yet another setback to bring new life to Geauga Lake as two communities currently battle it out over money generated from the future development. An income tax revenue debate currently brewing between Bainbridge Township and Aurora is just one of the issues that's bringing movement to a screeching halt. Like the mighty coasters that once stood on the site, there are a lot of ups and downs when it comes to redeveloping Geauga Lake. "Sometimes you're at the top and think it's going well and other times we're at the bottom," said Tracy Jemison from Geauga Growth Partnership. Momentum, now stalling, as a deal to open a Meijer store on 41 acres hits an impasse. "Without an agreement both sides are gonna lose," said Jemison. Bainbridge Township and Aurora leaders have yet to agree on how much income tax money each will collect from the proposed development. "I know everything always comes down to money," said Trish Wade. The Bainbridge Township resident tells News 5 she is tired of all the delays. "I wish something would be done with it even if it was making it into a park of some sort, a green space of some kind," said Wade. News 5 learned of another blow for the Meijer deal. Bainbridge Township is not being allowed to tap into Aurora's water and sewer lines for the project to move forward. Also, a brand new study done by students at Cleveland State University's Urban Affairs department shows this area cannot support any new retail. "With Target and Walmart there we don't need any more big box stores," said Wade. Local business owner Hung Tran agrees. "I think what would work in this area would be commercial/residential," said Tran. Up until a few weeks ago, Cedar Fair, which owns the site, has been trying to sell off Geauga Lake on its own. Now the company has hired Hanna Commercial to market the property. It's a property the Geauga Growth Partnership would like to see go Hollywood. "We still think this is a great location to locate some movie studios, put some back lot operations there. I think that would provide the greatest economic impact in that area," said Jemison. Despite the Meijer setback, there is some good news for Geauga Lake. Liberty Ford is under contract to open a dealership on 13 acres on the Aurora side. 597 acres remain listed at $12.5 million dollars. "Kind of wonder what's going to happen next," said Tran. Bainbridge Township and Aurora leaders will get together again next week to hash out a joint economic district. A Spokesperson with Hanna Commercial tells News 5 there is demand for supplemental retail, but not any additional big box stores. They also said after a decade of sitting vacant Cedar Fair wants to "move the property."   Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Floodwaters are slowly receding in parts of Randolph and Lawrence counties, giving officials their first look at some of the damage. Comments aAFont Size Flooding in Arkansas Click here for larger versions Water slowly began receding from flood-ravaged Randolph and Lawrence counties Thursday, giving officials their first glimpse at the damage left by the flooding Black River and several breaches along a levee system that protected a portion of Pocahontas. The Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department opened a section of U.S. 67 from Pocahontas northeast to Corning on Thursday afternoon that had been closed since Monday because of high water. "I will finally get to go home," said David Jansen, the county judge for Randolph County, who lives east of Pocahontas. U.S. 67 from Pocahontas south to the Lawrence County border remained closed as up to 4 feet of water continued rushing over the roadway, pouring from nine breaks in the Black River levee. Officials kept U.S. 63 east of Portia closed as well, although most of the water there had receded from the highway. After heavy storms roared through northern Arkansas last weekend, the Black River rose to 28.95 feet in Pocahontas on Tuesday evening, breaking the previous high mark of 28.4 feet set in April 2011. At least seven people died in weather-related incidents across the state. Two others are missing and presumed dead because of the weather. Madison County rescue teams suspended their search for 18-month-old Krystal Wiggins on Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Rick Evans said. Krystal and her 4-year-old brother, Damien Wiggins, disappeared Saturday after their mother's sport utility vehicle was swept off a low-water bridge near Hindsville. Teams found the boy's body earlier this week. Teams also scaled back a search for a man who fell from a canoe in the Buffalo National River on April 26, according to Buffalo National Park spokesman Caven Clark. Searchers in two boats checked the river for the canoeist Thursday but did not locate him, Clark said. Much of northern Arkansas received 4-6 inches of rain over the weekend, spawning flash flooding in creeks and rivers. Also over the weekend, southern Missouri received 10 inches of rain that flowed into the Current River north of Van Buren, Mo., causing the river to rise there to record levels. The water made its way downstream where it poured into the Black River, east of Pocahontas. The onslaught topped the 28-foot-high, 8-mile-long levee system there, causing three major sections and six minor portions to fail, and sending the rush of water south. Water poured into the Running Water Ditch, crossed U.S. 67 near the Shannon community in Randolph County and flooded thousands of acres, mostly farmland, to the north and east of Walnut Ridge. John Thomison, the county judge for Lawrence County, toured sections of his county Thursday morning as the water began to recede. "We've got a little bit of breathing room," he said. "We are realizing what a tremendous amount of water has come down. We're hoping it is stabilizing." Still, at least 4 feet of water covered U.S. 67 north of Walnut Ridge. Several Pocahontas police officers who volunteered to help with water rescues in the area launched a boat from Pocahontas and made it by water to Lawrence County, some 6 miles to the south, before reaching land. The National Weather Service reported that floodwaters spread up to 9 miles wide in some areas. Portia Mayor Kelly Duckworth spent Wednesday evening and Thursday morning watching anxiously as water began encroaching on her town from the east. Portia sits on the eastern side of the Black River, and several houses have river water lapping against them on the western edge of town. "We had water coming from the broken levees on the east side," Duckworth said. "I was afraid we were going to be surrounded by water." Water began rising again at 2 a.m. Thursday, she said, but by 6 a.m. it had gone down. "It was nerve-wracking," Duckworth said. "It was dark, and you really couldn't see much as the water was going up. I was worried for our town." About half of the 437 people who live there had left after Thomison suggested a precautionary evacuation of the town. Water made its way Thursday along the Running Water Ditch south through Clover Bend and eventually back into the Black River about 10 miles downstream from Black Rock. Judy Taggart, manager of the Steve Jones Mallard Lodge in Clover Bend, said floodwaters were encroaching on a skeet-shooting range and acres of fields behind the lodge, but the lodge was safe. "The field looks like a running, flooding river," she said. Gov. Asa Hutchinson called reports about the receding water "good news" and said he expects the area to be declared a federal disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance. "Once the water starts receding, then we will look at the damage assessment, which is a critical next step," Hutchinson said. "We already know that there's significant damage ... to businesses, in addition to the individual homes that have been flooded." Hutchinson flew over Randolph and Sharp counties Tuesday to inspect the flooding. In Pocahontas, officials reopened U.S. 67 on Thursday across the Black River bridge, giving residents access to a Wal-Mart Supercenter, some restaurants and other businesses in eastern Pocahontas, some of which flooded. Tara Maupin, manager of the Pocahontas Posey Patch, said she and store workers moved supplies from their store near the Black River to a building about a mile away on higher ground Monday and reopened at the new location a day later. The store at the original location had 19 inches of water inside by Wednesday morning, she said. Mary Haynes left her home in eastern Pocahontas on Sunday when officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for a neighborhood of about 150 homes just south of the Black River. She has been staying at a church. It's the second time this decade that her home has flooded. In 2011, levees broke and her home on Douglas Street received about 4 feet of water inside. Haynes was not allowed back into her neighborhood Thursday because water was still too high. Jansen said about 70 percent of the neighborhood was still underwater. He said flooding had destroyed at least 50 homes. "I couldn't believe it," Haynes said when she realized that her home would flood for the second time since she bought it. "I thought the levee would hold. If water just topped over it, it wouldn't have been as bad. But when it breached, the water came all at one time." She said she doesn't have flood insurance and doesn't know what she will do when she can return to her home. "I'm torn," Haynes said. "I don't want to give up my home, but at the same time, I don't want to go through this again." Jansen, who has gone through similar flood events in 2008 and 2011, said the latest flooding has taken a more emotional toll on him. "Each flood is different," he said. "I'm taking this one harder. You see all those people with losses, and you realize they are victims of circumstance. We tried to do the right thing with the levee, but you can't beat Mother Nature." Officials now are watching the White River rise as it takes water from the Black River. The White River reached 28 feet at Georgetown in White County on Thursday evening, flooding Arkansas 36 and cutting the town off. Flood stage there is 21 feet. "People are boating in and out of Georgetown," White County Office of Emergency Management coordinator Tamara Jones said. "The town is an island. People are used to it, though." She said several Georgetown residents have moved and are living in recreational vehicles at the White County Fairground in Searcy. Others are boating from Georgetown to dry ground, buying groceries and then boating back to the town and their homes. Meteorologist John Lewis with the National Weather Service in North Little Rock said after rain-producing storms leave Arkansas early today, the state should see dry weather for several days. "This will take a long while before it dries up," Lewis said of the flooding. "It's a very slow process."

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch Stock Updates On May 5 Posted: May 5 2017, 4:07am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The latest Nintendo Switch stock tracking information for online and in stores for Friday May 5th. A week ago, the Nintendo Switch got restocked for the Mario Kart 8 launch. A week has gone by without $299.99 Switch consoles on sale online. We take our daily look at the current Nintendo Switch availability and projections. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 Nintendo believes the Nintendo Switch will be as big as the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. Looking at the current shortage, the Japanese video game maker has a long road ahead of them to ship 101 million Nintendo Switch consoles. Nintendo Availability Status The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. On May 5, 2017 the Nintendo Switch is a not available online, but has been briefly available as part of a $500 Nintendo Switch bundle at ToysRUs.com on May 3. These Switch bundles are not very popular, but the fact that ToysRUs offered the Switch online is an indicator that new shipments arrive.  Online stores restocked the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in time for the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on April 28. Since then the Switch console was out of stock online, besides the TRU bundle offer, according to data from The Tracker. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $87 to $100 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $99 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value.  To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use the new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android. There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. The Nintendo Switch is available in 693 Walmart stores, 248 Target stores, 25 GameStop locations and 6 Fry's stores according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracker iStockNow (5:00am ET). The number of stores flagged to have stock declined slightly compared to May 4.  When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news. How to find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Online We developed the The Tracker app to make finding stock of rare products online as easy and stress free as possible. Download the free app for Apple iPhone or Android phones. From the list products you select to be notified for the Switch with Grey Joy-Con and/or Neon Joy-Con. That is it. It is set and forget. At the moment we detect the Nintendo Switch console in stock at major online retailers, you receive a notification on your smartphone. Now you are just a tap away from buying a Nintendo Switch. You can also see the current availability of the Nintendo Switch consoles in the web version of The Tracker: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con, Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     NES Classic Prices In Free Fall Posted: May 5 2017, 3:44am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   Diagram: Keepa   The Nintendo NES Classic Edition reseller prices are dropping considerably. When Nintendo announced to discontinue the NES Classic Edition, the reseller prices immediately jumped over $300. This was mid-April. Now that the NES Classic has almost completely vanished from store shelves, the reseller prices are as low as $215. Many including us have predicted that the market value of a brand-new NES Classic would go up to eventually $500 come May.  Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con in Stock Online The demand for the NES Classic has apparently slowed down and resellers are trying to find the right price point to sell off their stash of NES Classic consoles. The NES Classic Edition selling for $215 is a new buy now listing on eBay that appears to be from a legit seller with 100% positive feedback.  On the Amazon market place the prices have come down to around $250. As Keepa data shows, the price trend points downward. Based on the NES Classic auctions it appears that the sweet-spot for NES Classic Edition resell prices is at around $200.  Once resellers run low on the NES Classic units, prices will go up again. It is difficult to predict how low prices will drop and when they rise again. $200 is a bit more than 3 times the regular price of $59.99. We have seen plenty of buyers that bought NES Classic consoles for $180 to $220 in the past months.  Find all NES Classic offers and auctions on ebay.com as well as all marketplace offers on amazon.com. Even with prices dropping, offers that are too low are likely fake. Right now there are several NES Classic offers priced at $169 on Amazon.com from new sellers that are likely fake and just would look up your cash until Amazon refunds you. Some Target and Walmart stores still receive new NES Classic inventory. The Nintendo NES Classic Edition is still not completely sold out. Nintendo will not make an announcement when the last NES is sold as they will not know. Eventually the store inventory trackers will just stop finding new NES Classic stock.  Many NES Classic fans have already reset their mind on the next classic console release. Nintendo is expected to release a Super NES Classic Edition this fall. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On April 13, Nintendo announced to stop production of the NES Classic Edition. Nintendo said that the last shipments of the NES Classic arrive through April. We keep spotting though the $59.99 NES Classic Edition in May. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest hack enables the NES Classic to store 2,500 games. The 80s retro console launched on November 11, 2016. As of Aprl 27, 2017, Nintendo has sold 2.3 million NES Classic Edition.

Led by Dr. Meredith Clark, the study is a move towards filling the prominent gap in news research around how underserved communities engage with news. From lack of editorial oversight to racist and gendered abuse in comment spaces, communities around journalism have not served women and gender non-conforming/non-binary people of color well, if at all, researchers said. They added that improving diversity in news has focused almost entirely on representation within the newsroom; while that is certainly a necessary part of improving how journalism can serve more people, this study seeks to address equally fundamental questions around how and where underserved people engage with news in the English language. Volunteers must self-identify as a woman or gender non-binary/non-conforming, and as a person of color; be 18 or older; and read news online in the English language. Potential participants will be sent a follow-up survey to confirm eligibility. Focus groups will be conducted remotely online in English and may involve follow-up interviews. Participants will receive a $25 Amazon or WalMart gift card for volunteering their time, and the data collected by the study will be anonymized and used by The Coral Project to inform the creation of more inclusive commenting experiences. The study will also be shared publicly. Applications are available online, as well as a consent form. Email Sydette Harry at sydette@mozillafoundation.org to learn more. The Coral Project is a unique collaboration between the Mozilla Foundation, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, funded by a grant from the John S. and James L.

By Stewart Yerton / About 21 hours ago It’s prime Honolulu real estate. Anchored by bustling big box discount retailers and bordered by the luxe Ala Moana Center, the parcel lies in the shadow of gleaming luxury condo towers not far from Ala Moana Beach Park. It’s one of the most vibrant parts of the city, where the unemployment rate is close to zero. But don’t say that to the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism — or the developer of the Hawaii City Plaza Project slated to be built on two parcels on Sheridan Street in the middle of this booming area. The developer, Jay Fang, hopes to finance a 26-story condominium tower using a federal incentive program designed to encourage foreign investment in economically distressed areas. The proposed Hawaii City Plaza Project at 710 Sheridan St. near Ala Moana Center is raising money through a federal program for economically distressed areas. The unemployment rate there is less than 1 percent. Google The program lets foreign nationals invest as little as $500,000 to create jobs in areas designated as having high unemployment or struggling. In exchange they obtain a visa known as an EB-5, which allows holders to become permanent residents and provides a path to citizenship. The census tract where Fang’s project will be located has an unemployment rate of only 0.8 percent. But to pass muster with the EB-5 requirements, Fang includes his parcel in a “targeted employment area” that stretches from the edge of Waikiki to rural Makua Valley, an area with double-digit unemployment. Fang wants to build a mixed-use development with 163 residential condominium units, 313 parking spaces for motor vehicles and 163 parking spaces for bicycles within a quarter-mile of the future transit station in the Ala Moana Center. An artist’s rendering of the proposed Hawaii City Plaza project near Ala Moana Center that will include 163 condominium units. Hawaii City Plaza But far from applauding Fang’s project, members of the City Council’s Committee on Zoning and Housing on Thursday grilled Fang with tough questions about using the federal program to raise money for the project. Normally under the EB-5 program, investors must spend $1 million to be eligible for their EB-5 visa. But if the project is in a “targeted employment area,” investors only need to spend $500,000. So how does Fang’s project qualify for the discount residency? The Sheridan Street parcels are at the tail end of a gecko-shaped area that winds across Oahu from Ala Moana along the general route of the proposed Honolulu rapid transit line to Kunia before expanding into areas with double-digit unemployment, like Waianae, Makaha and Makua. This map was created by the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism.  The combined unemployment rates in the census tracts averaged out to 8.1 percent in 2015, or 153 percent of the national average for the time period, DBEDT director Luis Salaveria wrote in a letter to Fang’s company, California Investment Regional Center. DBEDT’s targeted employment area meanders across Oahu encompassing areas with high unemployment and Sheridan Street, which has an unemployment rate of less than 1 percent Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism “My department hereby designates this area is a Targeted Employment Area for the purposes of the EB-5 program,” Salaveria wrote. So Fang’s project, located at 710 and 730 Sheridan St., qualifies even though the immediate area’s unemployment rate is miniscule, according to DBEDT. The parcels are between Keeaumoku and Piikoi streets, mauka of the Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club building. George Massengale, director of community engagement for Habitat for Humanity in Hawaii, said he had worked with EB-5 investors in rural areas of the Big Island. But he questioned applying the targeted employment area exception to a thriving part of Honolulu where unemployment is practically nil. “It wouldn’t make sense to me,” he said. “It defeats the purpose” of the exception to EB-5’s standard $1 million investment requirement. Council Members Skeptical Members of Zoning and Housing Committee on Thursday sharply questioned Fang on another aspect of the proposal: whether the EB-5 investors would merely be equity investors in the development or whether they would also be buying units in the proposed condominium tower. Fang said the units would be marketed to Hawaii residents. But Councilwoman Kymberly Marcos Pine, the committee chair, expressed incredulity at that statement, noting Fang had said during a previous committee meeting that he had already sold many units to investors in China. Councilman Ikaika Anderson echoed Pine, saying he understood Fang to say 60 units have been sold to people in China. “Have 60 percent of the units been sold?” Anderson asked. “Is the project being marketed overseas? We need to understand all of that.” At a time when Hawaii is facing a housing shortage, Anderson said it does not make sense to support a transit-oriented development project that would be aimed at people from outside of Hawaii. Fang was clear Thursday saying that the EB-5 investors would receive only immigration visas for their investment. However, he added that they would receive their initial investment back at the end of five years with no interest, and then could buy units like anyone else. Fang continued to raise eyebrows when he told council members that he did not plan to use union labor to build the tower. Fang said he’s offering to donate $2 million to the Honolulu rail project as a community benefit  in exchange for not using union workers.  He said union labor costs $70-$80 an hour versus $30 an hour for non-union workers. After being questioned, Fang told the council that he would be willing to use union labor as “a community benefit.” Councilman Joey Manahan replied, “I don’t think the unions would see that as a community benefit.” After the meeting, Fang said in an interview that he believes council members misunderstood his previous comments about selling units to Chinese investors. The federal Immigrant Investor Program was created by Congress in 1990 to stimulate the U.S. economy. There were 157 EB-5 immigrant investors and their families in Hawaii between 2009 and 2014, according to a January 2017 report by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The national total was 16,946, the report said. According to a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service, which administers the program, there are 10,000 EB-5 immigrant visas available nationwide annually. After the meeting Councilwoman Ann Kobayashi was optimistic about the parcel’s prospects, even if Fang’s project does not work out. “I was looking forward to having the area cleaned up,” she said. “If it’s not going to work out, we’ll just move on and find someone who’ll make it work.” Follow Civil Beat on Facebook and Twitter.

Asda is selling premium bottles of the fruity beverage - and the deals are doing down a storm. Shoppers can get their hands on Bulmers or Magners. 500ml bottles of both brands are setting customers back 28p or 32p respectively. The deals were spotted by savvy users of HotUKDeals. "WOW... I've just ordered 74 bottles/cans for £25.12, I have no idea where i'm going to store them or how to tell the wife and i'm not even sure I like cider. Still can't turn my back on a good bargain" wrote one user. Another added: "Looks like I'll be drinking Bulmers pear cider this weekend!" "Thank you love this stuff and the Kopparberg," another wrote. Click here for the Asda website. Read More Why you may want to stop drinking cider IMMEDIATELY Unfortunately, some customers have reported the items are unavailable when they have tried to check out, suggesting the Walmart-owned supermarket has sold out. The news follows the revelation the supermarket was shifting eight cans for less than £4 today. Thatchers normally sells at around four for £4 or £5 and shoppers have been seen taking trolley loads of the goods, which are less than half price. Click here for the Asda website. Elsewhere, new research has found that draught cider is the dirtiest drink you can order in a bar. This is all down to beer lines between the cellar and the pump, experts say, with pipes often overlooked. It makes for bad reading for cider lovers. Research by Cask Marque, an independent accreditation scheme, examined 22,000 of British pubs. The researchers used 220,000 smart devices fitted onto beer taps to gauge how clean your pint is. And the results are pretty shocking for fans of fruit-based tipples. Cider was most frequently served through “unclean” lines, experts discovered. Worryingly for cider fans, 44 per cent of the pipes fell below Cask Marque standards.

Environment chief Erik Solheim said on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce as early as next week whether he will take the United States out of the climate pact, having vowed during his campaign to "cancel the Paris Climate Agreement" within 100 days of becoming president. "There is no doubt where the future is and that is what all the private sector companies have understood," Solheim told Reuters in Geneva. "The future is green," he said. "Obviously if you are not a party to the Paris agreement, you will lose out. And the main losers of course will be the people of the United States itself because all the interesting, fascinating new green jobs would go to China and to the other parts of the world that are investing heavily in this." The world has now passed its "peak oil" stage, the Norwegian-born Solheim said, and was rapidly moving into the age of solar and wind. The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit planetary warming by cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases from burning fossil fuels. "Wind engineer is now probably the most promising job opportunity in the United States," Solheim said, adding that China and India were bringing the price of solar down so fast that coal was no longer competitive. GREEN REVOLUTION Solheim's new target is pollution, with plastic in the oceans expected to equal the weight of fish by 2050. But with science, mobilised citizens, regulated markets, and the enormous power of business, such huge problems could be solved, he said. The green revolution is being led by iconic firms such as Google, Walmart, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, so the momentum does not depend on Washington, Solheim said. "Even if the worst were to happen and the United States were to withdraw, the consequences would be much less than people think," he said. Political leadership would shift to the European Union, China and India, and the U.N. is already talking to them about meeting the funding gap if the United States steps back - not only from the climate deal but U.N. funding in general. "We definitely want to ask the Senate and the U.S. Congress to keep as much of the U.S. contribution as possible to the U.N. and to the climate work. If they drastically reduce we would for sure ask others to step up and provide more money," he said. However the U.N. also needed to be more efficient. "It's not all that bad that there is some scrutiny. We are happy to work with the Trump administration on how to make the United Nations more efficient," Solheim said. "And if they cut down, which we encourage them not to do, we will also rationalise."

By LaurenSchwahn This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Tickets to concerts, plays, movies: you could live without them, but saving money shouldn’t mean sucking the fun out of life. Here’s how to curb your entertainment spending without giving up your favorite pastimes. 1. Trim your services Explore different pricing options for the services you already have. Take steps to lower your internet and cable bills, such as negotiating, downgrading your plans or bundling the two. 2. Seek an alternative to cable If trimming won’t save you enough, cut the cord completely. Based on the average cable bill cost, this could put upward of $100 back in your pocket each month. Axing cable doesn’t mean you’ll be starved for content. If you can survive without watching networks like CNN and AMC live, streaming services such as Netflix NFLX, -0.41% and Amazon Prime Video feature movies, TV and original series libraries. If you must have extra channels, consider replacing your traditional cable package with a service like Sling TV, which offers live TV for a fraction of the cost of cable. Looking to save even more? If you subscribe to multiple streaming services, such as Netflix and Hulu, drop the one you use less often. 3. Share memberships Split the cost of a paid membership with a friend or relative. For example, Amazon Prime memberships cost $99 a year, but members can share benefits with another adult for no extra charge by creating an Amazon Household. This gives both parties access to free movie and TV streaming, Prime shipping and Kindle books for about $50 each. Or you can cut your Costco COST, -1.23%  membership fee in half by sharing with a spouse or roommate. Members receive a free household card that they can share with another person over 18 years old who lives at the same address. 4. Shop wholesale clubs Wholesale clubs, such as Costco and Sam’s Club, have an abundance of affordable entertainment. They sell discounted movie and theme park tickets, restaurant gift cards and more in bulk, which is helpful, especially if you’re shopping for multiple people. You’ll also find inexpensive electronics, books, movies and games. 5. Get a library card With a public library card in hand, the entertainment world is your oyster: You don’t have to buy, or even rent, to get your fix. Use your library card to surf the web or check out movies, books, audiobooks, games and music for free. 6. Attend free events Take advantage of street fairs, concerts in the park or other free happenings in your community. Some venues that normally charge admission — such as museums, zoos and aquariums — host free-entry days once a month. Next time you plan a dinner out or hit the bars, look for joints that feature live music or comedy shows. Check your local newspaper, coffee shop or university for a list of upcoming events. 7. Volunteer If the sporting event or concert isn’t free, you still might be able to attend at no cost by volunteering at the venue. Just be aware that you might not fully enjoy the event if you’re busy checking tickets or collecting trash. 8. Ask about discounts Identification is all some people need to save money. Seniors, students and members of the military — or their families — often qualify for discounts at retailers, movie theaters, theme parks, national parks and restaurants. Kids often receive discounted admissions well. If who you are doesn’t cut it, your membership status might. For example, AAA and AARP memberships come with savings benefits. Ask if you’re eligible for special rates when making entertainment purchases. 9. Buy used Save serious money by buying televisions, tablets, computers, movies and videogames secondhand. Shop thrift stores and used book stores, and check retailers like Best Buy BBY, +1.47% and Wal-Mart WMT, +0.21% for refurbished tech. 10. Use credit card perks Under the right circumstances, plastic is more budget-friendly than cash. Your credit card might offer points or cash back on tickets to the theater or sporting events, electronics purchases and other entertainment-related transactions. Certain cards give exclusive discounts on or early access to event tickets through partnerships and promotions. 11. Cut back An obvious way to save on entertainment without giving up your “wants” entirely is to adjust your budget and set a lower spending limit for entertainment expenses. For instance, rent a movie every other week instead of weekly, or refrain from buying the latest gaming console if your old one still works.
