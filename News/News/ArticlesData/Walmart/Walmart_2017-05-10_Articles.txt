Walmart, the largest grocer in the U.S., is launching its online grocery pickup service today in Joplin at the Walmart Supercenter location at 1501 S. Range Line Rd., and at the Walmart Neighborhood Market location at 25145 DeMott Dr. The free service enables customers to order groceries online and pick them up at their local Walmart store without even leaving their cars. “At Walmart, we have always been known for saving our customers money and, with services like grocery pickup, we are also saving them valuable time,” said Joe Huber, local eCommerce Market Coach. “Our customers have told us that grocery pickup is a game changer. They are now able to complete their grocery shopping in a matter of minutes – between errands or on their way home from an after-school activity – without even unbuckling their seat belts.” Walmart’s grocery pickup service features 30,000 items, with more than 90 percent of customers choosing to add fresh meat, dairy or produce to their baskets. Other top items selected by grocery pickup shoppers include after-school snacks, diapers and large dog food bags. All items are priced at the same low prices customers find in their local Walmart stores. How it Works * Order and Choose a Pickup Time: Customers visit walmart.com/grocery online or through the Walmart Grocery mobile app, enter their zip codes to select a local store and begin creating their shopping lists. During checkout, they select a time to pick up their orders. * Personal Grocery Shoppers Fill the Basket: Highly-trained personal shoppers carefully select the freshest produce, meats and other items each customer requested. * Pick Up and Go: Once a customer arrives at the pickup location, there will be reserved parking spaces marked in orange and a designated number to call to alert an associate. An associate will quickly retrieve the prepared order and load it into the customer’s car. Quality Guaranteed Walmart always guarantees the quality of the food being picked up or purchased in store through its Freshness Guarantee for meat, produce and bakery items. If customers aren’t satisfied with an item, they simply bring back the receipt for a full refund.

The note detailed long hours, beatings and malnourishment of workers at a prison in the Chinese region of Guangxi, according to the customer’s family, who contacted local media. Similar notes found by customers in imported merchandise have raised questions about forced labor used in supply chains making brands sold at major retail stores. Wal-Mart on Wednesday said it was investigating. “We’re making contact with the customer and appreciate her bringing this to our attention. With the information we have, we are looking into what happened so we can take the appropriate actions,” Ragan Dickens, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said in an e-mail to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The customer told local media late last month that the note was hand-written in Chinese but she had it translated into English three times. According to KVOA.com News in Tucson, Arizona, the note read, in part: “Inmates in the Yingshan Prison in Guangxi, China are working 14 hours daily with no break/rest at noon, continue working overtime until 12 midnight, and whoever doesn’t finish his work will be beaten.” Prisoners are treated worse than “horse cow goat pig dog,” it read. Wal-Mart’s website details the company’s efforts to keep its supply chains free of forced labor and human trafficking. “We are working to improve transparency, empower workers and drive compliance,” it says. In a similar case, in 2014 a woman found a message in a Saks Fifth Avenue shopping bag from a man saying he was forced to work long hours at a Chinese prison factory. The worker was tracked down, and the note deemed legitimate. He was later released. In 2012 a Kmart shopper reported finding a letter at his local U.S. store from a worker also describing harrowing work conditions in China.

Voltaire Short (relatively) and sweet: the Biggest Lie is as old as the Constitution, that America is a land of equality and liberty and a democracy. - Advertisement - Fact 1: Of all advanced nations, the US is the most unequal. The 6 Walmart heirs who created nothing and do not work, have more wealth than 100 million Americans. Of the working poor, 1/3 are so badly paid they qualify for food stamps, which gives them $4.20 a day for their 3 square meals. If you work for Walmart, you have to apply for welfare to feed yourself and your family. Originally, 50 years ago Sam Walton had a buy-America policy and 95% of his merchandise was American made. Today Walmart buys 95% Chinese. Fact 2: A good measure of liberty is how many people are walking around free and how many are locked up. The US has the largest population of prisoners and the highest rate of incarceration in the world. By this objective standard, we are the least free nation. - Advertisement - Also, debt is a form of slavery, and the average US household now has $16,000 credit card debt, $28,000 auto debt, $50,000 student debt, and $172,000 mortgage debt for a total of over $250,000 total debt. By comparison, most Russians (80%) own their homes and have no mortgage debt. Fact 3: The US is not and never was a democracy. The Constitution was written by 95% slave owners and the first 7 Presidents were slave owners, Washington being the largest slave owner, and Jefferson being the next largest, both being in the top of slave owners. pinnochio (Image by craigCloutier)   Permission   Details   DMCA Because these slave owners (many of whom had opposed the American Revolution, justified by the principles of equality and consent of the governed) wanted to control the new nation, and because they were in the minority they devised several means to allow the minority to rule as they feared democracy and equality. The Senate voting scheme now allows Montana and Wyoming, with a combined 3% of the population of California, to have twice as many Senators and votes. Rural, conservative states with less than 15% of the population can block the will of the 85% represented by more urban states. Thus the slave owners in the South, with a minority of citizens, used the Senate scheme, as well as counting slaves as 3/5th of a person in the census for determining Representative in Congress. The census also determines the votes in the Electoral College, which is able to overturn the vote of the public as a firewall by the elite against the rule by majority. Bush II and Trump being recent examples of the Electoral College blocking democratic rule, equality, and consent of the governed. - Advertisement - Thus the Constitution betrayed the stated founding principles of equality and consent and instead created an oligarchy of slave owners. A good source for this history is Jensen's classic The New Nation. When slavery was abolished, the new oligarchy was composed of bankers and other large corporations, which continues to this day. The Trump regime now has 6 Goldman-Sachs alumni in key positions running the country. First Chief Justice, Founding Father, and slave owner John Jay betrayed his favoring of corporate fascism when he said, "The country should be run by those who own it."

Today most of us are slaves to the banks, who not only run the government but the Deep State, through a revolving door with the Deep State going back to Dulles.

You have just now confirmed by your own admission everything Eustace Mullins dedicated his life to uncovering and exposing more than 50 years ago. You now stand shoulder to shoulder with him. Side by side. You have finally stated the same thing Eustace Mullins declared in his book Secrets Of The Federal Reserve a half century ago. Now if only you can dig deeper to further expose what you have just now claimed. Now expose who the banksters are. Name them. Put faces on them for everyone here to read.

See my Novemeber article: Trump is the Stalking Horse for the latest Coup: Oil,9/11, the Deep State, and Wall St. Why don't you name the names? I am sick of your absurd demands. I do not stand shoulder to shoulder with your Nazi hero. He can go f*ck himself. For him, the banks are part of Jewish conspiracy. I totally reject that bullshit. I stand with people like Peter Dale Scott and DAvid Kinzer, people who hate fascism I really wish you would quit bothering me. You give off the stench of Nazi anti-Semitism in your virulent strain of fascism. Fire liberal teachers, expel Jewish journalists, read Nazi authors. f*ck that noise... My views are clear. If you want to punch out names, do so; the problem is not names but institutions. Hitler promoted cancer research. It does not make a person a Nazi if they also promote cancer research. Eustace Mullins was a white racist who loved Hitler. He's your hero, not mine. No please, if you want to name names, do so but I beg of you, stop pestering me. You pretend to know the deeper truth and constantly, 10 posts in one thread, attack me for not knowing it. Say what you have to say and leave me out of it. To me, you reek of fascism. I want nothing to do with you and your Nazi heroes. Leave me the f*ck alone....

Truth! In 2009, a screenwriting partner of mine, the British director Vadim Jean, directed an award winning documentary entitled, "In the Land of the Free." Narrated by Samueal L. Jackson, it focused on an american horror story: the plight of three Black Panthers who have spent an average of 39 years each in solitary confinement at Angola Prison, a former slave plantation. Thirty-Nine years...each. I cannot imagine anything anyone could conceive that so graphicaly symbolizes america's surfiet of immorality and its success at immuring us on an island of lies. The establishment's media created opacity has had americans groping toward memetic chaos...and the DNC is at the head of the conga line.

Christopher McInturff, 33, 209 Cherokee Road, was charged with attempted theft over $1,000 and shoplifting under $1,000. The victim, who was not named in the news release, told police she found her truck pried and with broken windows at the Walmart at 2914 W. Market St. McInturff was arrested after police determined he had shoplifted a tool from Walmart and used it to try to break into the vehicle, according to a news release. He has since been sent to the Washington County Detention Center, where he was held on $16,000 bond. His arraignment in Sessions Court was set for Wednesday. Tuesday was not the first time McInturff had been arrested from a situation at the West Market Walmart. In March, he was charged with motor vehicle theft, felony evading arrest, a habitual motor offender violation and reckless driving after a series of events that also began in the Walmart parking lot.

Fiji Time: 7:00 PM on Thursday 11 May Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Bribery probe Reuters Thursday, May 11, 2017 WAL-MART Stores Inc is preparing to pay about $300 million ($F633.8m) to settle a probe of bribery by its employees in markets including Mexico, India and China, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal, which would mark a significant concession by the US government, was being finalised and could change, the Bloomberg report said. In October 2016, Wal-Mart rebuffed a proposal by US prosecutors to pay at least $600m ($F1,26 billion) to settle the same corruption probe. Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt declined to comment on the story. Last week , Wal-Mart told Reuters it was considering getting certified under a new international program that could help companies defend themselves against isolated cases of corruption or poor business practices. The proposed resolution would require a guilty plea by at least one Wal-Mart subsidiary, but the parent company would not be charged, the report said. The US Department of Justice has been conducting a long-running investigation into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart in some overseas markets, including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. Wal-Mart's ethics and compliance system came into focus after the New York Times reported in 2012 that Wal-Mart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Wal-Mart de Mexico business. So far Wal-Mart has spent more than $800m on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world.

Photos Videos Topics Live PAK 169/2 (69) - WI (Yet to bat) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kapil Mishra Emmanuel Macron Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 Bahubali 2 News World News Walmart looking into note found recounting forced labor in China Shares1 Thu, 11 May 2017-03:43am , Reuters By Sebastien Malo NEW YORK, May 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Giant U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Wednesday it is looking into the origins of a note describing forced labor conditions in China that a customer claimed to find in a purse bought at a store in Arizona. The note detailed long hours, beatings and malnourishment of workers at a prison in the Chinese region of Guangxi, according to the customer's family who contacted local media. Similar notes found by customers in imported merchandise have raised questions about forced labor used in supply chains making brands sold at major retail stores. Globally, nearly 21 million people are estimated to be victims of forced labor, according to the International Labour Organization. Wal-Mart on Wednesday said it was investigating. "We're making contact with the customer and appreciate her bringing this to our attention. With the information we have, we are looking into what happened so we can take the appropriate actions," Ragan Dickens, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said in an e-mail to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The customer told local media late last month that the note was hand-written in Chinese but she had it translated into English three times. According to KVOA.com News in Tucson, Arizona, the note read, in part: "Inmates in the Yingshan Prison in Guangxi, China are working 14 hours daily with no break/rest at noon, continue working overtime until 12 midnight, and whoever doesn't finish his work will be beaten. Prisoners are treated worse than "horse cow goat pig dog," it read. Wal-Mart's website details the company's efforts to keep its supply chains free of forced labor and human trafficking. "We are working to improve transparency, empower workers and drive compliance," it says. In a similar case, in 2014 a woman found a message in a Saks Fifth Avenue shopping bag from a man saying he was forced to work long hours at a Chinese prison factory. The worker was tracked down, and the note deemed legitimate. He was later released. In 2012 a Kmart shopper reported finding a letter at his local U.S. store from a worker also describing harrowing work conditions in China.

This year, it offered studied in construction management, health services, creative arts and information technology. In the fall, it will add strands in culinary arts and global business. Part of a network of 26 schools with similar programs nationwide, Ignite mixes technical training with professional development and business education, said program director Teresa Hudson. She discussed the IT portion of the program during the Northwest Arkansas Tech Council’s monthly meeting at luncheon on Wednesday (May 10). “We don’t want them just to sit down and learn Java like in a traditional classroom. We want to see the cutting-edge programming that’s going on and let them learn it, and let them dig deep into that,” Hudson said. Two-hundred students are enrolled in Ignite for the 2017-18 school year. That’s the double the number in 2016-17. In the IT strand, there were 15 participants this year and 18 signed up for next year. Students spend two and a half hours of their day in the Ignite program, and their work is off-campus and includes time as an intern at local businesses. Wal-Mart Stores, for example, took on eight Ignite IT interns for 2016-17. Adithya Sreekumar and Gillian Dirkson were two of those. Sreekumar works at least 10 hours per week at Walmart. He said the students are treated like employees, and he is one of three who have expressed interest in continuing their career at Walmart. “I can honestly say after the six months I had at Walmart developing applications I learned more than I did in three years of programming classes at high school,” Sreekumar said. “A lot of times they just teach you the language, they don’t teach you a lot of real-world applications to it. At Walmart, we’re building a real app and bringing it to production.” The company is looking for opportunities for them, Sreekumar said. He hopes to work part-time in the retailer’s IT department during his senior year. After that, he plans to study computer science at the University of Arkansas. Dirkson said the Walmart intern group worked on several projects and learned a variety of skills, including how to use Google search to its fullest potential. (from left) Faith Pearrow, the only girl enrolled for Ignite’s information technology program for 2017-18, and Gillian Dirkson and Adithya Sreekumar, current participants in the program, discuss its benefits at a Northwest Arkansas Tech Council meeting. “A lot of people don’t know it’s a real skill. If you know how to really Google you can find a lot of information,” Dirkson said. Earlier this year, she also redesigned the Bentonville Public Schools Foundation website. In the fall, she plans to attend the University of Tennessee, where she will major in computer science with a concentration on artificial intelligence, the crux of several projects she has worked on during her internship at Walmart. The entire Ignite IT group also takes on a great deal of nonprofit and community service work, said instructor John Mark Russell. For example, the students visited an assisted living facility and acted as “tech gurus,” helping the residents learn to use their devices. AFTER IGNITE Castle Kerr, a former Ignite student, is now studying web development at NorthWest Arkansas Community College. He also does freelance work for local companies. While in the program, he built an e-commerce site for Hart Tackle and worked on the NWA Fitness & Health’s SuperFit Campaign, which encouraged Bentonville students to electronically track their health habits, with prizes for positive behaviors. He came into Ignite last school year knowing only Java. In addition to learning new programming languages through Ignite, “I learned how to teach myself,” he said. Some students from the inaugural year of the program have found work. RevUnit, a software solutions company in Bentonville, hired two Ignite alums. Each was taken on as an intern and subsequently hired full-time. Chief Technology Officer Michael Paladino said their lack of college education does not affect their standing at the company, but he has encouraged them to obtain a degree at some point, in order to open up more opportunities at other places. PROGRAM DIVERSITY One goal for Ignite is to improve diversity in the program. About 15% of 200 Ignite students enrolled for next year fall within the economically disadvantaged category. Of the 18 enrolled in the IT program for next year, there is only one girl. Dirkson, as a female IT student, said she does not identify with the lack of female interest in computer science. “I don’t understand what the problem is. I love it,” she said. Dirkson discussed the diversity issue with a program director of the CAPS program, an initiative that helped inspire Ignite, in Kansas City and came to the conclusion that the solution is threefold: start trying to reach female students at a younger age, work to reduce stigma and bias and “get parents behind it.” When Dirkson was in ninth grade and made known her interest in programming, her mother was supportive of the idea, researched the subject and tapped into a wide range of online resources that helped her learn, including Code.org, the Computer Science Network and Codecademy to help nurture her passions — a key requirement to participate in Ignite. Hudson said it requires independent learning, so in reviewing applications for the program, she looks at “passion for the field” more than grade point average. In fact, it has turned around the academic careers of some students, she said. In some circumstances, attendance increased and grades improved. “Now, they have a purpose for coming,” she said.

 How Amazon is crushing rivals like Walmart in a burgeoning tech war over the future of retail Jeffrey Dastin, Reuters May 10, 2017, 2:12 PM 1,495 facebook linkedin twitter email print Amazon CO Jeff BezosGetty Earlier this year, engineers at Walmart who track rivals' prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly stopped working. Losing access to Amazon's data was no small matter. Like most big retailers, Walmart relies on computer programs that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents can mean losing a sale. But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs - known commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. "Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard," said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. A Walmart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any "campaign" to stop them. "Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site," she said. Still, she said, "we prioritize humans over bots as needed." Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Walmart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars. The company's technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said. Brave new world Amazon's new bookstore in Chicago.Daniel McMahon/Business Insider Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals' pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for even 20 minutes. "That’s like a lifetime during Christmas," said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. "If we're not decently priced, we'll see it almost immediately" in sales declines. Disguised as humans Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public websites - a process known as crawling or scraping - has many purposes. Alphabet's Google, for example, constantly crawls the web to gather information for its search engine results and to sell ads. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers.  To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's known as a "CAPTCHA" - typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. "It is an arms race," said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. "Every week or every month, there's some new approach from both sides." Amazon's maneuver that halted Walmart in January took aim at a specialized web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers - a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Walmart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major U.S. retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently - a De'Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer's website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon's price for the De'Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16. Swarming with bots FILE PHOTO: A zoomed illustration image of a man looking at a computer monitor showing the logo of Amazon is seen in ViennaThomson Reuters Despite Amazon's capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80 percent of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites. In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Walmart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Wal-Mart employees said. Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organize rivals' data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one U.S. patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its web pages. "Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it," said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. That "isn't the case for most retailers." Read the original article on Reuters. Copyright 2017. Follow Reuters on Twitter.

Trader Joe’s was a close second and H-E-B ranked third among 12,700 U.S. shoppers surveyed. Publix and Wegman’s tied, scoring 77% on Market Forces Customer Loyalty Index. Publix located in the Southeast moved up to first place from second which it held for the past four years. This is the second year New York-based Wegman’s earned the top grade after it unseated Trader Joe’s last year. Consumers gave Trader Joe’s a loyalty score of 76%. Texas-based H-E-B moved into the top three for the first time with 69%. ALDI and Harris Teeter rounded out the top five at 68% and 66%, respectively. Bentonville-based Wal-Mart was at the bottom of the favorite list with a loyalty metric of 31%. Sam’s Club fared better at 49%. Kroger and Target were in the middle of the pack with loyalty metrics at 58% and 57%, respectively. The survey asked shoppers to rank stores on their cleanliness and courtesy of workers. Publix ranked the cleanest and Trader Joe’s was deemed the most courteous. Despite Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran’s mission to rate stores on “Clean, Fast & Friendly” scores for the past three years, Wal-Mart did not rank in the top 15 any of those three areas. Publix ranked first in four of the seven metrics shoppers measured: Fast checkouts, item availability, ease of finding items and store cleanliness. ALDI won the top spot on value by 87% of those surveyed. Wal-Mart ranked sixth in the value area at 58%, and Sam’s Club was fifth at 69%. Trader Joe’s took the top spot in cashier courtesy at 82% and Publix was next at 77%, Wegman’s was third at 70% and Whole Foods and ALDI tied for fourth place at 68%. Market Force also asked shoppers to rank retailers on new trends in grocery shopping.  More than half (58%) said they prefer shopping for local and organic choices of meat, produce and dairy products. Half also said they prefer organic when given a choice and 93% had purchased organic products in the past month. The most popular organic purchase is produce, followed by meat and dairy. Walmart U.S. has expanded its organic produce offerings over the past two year and re-configured produce areas of new stores and remodels so the expanded organic items are easily spotted by shoppers. Another area consumers say is important to them is convenience. Increasingly, shoppers are filling up their shopping carts online rather than in the store. Market Force found services such as click-and-collect (buy online and pick up at store) and online ordering with home delivery are being embraced across all age groups, particularly millennials. Wal-Mart came out on top in this area, followed by Kroger, Sam’s Club and Harris Teeter. The use of click-and-collect has more than doubled since 2016, with 9% saying they’ve tried it, compared to 4% in 2016. Of those, 78% were satisfied or very satisfied with the experience. About 26% of the shoppers using click and collect are frequent users, taking advantage of the service at least monthly. Home delivery services are also growing in popularity – 18% said they’ve used grocery home delivery, compared to 15% in 2016. Most are using the service through general online retailers such as Amazon and Jet (now owned by Wal-Mart). However, 20% were less than satisfied with the experience, leaving ample room for improvement.

Seattle-based Amazon recently lowered the free shipping threshold to $25 for non-Prime members, compared to $35 offered by Wal-Mart. Amazon is dabbling in brick and mortar with a seamless convenience model. Wal-Mart also is experimenting with convenience formats offering customers mealtime solutions and a plethora of beverages to go. Wal-Mart recently applied for a patent that will allow the retailer to track how products are used once consumers take them home. This technology is one up on Amazon’s Dash button because it will allow Wal-Mart to automatically reorder items from milk to baby diapers on behalf of the customer when the products start to run low. It also can track how frequently a product is used. For instance Wal-Mart would be able to tell how often a person drives their car and estimate the wear of the tire tread. The same could apply for shoes or work boots. Having this knowledge would give the retailer the opportunity to prompt consumers to replace items showing wear and tear, while also offering suggestions and special promotions. Amazon Dash is already in use and allows customers to push a button to reorder when the time is right. Wal-Mart recently added another feature to its mobile app to help customers who shop for groceries online or in stores with a simple reorder button. For customers who shop in stores and scan their receipts into the Savings Catcher App, those items appear online when the customer logs into Walmart.com. In markets where grocery pickup is offered, consumers build a shopping list by simply clicking on the items they want which is curated from recent shopping trips. The online basket can be filled much quicker and the order can be picked up at a location and time of their choosing. Walmart U.S. e-commerce CEO Marc Lore said this change is about saving customers time when they order groceries online. The biggest complaint among online grocery users is the time it takes to place an order. THE WAL-MART AND TARGET INTERACTION Wal-Mart is also taking some plays from Amazon with the recent specialty retail acquisitions such as ModCloth, ShoeBuy and Moosejaw. Amazon owns Zappos, having also acquired Pets.com and Quidsi – formerly Diapers.com. Amazon is also meeting with suppliers about offering more proprietary branded items such as apparel and home furnishings. Wal-Mart already has numerous private label merchandise on everything from Marketplace salsa to Danskin active wear. Anderson said it’s a too early to know how if Wal-Mart will have the patience and conviction to stick with product and process pilot programs for the long-term. Anderson also said the tit-for-tat strategy is not new to retail. He said prior to Amazon’s rise, Wal-Mart and Target for 20 years played a similar chess game. He said Wal-Mart is trying lots of things, as they did against Target. Not too long ago Wal-Mart’s Project Impact was an attempt to declutter the stores, streamline merchandise offerings and look more Target. That proved disastrous for Wal-Mart and it took several years to unwind the damage. “Some things just don’t fit and these retailers won’t follow in that case,” Anderson said. For instance he said Amazon is dabbling in brick and mortar but there is no way it will ever have the store fleet that Wal-Mart does. Similarly Wal-Mart recently tried a subscription to guarantee free shipping for online orders, but that was short-lived because it’s not a good fit for Wal-Mart, who eventually just lowered the cost for everyone and abandoned the subscription model dubbed Walmart ShippingPass. SEEKING A ‘DESTABILIZATION’ EFFECT Anderson said Lore, now running the e-commerce business, brings an outside perspective and compelling point of view on Amazon, having worked there after he sold Quidsi/Diapers.com to Amazon in 2011 for $545 million. He said Lore will tweak Walmart.com where it’s necessary, but not force changes just for the sake of change. Walmart.com wants to be a leader for the lowest cost online which is likely why they lowered free shipping fees and started giving pickup in-store discount. Anderson said Walmart.com doesn’t need to be No. 1 in e-commerce in terms of size, but it does need to be No. 2. “Perhaps Wal-Mart thinks there are enough households that haven’t gone to online shopping and these recent perks will help the retailer pick up some of that untapped market. I don’t see the competition as clear cut-throat with Amazon,” Anderson said. “We are watching to see if Wal-Mart’s tactics have an impact on Prime members. Wal-Mart is big enough to have a destabilization effect on Amazon, but not detrimental given Amazon’s ability to innovate and move quickly.” He said many of the moves made by Amazon and answered by Wal-Mart and vice versa are necessary in the near term to maintain their shopper base in the challenging retail environment. He said some economic models of online retailer’s today aren’t favorable but they are what consumers prefer. Anderson said Amazon has the cash it needs to continue to innovate and invest in giving consumers what they want. Anderson expects to see Amazon and Wal-Mart masquerade as the other at times as they try and figure out what works. In the longer term he said Wal-Mart and Amazon will eventually grab their own identities and operational models. For Wal-Mart he said Lore looks to be given the latitude needed to make big moves. “Lore seems to have a clear point of view what the opportunities are for Wal-Mart and he’s accelerating the action. It’s too early to see if it’s yielding any results but he does have a hypothesis on how Wal-Mart can win and that’s a positive for the retail giant,” Anderson added. MODEL DISRUPTION Clint Lazenby, consultant with #OnShelf, said Amazon and Wal-Mart are each trying to protect market share which is why the moves go back and forth like a chess game. “With Amazon’s significant number of households enrolled as Prime members and knowing the advantages Amazon accrues from this puts them in a position of not wanting to give those shoppers a reason to question the perceived value their membership delivers. Therefore Amazon needs to ensure they are matching Wal-Mart on the visible/transactional costs the consumer is getting inundated with and can compare at checkout,” Lazenby said. “It suggests they will strive to match Wal-Mart move to move to stay aligned and keep shoppers satisfied and continue to convert and hold in the Prime program while continuing to bolt-on additional services in the future.” He said Wal-Mart is likely exploring ways of disrupting the Amazon success model by offering interesting pricing options as they continue to leverage their store assets, consumer trust and supply chain capabilities. “You also have to assume Wal-Mart is looking for ways to close the gap on what I call the Amazon value loop, referring to the all of the other value adds the shopper is getting as a part of their membership (music, video, etc). There are a number of unique strengths Wal-Mart has to disrupt this model and challenge Amazon with new and different value propositions for the shopper,” Lazenby noted in a statement.

By Fabiola Cineas  |  May 10, 2017 at 12:59 pm comment on this post Marc Lore. Image via Twitter. Bloomberg just released its annual best-paid executives list for 2016 and Marc Lore, Jet.com co-founder and current president and CEO of Wal-Mart’s e-commerce arm, was ranked as number one on the list. In 2016, Lore’s compensation stood at $237 million – that’s more than Apple CEO Tim Cook’s $150 million, which placed him second on the list. BizPhilly last reported on Lore in August when his company Jet.com, an Amazon competitor, was acquired by Wal-Mart for $3.3 billion. The deal still stands as the biggest purchase ever of an e-commerce startup in the U.S. and is tied to Lore’s 2016 earnings. His compensation is composed of shares that will fully vest in 2021, Bloomberg said.  Lore, 45, is an alumnus of both Bucknell University and Penn’s Wharton School of Business. His serial entrepreneurship began with the e-commerce company Quidsi that had popular subsidiaries like Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wags.com. And though the e-commerce site was a top Amazon competitor in the late 2000’s, Lore sold the company to Amazon for around $545 million in 2011. Philly’s own MentorTech Ventures invested in both Jet.com and Quidsi. Bloomberg notes that Lore’s position on the list may come as a surprise to some in light of a blog post Lore wrote two years ago titled, “Chasing Money Will Cripple Your Career.” In it, Lore explains that he doesn’t want his success to be evaluated based on his salary. Also on the list dominated by tech leaders is former Goldman Sachs banker John S. Weinberg ($124 million), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($100 million), Google CEO Sundar Pichai ($106 million) and International Business Machines Corp. CEO Virginia M. Rometty ($97 million).

Report: Amazon Blocked Walmart’s Shopping Bots From Getting Pricing Data Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Report: Amazon Blocked Walmart’s Shopping Bots From Getting Pricing Data Image courtesy of REL Waldman May 10, 2017 12:26 pm EDT By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk get outta here amazon bots walmart online shopping e-commerce prices In the crowded arena of online shopping, speed is of the essence if you want to keep up with your competitors’ prices: If you aren’t quick enough, your rival could undercut you. A new report claims that Walmart is trying its hardest to automatically track Amazon’s prices, but it’s not having much luck. Reuters reports that in January, Walmart engineers in charge of monitoring rivals’ online prices found the technology they were using to scrape Amazon.com for data wasn’t working anymore. Walmart and many other retailers use bots — automated software intended to look like an authentic web surfer to the site being scanned — to search competitors’ offerings. Some bots are programmed to throw off the scent of bot-detectors, moving the cursor around a web page in the way a human might, rather than speeding through the page like a machine who knows exactly where to click. But Amazon blocked Walmart’s bots from creeping on its online prices by putting up a digital curtain to hide its listings from users of a specialized web browser that Walmart reportedly used in its hunt for prices, insiders told Reuters. According to those people familiar with the matter, the Arkansas-based retailer’s @WalmartLabs unit couldn’t get around the blockade for weeks, which meant it had to get Amazon’s data from a secondary source. Walmart declined to comment to Reuters on the January maneuver but said that its company improves it technology regularly and uses a variety of tools to monitor prices. Amazon said it’s aware that competitors use bots, but denied any “campaign” to keep them from creeping. Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site, and we don’t have a campaign to remove bots,” Amazon said in a statement. “We know that because we have the lowest prices and the largest selection, many other retailers use our site as the gold standard — and they use bots to compare themselves to us. We prioritize humans over bots as needed to ensure we are providing the shopping experience our customers expect from Amazon.” While some online sites use CAPTCHA to trip up bots, those safeguards can be annoying to humans who are just trying to shop around, prompting retailers like Amazon to come up with new solutions. For example, one Amazon patent application [PDF] describes an encryption technology that would require bots to solve a complicated algorithm before gaining access to its Web pages, while humans wouldn’t have to do a thing.

The officers run the offender’s criminal history, and quickly find out that he has a 40-page rap sheet. Not 40 arrests; 40 pages. Will one more arrest put this guy on the straight and narrow? Or is there another route, away from prison and toward social services, that would better change behavior, reduce recidivism, protect the community, and save the taxpayers money? This was the central question under discussion Tuesday night during the Hill North Community Management Team’s monthly meeting at Career High School. The majority of the hour-and-a-half-long meeting was dedicated to a presentation by Keith Brown, director of health and harm reduction at the Katal Center for Health, Equity and Justice. Brown runs a year-old program in Albany, N.Y., called Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD), which encourages police officers to redirect low-level offenders engaged in drug abuse, prostitution, and other non-violent street crimes toward a caseworker. Instead of making an arrest, the police collaborate with the caseworker to help the offender navigate access to a variety of social services, from housing to mental healthcare to substance abuse treatment, that help stabilize his life, change his behavior, and make the community that much safer. Now the Harp administration is looking to bring LEAD to New Haven. Tuesday night’s event was part of the plan to broach the idea with the community. Earlier this year, the city called on Brown to help organize an 11-person trip to Seattle, where a diverse group of New Haveners got to take a look at how the LEAD program works in the city in which it was originally developed in 2011. On Tuesday night, Brown returned to New Haven to share anecdotes, takeaways, and key principles from his own city’s implementation of LEAD, with a focus on explaining both how the program works in general, and how the program might work in New Haven in particular. He started by telling the story of the Walmart shoplifter, who was the first person ever diverted by Albany’s LEAD program. “The first person we got in our project illustrates exactly what’s wrong with the way the current system functions,” he told the room. After the police scanned through his 40-page rap sheet, they learned that the man had a 30-bag-per-day heroin habit. He had to hustle together $300-400 every day just to avoid the debilitating sickness of withdrawal. Instead of making yet another arrest, the Albany police, who had been trained in LEAD’s harm reduction principles, called the program’s designated caseworker, who was eventually able to get the offender stable housing, an ID, medical care, and access to a methadone clinic. One year later, the initial offender had had zero new arrests. “Law enforcement often have a binary choice: to arrest a person or not to arrest a person,” Brown explained. LEAD offers a third route: diversion, away from prisons and towards the social mechanisms that are much more qualified to help with issues of mental healthcare and substance abuse. “LEAD acknowledges that behavior change takes time and that oftentimes people relapse or still engage in the same behaviors before they ultimately get better,” he continued. “It’s a pre-arrest diversion program, which means that if you engage with a case manager, you do not end up with a criminal record. In Albany, all we require is that participants complete an assessment with their caseworker within 30 days. That’s how we define engagement with the process. It’s not about somebody deciding on an arbitrary outcome that they want you to do. It’s about engaging with the process of behavior change.” Fifty-two people have gone through the Albany program since it started last year, and the city just recently added a second caseworker. The program is currently paid for by New York Department of Health harm reduction funding and by Medicaid Redesign money that is funneled to the local hospital system. Could LEAD Work in New Haven? Although LEAD programs in Seattle and Albany share the same principles and diversionary flows, Brown explained, each instance of the program is contingent on the scope and quality of community participation. In Albany, the community worked with the police from the outset to ensure that a community leadership team would have access to law enforcement data on who had been diverted, who had been arrested and not diverted, and why the police had made the decisions that they did. All of this data could also be broken down by demographics. “In Albany, African Americans make up 38 percent of the population but 68 percent of drug offenses,” Brown said. “The community demanded of LEAD: whatever you do, you should be making this better, not making this worse or keeping this the same.” Jeannia Fu, a graduate student at Yale’s School of Public Health and an advocate for the Sex Workers Allies Network (SWAN), expressed concern that New Haven’s longstanding problems with establishing an effective Civilian Review Board (CRB) pointed towards a police department that may be reluctant to participate in a program that required such open scrutiny of daily police decisions. Jane Mills of People Against Injustice (PAI) countered that court records on arrests are actually quite accessible and thorough. She agreed that New Haven city government and law enforcement must achieve new levels of openness if something like LEAD were to work here. “In New England, transparency is a tough thing,” said Mills, who has been on the city’s planning committee for LEAD for the past few months. “For this to work well, New Haven has got to get radically transparent about what they’re doing.” Mills argued that PAI would work hard to get detailed information about the city’s exploration of LEAD out to the public. Brown agreed, saying that every implementation of LEAD had to be a collaborative affair that was owned by multiple stakeholders, not just the city or the police. He said that communities have to demand access to police data, and have to be involved in shaping the program’s eligibility criteria, if the program had any chance of succeeding in a city. Hill resident Hector Miranda had a related message for Brown: Come back to this meeting, and come back often. “We expect you guys to come back so that we can talk about how this is going to work,” he said. “Every second Tuesday of the month, when this management team meets.” Caprice Taylor Mendez, a program manager at The Community Foundation for Greater New Haven, traveled to Seattle earlier in the year and who had helped organize Brown’s presentation at the management team meeting on Tuesday night. She called this presentation a first step towards bringing a harm reduction model of policing to New Haven. The next, critical steps would require constant, dedicated community collaboration. “There’s zero funding for this program right now, and we’ve been exploring it to date on a shoestring,” she said. “The Community Foundation is happy to provide some seed dollars to Cornell Scott Hill Health Center to have a part-time staffer who can start putting all these pieces together” and help facilitate communication between the community, law enforcement, the city, and various other local social service organizations. Mendez said that the Community Foundation, the Katal Center, and other relevant stakeholders will make a similar presentation on the principles and possibilities of LEAD on May 17 at Betsy Ross School during the Hill South Community Management Team’s monthly meeting. Then, on June 21 at 6 p.m. at Betsy Ross, these groups plan to hold a larger, participatory conversation about LEAD in which interested members of the community can share their thoughts on the program, and help determine the shape and details of how a New Haven LEAD program would look and work.

Comments posted by: Patricia Kane on May 10, 2017  1:11pm As a volunteer attorney working with SWAN and a supporter of the LEAD program, I want to congratulate the community stakeholders and the people of the Hill for getting behind this revolutionary and humane approach to certain crimes.     The Courts know certain categories of crime (drug use, vagrancy (homelessness) and sex work) are not solved by the legal system. We have come to realize that they are related to poverty, childhood abuse and lack of social supports and should be treated as public health issues and not criminalized.     Right now there are many more people seeking treatment for drug use than there are programs to take them in.     Homelessness is not fixed by temporary shelters with rigid rules either.     And sex workers, female and male, teens and older people, are surviving as best they can, but want a better life and can’t do it on their own.     New Haven has an opportunity to embrace a humane approach to our brothers and sisters in need.     Seattle, Albany and other cities have instituted LEAD programs and the rate of recidivism is greatly reduced, which means courts are left to address more serious crimes and the focus shifts to promoting health and away from punishment - which has failed.     LEAD is the future. It will take time for the community to grasp the concept (I’m still learning), but this new approach works and changes lives. posted by: wendy1 on May 10, 2017  2:03pm WE need LEAD.  I totally agree with Pat Kane.  At the city budget hearing I pushed housing instead of our bad privately run shelters, a poisonous money pit that the mayor and the BOA still help pay for while A Cunningham holds fundraisers at NH Lawn Club…!!!!!! Currently you are only allowed 3 months tops in a shelter than back on the street waiting years to get an apt….that is if you actually get a cot in a shelter.  The Housing First approach saves lives and money and gives folks a chance to heal and become taxpayers.  I will continue to nag Nemerson saying merchants and landowners dont want the spectacle of hungry, homeless, ill people living in the parks, street, underpasses, etc. Events Calendar loading… SeeClickFix » Street Lamp May 10, 2017 11:37 pm Address: 171 Orange St New Haven, CT 06510, USA Rating: 1 Illegal Driveway May 10, 2017 11:29 pm Address: 736 Quinnipiac Avenue New Haven, Connecticut Rating: 1 PosterWallAdd your Poster News Feeds N.H.I.

Amazon, which offers rapid delivery services like Prime Now and Amazon Pantry, recently said it cut the threshold for free shipping to $25 from $35. Walmart previously dropped its free-shipping minimum to $35 from $49. Target plans to pilot the new service with shoppers this summer in the Minneapolis area. Once the pilot is live, Minneapolis area shoppers that have a REDcard will be eligible to access thousands of household essentials online. They will be able to fill a box with multiple items and have their orders shipped to their homes for a low, flat fee, although there are no reports yet on what that fee will be. Target said it will be able to fulfill orders placed before 1:30 pm by the next business day. "Today’s consumers expect everything right now!" Ken Morris, Principal, Boston Retail Partners (BRP) told RIS News. "Amazon and Walmart are raising the bar by continuing to offer faster delivery options – even same day. This move by Target to offer next day delivery is a direct response to competitors’ offerings – they need to do it. Target will also need to add fresh, refrigerated or frozen foods categories to next day delivery to be on par with Amazon and Walmart. Target said the items for Target Restock orders will be packaged at a nearby store, essentially turning local stores into omnichannel  warehouses.   "It’s an interesting move by Target to use existing personnel to package the boxes that consumers order with Target Restock," commented Barry Pellas, CTO of PointSource. "It integrates front-end employees more deeply within the supply chain, giving them a holistic picture of the inventory that’s going in and out of the store. At this stage, Ship from Store (SFS) is a good choice because Target can analyze inventory and manage logistics, using technology patterns to ensure that the store always has what it needs when it needs it. "But this is just the beginning for Target, and if they continue to roll out this service across the county, the SFS method might not be sustainable with increased demand. Right now, the products that they are offering in this pilot are not a comprehensive selection of Target’s inventory. As they offer more options a separate warehouse will be necessary to accommodate this influx, and more digital inventory management services will be necessary with it. If Target wants to compete with e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart, they’re going to need to build out a more robust supply chain and that isn’t possible in-store." "Target seems to be playing catch-up instead of leap-frogging the competition," said Morris. "Perhaps moving to same day within a reasonable proximity of their store locations and adding auto-replenishment services for products that are purchased regularly might be a better strategy. Another good strategy would be to offer an enhanced loyalty program, similar to Amazon Prime, that offers compelling benefits like free delivery and premium benefits that increase customer loyalty for products they can purchase from many other sources." Target noted in its blog that the company is fine-tuning the experience and testing various enhancements as well. "In order to combat the possible decline of in-store sales, Target should consider replicating their in-store experience by personalizing the buying experience within the application," said Pellas. "Providing recommended products, suggestions based on past shopping trips (both in store and through Target Restock), or enticing them upon checkout with deals and Cartwheel offers will help to recover revenue from those impromptu purchases while keeping their loyal REDcard buyers engaged." Supply Chain Concerns Providing the rapid service that e-commerce giants like Amazon offer will requireTarget to ensure that their technologies and architectural infrastructure allow for seamless communication and integration between their fleet management, tracking and warehouses. "All areas of the supply chain must be unified so that the data being shared and experiences provided are consistent across locations and channels," said Pellas. "If Target continues to build out this program to a national level, a cloud-based platform with real-time, omnichannel capabilities will be essential to the growth of the Restock service. "Sharing goals and developing open lines of communication within an organization will help establish innovative processes that can improve existing procedures and lead to greater efficiencies. This type of transparency can help retailers continue to adapt to meet changing market needs." "While this is a good move for Target, competitors are upping the game which will continue to put pressure on Target and others to find ways to offer faster delivery services and other conveniences that make shopping and buying easier," said Morris. "Retailers selling commodity items have a challenging road ahead."       SHARE YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Analytics How IBM Watson "Drives" Shoppers to Brick & Mortar Fulfillment Amazon Announces AmazonFresh Pickup, Delays Amazon Go Store Operations Albertsons May Bid on Whole Foods; Appoints EVP of Retail Operations Supply Chain and Merchandising Walmart Battles Amazon With the One Thing the E-Commerce Giant Lacks Digital Tranformation Walmart's Tech Innovation Hub Will Invest in Startups RELATED TOPICS Supply Chain and Merchandising Supply Chain Management Cloud Computing Fulfillment Inventory Management Customer Experience Footer Social LinkedIn Twitter Youtube Facebook Footer Contact Us Editorial Board Media Kit Privacy Statement Terms & Conditions © 2017 EnsembleIQ, All Rights Reserved

X Apple within touching distance of the $800bn mark Firm now worth more than Walmart, General Electric, Pfizer and Kraft Heinz combined about 15 hours ago Forrest Gump invested in “some kind of fruit company”. It was Apple, and he did not “have to worry about money no more”         In Forrest Gump, the film’s protagonist wades into the stock market and into “some kind of fruit company”. “We don’t have to worry about money no more,” Gump says of his investment. “And I said, ‘That’s good! One less thing’.” The company? Apple. On Tuesday the valuation of the iPad and MacBook maker topped $800 billion (€735.8bn) for the first time, more than the value of Walmart, General Electric, Pfizer and Kraft Heinz combined, and the first time a US publicly-traded company has hit that mark. The company’s stock, up nearly a third so far this year, has enjoyed a meteoric rise since the iPhone began disrupting the mobile phone industry in 2007. It has returned more than 870 per cent to shareholders since then. While much of the gain has been propelled by the popularity of the iPhone, the more recent introduction of debt-funded share buybacks and dividends has attracted a steady stream of value investors. Warren Buffett is a new investor. Apple has not been the only technology company setting records this year. The sector now accounts for five of the most valuable companies within the S&P 500. The list includes three of the four Fang stocks – Facebook, Amazon and Google owner Alphabet (the fourth is Netflix). Together with Microsoft they are worth nearly $3 trillion. “You are seeing the very real effects of disruption in tech,” Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, said of their rising share prices. Top banana Michael Underhill, the chief investment officer of Capital Innovations, adds: “Tech has been leading the way, and Apple has been the top banana in a crowded tech world with over $200 billion in cash, defensible market share and proprietary technology with leading platforms for innovations.” Despite recording earnings growth of more than 10 per cent in the first quarter, Apple trades with a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio below that of the wider S&P 500, according to FactSet. Facebook and Alphabet both command a p/e ratio above 27. Apple, by contrast, trades at less than 16 times its earnings over the next year. As Apple’s valuation marches higher, the sheer size of the company is raising questions for some over its ability to keep growing sales. Other large consumer groups have suffered major missteps, portfolio managers caution. However, analysts expect that the next iPhone will recapture consumer attention and help fan growth at the company. Broker Drexel Hamilton is among the most bullish, and this week put a price target on the group that is equivalent to a $1 trillion valuation. “Because their iPhone sales were a little bit on the poor side, there are expectations that their next product will be more breakthrough,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “It may start putting a little pressure on them to deliver a ‘cool’ product going forward.” Advance The company’s advance this year has been vital to the broader S&P 500, of which Apple represents just under 4 per cent of the index. Without Apple and nine other stocks, which together account for roughly 15 per cent of the S&P’s market cap, the benchmark index would be little changed since the start of March. Over the past two months the vast majority of the benchmark US stock index – some 490 stocks – have had little impact on the index, according to Fundstrat Global Advisors. Despite its record valuation, Apple’s sway on the S&P 500 still falls short of the influence some companies have had in the past. IBM, which for several years held a 5 per cent or 6 per cent weighting in the index, ExxonMobil and General Electric have commanded greater influence. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Nicholas Colas Alphabet Amazon Apple Exxon Mobil Facebook General Electric Google Heinz IBM Kraft Microsoft Netflix Pfizer WalMart Read More Europe shares dip and dollar down on Comey sacking Investors toast strong corporate updates as shares rise across Europe US stocks hit fresh highs as fear factor dissipates European shares rise on recovery in resources stocks Akzo sees latest PPG bid inadequate, weighs options Quiet day as Macron’s victory largely priced into the market Aryzta evaluating alternatives for Picard shareholding Euro hits 6-month high and Asian shares gain after French election BlackRock increases stakes in CRH and Bank of Ireland Oil output cuts may be extended, says Saudi energy minister  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Snapchat shares plummet on back of first earnings report Technology Samsung’s new Frame TV the picture of style Sport Sonia O’Sullivan: Sub-two-hour marathon now looking like a real runner Economy Fed says slowdown in US growth is temporary Sponsored The Story of Home: A dream of tiny houses The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Funds Tracker Keep up to date with your investments   Latest Business PTSB must deal with non-performing loans before it can pay dividend, CEO says 07:57 Coillte operating profit jumps due to “significant changes” 07:57 KBC Bank Ireland reports after-tax profit of €67m 07:45 Dublin-based fintech firm Corvil sees profits surge 07:00 How smartphones killed off boredom 06:55 Most Read in Business 1 AIB to give cashback on some Visa card purchases 2 Web Summit lost out when it lost its Irish soul 3 Snapchat shares plummet on back of first earnings report 4 Italians turning to Ryanair as Alitalia files for bankruptcy 5 Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus – the Android phone you need 6 Ireland is world’s fourth-largest shadow banking hub 7 ‘Intense hiring’ as professional job vacancies rise 8 Tabit transforming corporates’ in-house food catering services 9 Will Europeans really be able to ‘roam like home’ on their phones? 10 How smartphones killed off boredom Never miss a story.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) May 10, 2017 at 11:01AM Earlier this year, The Motley Fool had three talented high school students from St. Albans attend our "MBA in a Day" program to gain investing and finance skills. "MBA in a Day" is part of The Motley Fool's commitment both to local education and to charity (the "MBA" was raffled off as part of a fundraiser). Watch the video below to learn what these young men learned! A full transcript follows the video. Gaby Lapera: Hello everyone! Welcome to "MBA in a Day" at The Motley Fool, a special program with local high schoolers. We're taping today on Friday, Feb. 17th, and we're joined by a few young men from St. Albans, a local school. Hi, how are y'all? Jack Burnett: Doing well. Robert Gerber: Great. Lapera: Awesome. Why don't you guys introduce yourselves? We'll start in that corner with the blue mic. Burnett: Hi, I'm Jack Burnett, I'm a senior at St. Albans. I'm really excited to be here today. It was a pretty great day, I learned a lot. Gerber: I'm Robert Gerber. I'm a sophomore at St. Albans. I've always had an interest in business and investing, and this has been a pretty great day so far. Lapera: Awesome. Brian Geffroy: I'm Brian Geffroy, I'm a senior with Jack, and I agree with him, it's been a very exciting day and I'm really excited to talk to you guys about what we learned. Lapera: Awesome, thanks for joining us. Can one of you tell me why y'all are here? How did you end up at the Fool today? Burnett: Yeah, this started, actually, as part of the Christmas House Tour fundraiser that's done every year for our school to raise money for the faculty and the school in general. This was an auctioned item. David Gardner was gracious enough to put it up, he's a dad of one of our classmates. So, we were lucky enough to win this raffle item, and we're happy to be here. Lapera: Awesome. Can you tell me who you've met today, some of the things you've learned? Geffroy: Yeah, we met a lot of different people that have come and talked to us about different parts of investing. We met David Gardner, too, himself, which was really interesting. He really talked a lot about how it's not all luck, and he showed us the numbers. He, over time, was obviously a very successful investor, and he showed us some of the tips he had, like be patient, and don't be sporadic, don't just change your stocks every day, be patient and stick to a three to five year, even a 10-year plan. That was one of the biggest things I took out of that. Lapera: That's awesome. I know you guys also talk to Buck Hartzell. Did he give you guys any really important pieces of knowledge you'd like to share? Gerber: I'd say the most important piece of information that, on each slide, he gave what you would hear in the newspaper, what Wall Street's analysis would be, and then he says what a Fool's analysis would be, and how you look for something ... Geffroy: But not an actual fool, someone who works at the Motley Fool. Lapera: Don't worry, our listeners are familiar with us, it's Fool, not fool. Burnett: Capital "f", right. Lapera: What about you, anything super interesting you learned today? Burnett: Yeah, Buck was great, talked about not quite contrarian ways to approach these retail stocks in particular, but as a way to look for hidden clues in the statistics on different companies. Beyond that, in the morning, we got an overview of why to invest your money vs. storing it in your mattress or under your bed, there's a lot of stuff that can be done simply by putting stuff into a 10-year plan. Lapera: Definitely. I think that what you're getting at is the power of compounding interest. Listen, if you listen to Industry Focus, this is something you've heard me harp on time and time again. The earlier you get started, the better off you are, because that compounding interest will have time to work. And you guys are very young. If you guys start investing or saving now, it'll work out way better for you guys in the long run. So, very important question for you guys. Do you like it here so far? Burnett: Yeah. Geffroy: Yeah. Gerber: Absolutely, I think the work environment is really unique here. I've visited a couple office buildings, but this seems really cool. Lapera: Yeah, it's a lot of fun. We gave them donuts, that's why they like us. Burnett: Sign me up. Lapera: You guys talked a little bit about some of the things you learned from David Gardner and Buck Hartzell. I know that you guys have picked three different companies, each of you have picked one, and I would love to talk to you guys a little bit about them. I'd like to know, why don't we start with Costco. Gerber: That's me. The reason I chose Costco as a great stock to go after is because it's a very unique company in its approach with discounted and wholesale items. And although it has competitors like Wal-Mart, they don't sell products at the same sort of the bulk level that Costco does. Lapera: You can't see this unless you're watching the video version of this, but he's throwing a little bit of shade at my friend right here, because I believe you did pick Wal-Mart, right? Geffroy: Yeah, I did pick Wal-Mart. I disagree. I think Walmart is obviously a very successful company. It's quite arguably the most successful company in America. But there's a lot of problems with both of our models, especially going into the future with e-commerce soon to be the number one way to buy things. I think the wave of the future might not be Wal-Mart and Costco, unless they start to adapt, and that might actually be a segue into the next segment, Jack's company, Amazon. Lapera: Doing my job for me, man. Burnett: Yeah, I chose Amazon. While you have Costco and Wal-Mart, Amazon is headed more toward the future in the sense that while e-commerce is growing, right now, it's only 8% of the world's commerce is done online. So, while Amazon might seem like a massive company, they're worth about $250 billion, they can only go up, essentially. They're expanding into all these crazy endeavors, into drone delivery and those creepy Amazon Alexa things that sit in your house and listen to everything you say. It's getting into people's lives through every way, they've started buying up more and more movies and rights for their Amazon Prime movie services. So, really, expanding into everything and growing in almost all possible ways. Lapera: Awesome. But I know that you guys all picked your stocks for a reason, right? There's a reason you picked Wal-Mart. Why? Why do you think it's a good company? Why is it worth investing in? Geffroy: I think it's a really good company, just because of how widespread it is and how many stores there are. It has the most supercenters out of all of these types of companies. I thought because of how massive it is, it's -- Lapera: You think it has staying power. Geffroy: Yeah. I definitely think it could do well in the long-term, because it's not going anywhere. I don't think Walmart will be going out of business any time soon, based on their profits and how much money they make and how much stability there is. They're the largest employer in America. I think it's very stable, and it's a very smart stock to look into. They're not going out of business like RadioShack did, like we talked about earlier. Lapera: Yeah. And Wal-Mart also has a couple of interesting advantages in that they do prescription sales. They're selling medicine, which is something that Amazon can't really do. And who knows, maybe that'll change. But they definitely have a business model that's a little bit outside of where Amazon is operating. Costco. Gerber: The reason I chose Costco primarily is because it's very much like Wal-Mart, except for the fact that there's a constant enrollment and renewing of memberships. That's a steady stream of earnings, in addition to their bulk wholesale model of advertisement and scaling. Burnett: And talk about a loyal customer base right there. Most people who go to Costco keep going back for everything. Lapera: Absolutely. Another really interesting thing about Costco is they're a very ethical company. I think a lot of investors like them for the way they treat their employees. Geffroy: Yeah, people don't think that about Wal-Mart in the same way. I just read about the amount of money that the Waltons have and how little they donate to charity, could bring a bad light on the company. Lapera: Absolutely. If ethics is something you're concerned about, maybe something to think about when you're trying to choose between Costco and Walmart. What about Amazon? We know you think it's great, we know they also think it's great. Burnett: [laughs] Yeah. I mean, again, the amount of potential it has to grow in all facets, it's looking like Alphabet is expanding into new endeavors, and looking into alternative ways to address these things, like the idea -- I'm a little skeptical of delivering groceries by drone when you could just drive them there. But, expanding into these what can seem like gimmicky products eventually, you have the potential to turn into something massive. Lapera: Yeah, by pushing the boundary, maybe they'll find the next new thing. Moment of truth, are you guys actually going to invest in any of these companies? Geffroy: I think I'll probably be investing in Amazon, he just chose it before I did. Lapera: What about you? Gerber: I probably will invest in Costco, just because I haven't already, and also in Amazon because of the potential. Burnett: There you go. Lapera: And you're obviously sold on Amazon. Burnett: Yeah. Lapera: That will be really interesting because Amazon's stock price is creeping up. Let me see, I can see how much it is right this second. Burnett: $845 a share. Lapera: Yep, $844.35 right this second at 3:56 p.m. eastern time. I just saw an article the other day that said, will Amazon break $1,000? So, you believe the stock is on the rise, right now might be a cheap time to buy it. And that's a good concept to think about, too. Stocks can be cheap, like actually cheap, like $1, or they can be relatively cheap like Amazon at $844. It's not cheap, no one is saying $844 isn't a lot of money, but it's maybe a lot less than it will be in the future. What about you, Rick? Did any of them convince you on a stock? Rick Engdahl: I already own Amazon and Costco and, sorry, Wal-Mart's not on my list. Gerber: Oh well. Lapera: OK. As usual, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Contact us at Fool School at fool.com, or @TMFFoolSchool on Twitter if you have any questions. Thank you, again, to Rick, today's awesome producer, and thank you guys for joining us.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The Y Partners with Leanne Brown, Author of Good and Cheap, to Raise Awareness for Free Summer Food Program, Serving Nearly 300,000 Youth this Summer CHICAGO, May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — YMCA of the USA (Y-USA) will partner with Leanne Brown, author of the cookbook Good and Cheap, to raise awareness for the Y’s Summer Food Program. The free program, estimated to serve over 7.2 million meals and snacks to nearly 300,000 youth this summer, provides nutritious food, as well as activities, to keep kids’ minds and bodies active when the school year ends. The partnership will aim to educate parents and community members on healthy, affordable food options available to ensure fewer kids and teens go hungry this summer. The Summer Food Program, in its seventh year, is part of an existing national partnership between Y-USA and the Walmart Foundation to address child hunger, which is more prevalent in communities during the summertime. Made possible by a 15 month, $7.1 million grant from the Walmart Foundation, the Y is better able to reach kids in need. The Summer Food Program is part of the Y’s year-round effort to address child hunger; during the school year, the Y’s Afterschool Meal Program provides a combination of learning activities and healthy meals and/or snacks at the end of the school day. Leanne Brown’s best-selling cookbook Good and Cheap provides an avenue to healthy and affordable meals by educating readers on how to prepare nutritious recipes to eat on $4/day—the average amount of money a person receives from the government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Brown’s understanding of the need to provide nourishment and access to food to those who need it most makes her a powerful partner to help raise awareness for the Summer Food Program. „We are thrilled to partner with Leanne Brown for our Summer Food Program this year,” said Stacey McDaniel, National Spokesperson for the Anti-hunger Initiative at Y-USA. „Leanne’s dedication to resolving the food crisis in America makes her a natural fit for a partner with our organization. Together we will promote awareness for the imminent danger of child hunger in America and work to educate communities across the U.S. about solutions to this problem.” As part of the partnership, McDaniel, together with Brown will visit multiple Y locations across the U.S. to share insights about the program and ways to shop for healthy foods, prepare basic dishes on a limited food budget, and utilize what people may already have in their pantries to make wholesome meals. Y locations include: YMCA of Greater Boston YMCA of Greater Rochester YMCA of Middle Tennessee YMCA of Greater Indianapolis The Y is committed to youth development, healthy living and social responsibility and is working to ensure all kids have access to nutritious meals. Available in nearly 1,900 locations nationwide, the goal of the program is to keep children healthy, active and well-nourished all summer long. Members of the community living in the vicinity of each of the Y locations listed above are encouraged to contact their local Y to learn more about these visits and to become involved. To learn more about the Y’s Summer Food Program, visit ymca.net/summerfood. About the Y The Y is one of the nation’s leading nonprofits strengthening communities through youth development, healthy living and social responsibility. Across the U.S., 2,700 Ys engage 22 million men, women and children – regardless of age, income or background – to nurture the potential of children and teens, improve the nation’s health and well-being, and provide opportunities to give back and support neighbors. Anchored in more than 10,000 communities, the Y has the long-standing relationships and physical presence not just to promise, but to deliver, lasting personal and social change. ymca.net About Good and Cheap GOOD AND CHEAP: EAT WELL ON $4/DAY, by Leanne Brown, is a cookbook like no other, demonstrating why kitchen skill, not budget, is the key to great food. GOOD AND CHEAP is not a challenge to live on so little—it’s a resource for those who face this reality, or anyone in need of stretching a tight budget. In addition to sharing tasty, nutritious recipes that maximize every ingredient and use economical cooking methods, Brown gives tips on shopping, setting up a basic pantry, mastering staples, and even repurposing last night’s dinner.

Meanwhile, Amazon has been beefing up its AmazonFresh business and rolling out more brick-and-mortar locations. Wal-Mart purchased Jet.com last year, hoping to grow its online sales. Lauren Thomas | @laurenthomasx3 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Jet.com Walmart and Jet.com test grocery concept in New York. Wal-Mart has quietly made its next move in taking on Amazon to bring fresh groceries to the masses. On Wednesday, Jet.com — which Wal-Mart acquired for $3.3 billion in 2016 — is opening a temporary grocery location in New York in partnership with Rachel Shechtman's Story retail concept store. In buying the e-commerce company last year, Wal-Mart has hoped to beef up its online ordering offerings, bringing in Jet's co-founder and CEO Marc Lore, who now leads all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations. Jet wasn't immediately available to comment. "What's fresher than fresh?" Story wrote in release announcing the partnership with Jet. "Having healthy produce dropped at your door — and you don't even have to be home to receive it. This is the magic of Jet.com." Jet will sell its grocery items at the New York Story location for six weeks. There also will be a number of in-store events with chef Mario Batali and makeup guru Bobbi Brown, among others. Shechtman, a former brand consultant for Kraft and TOMS shoes, founded Story in 2011. The 2,000-square-foot "start-up store" in Manhattan features a rotating line-up of merchandise, which changes every four to eight weeks, the company says. Jet's physical debut comes at a time when e-commerce giant Amazon has been investing more in its AmazonFresh business, and testing brick-and-mortar locations to expand its reach. One store concept, called AmazonFresh Pickup, is a drive-in-type grocery store for Prime members that lets users shop online, reserve a time to pick up the groceries and have them loaded into their car at the store. Amazon also plans to boost the number of physical book stories it operates, and is testing a smart convenience store, Amazon Go, near its Seattle headquarters. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart has been rapidly expanding its own online grocery business and concentrating on the so-called click-and-collect model, which allows consumers to pick up their orders at stores. Last year, Wal-Mart announced a partnership with Uber and Lyft to delivery groceries to customers' homes. While e-commerce is the fastest growing portion of the food retail business, few shoppers buy their groceries online. Wells Fargo Zachary Fadem estimates that just 1 to 2 percent of total grocery spending occurs online. Since Lore's arrival at Wal-Mart, the big-box retailer has been beefing up its digital operations, recently adding to its portfolio women's clothing retailer Modcloth, for $150 million, and outdoor recreational retailer Moosejaw, for $50 million. —CNBC's Jeff Daniels contributed to this report.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch Update: GameStop Stocks Three New Nintendo Switch Bundles Posted: May 10 2017, 11:57am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The latest Nintendo Switch stock tracking information for online and in stores for Wednesday, May 10th. New Nintendo Switch inventory has been coming into stores, but not online in the past days. The Nintendo Switch got restocked in a big way the last time for the Mario Kart 8 launch in the week that ended April 28. Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in Stock Online Update: GameStop has released three new Nintendo Switch bundles available online now. The three Nintendo Switch bundles start at $479.99. Customers can choose between Mario Kart and Zelda themed bundles. All bundles ship by May 19. GameStop is restocking the Nintendo Switch starting Thursday in stores too. We have confirmed this morning. The Nintendo Switch is also only available as part of bundles at GameStop retail locations. On May 5, the Nintendo Switch was on sale online at Walmart.com for $369 in a bundle. Some managed to even buy the Switch without the accessories using the Walmart app. Read below when to expect the next Switch sale at Walmart's online shop. Nintendo believes the Nintendo Switch will be as big as the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. Looking at the current shortage, the Japanese video game maker has a long road ahead of them to ship 101 million Nintendo Switch consoles. The positive reception and praise of the Nintendo Switch fuel the demand for the mobile and home console hybrid. Find below the latest Nintendo Switch online availability updates and stock tracking updates for stores. Nintendo Switch Stock at Online Stores On May 10, 2017 the Nintendo Switch is available online as part of three bundles starting at $479.99 online at gamestop.com. The last online availability was as part of a $369.84 Nintendo Switch bundle at walmart.com on Friday May 5. The Walmart Switch bundle offer sold out quickly. Rumors though say that Walmart is offering this Switch bundle every Friday at 5pm ET. The next time the Switch is on stock according the rumor is on May 12th at 5pm ET. The $499.99 Nintendo Switch bundle at ToysRUs.com on was available on May 6 for a short time. These high priced Switch bundles are not that popular with consumers, but still sell out. The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. Online stores restocked the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in time for the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on April 28. Since then the Switch console was out of stock online, besides the TRU bundle offer, according to data from The Tracker. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $90 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $100 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have risen slightly. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news. How to find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Online We developed the The Tracker app to make finding stock of rare products online as easy and stress free as possible. Download the free app for Apple iPhone or Android phones. From the list products you select to be notified for the Switch with Grey Joy-Con and/or Neon Joy-Con. That is it. It is set and forget. At the moment we detect the Nintendo Switch console in stock at major online retailers, you receive a notification on your smartphone. Now you are just a tap away from buying a Nintendo Switch. You can also see the current availability of the Nintendo Switch consoles in the web version of The Tracker: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con, Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con. Nintendo Switch in Stock at Stores The Nintendo Switch is available in 1,045 Walmart stores, 272 Target stores, 128 GameStop locations according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracker iStockNow (6am ET). The number of Walmart and Target stores stayed flat, but GameStop added 100 locations to have the Switch in stock over the past hours. Compare the Nintendo Switch stock indicators to yesterday, May 9. The Nintendo flagship store in New York said on April 28 in a tweet to have the Nintendo Switch in stock each morning. People in New York or visitors can give this purchase option a try. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news.

Jeffrey Dastin Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. Photo: Reuters San Francisco: Earlier this year, engineers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc who track rivals’ prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly stopped working. Losing access to Amazon.com Inc’s data was no small matter. Like most big retailers, Wal-Mart relies on computer programs that scan prices on competitors’ websites so it can adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents can mean losing a sale. But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs—known commonly as robots or bots—thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon’s data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon’s technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalogue and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. ALSO READ: Amazon adds video calling with Echo Show Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. “Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard,” said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any “campaign” to stop them. “Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site,” she said. Still, she said, “we prioritize humans over bots as needed.” Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon’s leadership in the burgeoning bot wars. The company’s technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it’s proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market’s bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said. Brave new world Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals’ pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others’ price moves for even 20 minutes. “That’s like a lifetime during Christmas,” said chief executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. “If we’re not decently priced, we’ll see it almost immediately” in sales declines. Disguised as humans Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public websites—a process known as crawling or scraping—has many purposes. Alphabet Inc’s Google, for example, constantly crawls the Web to gather information for its search engine results and to sell ads. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors’ defences. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers. To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what’s known as a “CAPTCHA”—typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can’t. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defences, disguising their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. “It is an arms race,” said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. “Every week or every month, there’s some new approach from both sides.” Amazon’s manoeuvre that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim at a specialized Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers—a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Wal-Mart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major US retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently—a De’Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer’s website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon’s price for the De’Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16. Swarming with bots Despite Amazon’s capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80% of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites. In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Wal-Mart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Wal-Mart employees said. Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organize rivals’ data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one US patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web pages. “Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it,” said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. That “isn’t the case for most retailers.” Reuters Jeffrey Dastin Topics: Amazon bots Wal-Mart robots Amazon traffic More From Livemint READ MORE Bharatpur: Wall collapse kills 24, case registered against marriage hall owner Gold steadies above 8-week low as dollar, stocks gain Amazon Great Indian Sale is back, and its gadget deals galore First Published: Wed, May 10 2017. 04 41 PM IST Editor's Picks The Dalal Street party is getting a little wild SoftBank losses from Snapdeal, Ola at $1.4 billion Bharti Airtel to invest $2.5 billion in FY18, with focus on building 4G capacity Latest News Bharatpur: Wall collapse kills 24, case registered against marriage hall owner Gold steadies above 8-week low as dollar, stocks gain Amazon Great Indian Sale is back, and its gadget deals galore All ITR forms are now available online, e-file your income tax returns 94 cities get Crisil ratings as urban local bodies prepare for municipal bonds Mint On Sunday 1965 Nanda Devi spy mission, the movie Meeting Lucy in Ethiopia, and other travel stories from the cradle of humanity The Universe of the Mantra Secrets of the world’s biggest gin collection The Tao of thinking Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2017 HT Media Ltd.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: It's Time to Face the Facts: Mobile Wallet Usage Rates Are Laughably Low A new study shows usage rates of the big-name mobile wallets remain dismally low. Will consumers ever adopt these new shopping habits? Matthew Cochrane (CMFCochrane) May 10, 2017 at 6:00AM In March, PYMNTS.com released a startling study about consumer habits and the use -- or lack thereof -- of mobile wallets to facilitate point-of-sale (POS) transactions. According to the study, which specifically looked at the usage rates of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, Samsung's Samsung Pay, Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Walmart Pay, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android Pay, less than 5% of the customers with the capability to use these mobile wallets did so, even when the merchants where the purchases were being made accepted that form of payment. All of the reported stats from the survey revealed strengths and weaknesses for each of these players. Apple Pay had the most respondents who had utilized the service at least once (22%). Samsung Pay (15%) and Android Pay (10%) notched fewer consumers trying their services. Samsung Pay had the highest usage (4.5%), which is, again, only tracked when the consumer with the right phone and/or operating system made a purchase at a merchant who supported that method of payment. According to PYMNTS.com, the usage rate for Samsung Pay has been relatively constant for 1.5 years. Apple Pay had the second-highest usage (4%) while Android Pay lagged far behind with a mere 1.1% usage rate.   Walmart Pay was launched less than a year ago, making it far younger than the other players examined. Yet 3.3% of consumers have Walmart Pay installed on their phone, according to PYMNTS.com.   Image source: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. What are the players doing to drive mobile wallet usage? Each of these companies seems to have a different strategy for boosting their mobile wallet engagement. Apple has been focused on opening new markets and points of acceptance for Apple Pay. In the company's 2017 second-quarter conference call, CEO Tim Cook welcomed the Taiwan and Ireland markets to Apple Pay, bringing the total number of global markets accepting the mobile wallet to 15. Apple Pay now has more than 20 million retail locations that accept it as a method of payment. Image source: Apple Inc. During the same conference call, Cook stated transaction volume for Apple Pay had increased 450% over the past year, proving that this strategy has shown some measure of success. While the usage rate remains dismally low, this plan at least addresses one of the primary shortcomings holding mobile wallet usage back, according to the study. A great deal of confusion still exists regarding which retailers support these mobile wallet platforms. According to the survey, 21.6% of customers with an iPhone didn't use it to make a transaction because the retailer didn't accept it or they didn't know whether it did. Wal-Mart does not face these same issues. Since June 2016, when Walmart Pay was expanded to all domestic Wal-Mart locations, American consumers have known that the wallet would be accepted while they were shopping at one of the stores. However, the giant retailer faces another challenge with its customer base. Fully 55.8% of Wal-Mart customers in the survey either wanted to use cash, were not comfortable with the platform, or simply flat out stated they didn't want to use a mobile payment method. Educational and promotional material inside the stores might go a long way toward easing the concerns of these customers. Android Pay recently entered into a partnership with PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) in hopes of encouraging user engagement. This agreement allows Android Pay users to link their PayPal accounts to Android Pay, allowing PayPal's 203 million active account holders to make purchases both in-app and at the point-of-sale with their PayPal accounts via Android Pay. What's holding mobile wallets back? These efforts might encourage some user growth and increase engagement with the platforms to some extent, but PYMNTS.com CEO Karen Webster believes they miss the larger point. In the press release accompanying the study, she was quoted as saying, "The lesson, though, isn't that wallets are dead but that the providers, and innovators, really need to focus on features -- or something -- that will get consumers, and merchants, excited." Webster might have a point. For every mobile wallet included in the survey, a double-digit percentage of those surveyed said they preferred to use a different payment method because the other payment method offered rewards or points. Another thing holding these wallets back are the very real physical limitations they all face. Each of them require a particular type of phone, operating system, or store (in the case of Walmart Pay) to work. Interestingly, PayPal was not included in the survey because its partnerships with Discover, Mastercard, and Visa are still relatively new. However, these partnerships allow PayPal to be accepted at physical retail locations using these payment networks' tokenization services. Once these partnerships begin manifesting themselves into specific banking institutions (and they already have) PayPal's app might well become the digital wallet of choice because it won't be hampered by the same operating system or phone manufacturer restrictions these other mobile wallets face. Customers can now order pizza from Domino's by tweeting an emoji or through Facebook Messenger. Image source: Domino's Pizza, Inc. Another interesting development has been the onslaught of different retailers' mobile apps. For instance, Starbucks customers can now use the coffee house's app to order their favorite caffeinated beverage while they're still miles away. Upon arrival, customers can pop in, grab their drink, and rush back out. Pizza lovers can order pizzas using their phones by tweeting pizza emojis or tapping one button on Domino's Pizza's app. These and other merchants' proprietary apps have surely stolen at least some of the mobile wallets' thunder. The big takeaway There can be little doubt that the world of payments and commerce are undergoing a seismic shift, the likes of which has probably not been seen since those little plastic rectangles were first introduced to our wallets decades ago. This change can be hard to categorize at times as the boundaries between digital commerce and traditional sales at brick-and-mortar retailers are increasingly blurred. Mass innovation can sometimes seem maddeningly deliberate as consumer habits can be slow to change. Yet, as time marches on, consumer trust in new technology tends to increase. While it might not take the shape we originally envisioned, phones will almost undoubtedly be used more to pay for purchases. Whether that's through retailers' own apps, as in the cases of Domino's and Starbucks, or through mobile wallets remains to be seen. What is clear thus far is that Alphabet's, Apple's, Samsung's, and Wal-Mart's mobile wallet efforts are not enough to ensure their future success.

You have probably seen me write about Swagbucks here on the blog. It's a site where you earn points (called SB) for things you're probably doing online already, like searching, watching videos, discovering deals, shopping online and taking surveys. Then you take those points and exchange them for gift cards to places like Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, Target, CVS, Domino's, PayPal cash and more! Unlike a lot of other rewards sites, you can cash out at any time, and they have gift cards for as little as 300 SB (The $3 Amazon gift card - every little bit helps)! This month, you can get a 500 SB bonus (worth $5 in gift cards) through this blog when you sign up! Here's how it works: 1. Sign up at Swagbucks.com HERE. Click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get a bonus. 2. Earn 300 SB points total before 6/1/17 and you'll get a $3 (300 SB) bonus! 3. If you spend at least $25 through the Swagbucks Shop section, you'll get another $2 (200 SB) bonus on top of the cash back you'll get from shopping. You must receive your shopping SB before July 1st to get the 200 SB bonus. If I am doing any online shopping, I go through the Swagbucks Shop section if the store is participating so I can earn SB points for every purchase. I've used the Swagbucks Shop section for online shopping at stores including Amazon, Kohl's, Walmart, Target, Groupon and more. I usually cash in my SB points for CVS and Sheetz gift cards which means I use my SB for free toilet paper, free bath & beauty products and free gas! New to Swagbucks? If you don't know about Swagbucks yet, it's the largest rewards website that gives people free gift cards for the things they do online (searching, shopping, watching videos, playing games and more). You earn points called SB for online activities and then you can cash them in for gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, CVS, Lowes, Starbucks, Paypal, Bass Pro Shops, Kohl's and so many more! It's free to join and I have earned a bunch of gift cards in the many years I have been a member. How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events (which we post about here on the blog and Swagbucks posts about on their website in the Swagbucks Blog section. * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Recently, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago. I used a coupon code for a percent off when I made the purchase and qualified for free shipping and got the SB points added to my account a couple weeks later. * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus.

The move comes after a number of challenges by Walmart, including the added support for free two-day shipping on orders under $35 with no membership required, announced in January, and the more recent rollout of a new program called “Pickup Discount” that offers lowers prices if you ship items to the store instead of your home, TechCrunch said. Amazon’s free shipping minimums apply to non-Prime members who have to place an order on the site that totals a certain amount in order to qualify for free shipping. Prime, of course, offers free, 2-day shipping on over 50 million items, along with other perks, like streaming TV, movies, and music, unlimited photo storage, free Kindle books, and more. Before Walmart’s announcement in January, Amazon had kept the minimum fairly high at $49. This was designed to encourage more sign-ups for its annual membership program, Prime. But after Walmart’s rollout of free shipping on orders under $35, Amazon in February dropped its requirements down to $35, as well. This second drop now follows Walmart’s launch of its pickup discount program, which can save shoppers sometimes a significant amount of money on larger purchases – like $50 on a new HDTV, for example. In addition, Target on Sunday, May 7 – alongside the announcement of its two-day delivery service trial – raised its free shipping minimum from $25 to $35 to be in line with Walmart and Amazon. That means Amazon is now undercutting this competitor, too. The change to the shipping minimum was first spotted by the Best Black Friday website, which notes that Amazon had not publicized the drop. As best they can tell, the new minimum went into effect sometime in the past week, but an exact date couldn’t be determined. This still would have followed Walmart’s launch of Pickup Discount, but not the increase to Target’s minimum. However, a lowered minimum alone may not combat Walmart’s threat with its free 2-day shipping deal. While amount consumers need to spend to qualify for free shipping is lower, you’ll still have to endure standard ship times before your package arrives, which can be as long as a week. In Walmart’s case, you may have to spend a bit more for free shipping, but it’s offering to ship those items in 2 days – just like Prime – and without the need to pay for an annual membership.

The move comes just a couple of months after the ecommerce giant dropped it to $35 from $49. “Walmart is definitely forcing their hand with the new [rate],” BestBlackFriday‘s Phillip Dengler, who spotted the change, told Digital Trends. Indeed, Amazon’s maneuverings follow Walmart’s decision earlier this year to do away with its subscription-based ShippingPass and replace it with free two-day shipping on eligible orders worth $35 or more. However, Amazon’s deliveries take between five and eight business days to reach your door, whereas Walmart promises to have orders in your hand in just a couple of days. To secure free two-day shipping, or faster, Amazon shoppers have to sign up to Prime, which in the United States costs $99 a year and includes additional benefits such as online access to thousands of streaming movies, TV shows, and the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. Price juggling The Seattle-based company occasionally switches its minimum order total for free shipping, often in response to the competition though at other times to deal with its own logistical and financial challenges. In February 2016, for example, it raised it to $49 from $35. Longtime Amazon customers that aren’t Prime members will recall that before then, free shipping came with orders totting up to $25 or more. So, yes, Amazon has returned to its pre-2013 free shipping minimum. Another big hitter, Best Buy, has also been testing different offers in a bid to win more customers, saying that it “sometimes offers free shipping for specific shipping methods in select categories, or free shipping sitewide.” If you sign up to the free “My Best Buy” scheme, you’ll find that some orders qualify for free two-day shipping, with a minimum purchase of $35. Additionally, if you buy lots of stuff on its site you’ll quality for its “Elite” or “Elite Plus” scheme, bagging you free two-day deliveries on many items, with no minimum purchase. For Amazon shoppers that really don’t want to fork out $99 a year for Prime, the bottom line is this: Wait until there’s at least $25 worth of stuff you want to order before you hit the “buy” button. But if your order hits $35, it’d be a good idea to check the other sites as well to make sure you’re getting the best possible deal.

Insight: Amazon trounces rivals in battle of the shopping 'bots'  10 May 2017 - 8:14 FILE PHOTO: A zoomed illustration image of a man looking at a computer monitor showing the logo of Amazon is seen in Vienna, Austria, on November 26, 2012. REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo By Jeffrey Dastin | Reuters San Francisco: Earlier this year, engineers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc who track rivals' prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly stopped working. Losing access to Amazon.com Inc's data was no small matter. Like most big retailers, Wal-Mart relies on computer programs that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents can mean losing a sale. But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs - known commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition.  Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. "Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard," said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any "campaign" to stop them. "Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site," she said. Still, she said, "we prioritize humans over bots as needed."  Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars. The company's technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said. BRAVE NEW WORLD Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals' pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for even 20 minutes. "That’s like a lifetime during Christmas," said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. "If we're not decently priced, we'll see it almost immediately" in sales declines. DISGUISED AS HUMANS Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public websites - a process known as crawling or scraping - has many purposes. Alphabet Inc's Google, for example, constantly crawls the Web to gather information for its search engine results and to sell ads. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers.  To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's known as a "CAPTCHA" - typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. "It is an arms race," said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. "Every week or every month, there's some new approach from both sides." Amazon's maneuver that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim at a specialized Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers - a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Wal-Mart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major U.S. retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently - a De'Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer's website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon's price for the De'Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16. SWARMING WITH BOTS Despite Amazon's capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80 percent of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites.  In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Wal-Mart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Wal-Mart employees said. Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organize rivals' data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one U.S. patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web pages.  "Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it," said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. That "isn't the case for most retailers." Share this post Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Walmart Family Mobile is offering a $49.88 plan that includes unlimited talk, text, and data with 10GB of 4G LTE data. To compare, there’s a $29.88 plan that offers 1GB of high-speed data as well as a $39.88 plan with 5GB of LTE data. The new 10GB plan also includes a free Vudu movie rental every month, similar to what T-Mobile offers to its unlimited LTE data customers. Speaking of things that are similar to T-Mobile, Walmart Family Mobile also recently began offering its own version of Binge On. On January 24, Walmart Family Mobile introduced Data Saver, which streams video at DVD quality when you’re on a cellular connection and helps to stretch your up to three times longer. Data Saver was automatically enabled for all new and existing customers on 4G LTE rate plans on January 24. Walmart Family Mobile customers can turn Data Saver off and on whenever they’d like by navigating to myfamilymobile.com, going to Profile, clicking Media Settings, and then clicking “ON” or “OFF” next to the Data Saver option. While there don’t appear to be any free services like Binge On, Data Saver can help folks on Walmart Family Mobile to make their limited high-speed data last a bit longer. The same feature is also available on MetroPCS, where it’s known as Data Maximizer.

John Legere has done very well for the company, and has actually done leaps and bounds with the LTE network. Dotson was all about “being a phone company” and was not interested in anything beyond EDGE.. thus leaving T-Mobile way behind.. great guy though just not very forward thinking Mike T-Mobile was dead not that long ago and now their #3 and are getting customers who came from Verizon and ATT. That’s a huge turnaround. BobbieDooley I agree that Phillip Humm didn’t add much value. All the value was created when Robert Dotson and Tim Wong were there. As for “being a phone company” that’s not entirely true. Under Dotson’s leadership, the company introduced the first cellular PocketPC, Sidekick (with unlimited data), data cards, and I also believe that the company had the first Blackberry which didn’t use CDPD/pager technology airwaves to communicate. It was the outsourced marketing company who wanted the company brand to be a “value” brand; and create/re-create new marketing campaigns every 3 months like someone with attention deficit disorder. This becomes very expensive. However, the company agreed to invest in marketing over listening to customers and building a network. The ad firm just said sediment plateaued, and a new promotion would fill the gap in sales. In turn, it paid the marketing company execs 6-figure salaries. X T-Mobile’s 2GB for $50 is ridiculous. 4 or 5 would be more appropriate. BreakingData I have to agree. AJ2 Straight Talk offers 5gb for $45 matt straight talk does not like unlocking phones and they got in trouble for it. trac fone charges more then what AT&T charges on per minute plans. straight talk reserves the right to cancel your wireless service if you use it for any kind of streaming. i wouldn’t go near them what happened was straight talk posted an unlocking policy. it said the phone had to be sold after jan 2015 and it had to be used for 12 consecutive months. so this basically said their entire subscriber list was ineligible for an unlock until jan 2016. fcc cried fowl, and now straight talk says ‘ we have entered into an agreement with the fcc x With the Tracphone brands I think it’s better to BYOD. I was looking their T&C and so far I haven’t found a mention of tethering, I don’t think they allow it. John Wentworth It’s definitely better to go BYOD with Straight Talk, there phone selection is mostly crap phones and a few high end Samsung and Apple devices that you could buy unlocked for virtually the same price. Straight Talk does prohibit tethering in any form, I used them a few times and I couldn’t stand how low on the priority list they were, I had problems with even voice calls and slow data speeds all the time on their AT&T sim, their t-mobile sim performed better but, their support is still worthless. I advise people to stay away from the bottom of the barrel MVNO’s MetroPCS for T-mobile or Cricket for AT&T offer a much better price/performance ratio and much better support. These days I’m back on Postpaid, I jumped on the 2 for $100 unlimited t-mobile postpaid plan, still better than any of the prepaid plans for heavy data users, being highest on the tower priority list makes a difference and the support is worlds better. x Looks like all T-Mobile MVNOs don’t allow tethering. fn noobee Not true. Walmart Family mobile does allow tethering. I am on 10GB/mo plan and wife is on 5GB/month plan and can confirm that both lines were allowed to tether. Don’t know what the limit is for each bracket but I tethered all the other night to my Nexus 9 for web browsing and watching a couple Youtube videos when free Wi-Fi in hotel was acting up and my wife downloaded a couple 200+ MB apps on the kiddos’ Fires while on the road. FYI, this was on an unlocked gray market device and WFM (read T-Mobile) LG G Stylo phone. Acdc1a All depends on your usage. Someone who regularly leaves the country like myself would disagree with you. gmo8492 It used to be 500mb 2 years ago. Be grateful they bumbed up the base plan while the other plans went up in price and data. Rdaex You can get SimplyPrepaid for 50 bucks and get 5GB. 60 bucks for 10. Mike I’d like the mention with the Vudu credit on Walmart Family Mobile with this new $49.88 10GB plan, it is a $7 value compared to T-Mobile’s $3.99 value. Way more bang for the buck. All the phones they sell now besides the $19.88 Rogue are band 12, including the $39.88 ZTE Obsidian. fn noobee Except the Coolpad Rogue is an awful phone. I will recommend the Alcatel OT XL ($120) or LG G Stylo ($180 now) personally. You have to be impressed with a phone that offers LTE for $20 though. On the more premium side the ZTE AXON Pro has Band 12 (confirmed) support and VoLTE (unconfirmed on WFM) support. I tried calling on Band 12 but band switched before I could confirm this. x I just learned that Boost was throttling video streams for the last 2 years. At 4 different levels 600kbps, 2Mbps, 6Mbps and I think 10Mbps. That’s innovation! Some would say. How come I never heard of this, with all the Binge On talk that’s going on? Jay J. Blanco i’m in love with tmobile new tablet plans they are amazing randian The Vudu credit would be nice if it were a purchase credit. A rental credit makes it useless to me. Mike Stop being greedy. Look at the purchase price of movies compared to renting. Ppl are always complaining no matter what just be happy u get a movie rental credit each month. Android_God Yeah, I was doing a double take at his comment. Certainly this person seriously isn’t thinking that a company would give them a free movie to own every month. Android_God Are you saying that they should give you a free movie to own every month? randian Since we’re talking a streaming download and not a physical disc, yes. Android_God The movie business isn’t in the business of giving away free movies randian I can buy most physical blu-rays new for about $10. A streaming only video is surely worth less to own. That makes $7 as a rental overpriced, but ok if you own it. Android_God That’s funny how you’ve completely lowered the cost of a blu-ray disc and raised what the cost of a rental really is. That’s never a good sign when you have to exaggerate to prove your point matt do you get music freedom? can you port from t-moble? matt 25 bucks for a sim card and Walmart does not include 25 bucks of service no thanks i think il keep my $30 prepaid walmart plan plus my separate $35 6 gb post paid ipad plan. that way i get music freedom on both devices and bingeon/data stash on the ipad x $25 plan?! With some data or no data? Because if you don’t need a lot of data for the phone you can get the $50 for 2Gb and $15 for 6Gb for your iPad, all in one TMo bill. x I mean $75, I forgot the other $10. It was a Simple Mistake. matt thanks for the advice, yeah i don’t make a lot of calls, so having 5 gigs on the phone vs 2 gigs is a better deal Augustine You might also get the unlimited data plan for $60 (taxes included) with 8 GB of tethering from Metro PCS and save a few bucks. AJ2 Does Walmart Family Mobile limit you to 8mbps? x I was looking the Family Mobile webpage earlier and found no details. Someone should grab a brochure at Wal-Mart. matt I’m looking at the terms and conditions of this plan on walmart’s main family mobile page and theres nothing there saying there is a hard limit. it says you can expect 6-16 mbps down and 2-5 megabit up with LTE. the otter thing it says is your data is given a lower priority then a t-mobile customer during peak periods. go to my family mobile dot com and read “internet services” its at support dot my family mobile dot com slash articles slash internet-serves x The link ends with: slash internet-services I also found in the T&C Section 10 that “Tethering your Device to other lawful devices is permitted pursuant to the terms and conditions and allotments of your Data Plan.” Good luck to those wanting to switch. I’m still undecided. fn noobee No, but on the page for agreement terms they state expected speed of LTE to be download speeds between 6 – 16Mbps (I know, broad range). I have done my own speed tests from major cities to rural areas across different parts of the country while traveling on leave and have yet to get ANY speeds above 18~19Mbps even in major cities like Denver, Seattle and St. Louis (touted by T Mo as one of the fastest cities). In fact I noticed in one test outside Charlottesville Virginia that speeds started to take off over 30+Mbps and then capped off below 20Mbps as if being limited/capped. Real world? I will say the speeds are more than fast enough for average usage. Monkeyk How do these Walmart plans work? how many lines do you get for that $50? T-Mo is offering 4 10GB lines for $120 now, right? How much would 4 10GB lines cost on the Walmart family plan? (J²) Each additional line is the same price as the primary line minus $5. You really aren’t saving if you’re interested in a Family Plan. NardVa For $50 you get unlimited talk, text and 10GB of LTE data. I don’t think you will find a better deal on prepay with 10GB of LTE data. GoSmart, which is under T-Mobile, has a $45 plan with 12GB of data, but you can only access the 3G/4G network. Not a bad deal for a single line account. x With GoSmart, I thought you could access the whole network but you were throttled to 3g speeds. At least that’s what someone who claimed he knows was saying on reddit. And I believe the speed is at the lower 3g range. NardVa I had a buddy who used GoSmart. You are not throttled to 3G, but you only have access to T-Mobile’s 3G network. T-Mobile’s 3G network is pretty fast. Remember before LTE rolled out, everybody was using 3G. T-Mobile’s 3G used to beat out AT&T’s LTE in some areas. x I’m not sure about the network, but I’m pretty sure you’re throttled to a certain speed, the proof is that GoSmart has a program where every month of service you’ll receive an speed increase that’s something like 0.025 Mbps, for some months. I don’t know to whay speed you’re throttle because I haven’t found it on the website nor in searches. Brad B Tmobile doesn’t drop you off LTE. It simply throttles the speed using software on their server and drops the bandwidth to about 100 kbps. Hope that helps. nlllllovollllln Background services put me over the cap, and I’m now getting 64 kbps for the next week. F— You straighttalk and your outsourced customer service. x You can turn off most background services. The ones I don’t turn off are my Web Browser’s, Mobile Hotspot, Android OS, Google Play Store, Messaging, Google Services and Media. nlllllovollllln None of those are significant. The culprit here is Unified Daemon (EUR). x I haven’t seen that one, what brand is your phone? The app that uses the most background on my LG in Android OS with 55mb in 15 days, second Play Store with 7.5mb. Data always on and I never use Wi-Fi. x I meant: the app that uses the most… is Android OS… nlllllovollllln OS isn’t significant. i’ve never gone over the cap otherwise. Augustine Methinks that the culprit is in the mirror: bit(dot)ly / 1PLRpZ0 Nlllllovollllln Oh yeah? John Beaulieu Straight Talk is not the same thing as Walmart Family Mobile at all. Straight talk is basically re-branded Tracfone (and net10). Walmart family Mobile is re-branded T-mobile. It would serve you well to be informed and aware of what service you are actually using. nlllllovollllln Who said anything about Walmart? You would do well to inform yourself of a class on reading comprehension. Besides that, Straight talk is a partnership between trac and walmart. So, I think its you who should be more informed. Bklynman Anyone who read this blog,use Family Mobile,how is the service? dUSTI AWESOME, IVE BEEN WITH THEM SINCE LAST YEAR AND OMG NSAME SERVICE AS VERIZON Bklynman Funny,ok now that we heard from the comdey section,does anyone out here use Family Mobile? fn noobee I have Walmart Family Mobile and if you are in an area covered natively by T-Mo’s towers service (which has really expanded lately) it is great. If you are in areas covered by their partners (like Western KS or the entire state of West Virginia, no exaggeration) you will want to look at T-Mobile postpaid or AT&T. Customer service is good once you figure out what option to select to get a representative. Price is $10/month less than comparable Simply Pre-paid data rate plans. Bklynman Thank you,I am in NYC,this a possibility for as option now. I am going to see if i can find 3 friends get the unlimited for 4 lines,if I can do that,would be great,since everyone else has better single line plans than Tmobile,Metro PCS has unlimited plan $60.00 amonth. I am going to try Freedom Pop,I will get cheap phone from them try them for 1 month see how they are,if I get good coverage with them,goodbye Tmobile. Yes I know they are on the Sprint network. fn noobee That unlimited data family plan can’t be beat and if you are not the most data hungry user, the 10GB/mo for $120 for 4 lines is IMO an even better deal. With a lot of zero balance options (BingeOn, Music Freedom, Wi-Fi calling, etc.) for postpaid customers, 10GB/ MO goes much further than it used to for most users. I personally would be hesitant to get on another CDMA MVNO ever after being on Virgin Mobile (Sprint MVNO). Coverage in my area at the time was bad and data speeds slow. When I jumped ship to T-Mobile, I had to sell phone because it’s locked in to Virgin Mobile. pizza boy I thought I saw that the walmart $49.99 family plan plus included the hotspot at no extra charge. Anyone know if it has the hotspot, and how much data is allotted to the hotspot use.

The new minimum shows Amazon competing for shoppers who don't pay $99-a-year for Amazon Prime, which includes free two-day shipping on millions of items as well as access to music and video. These customers are the Seattle-based company's most loyal shoppers. Amazon will make non-Prime shoppers wait 5 to 8 business days for free shipping on more than 50 million items. Wal-Mart in January made a big push against Amazon Prime when the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant offered free two-day shipping without a membership fee on orders of at least $35 while expanding its online marketplace inventory to include millions of items. The company last year acquired startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion in cash and stock and put its management team in charge of the online operation to strengthen its e-commerce business against Amazon. A company representative declined to comment on Amazon's price move. "The challenge Wal-Mart has thrown down is, 'give me free two-day shipping without a membership fee,' which is hard for Amazon to match without refunding everyone's $99 Prime membership," said Sucharita Mulpuru, an e-commerce consultant. "This is the best Amazon can do without cannibalizing Prime, which is so important to its business." Spencer Soper, Bloomberg.

The winning grocers announced Tuesday were selected via a competitive bidding process held by the LCBO. In Kingston, Farm Boy and the Walmart Superstore will begin carrying beer and cider in June. Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error Farm Boy and the Walmart Superstore are among 76 Ontario grocery stores that will start selling beer and cider on June 30. The Ontario government made the announcement Tuesday, increasing to 206 the number of grocery stores in the province authorized to sell beer and cider. The winning grocers announced Tuesday were selected via a competitive bidding process held by the LCBO. Farm Boy (940 Futures Gate) and Walmart (1130 Midland Ave.) join the Loblaws Princess Street Market as locations in Kingston to purchase beer and cider. Loblaws has been selling beer and cider since December 2015. “Ontarians welcome beer and cider in grocery stores, which provides greater convenience and choice for consumers,” Ontario Minister of Finance Charles Sousa said in a news release. “While today’s announcement is good news for shoppers, it also enables breweries and cideries to introduce their products to consumers in local communities across the province.” According to the Ministry of Finance website, eventually beer and cider will be available in up to 450 grocery stores, including up to 300 that will also sell wine. Stores authorized to sell wine, beer and cider must abide by these requirements: • Sales hours are Monday to Saturday, 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. • Alcohol limitations of 7.1 per cent for beer and cider, and 18 per cent for wine. • Beer and cider will continue to be sold in a six-pack or less or up to 750 mL per container. • Wine can be sold in maximum four-litre containers. • Staff selling alcohol must be a minimum of 18 years of age and be trained on Ontario’s standards for social responsibility, including making sure customers under the age of 19 and intoxicated individuals do not purchase alcohol. • Grocers are required to adhere to uniform and minimum pricing for wine, beer and cider. — The Whig-Standard  Featured Businesses Contact us to Advertise » New Homes RealtySource - Jordan Quaresma Automotive RUST CHECK Cleaning Services Molly Maid Go to the Marketplace » Local Businesses Advertise with us Contribute Send Your Scoop!

Already with 1,600 U.S. stores, Aldi has set a minimum target of selling groceries at a 21 percent discount to its U.S. rivals, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Chief Executive Jason Hart told Reuters. His strategy, previously unreported, centers on adding more private-label goods, which are a retailer's in-house brands, to win over price-sensitive customers, and a massive expansion to further disrupt a U.S. grocery sector that has seen 18 companies go bankrupt since 2014. Hart's plan calls for spending US$1.6 billion to expand and remodel 1,300 U.S. stores, and open 400 new stores mainly in Florida, Texas and on both coasts by end of 2018. He also pledged Aldi will be willing to change prices more frequently to respond to rivals if needed. "We are re-merchandising, remodeling, enhancing our product range and are focused on gaining volume so more customers start their shopping at Aldi and we are able to complete their shopping lists moreso than we have in the past," said Hart, who added Aldi's U.S. sales have doubled in five years. Advertisement Advertisement Though it only accounts for only about 1.5 percent of the U.S. grocery market, Aldi is growing at 15 percent a year, whereas Wal-Mart currently controls about 22 percent of the market and its U.S. sales are estimated to grow about 2 percent this year, according to analysts. Aldi's growth potential has competitors taking notice. Reuters reported in February that Wal-Mart is running price tests in 11 states, pushing vendors to undercut Aldi and other rivals by 15 percent and is expected to spend about US$6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2le6v0Y Price wars are roiling the entire retail sector - from department stores to discount chains - but it is nowhere as intense as in the grocery sector. Beyond Wal-Mart's move to match Aldi on price, German discount chain Lidl plans to open up to a 100 U.S. stores in a year, and Amazon.com Inc is aggressively testing out various brick-and-mortar grocery formats along with growing Amazon Fresh, its grocery delivery service. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qRbNT9 "We have not seen anything like this in the grocery sector in the United States before," said Scott Mushkin, managing director of Wolfe Research and a leading pricing analyst. Such heated competition risks a dangerous race to the bottom that could result in more retailers shutting their doors. "Given Aldi's expansion, Lidl's entry, Wal-Mart's response and Amazon's growing ambitions in this space, it is fair to expect a significant acceleration in the bankruptcy and liquidation cycle in this sector over the next few years," said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. For more on Wal-Mart's stock performance vs Amazon, click GOAL: EVERYDAY LOW PRICING Aldi, has a simple strategy to win more customers: everyday low pricing, according to Hart. "We don't confuse our customers with yo-yo discounts, sales, coupons and loyalty cards that require membership fees," he said. Four analysts and consultants contacted by Reuters confirmed Aldi now offers the lowest prices in private label consumer products in the states it operates, although they did say Wal-Mart is gaining ground in the states they are conducting price tests. Hart said Aldi's internal studies show its prices are 21 percent lower than its lowest-priced rivals and the discount retailer intends to keep the advantage at least that strong going forward. Depending on the product, Aldi's prices are cheaper than most rivals' private label items and even most branded items, analysts said. Hart said the 21 percent difference in price is calculated by monitoring competition on a basket of groceries. Aldi counts on its no-frills shopping experience to help keep costs low, and limits much of its inventory to items that sell in huge volume. But its focus on offering far more private label items than branded products is central to allowing Aldi to adjust pricing whenever it chooses, Hart said. Aldi and Wal-Mart do no break out the figures, but analysts including Mushkin and Flickinger say Aldi carries about 1,200 stock keeping units (SKUs) or type of products, 90 percent of which are private label. Wal-Mart stocks about 30,000-40,000 SKU's of products similar to ones Aldi sells, and only 30 percent of that are private labels. That different product mix can potentially make it more difficult for Wal-Mart to adjust prices because it often first needs buy-in from suppliers, and many times faces push back from packaged goods makers like Procter & Gamble , Unilever and even smaller brands. Such vendors fear steep discounting can erode the value of their brands, analysts said. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined comment saying the company would not comment on a competitor's strategy. P&G and Unilever did not respond to Reuters requests seeking comment. But the explosive growth in private label products is on the radar of Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Last month he told analysts that private label goods will play an even more important role as the widespread availability of branded products online will compress those products margins over time. "Aldi is disrupting the sector the way Wal-Mart did when they started," said Strategic Resource Group's Flickinger. STEPPING UP THE GAME Aldi's aggressive push to remodel its stores will allow it to add new private label merchandise in rapidly growing categories like fresh food. "The remodels are aimed at increasing our volumes which means more purchasing power that will help us lower prices further," said Scott Patton, Aldi's vice president of corporate buying. At a recent visit to an Aldi store in Wheaton, Illinois Reuters found newer-looking shelves, wider aisles and brighter lighting than a typical Aldi store. There was also a bigger assortment of fresh, organic, gluten-free products and antibiotic-free meats versus what it stocked earlier - categories Aldi said is growing the most rapidly at its stores. For example, its Simply Nature range of private-label products grew 53 percent to US$300 million in 2016 from a year ago. Aldi has also opened stores close to Wal-Mart's supercenters to benefit from its budget-conscious shoppers. Its total store count of 2,000 stores by the end of next year will be about 42 percent of Wal-Mart's U.S. store base.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Aldi raises stakes in U.S. price war with Wal-Mart By Reuters Published: 01:01 EDT, 11 May 2017 | Updated: 01:02 EDT, 11 May 2017 e-mail By Nandita Bose WHEATON, Ill., May 11 (Reuters) - German grocery chain Aldi Inc is trying to beat the world's biggest retailer at its own game: low prices. Already with 1,600 U.S. stores, Aldi has set a minimum target of selling groceries at a 21 percent discount to its U.S. rivals, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Chief Executive Jason Hart told Reuters. His strategy, previously unreported, centers on adding more private-label goods, which are a retailer's in-house brands, to win over price-sensitive customers, and a massive expansion to further disrupt a U.S. grocery sector that has seen 18 companies go bankrupt since 2014. Hart's plan calls for spending $1.6 billion to expand and remodel 1,300 U.S. stores, and open 400 new stores mainly in Florida, Texas and on both coasts by end of 2018. He also pledged Aldi will be willing to change prices more frequently to respond to rivals if needed. "We are re-merchandising, remodeling, enhancing our product range and are focused on gaining volume so more customers start their shopping at Aldi and we are able to complete their shopping lists moreso than we have in the past," said Hart, who added Aldi's U.S. sales have doubled in five years. Though it only accounts for only about 1.5 percent of the U.S. grocery market, Aldi is growing at 15 percent a year, whereas Wal-Mart currently controls about 22 percent of the market and its U.S. sales are estimated to grow about 2 percent this year, according to analysts. Aldi's growth potential has competitors taking notice. Reuters reported in February that Wal-Mart is running price tests in 11 states, pushing vendors to undercut Aldi and other rivals by 15 percent and is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2le6v0Y Price wars are roiling the entire retail sector - from department stores to discount chains - but it is nowhere as intense as in the grocery sector. Beyond Wal-Mart's move to match Aldi on price, German discount chain Lidl plans to open up to a 100 U.S. stores in a year, and Amazon.com Inc is aggressively testing out various brick-and-mortar grocery formats along with growing Amazon Fresh, its grocery delivery service. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qRbNT9 "We have not seen anything like this in the grocery sector in the United States before," said Scott Mushkin, managing director of Wolfe Research and a leading pricing analyst.

Photos Videos Topics Live PAK 169/2 (69) - WI (Yet to bat) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kapil Mishra Emmanuel Macron Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 Bahubali 2 News Business News EXCLUSIVE-Aldi raises stakes in U.S. price war with Wal-Mart Shares1 Thu, 11 May 2017-10:37am , Reuters German grocery chain Aldi Inc is trying to beat the world's biggest retailer at its own game: low prices. Already with 1,600 U.S. stores, Aldi has set a minimum target of selling groceries at a 21 percent discount to its U.S. rivals, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Chief Executive Jason Hart told Reuters. His strategy, previously unreported, centers on adding more private-label goods, which are a retailer's in-house brands, to win over price-sensitive customers, and a massive expansion to further disrupt a U.S. grocery sector that has seen 18 companies go bankrupt since 2014. Hart's plan calls for spending $1.6 billion to expand and remodel 1,300 U.S. stores, and open 400 new stores mainly in Florida, Texas and on both coasts by end of 2018. He also pledged Aldi will be willing to change prices more frequently to respond to rivals if needed. "We are re-merchandising, remodeling, enhancing our product range and are focused on gaining volume so more customers start their shopping at Aldi and we are able to complete their shopping lists moreso than we have in the past," said Hart, who added Aldi's U.S. sales have doubled in five years. Though it only accounts for only about 1.5 percent of the U.S. grocery market, Aldi is growing at 15 percent a year, whereas Wal-Mart currently controls about 22 percent of the market and its U.S. sales are estimated to grow about 2 percent this year, according to analysts. Aldi's growth potential has competitors taking notice. Reuters reported in February that Wal-Mart is running price tests in 11 states, pushing vendors to undercut Aldi and other rivals by 15 percent and is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2le6v0Y Price wars are roiling the entire retail sector - from department stores to discount chains - but it is nowhere as intense as in the grocery sector. Beyond Wal-Mart's move to match Aldi on price, German discount chain Lidl plans to open up to a 100 U.S. stores in a year, and Amazon.com Inc is aggressively testing out various brick-and-mortar grocery formats along with growing Amazon Fresh, its grocery delivery service. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qRbNT9 "We have not seen anything like this in the grocery sector in the United States before," said Scott Mushkin, managing director of Wolfe Research and a leading pricing analyst. Such heated competition risks a dangerous race to the bottom that could result in more retailers shutting their doors. "Given Aldi's expansion, Lidl's entry, Wal-Mart's response and Amazon's growing ambitions in this space, it is fair to expect a significant acceleration in the bankruptcy and liquidation cycle in this sector over the next few years," said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. For more on Wal-Mart's stock performance vs Amazon, click GOAL: EVERYDAY LOW PRICING Aldi, has a simple strategy to win more customers: everyday low pricing, according to Hart. "We don't confuse our customers with yo-yo discounts, sales, coupons and loyalty cards that require membership fees," he said. Four analysts and consultants contacted by Reuters confirmed Aldi now offers the lowest prices in private label consumer products in the states it operates, although they did say Wal-Mart is gaining ground in the states they are conducting price tests. Hart said Aldi's internal studies show its prices are 21 percent lower than its lowest-priced rivals and the discount retailer intends to keep the advantage at least that strong going forward. Depending on the product, Aldi's prices are cheaper than most rivals' private label items and even most branded items, analysts said. Hart said the 21 percent difference in price is calculated by monitoring competition on a basket of groceries. Aldi counts on its no-frills shopping experience to help keep costs low, and limits much of its inventory to items that sell in huge volume. But its focus on offering far more private label items than branded products is central to allowing Aldi to adjust pricing whenever it chooses, Hart said. Aldi and Wal-Mart do no break out the figures, but analysts including Mushkin and Flickinger say Aldi carries about 1,200 stock keeping units (SKUs) or type of products, 90 percent of which are private label. Wal-Mart stocks about 30,000-40,000 SKU's of products similar to ones Aldi sells, and only 30 percent of that are private labels. That different product mix can potentially make it more difficult for Wal-Mart to adjust prices because it often first needs buy-in from suppliers, and many times faces push back from packaged goods makers like Procter & Gamble, Unilever and even smaller brands. Such vendors fear steep discounting can erode the value of their brands, analysts said. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined comment saying the company would not comment on a competitor's strategy. P&G and Unilever did not respond to Reuters requests seeking comment. But the explosive growth in private label products is on the radar of Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Last month he told analysts that private label goods will play an even more important role as the widespread availability of branded products online will compress those products margins over time. "Aldi is disrupting the sector the way Wal-Mart did when they started," said Strategic Resource Group's Flickinger. STEPPING UP THE GAME Aldi's aggressive push to remodel its stores will allow it to add new private label merchandise in rapidly growing categories like fresh food. "The remodels are aimed at increasing our volumes which means more purchasing power that will help us lower prices further," said Scott Patton, Aldi's vice president of corporate buying. At a recent visit to an Aldi store in Wheaton, Illinois Reuters found newer-looking shelves, wider aisles and brighter lighting than a typical Aldi store. There was also a bigger assortment of fresh, organic, gluten-free products and antibiotic-free meats versus what it stocked earlier - categories Aldi said is growing the most rapidly at its stores. For example, its Simply Nature range of private-label products grew 53 percent to $300 million in 2016 from a year ago. Aldi has also opened stores close to Wal-Mart's supercenters to benefit from its budget-conscious shoppers. Its total store count of 2,000 stores by the end of next year will be about 42 percent of Wal-Mart's U.S. store base.

This is significantly less than the $1 billion settlement the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission were reportedly attempting to reach during the Obama administration, according to Reuters. Walmart instigated a wide-spread investigation to look into employee behavior across the globe. The company currently has about 2,300 employees working on compliance and ethics, the company says. The retail giant has not yet agreed to the settlement but is in the final stages of negotiation, according to reports. The company has already spent nearly $840 million on investigation and upgraded compliance operations. Last month, Walmart said it has spent more than $141 million on ethics and compliance systems since 2013 to ensure compliance is up-to-date and accurate. The company also created a board-level Global Ethics, Compliance & Risk Committee. Walmart didn’t say this was in response to the Mexico bribery scandal, instead saying its ethics and compliance focus is part of its efforts to grow in this “new era of retail” and to position the business for sustainable growth and shareholder returns. One challenge for companies that plead guilty to these types of crimes is that they can be blocked from winning government contracts, including access to the food stamps program which accounted for about $13 billion in sales last year, reports Retail Dive. But the article says that bribes or “gifts” are a common practice in parts of the world, necessary to obtain building permits and close other business deals. The Department of Justice has a guide on complying with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 to help companies adhere to business gift customs in other parts of the world while still remaining in compliance with laws and regulations. The settlement would require a plea of guilty by at least one Walmart subsidiary, but the parent company would not be charged, Fortune reports.     Categories Compliance, Environmental Management, Feature The New Energy Future - Challenges and Opportunities in Corporate Energy Management Sponsored By: Edison Energy    Leveraging EHS Software in Support of Culture Changes Sponsored By: VelocityEHS    Financing Environmental Resiliency and a Low-Carbon Future with Green Bonds Sponsored By: NSF International    eBook: Driving Visibility and Harmonization in EHS Practices Sponsored By: Sphera Solutions    Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top E-commerce Stocks to Buy Now For investors looking to ride one of the biggest trends of all, e-commerce provides intriguing possibilities. Looking at the top players can be a great place to start. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) May 10, 2017 at 8:46PM One way investors can achieve outsized gains is by catching an emerging trend and investing in key players as it evolves. To that end, there are very few trends that can match the enormous and growing potential of e-commerce. Online sales in the U.S. amounted to $322 billion in 2016, and that figure is expected to climb to $485 billion by 2021, according to Statista. While the current trend has been over 20 years in the making, it's still far from over and represents a compelling opportunity for investors. eMarketer recently released data detailing the top online retailers in the U.S., which provides a starting point for those interested in investing in e-commerce. The companies that took the top three spots were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). E-commerce represents a growing trend and a compelling opportunity. Image source: Pixabay.  The Big Kahuna No discussion of e-commerce is complete without addressing the 800-pound gorilla in the room. The largest player in e-commerce, bar none, is Amazon. Over the trailing-12-month period, Amazon had total revenue of nearly $136 billion, and e-commerce accounted for 70% of that amount, or nearly $95 billion. The company's online sales grew 20% last year, while total revenue grew 27%. In addition to e-commerce sales, Amazon has several other prosperous businesses, including its cloud-computing segment, Amazon Web Services; its Prime membership service; and a thriving artificial-intelligence segment led by Alexa, the company's virtual personal assistant. Alexa powers a growing number of Amazon products, including its Echo family of smart speakers, as well is the Fire TV, Fire Stick, and Fire Tablets. An Apple a day Apple may not immediately come to mind when you think e-commerce, but there are several factors at play. Many of the company's flagship phones and computer products are ordered online. Add to that its signature iTunes, app store and its growing Apple Pay payments business, and it's no wonder Apple took the second spot. Its e-commerce sales grew an estimated 40% to nearly $17 billion, which represents nearly 8% of Apple's total revenue of $218 billion over the trailing 12 months. CEO Tim Cook revealed in Apple's most recent earnings conference call that the company planned to double revenue from its services segment by the end of 2020, and that development should serve to increase the company's share of e-commerce as well.  Top picks in e-commerce. Image source: Getty Images. Down but not out With the rise of Amazon, many had discounted Wal-Mart in the realm of e-commerce, but that pronouncement may have been premature. While physical stores still account for 97% of Wal-Mart's revenue, its online sales grew 9% to over $14 billion for the trailing 12 months. The company signaled to investors that it was serious about e-commerce with its recent acquisition of online retailer Jet.com, as well as Modcloth and Moosejaw with their e-commerce sites. In the company's most recent earnings press release, Wal-Mart's president and CEO, Doug McMillon, stated: We're moving with speed to become more of a digital enterprise and better serve customers. We had a very solid fourth quarter, with U.S. comp sales growth of 1.8% and U.S. e-commerce GMV [gross merchandise volume] growth of 36%.  Final thoughts It's important to note that of the top 25 retailers eMarketer ranked by online sales, Amazon's total e-commerce contribution exceeded that of the next 24 combined. Data released by Slice Intelligence estimates that 43% of all online retail sales in 2016 happened on Amazon's website, and the e-commerce giant captured more than half of all online sales growth last year. It's unlikely that Amazon's position at the top will be in jeopardy anytime soon, but there is still plenty of growth for the industry, as online sales account for only 8.3% of total sales for last year.   Danny Vena owns shares of Amazon and Apple.

(Source: WMC Action News 5) Ibotta in action (Source: WMC Action News 5) MEMPHIS, TN (WMC) - Just threw your store receipt in the trash, didn't you? Dig in there and get it back. Then scan the barcode with one of the smart phone apps Kyle James, founder and savings guru of RatherBeShopping.com, recommends to score cash rebates. "With very little time or effort, you can scan that receipt with your smart phone, and you get a lot of free money back," James said. "You can take it out immediately with PayPal, or you can get a gift card. It's really a no-brainer." Starting with my favorite: * IBOTTA: Ibotta can be used with virtually any retailer's receipt on any brand product. You can use it as your shopping list, checking off items you would shop for anyway to register their rebates. "And this includes generic stuff, like milk, eggs, even produce," James said.  One of Andy Wise's secret shoppers, Shawn Anderson, put Ibotta to work at Target. She built a shopping list of items listed as carrying rebates at Target, including bread and milk with no brand restrictions. Her bill at check-out was a little more than $25. We pulled her cart aside, then used Ibotta to scan each product's barcode, then scan her receipt's barcode. Ibotta instantly rewarded her more than $12 in rebates and credits--although $10 of that was a bonus for being a first time user of the product. "I saved about half of what I spent!" Anderson exclaimed. "So I've got more money to shop!" * WALMART SAVINGS CATCHER APP: Walmart offers its own free receipt-scanning app exclusively for its store receipts. As long as you scan the receipt within seven days of purchase, James said you can save and accumulate rebates that you can apply to future Walmart purchases. "I'm up to about $68, and I can use that money to go back into Walmart, do back-to-school shopping or Christmas shopping, whatever it might be," he said. "After you scan your receipt, Walmart will check the pricing of the items you bought, compare them with the prices at local competitors, and if they find a lower price they’ll refund you the difference." * YAARLO. James said with the Yaarlo app, you can scan any store's receipt and get a flat cash-back percentage on your total order. "The more you use it, the higher that number gets," he explained. "With Yaarlo, you can also get cash back on gift cards. A lot of people buy gift cards with Yaarlo and get money back on that. Go in the store, use that gift card, then scan that receipt back in the app and get money back on the purchase with the gift card! So that's kind of double-dipping their savings." James has written a blog about these apps and other reasons why you should save your receipts. Link to it here. Copyright 2017 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

DailyTimes | Amazon trounces rivals in battle of the shopping ‘bots’ Toggle navigation    Home Pakistan World Business Sport Life & Style Opinion Blogs Today's Paper E-PAPER Archives Amazon trounces rivals in battle of the shopping ‘bots’ By:   agencies 11-May-17 Top News Suspect in Maulana Azam Tariq's murder apprehended 11-May-17 614 ISLAMABAD: The Federal In ... Over and out! 11-May-17 417 ISLAMABAD: Hours after a &lsqu ... SAN FRANCISCO: Earlier this year, engineers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc who track rivals' prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly stopped working. Losing access to Amazon.com Inc's data was no small matter. Like most big retailers, Wal-Mart relies on computer programs that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents can mean losing a sale. But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs - known commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. "Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard," said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any "campaign" to stop them. "Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site," she said. Still, she said, "we prioritize humans over bots as needed." Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars. The company's technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said. Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals' pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for even 20 minutes. "That's like a lifetime during Christmas," said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. "If we're not decently priced, we'll see it almost immediately" in sales declines. Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public websites - a process known as crawling or scraping - has many purposes. Alphabet Inc's Google, for example, constantly crawls the Web to gather information for its search engine results and to sell ads. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers. To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's known as a "CAPTCHA" - typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers.

Peter is a seafood industry veteran who has built a strong network amongst seafood buyers and suppliers over the course of a distinguished career in sustainability and procurement, including 17-years at Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, where he was responsible for implementing their seafood sustainability commitments. Peter will officially join the team on 22 May and is the first in this role for the ASC. He will lead commercial engagements and outreach for the programme in the United States and Canada. “We are excited to welcome Peter to our growing Americas team in this new position as Vice President of Market Development,” said Chris Ninnes, CEO of ASC.  “He will lead our retail and supply chain focused work, linking certified supply to a growing demand for ASC products in the market. With his appointment to the America’s team Peter joins a growing number of ASC staff in the region including Contessa Kellogg-Winters who heads up ASC's global communications team, Colin Brannen, Standards Technical Coordinator, whose main focus is on the development of new standards and Laurent Viguie, who leads our commercial work in Brazil.” The ASC has enjoyed rapid uptake around the globe, as retailers and farmers have embraced the programme, particularly in Europe, with great enthusiasm. With a growing number of staff now in place in North and South America, the ASC is poised to expand upon that success in the Americas. The region is not only the base of expanding fish farming operations for salmon, shrimp, tilapia, bivalves and many other fin fish, it also contains both the United States—the single most important  market outside of China for farmed fish—and Brazil, which is one the fastest growing market for farmed fish in the world. "The time is right for us to provide more direct support for many of our certified farms that are supplying into these important markets and respond directly to the encouragement that many of them have given us to take this step.” Esther Luiten, Commercial Director of the ASC said, “With the expanded ASC staff in the Americas, we will be able to service companies already working with our programme even better and expand interest amongst others. This is key to delivering on our mission to bring meaningful positive change for both the environment and the people who depend on aquaculture for their livelihoods. Our unique performance-based standards, together with the transparency of our programme and the easy to recognize ASC-logo on consumer facing products, are fundamental to our effort to promote and reward those producers who operate responsibly.”   “I am thrilled to be working back in the seafood sector with ASC,” said Peter.  “As I anticipate engaging with the retail and food service sector, I am so excited at the opportunities that ASC can bring to the market place. I look forward to seeing a lot of old friends in the coming months, along with making a lot of new ones.” Peter’s distinguished career spans more than two decades and notably began at Wal-Mart where he held a variety of critical roles and capacities including store operations, and senior buyer before rising to become Vice President and Divisional Manager for Deli and Seafood. While in this capacity, Peter was charged with developing the company’s seafood strategy for environmental sustainability. The resulting programme and work are well known throughout the seafood industry and NGO groups. Upon leaving Wal-Mart, Peter formed Epiphany Group LLC, a company that focuses on consulting to the deli and seafood industry on environmental and business solutions. Through Epiphany, Peter worked with some of the largest retailers in the world, both nationally and internationally, along with a plethora of manufacturers and NGOs. Previously, Peter served as Vice President of Global Market Development for the Global Aquaculture Alliance. He left GAA to re-join the retail industry when he took a role as Vice President of Bakery, Deli, Commercial Bread and Food Service with South Eastern Grocers (SEG). At SEG, Peter was responsible for all purchasing and procurement along with in store execution of merchandising and marketing plan for these areas. SEG is based in the south eastern US and encompasses retailers Winn-Dixie, Harveys, Fresco Y Mas, and BILO among other stores. The expansion of the ASC’s presence in the Americas is just one in a series of exciting developments for the ASC. In only seven years, the ASC has become recognised as a trusted scheme and has received high profile commitments as a certification of choice from numerous global retailers including Loblaw’s, IKEA, Carrefour, Coles, Lidl and Sysco Food Services. The first farm achieved certification in 2012 and there are now 456 farms certified to the ASC standard. At present, nearly a quarter of all the farmed salmon produced around the world is ASC certified and that number is growing each month due to the commitments of retailers, producers and organisations such as the Global Salmon Initiative, which represents over 50% of the global farmed salmon sector and have committed to certify all of their members to the ASC standards. In order to fulfil its mission to help move the aquaculture industry towards sustainably and social responsibility, the ASC has made and continues to make programmatic improvements. A new standard for seriola and cobia was introduced in 2016 and a number of other standards are being developed, including sea bream, sea bass and meagre and, jointly with the MSC, a standard for seaweed. The operational review has just been completed and updated standards for salmon and tilapia have been published. An updated standard for pangasius will follow shortly. In addition, the ASC is making progress on the ASC Aligned Farm Standard (previously referred to as the ASC Core Standard) and a new Feed Standard that will improve the sustainability of both marine and terrestrial ingredients for aqua feed will be released by the end of the year.  Source: The Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) Print Article Send Article Respond Permalink Share Article   del.icio.us   Facebook   Newsvine   LinkedIn   Reddit   StumbleUpon   Twitter Bakery  Dairy  Deli  Floral   Meat & Poultry  Produce  Seafood  Retail & Foodsvc             Got News?

WASHINGTON: Walmart Stores is preparing to pay roughly $300 million to resolve a long-running US investigation into allegations of bribery by its employees, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal, which the people said was being finalised and still could change, would amount to a significant concession by the US government. The Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission had sought at least twice that amount as recently as last year as they investigated bribery allegations linked to Walmart's business in countries including Mexico, China and India. The proposed penalty could be easily absorbed by the world's largest retailer. The proposed resolution would require a guilty plea by at least one Walmart subsidiary, said the people, who discussed details of the confidential negotiation on the condition of anonymity. The parent company wouldn't be charged, the people said. Instead, they said, it would enter into a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department and install an independent monitor to supervise the company's compliance with the settlement. Walmart declined to comment. Walmart's latest annual report didn't disclose any legal reserve and said the company didn't expect a settlement to have a material impact on its business. Representatives of the Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment. The case gained national prominence through articles in the New York Times detailing alleged bribery and a potential cover-up by high-level executives in Mexico. The reduced figure suggests that the case was difficult to prosecute once federal investigators gathered and scrutinized evidence, the people said. Much of the alleged misconduct uncovered in Mexico, which has the most Walmart stores outside the US, was too old to prosecute, people familiar with the matter have said. Also, most of the behavior under scrutiny involved dozens of small payments to government officials to speed zoning and building permits — not the type of vast corruption involving million dollar bribes as seen in other industries like mining, drilling and telecommunications, the people said. Because of the challenges in Mexico, the government tried to build stronger cases around conduct found in Brazil and India, two people familiar with the matter have said. The probe into China operations, in the final phase, didn't uncover widespread bribes to officials there, the people said.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UVhERa Timothy D Cook, CEO, Apple ALSO READ Tesla's Elon Musk slams Trump's immigration ban, later deletes tweets Google CEO Sundar Pichai pay doubled, gets $200 mn compensation in 2016 Google CEO Sundar Pichai gets $200-million pay package Google CEO Sundar Pichai made massive $200 million as compensation in 2016 Google betting big on AI, machine learning: Sundar Pichai In a year when technology leaders again seized the top spots among America’s highest-paid executives, a scion of Goldman Sachs Group stood out.   John S Weinberg, 60, whose surname had been synonymous with the bank for decades, left as co-vice chairman in 2015. A year later he joined Evercore Partners Inc., reaping sign-on awards worth $124 million as of December 31. That placed him third on the Bloomberg Pay Index, a ranking of the best-compensated US executives for 2016.   He joins an exclusive club increasingly dominated by bosses at companies that are, at best, just a few decades old. He’s surpassed only by Jet.com co-founder Marc Lore, whose $236.9 million in awarded compensation last year was largely composed of money Walmart Stores Inc paid to buy his company, and Apple Inc Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who received $150 million. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, 44, and Tesla Inc’s Elon Musk, 45, round out the top five.   An old-school corporate adviser whose father and grandfather led Goldman Sachs, Weinberg is an odd fit in that quintet. For Evercore, founded in 1995, it was a rare coup to land a 32-year veteran from one of Wall Street’s most storied firms — one who brings relationships with some of the biggest US companies. As Evercore’s new executive chairman, he also gives founder Roger Altman more freedom from daily responsibilities.   “The concept of nine-figure compensation numbers can be startling,” said Steven Hall, managing director at Steven Hall & Partners, a compensation-consulting firm. “But these are executives whose proven talents make them heavily sought after by other firms.”   Weinberg, who was awarded $22.9 million in 2013, the last year Goldman Sachs disclosed his pay, has a “proven track record as a leader of investment-banking businesses,” Evercore said in its annual proxy filing. His pay package for last year included $88.9 million in partnership units and restricted stock, of which about one-third is tied to performance, and the opportunity to collect $35 million in cash if targets are met. Some of it replaced awards from Goldman that were forfeited when he joined Evercore. It puts him ahead of other finance titans, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and KKR &  founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts, both 73.   Boards often heap big equity grants on executives when they join a company or sign new employment contracts, which can cause compensation to spike in that particular year. Examples include Weinberg and CBS CEO Les Moonves, 67, who’s ninth on the index and signed a deal that keeps him on the job until 2019. Similarly, executives who leave sometimes get severance and stock awards that vest ahead of schedule, such as Viacom Inc.’s ex-CEO Philippe Dauman, 63, who ranks eighth.   As a result, those three are less likely to be near the top of the index next year — a fate familiar to billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong. He took over as CEO of cancer researcher NantKwest Inc in 2015 and got stock options that vaulted him to the top of the ranking for that year. A $602,308 salary was his only compensation for 2016.   The Bloomberg Pay Index tracks the 200 highest-paid executives who appear in filings from companies that submit compensation details to US regulators. The index adds salaries, bonuses, perks, options, restricted shares and changes in pension values that a person was awarded for the most recent year. All equity awards are valued at each company’s fiscal year-end. The index’s figures can therefore differ from those disclosed in filings, in some cases by a lot, depending on stock-price changes and dividend payouts.   Recurring annual grants of stock or options are included in the year they’re bestowed, not when they vest. One-time grants, meant to pay an executive for several years, are allocated over the life of the award as explained in regulatory filings. The top-ranked executives or their representatives declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests for comment.   Apple’s Cook, 56, received a mega-grant of restricted stock units when he took over the iPhone-maker in 2011, scheduled to vest over 10 years. In filings, Apple’s board said the CEO wouldn’t receive additional equity compensation in those years. In that instance, the Bloomberg Pay Index annualized the award, which is partly tied to stock performance, over the intended lifetime. Cook’s 2016 payout was bigger than in previous years because of how Apple’s board structured the distribution of shares. Tesla’s Musk got a similar award in 2012 that’s meant to pay him for a decade.   Similarly, Charter Communications Inc. CEO Tom Rutledge, 63, got a 2016 pay package that the company valued at $98.5 million. The bulk came from option grants that are the only equity compensation he’ll get through 2020. The index allocates the options over five years and values his 2016 pay at $62.6 million, placing him 13th.   Other pay rankings that don’t annualize one-time awards are unlikely to feature Cook, whose 2016 compensation as reported in Apple’s most recent proxy statement was a comparatively meager $8.75 million. Rutledge, however, would likely end up near the top of any ranking for last year based on reported pay.   Certain executives show up on the index perennially, including Gamco Investors Inc.’s Mario Gabelli, 74, who ranks 10th with $76 million for 2016, followed by private-equity leaders Roberts and Kravis at about $64 million each. Those payouts are all cash, putting them on the opposite side of the spectrum from Pichai, whose pay from Google parent Alphabet Inc. is almost entirely in stock that’s granted every other year.   Wal-Mart’s Lore, who tops the Bloomberg Pay Index after selling Jet.com to the retail giant for $3.3 billion, makes for a special case. Most of his compensation is tied to the deal and composed of restricted shares that will fully vest by September 2021. While the stock qualifies as compensation for regulatory purposes, Wal-Mart’s board said in a proxy statement that it doesn’t consider it to be part of his pay. Excluding shares from the acquisition, Lore got $1.43 million in salary, bonus and perks for the most recent fiscal year.   Lore, who’s 45 and worked in finance before becoming an entrepreneur, might seem like a surprise find at the top of Bloomberg’s pay ranking. In 2015, two years after he left Amazon.com Inc. to start Jet.com, he wrote a LinkedIn post titled “Chasing Money Will Cripple Your Career.”   “Over my six years in finance, I learned to approach my career as an individual sport, where I was judged by the size of my bonus,” Lore wrote. “Ultimately, I have realized that success is not a measure of your salary, title or degree, but the impact you have on others and the collective happiness of the people you touch.” Bloomberg Read More On Weinberg | Best Paid Executives For 2016 | Goldman Sachs Group | Sundar Pichai | Elon Musk | International | Others PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Cover from Natural Calamities.

A year later he joined Evercore Partners Inc., reaping sign-on awards worth $124 million as of December 31. That placed him third on the Bloomberg Pay Index, a ranking of the best-compensated US executives for 2016.   He joins an exclusive club increasingly dominated by bosses at companies that are, at best, just a few decades old. He’s surpassed only by Jet.com co-founder Marc Lore, whose $236.9 million in awarded compensation last year was largely composed of money Walmart Stores Inc paid to buy his company, and Apple Inc Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who received $150 million. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, 44, and Tesla Inc’s Elon Musk, 45, round out the top five.   An old-school corporate adviser whose father and grandfather led Goldman Sachs, Weinberg is an odd fit in that quintet. For Evercore, founded in 1995, it was a rare coup to land a 32-year veteran from one of Wall Street’s most storied firms — one who brings relationships with some of the biggest US companies. As Evercore’s new executive chairman, he also gives founder Roger Altman more freedom from daily responsibilities.   “The concept of nine-figure compensation numbers can be startling,” said Steven Hall, managing director at Steven Hall & Partners, a compensation-consulting firm. “But these are executives whose proven talents make them heavily sought after by other firms.”   Weinberg, who was awarded $22.9 million in 2013, the last year Goldman Sachs disclosed his pay, has a “proven track record as a leader of investment-banking businesses,” Evercore said in its annual proxy filing. His pay package for last year included $88.9 million in partnership units and restricted stock, of which about one-third is tied to performance, and the opportunity to collect $35 million in cash if targets are met.

There is a Swagbucks Swag Code available today from 3 pm to 4 pm for 3 SB points! The Code is a Stealth Swag Code and is unique for each person. Go to Swagbucks.com HERE to see your unique code. Enter the code in the Swag Code box at Swagbucks.com HERE. New to Swagbucks? If you don't know about Swagbucks yet, it's the largest rewards website that gives people free gift cards for the things they do online (searching, shopping, watching videos, playing games and more). You earn points called SB for online activities and then you can cash them in for gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, CVS, Lowes, Starbucks, Paypal, Bass Pro Shops, Kohl's and so many more! It's free to join and I have earned a bunch of gift cards in the many years I have been a member. How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps (I earn about 80 - 100 SB a day doing this) * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Just this week, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Consumers May Be Shopping Online More Often, but They Are Taking Their Conversations Offline /EINPresswire.com/ — NEW YORK, NY–(Marketwired – May 10, 2017) – In a new, first of its kind analysis of combined offline and online consumer conversations, Engagement Labs released its TotalSocial® rankings on the top performing retail and apparel brands in the U.S. The rankings are based on Engagement Labs’ proprietary TotalSocial data, which continuously measures the most important drivers of brand performance with respect to social media and word of mouth conversations. Although it might seem that consumer shopping choices are greatly influenced by the digital world (influencers, fashion blogs, etc.), the analysis finds that out of more than 60 brands measured, conversations about retail and apparel brands still mostly happen offline, in face-to-face conversations, as opposed to online conversations taking place via social media. In fact, the tone or sentiment of a face-to-face conversation about a given retail or apparel brand is much more likely to be positive than if a consumer goes online. According to Engagement Labs’ data, Amazon is the clear TotalSocial leader in the retail and apparel category and is also a well-established Conversation Commander, which is defined as a brand that performs above average both offline and online. Amazon’s top rank is driven by its extremely strong online and offline volume scores, strong offline sentiment and its high online brand sharing performance, which is the sharing of branded content by consumers on social media. One major retailer that is notably missing from the top performers list is Walmart, despite driving a large volume of consumer conversations. Although Walmart is the most talked-about retail and apparel brand offline and has the third-highest online volume score, the brand struggles with low sentiment scores in terms of both online and offline conversations. In addition, the brand also fails to drive much consumer conversation surrounding its overall marketing efforts, or what Engagement Labs calls Brand Sharing. Taken together, these areas of deficiency offset its strong volume scores which cause it to fall out of the top ten as well as the top 20 ranking out of more than 60 brands measured. „Reflecting one of the biggest trends in the category, athleisure brands make a strong showing in the retail and apparel ranker with three of the top six TotalSocial positions, held by NIKE, adidas and Under Armour,” says Ed Keller, CEO of Engagement Labs. „We know that TotalSocial scores are predictive of future sales, and this strong performance by these athleisure brands helps to explain the double-digit growth for this sector when the rest of the apparel category is seeing very low growth. We will keep a careful eye on the trends, but from what we have seen over the past year, there is plenty of reason to believe that analysts’ projections for continued growth ahead are on the mark.” Engagement Labs found that Nordstrom is a stand-out brand in the ranking as it is the only one with a stronger online score than offline. In fact, its online score tops the category. Additionally, both Nordstrom’s online volume and online sentiment scores are stronger as compared to its offline scores. As a brand that prides itself on reputable customer service and its in-store experience, Nordstrom’s TotalSocial scores reveal how that experience is making its way into online conversations as well. The strong online performance is a reflection of a strategy designed to appeal to millennials, which integrates digital and cross-channel shopping and is helping to drive positive sales growth for Nordstrom at a time when other retailers are struggling and closing stores. In contrast to Nordstrom, Costco has the largest gap among the top ten in favor of offline conversations versus online. Brands such as Old Navy, Home Depot, Target and Bed Bath & Beyond make the top of the list in terms of their offline scores, but are held back by lower online scores, which preclude them from making the TotalSocial top ten. Additionally, as the inverse to this trend, a handful of brands make the online top ten, but are prevented from making the overall top ten rankings due to lower offline performance — including H&M, Best Buy, NIKE’s Air Jordan and Kohl’s. Engagement Labs defines these brands — which perform considerably better offline than online, or vice versa — as Social Misfits, emphasizing that these brands can drive better consumer engagement and sales by learning the lessons of what drives strong performance in one channel and applying those lessons to the other.

Deanna Pogorelc | May 10, 2017 Natural products shoppers are no strangers to certification logos—they’re used to looking for the USDA Organic, Non-GMO Project or Certified B Corp seals. But another logo is more present than ever on companies' packaging, marketing materials and in booth displays. It’s a small, two-line logo that says "women owned." It signifies that a company is majority owned and operated by a female leader. It’s not actually that new—the logo was unveiled back in 2014—but its increasing use is perhaps indicative of a larger movement within the CPG industry to support more women entrepreneurs and commit to diversity across suppliers. Related: Conscious consumption and the values connection [NEXT Forecast 2017] The logo was created by the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council, WEConnect International and Walmart as a way to bring consumer recognition to products created by women-owned businesses, and in turn help those businesses continue to grow. In order to be eligible to utilize the logo, companies must be certified through WBENC or WEConnect. WBENC says it has certified some 14,000 business and is adding about 500 new ones each year. For those companies, the benefits of being part of that network take several different shapes. "We think it’s good for business and positive for our customers to know,” said Courtney Hamilton, administrative assistant at Southern Valley Produce, a family-owned produce company in Norman Park, Georgia. The company sought women-owned certification in 2010 and displays the logo on its grab-and-go vegetables. The certification was a no-brainer, Hamilton said, since her grandmother Wanda (who started the business with her husband and two sons in 1987) was already the majority owner. "It puts us in the minority category, because many companies are male-owned and operated. It gives us a unique niche to say that we’re different and, while we operate with men, women have a place here too." Women account for less than a quarter of management positions in businesses globally, according to research by Morgan Stanley. They’re also underrepresented on boards—in the U.S., boards comprise only 18 percent women. Yet more gender diversity, particularly in corporate settings, can translate to increased productivity, greater innovation, better decision-making and higher employee retention and satisfaction, the firm concluded in its 2017 Investor’s Guide to Gender Diversity. And companies are taking notice. In March, nine Fortune 500 companies including Walmart, Campbell Soup and General Mills made headlines when they went public with an initiative to source more from women-owned businesses. But there’s another piece to this, and it’s the notion that consumers are getting more curious about the stories behind the products they purchase. They want to know how companies are sourcing their ingredients, and what those ingredients actually are. They want to know who is behind the brand, and if they’re working to make the world a better place. And, since women drive at least 70 percent of consumer purchases, the women-owned logo gives brands a way to immediately connect with those powerful shoppers. "I think many of the items are ‘relating’ to the consumer somehow differently, and there is a perceived product or service quality, as well as more women are wanting to support other women,” said Pamela Prince-Eason, CEO of the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council. For Southern Valley Produce, and for tahini brand Soom Foods, their women-owned certification gives them a bridge to tell customers and consumers that they are family-owned, to show that they’re about relationships and to communicate that they are values-based. Soom was founded by three hard-working sisters. That’s an important part of the company's story, and the certification helps it tell that story. "We came from a family of family business, so it was just something that resonated very strongly with us from a values perspective," said CEO Shelby Zitelman Stamm. “We were also just listening to the market—people were very interested in the fact that we were sisters and were able to work together and build this business together, so we’ve owned that.” Soom obtained its women-owned certification last year, when it also made a commitment to focus on serving the foodservice industry. That underscores the value of telling the story not just to consumers but to business partners as well. “Many of the retail customers that we are currently doing business with or hope to do business with have their own initiatives to work with women,” said Michele Meloy Burchfield, cofounder of Blume Honey Water. Burchfield and her longtime friend Carla Frank cofounded Blume to bring artisanal waters crafted from bee-friendly honey and natural flavors to the market. They view the certification as not just a business advantage but as a celebration of who they are as friends and as a company. “There’s such a beautiful transformation taking place over decades, when you think about how women have taken steps professionally and personally and melded those together to form businesses and to take risks that they otherwise wouldn’t,” Burchfield said. “And I think that there are women behind us now that recognize that and celebrate it and support it.” TAGS: General 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Huff joined Wal-Mart in 1994 as an intern and spent more than seven years as a buyer before being elevated into middle and then senior management roles such as vice president of merchandising for snack and beverages to senior vice president and general merchandising manager for consumables.

The petite blond stands in the parking lot of Roseville Towne Center, a strip mall with a Wal-Mart, a Dollar Tree, a jewelry pawn shop and what was Hillary Clinton’s campaign office, where a bright yellow sidewalk tent now hawks free cell phones. A few people wait to sign up for one. Wilson explained: “I’ve worked there for 17 years. I was on vacation when I got a text from my boss on Good Friday to call him. He told me don’t come back to work on Monday, you no longer have a job.” Of her ability to get another job as a purchaser and customer service professional, she sounds pragmatic, saying: “I’m confident I’ll find something. I am an incredibly hard worker, I have had two job interviews this week, it will happen.” Of her town’s fortunes, she sounds blunt. “It was once middle class, now I would call it lower middle class,” she says. Of Hillary Clinton having a campaign office here — only to skip visiting the struggling working-class manufacturing town and send in Hollywood surrogates Ted Danson and his wife Mary Steenburgen, who scolded voters about climate change — she is sardonic. “Your message and your optics are everything when you are trying to persuade people to buy something from you or vote for you. Does this look like somewhere that needs to be schooled on climate change?” she asks. “That is why she did not win Michigan. No matter who she chooses to blame, it is time for her to really look inward.” Roseville is in Macomb County, the heart of Reagan Democrat country, of socially conservative white Democrats who are anxious about their economic future. It’s like so many places where candidate Donald Trump exceeded expectations — an economically anxious, culturally conservative tight-knit community that doesn’t understand how elite-driven change will benefit it. For the Clinton campaign to send Hollywood liberals here in the closing days of the race to preach about climate change was tone-deaf on a Guinness World Records level. The decisions we make on how to communicate to people are fragile: They can change lives, cause chaos and regret, or take us to a better place by tapping into something deep. Last week, two politicians made news for the ways they communicated to Americans: Clinton’s words were crafted, deliberate and dishonest; President Trump’s words were a string of thoughts bouncing everywhere, with no craft and no massaging and great gaps of context. The press reacted wistfully to the former. To the latter, it went into full meltdown. Again. Michael Kinsley once observed, “A gaffe is when a politician tells the truth.” By this definition — and this is how the press appears to view it — Trump speaks in gaffes. Now, that doesn’t mean Trump is always accurate in what he says, but he says (or tweets) what he truly thinks at that moment. We in the press are just not accustomed to this type of honesty. Most politicians are loath to veer from carefully vetted talking points; they don’t commit gaffes because they never tell you what they really think. Instead, they talk around the point or tell you what they think you want to hear. Trump never does this. Trump’s willingness to say what he thought during the 2016 campaign endeared him to his supporters. Unlike the press, Trump supporters understood that Trump shot from the hip and would make mistakes. To many of them, his walking back of some of what he said makes sense and is a sign of learning, not of duplicity. Compare this to Clinton’s interview Monday with Christiane Amanpour. She conceded to mistakes during the campaign, said she is writing her “confessions” in a new book and seeking “absolution,” and then blamed it all on FBI Director James Comey. Bruce Haynes, founding partner of the bipartisan Purple Strategies consulting firm, calls this typical political doublespeak. He says: “She may as well have said, ‘Wasn’t on me, bro.’ She says she takes responsibility but, in the next breath, she blames James Comey, WikiLeaks, Vladimir Putin. and who knows who else.” “Clinton neglected to include things like calling voters ‘deplorable’ and ‘irredeemable’ and failing to adequately campaign in states like Michigan, where voters had the highest levels of economic anxiety and the biggest questions about what her policies would do to help,” Haynes said. In a year defined by a backlash against elites, the Clinton campaign closed the race in Michigan with elite cultural figures talking about elite social issues. It couldn’t have gotten it more wrong. Last October, Danson and Steenburgen addressed 35 people in this strip mall, many of them Clinton campaign volunteers and local elected officials. At the same time, Trump was planning his sixth and seventh trips to manufacturing towns in Michigan, and the local Trump headquarters had lines outside its doors of people wanting yard signs, despite the Republican nominee being 6 points down in most polls just days before the election. Words delivered with honesty, despite being loose with facts, sometimes are more appealing to people than a perfectly crafted message that is dishonest at its core. That’s why Wilson chose Trump over Clinton. And that’s why Trump is president and Clinton is not.

Wednesday, May 10, 2017 Publix Ties Wegmans As America's Favorite Grocery Store, Walmart Last Publix and Wegmans are America’s favorite grocery retailers, tying for first place while Walmart came in last, according to a consumer study of more than 12,700 shoppers conducted by Market Force Information. Publix, which ranked second for the past four years, earned a first-place tie with Wegmans, with each scoring 77% on Market Force’s Customer Loyalty Index. Trader Joe’s narrowly missed the lead spot with 76%, and H-E-B made the top three for the first time with 69% - a 10% increase from 2016. ALDI and Harris Teeter rounded out the top five with 68% and 66%, respectively. Florida-based Publix Super Markets is the largest employee-owned grocery chain in the country and has been named to Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For every year since the list’s inception. The chain’s engaged and friendly associates help deliver on its “Where shopping is a pleasure” motto. Wegmans, founded in 1916, is known for its fresh produce, reasonable prices and massive stores. The New York-based chain is expanding steadily and, with a focus on employee training to ensure customers have a great experience, creating superfans eager for a new location to open near their home. Publix Stores Are Cleanest, Trader Joe’s Cashiers Are Most Courteous  What sets one grocer apart from the others in shoppers’ minds? For one, being able to find the items they want, a category where Publix was a clear leader. Publix was also found to have the cleanest stores and fastest checkout speeds. Wegmans ranked highest for its specialty department service, and a close second for item availability. Trader Joe’s was found to have the most courteous cashiers. ALDI once again led for value, followed by WinCo Foods and Costco. Harris Teeter, Hy-Vee, ALDI and H-E-B all fared well in the rankings, while Walmart landed at the bottom in all categories but one. Convenience is Driving Tech Trends Increasingly, shoppers are filling up their shopping carts online rather than in the store. Market Force found services such as click-and-collect (buy online and pick up at store) and online ordering with home delivery are being embraced across all age groups, particularly millennials. The use of click-and-collect has more than doubled since 2016, with 9% saying they’ve tried it, compared to 4% in 2016. Of those, 78% were satisfied or very satisfied with the experience. Most click-and-collect shoppers use the service at Walmart, followed by Kroger, Sam’s Club and Harris Teeter.  Twenty-six percent are frequent users, taking advantage of click-and-collect at least monthly. Home delivery services are also growing in popularity – 18% said they’ve used grocery home delivery, compared to 15% in 2016. Most are using the service through general online retailers such as Amazon and Jet. However, one-fifth were less than satisfied with the experience, leaving ample room for improvement.

Burke’s office offers free adjustments to its patients if they buy their glasses online. Other shops are charging fees for adjustments to glasses purchased elsewhere. Andy Marso amarso@kcstar.com Health Care May 10, 2017 10:17 AM As people buy more eyeglasses online, opticians adjust — and make adjustments By Andy Marso amarso@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Optometrists who also sell eyeglasses out of their practices have long faced competition from other brick-and-mortar stores: large chains like LensCrafters, retail giants like Wal-Mart and even the corner drug store selling readers. But now they’re facing a new challenge: glasses bought online, and how frequently they need adjustments. “Competition isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” said Todd Fleischer, the executive director of the Kansas Optometric Association. “But it is affecting the traditional model and how they do business.” According to a market research report by IBISWorld, online sales of eyeglasses and contact lenses grew by about 7 percent per year between 2011 and 2016. That pace is expected to slow, but it’s still taking a chunk out of local optometrists’ revenues. It’s also forcing them to make tough customer service decisions, Fleischer said. Many optometry practices offer free eyeglass adjustments to their patients, regardless of whether they buy the glasses at the practice. Online sales are testing those policies. “That’s something where the doctors have to determine how they handle that,” Fleischer said. With online sellers advertising prescription eyewear for as low as $7, there’s little risk to consumers in ordering without a try-on. But Amanda Carr, the optical manager at Hawks, Besler & Rogers Optometry in Overland Park, said those often need a lot of adjustments. “We have a lot of issues with measurements,” Carr said. “If they’re too tight we can do our best, but there’s really no easy fix for that.” Still, she and her colleagues will try to fix them at no cost, with one caveat. “We do have them sign a waiver if there’s any breakage because a lot of times the quality of products is not up to par,” Carr said. Jason Rogers, an optometrist at Carr’s office, said he and his partners are focused on patients’ overall eye health needs and don’t begrudge them the opportunity to shop elsewhere for their glasses. There’s no plan yet for them to charge extra for adjustments. “We have had the philosophy of trying to take care of whatever needs someone has when they come in, whether they purchase them here or elsewhere,” Rogers said. “(But) I know there are offices out there that actually have a fee for that; to look at them or to troubleshoot them if they weren’t purchased there.” Rogers said his office tries to keep a wide selection of glasses in stock to keep customers from going elsewhere, including online. Carr said online sales haven’t affected their office as much as others because it’s a “mature practice” with a lot of longtime customers. But her sister is an optician at a practice that has been harder hit by online sales. Fleischer said online is starting to play into decisions about whether to start up or expand new practices. “I think it’s definitely a factor in what’s going on in the (business) environment,” Fleischer said. “It’s just like every other business they have to adapt (to the internet). I wouldn’t call it necessarily a game-changer, but it’s something that definitely factors into their decisions.” Andy Marso: 816-234-4055, @andymarso LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email a day ago Brown recluse spider bite causes necrosis in man's leg 2:58 a day ago Brown recluse spider bite causes necrosis in man's leg 3:44 4 days ago Mother details son’s struggle with mental illness 0:36 21 days ago New apps can record patient's wishes in case of emergency View More Video Health Care Overland Park makes Medscape’s top 10 cities for doctors Black & Veatch golf tournament raises $350,000 for Children’s Mercy genomics Brown recluse bite in Missouri a cautionary tale for patients and providers KC company leading clinical trials on diabetic kidney disease Price shopping for surgery?

New Development Who Else Hates to Grocery Shop? By Marc Elliott May 10, 2017 8:54 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Kevork Djansezian, Getty Images I had a conversation with a co-worker a few weeks ago regarding my utter hatred for grocery shopping. It’s a weekly occurrence that I simply detest. I don’t mind the actual shopping for food part so much. Hey, I love food as much as the next guy. I just can’t stand putting up with the circus in the aisles. I can’t begin to tell you how much it warms my heart when two people who haven’t seen each other since the 8th grade reunite in the cereal aisle and decide to strike up a 25 minute conversation right in front of the box of Lucky Charms I want to buy. That’s truly a special moment for everyone else shopping in the store that would like to wrap up the whole grocery shopping experience in under three hours. I guess my real disdain for the grocery store rests in the fact that my wife insists we go grocery shopping every Sunday during the early afternoon. I realize it would be a much simpler, and probably a much more enjoyable process if we were to go shopping on say a weeknight, or even early in the morning or later at night on the weekend. But who wants to hunt down a jar of Ragu at 8:30 on a Sunday night? I know I don’t. So what can a person who loathes grocery shopping do? Well, if you don’t mind letting someone else do the grocery shopping for you, there’s always that option. I know the Sioux Falls Hy-Vee stores have their Hy-Vee Aisles Online service. They’ve had the service up and running for some time now. It’s extremely handy, and many people seem to enjoy it. They’ll even deliver your groceries for you if you live inside their designated delivery area. Now I see KSFY TV is reporting that on Tuesday, two of the Sioux Falls Walmart locations just jumped into the grocery shopping for you business as well. The Walmart Supercenter located at 7821 South Minnesota Avenue and the Sioux Falls Walmart Supercenter at 5521 East Arrowhead Parkway now are offering a grocery pickup service of their own. Much like other grocery shopping online services, customers can visit the stores online website, or through the Walmart Grocery mobile app. You then enter in your zip code to select a local store and begin creating a shopping list. After that’s done, you proceed to checkout at which time you choose a time to pickup your order. Once all of that is complete, a trained personal shopper goes to work carefully selecting the freshest produce, meats and other items on your shopping list. Then, you simply swing by the Walmart Supercenter at your designated time, park in one of the reserved online grocery shopping parking spots, call a special number, and store employee runs all your fiddles out to the car. Easy-peasy. No longer do you have to put up with the class reunion going on in aisle number 5!  Both stores options are definitely something to consider if you happen to be like me, and would rather be audited by the IRS each year, than being forced to play bumper carts with Betty and Agnes every Sunday in an attempt to get a box of mini donuts.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The Y Partners with Leanne Brown, Author of Good and Cheap, to Raise Awareness for Free Summer Food Program, Serving Nearly 300,000 Youth this Summer Partnership aims to educate parents and community members on healthy, affordable food options available to ensure fewer kids and teens go hungry this summer CHICAGO, May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- YMCA of the USA (Y-USA) will partner with Leanne Brown, author of the cookbook Good and Cheap, to raise awareness for the Y's Summer Food Program. The free program, estimated to serve over 7.2 million meals and snacks to nearly 300,000 youth this summer, provides nutritious food, as well as activities, to keep kids' minds and bodies active when the school year ends. The partnership will aim to educate parents and community members on healthy, affordable food options available to ensure fewer kids and teens go hungry this summer. The Summer Food Program, in its seventh year, is part of an existing national partnership between Y-USA and the Walmart Foundation to address child hunger, which is more prevalent in communities during the summertime. Made possible by a 15 month, $7.1 million grant from the Walmart Foundation, the Y is better able to reach kids in need. The Summer Food Program is part of the Y's year-round effort to address child hunger; during the school year, the Y's Afterschool Meal Program provides a combination of learning activities and healthy meals and/or snacks at the end of the school day. Leanne Brown's best-selling cookbook Good and Cheap provides an avenue to healthy and affordable meals by educating readers on how to prepare nutritious recipes to eat on $4/day—the average amount of money a person receives from the government's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Brown's understanding of the need to provide nourishment and access to food to those who need it most makes her a powerful partner to help raise awareness for the Summer Food Program. "We are thrilled to partner with Leanne Brown for our Summer Food Program this year," said Stacey McDaniel, National Spokesperson for the Anti-hunger Initiative at Y-USA. "Leanne's dedication to resolving the food crisis in America makes her a natural fit for a partner with our organization. Together we will promote awareness for the imminent danger of child hunger in America and work to educate communities across the U.S. about solutions to this problem." As part of the partnership, McDaniel, together with Brown will visit multiple Y locations across the U.S. to share insights about the program and ways to shop for healthy foods, prepare basic dishes on a limited food budget, and utilize what people may already have in their pantries to make wholesome meals. Y locations include: YMCA of Greater Boston YMCA of Greater Rochester YMCA of Middle Tennessee YMCA of Greater Indianapolis The Y is committed to youth development, healthy living and social responsibility and is working to ensure all kids have access to nutritious meals. Available in nearly 1,900 locations nationwide, the goal of the program is to keep children healthy, active and well-nourished all summer long. Members of the community living in the vicinity of each of the Y locations listed above are encouraged to contact their local Y to learn more about these visits and to become involved.

GOOD AND CHEAP is more than a book of recipes. It is a book of ideas, made to prove that cooking has a powerfully positive effect.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 10 May 2017 | MYT 8:00 PM Amazon trounces rivals in battle of the shopping bots Amazon's mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success as its fast delivery, huge product catalog and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: Earlier this year, engineers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc who track rivals' prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly stopped working. Losing access to Amazon.com Inc's data was no small matter. Like most big retailers, Wal-Mart relies on computer programs that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even US$0.50 (RM2.17) can mean losing a sale. But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs – known commonly as robots or bots – thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorised to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. "Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard," said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any "campaign" to stop them. "Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site," she said. Still, she said, "we prioritise humans over bots as needed." Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars (see graphic). The company's technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the Internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit US$100bil (RM434.7bil) in annual sales in 2015 – faster than any company in history, it said. Brave new world Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals' pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods, including bots, to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for even 20 minutes. "That’s like a lifetime during Christmas," said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. "If we're not decently priced, we'll see it almost immediately" in sales declines. Disguised as humans  Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public websites – a process known as crawling or scraping – has many purposes. Alphabet Inc's Google, for example, constantly crawls the Web to gather information for its search engine results and to sell ads. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers (see diagram). To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's known as a "CAPTCHA" – typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. "It is an arms race," said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. "Every week or every month, there's some new approach from both sides." Amazon's maneuver that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim at a specialised Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers – a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Wal-Mart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major US retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently – a De'Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer's website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon's price for the De'Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10%, from a low of US$80.06 (RM348.02) to US$88.16 (RM383.23). Swarming with bots Despite Amazon's capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80% of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites. In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Wal-Mart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Wal-Mart employees said. Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organise rivals' data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one US patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web pages. "Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it," said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. That "isn't the case for most retailers." — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Portland, Oregon, authorises subpoena over Uber software tool Uber says to partner with taxis in Myanmar expansion drive Taiwan's Foxconn to begin construction on US plant in second half of 2017 China’s tech money heads for Israel as US welcome wanes Apple tops US$800bil market cap for first time Seven reasons to get an iPhone now Others Also Read China's Xi speaks with new South Korean president about North Korea Coffee festival perks up interest Group launches startup incubator advertisement Latest News Pay for Lazada purchases at 7-Eleven EU to tackle complaints over tech companies’ trading practices LVMH boosts digital profile with multiple brands website China’s tech money heads for Israel as US welcome wanes Uber says to partner with taxis in Myanmar expansion drive Most Viewed in Tech Nissan is offering a free drone with its latest car China’s tech money heads for Israel as US welcome wanes LVMH boosts digital profile with multiple brands website Microsoft aims to make artificial intelligence mainstream Uber says to partner with taxis in Myanmar expansion drive Cannes says 2017 is first and last for Netflix unless it changes Kanye West exits social media Taiwan's Foxconn to begin construction on US plant in second half of 2017 Tesla starts taking orders for premium solar roofs Your password is terrible and everyone wants to fix that Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

May 10, 2017 08:30 ET Consumers May Be Shopping Online More Often, but They Are Taking Their Conversations Offline Engagement Labs' TotalSocial® Rankings Uncover Top U.S. Retail and Apparel Brands Based on Word of Mouth and Social Media Conversations; Analysis Finds Online Retailer Amazon is Also an Offline Leader NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - May 10, 2017) - In a new, first of its kind analysis of combined offline and online consumer conversations, Engagement Labs released its TotalSocial® rankings on the top performing retail and apparel brands in the U.S. The rankings are based on Engagement Labs' proprietary TotalSocial data, which continuously measures the most important drivers of brand performance with respect to social media and word of mouth conversations. Although it might seem that consumer shopping choices are greatly influenced by the digital world (influencers, fashion blogs, etc.), the analysis finds that out of more than 60 brands measured, conversations about retail and apparel brands still mostly happen offline, in face-to-face conversations, as opposed to online conversations taking place via social media. In fact, the tone or sentiment of a face-to-face conversation about a given retail or apparel brand is much more likely to be positive than if a consumer goes online. According to Engagement Labs' data, Amazon is the clear TotalSocial leader in the retail and apparel category and is also a well-established Conversation Commander, which is defined as a brand that performs above average both offline and online. Amazon's top rank is driven by its extremely strong online and offline volume scores, strong offline sentiment and its high online brand sharing performance, which is the sharing of branded content by consumers on social media. One major retailer that is notably missing from the top performers list is Walmart, despite driving a large volume of consumer conversations. Although Walmart is the most talked-about retail and apparel brand offline and has the third-highest online volume score, the brand struggles with low sentiment scores in terms of both online and offline conversations. In addition, the brand also fails to drive much consumer conversation surrounding its overall marketing efforts, or what Engagement Labs calls Brand Sharing. Taken together, these areas of deficiency offset its strong volume scores which cause it to fall out of the top ten as well as the top 20 ranking out of more than 60 brands measured. "Reflecting one of the biggest trends in the category, athleisure brands make a strong showing in the retail and apparel ranker with three of the top six TotalSocial positions, held by NIKE, adidas and Under Armour," says Ed Keller, CEO of Engagement Labs. "We know that TotalSocial scores are predictive of future sales, and this strong performance by these athleisure brands helps to explain the double-digit growth for this sector when the rest of the apparel category is seeing very low growth. We will keep a careful eye on the trends, but from what we have seen over the past year, there is plenty of reason to believe that analysts' projections for continued growth ahead are on the mark." Engagement Labs found that Nordstrom is a stand-out brand in the ranking as it is the only one with a stronger online score than offline. In fact, its online score tops the category. Additionally, both Nordstrom's online volume and online sentiment scores are stronger as compared to its offline scores. As a brand that prides itself on reputable customer service and its in-store experience, Nordstrom's TotalSocial scores reveal how that experience is making its way into online conversations as well. The strong online performance is a reflection of a strategy designed to appeal to millennials, which integrates digital and cross-channel shopping and is helping to drive positive sales growth for Nordstrom at a time when other retailers are struggling and closing stores. In contrast to Nordstrom, Costco has the largest gap among the top ten in favor of offline conversations versus online. Brands such as Old Navy, Home Depot, Target and Bed Bath & Beyond make the top of the list in terms of their offline scores, but are held back by lower online scores, which preclude them from making the TotalSocial top ten. Additionally, as the inverse to this trend, a handful of brands make the online top ten, but are prevented from making the overall top ten rankings due to lower offline performance -- including H&M, Best Buy, NIKE's Air Jordan and Kohl's. Engagement Labs defines these brands -- which perform considerably better offline than online, or vice versa -- as Social Misfits, emphasizing that these brands can drive better consumer engagement and sales by learning the lessons of what drives strong performance in one channel and applying those lessons to the other.

The retailer has raised its free shipping threshold to $35, up from $25, CNBC reports. The company made the quiet increase last Sunday, Target (tgt) told CNBC. The decision comes just after other retail and e-commerce giants—like Walmart (wmt) and Amazon, for example—have slashed their free shipping thresholds. Amazon (amzn) cut its threshold by $10—non-Prime members now have to pay a minimum of $25 to get free shipping, instead of $35 perviously. And in January, Walmart dropped its free shipping threshold to $35 for two-day shipping. "Target regularly reviews and adjusts our online shipping policies and practices to better serve guests and enhance our business" the retailer said in a statement to CNBC, which notes that there was no press release announcing the change. Target added that only “a small percentage of Target.com purchases are less than $35, so the majority of orders will continue to ship for free.” The change won't affect Target's REDcard credit or debit cardholders, according to CNBC. They will still receive free shipping online sans a threshold, as well as 5% off every purchase.

Like most big retailers, Walmart (wmt) relies on computer programs that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents can mean losing a sale. But a new tactic by Amazon (amzn) to block these programs—known commonly as robots or bots—thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog, and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. "Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard," said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce.

He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any "campaign" to stop them. "Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site," she said. Still, she said, "we prioritize humans over bots as needed." Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Walmart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars. The company's technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015—faster than any company in history, it said. BRAVE NEW WORLD Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals' pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for even 20 minutes. "That’s like a lifetime during Christmas," said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. "If we're not decently priced, we'll see it almost immediately" in sales declines. DISGUISED AS HUMANS Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public websites—a process known as crawling or scraping—has many purposes. Alphabet's Google (googl), for example, constantly crawls the Web to gather information for its search engine results and to sell ads. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers. To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's known as a "CAPTCHA"—typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. "It is an arms race," said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. "Every week or every month, there's some new approach from both sides." Amazon's maneuver that halted Walmart in January took aim at a specialized Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers—a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Walmart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major U.S. retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently—a De'Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer's website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon's price for the De'Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10%, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16. SWARMING WITH BOTS Despite Amazon's capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80% of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites. In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services, and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Walmart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Walmart employees said. Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organize rivals' data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one U.S. patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web pages. "Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it," said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group.

Skip to content comics cosplay tv/film games Submit tip Contact CGC Insider Search for: Batman 66 Gets The Action Figure Line It Should Have Decades Ago Thanks To Funko Posted by Jeremy Konrad May 9, 2017 2 Comments Back in January we got our first look at the upcoming wave of Batman 66 3 3/4 inch action figures from Funko. Today, we have packaged shots of each figure. And they look pretty awesome. Coming to stores this June, these will be available at all of the standard places one would buy Funko products: Walmart, Hot Topic, Walmart, Toys R Us, and your local comic shop. Whenever batman 66 product is offered, people order it in waves so these shouldn’t be too difficult to get your hands on, but there is a chase version of Mr. Freeze available as well at a 1:6 ratio, so that may prove to be a bit tougher. People have been having a lot of puck getting chases by placing online orders with Amazon on other Funko products, so you may want to try your luck there. From the Funko blog: These fully poseable action figures feature nine points of articulation and are 3.75” tall! This series features classic Batman, Catwoman, Batgirl, King Tut, Mr. Freeze and Bookworm! Look for the Mr. Freeze chase – A 1-in-6 rarity! They are perfect for your collection! Coming this Summer!   These have full articulation, so they will be a little different from the 5 POA figures put out by both Funko and Super 7 in the past, and they look to have wonderful sculpts to them. The standout here looks to be King Tut, the detail on him is awesome. I love all the little accessories that come with each figure as well. Not putting Joker or Robin in the first wave is a bold choice, but I love the addition of Bookworm and Batgirl instead. We also know that a Batmobile and Robin are coming, although that has not been dated yet. Check out Funko’s Batman Classic Figure hub here for more info.   About the Author Latest Posts Contact About Jeremy Konrad Jeremy Konrad loves Star Wars and collecting action figures and collectibles.

Photo: AFP PHOTO / Emmanuel Dunand SAN FRANCISCO – Earlier this year, engineers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc who track rivals' prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly stopped working. Losing access to Amazon.com Inc's data was no small matter. Like most big retailers, Wal-Mart relies on computer programmes that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents can mean losing a sale. But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programmes - known commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorised to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalogue and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. "Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard," said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. READ: Amazon looks to the sky to store products A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any "campaign" to stop them. "Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site," she said. Still, she said, "we prioritise humans over bots as needed." Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars.  The company's technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said. Brave new world Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals' pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for even 20 minutes. "That’s like a lifetime during Christmas," said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. "If we're not decently priced, we'll see it almost immediately" in sales declines. Disguised as humans Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public websites - a process known as crawling or scraping - has many purposes. Alphabet Inc's Google, for example, constantly crawls the Web to gather information for its search engine results and to sell ads. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defences. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers.  To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's known as a "CAPTCHA" - typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defences, disguising their computer programmes as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. "It is an arms race," said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. "Every week or every month, there's some new approach from both sides." Amazon's manoeuvre that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim at a specialised Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers - a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Wal-Mart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major US retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently - a De'Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer's website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon's price for the De'Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16. Swarming with bots Despite Amazon's capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80 percent of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites. In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Wal-Mart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Wal-Mart employees said. READ: Disruption in Amazon's cloud service ripples through internet Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organise rivals' data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one US patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web pages.  "Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it," said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. That "isn't the case for most retailers." AFP Comment Now! Discussion Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Losing access to Amazon.com Inc's data was no small matter. Like most big retailers, Wal-Mart relies on computer programs that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents can mean losing a sale. But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs - known commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. "Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard," said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any "campaign" to stop them. "Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site," she said. Still, she said, "we prioritize humans over bots as needed." Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars. [For graphic - click tmsnrt.rs/2qXbYfT] The company's technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said. BRAVE NEW WORLD Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals' pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for even 20 minutes. "That’s like a lifetime during Christmas," said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. "If we're not decently priced, we'll see it almost immediately" in sales declines. DISGUISED AS HUMANS Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public websites - a process known as crawling or scraping - has many purposes. Alphabet Inc's Google, for example, constantly crawls the Web to gather information for its search engine results and to sell ads. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers. To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's known as a "CAPTCHA" - typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. "It is an arms race," said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. "Every week or every month, there's some new approach from both sides." Amazon's maneuver that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim at a specialized Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers - a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Wal-Mart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major U.S. retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently - a De'Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer's website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon's price for the De'Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16. SWARMING WITH BOTS Despite Amazon's capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80 percent of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites. In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Wal-Mart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Wal-Mart employees said. Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organize rivals' data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one U.S. patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web pages. "Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it," said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. That "isn't the case for most retailers."

Bonus points, however, go to those who tell stories that have legs, drawing further articles and social media sharing long after the event is over. A free, downloadable tip sheet from Ragan Communications and Guinness World Records, "How to land blockbuster coverage during and after a PR event," offers pointers for using storytelling to boost coverage. The tip sheet offers creative ideas from pros for turning a one-off event into a PR gift that keeps on giving. It cites experts from Reebok, John Deere, Walmart, Mall of America and Denver Water. “It’s not just us forcing Reebok stories down people’s throats,” says Ben Blakesley, Reebok’s director of global social media. “It’s, ‘How can we identify stories that people care about and what they’re talking about?’” The tip sheet tells how Reebok promoted its CrossFit Nano 7 shoe, drawing coverage from publications such as Men’s Fitness when 33 athletes around the globe broke 44 Guinness World Records titles. The download points the way to telling stories that inspire—and explains why certain stories gain major traction in the press. The tip sheet explains why John Deere, the heavy-equipment maker, chose to publish a magazine story not about its tractors, but about the origins of country music. “Farming is just what they do for a living, but they certainly have other interests that may or may not have anything to do with agriculture,” says David G. Jones, editor of The Furrow and Homestead magazines. Learn how Walmart kept pushing the story of its commitment to buy $250 billion worth of products that support U.S. manufacturing over 10 years, using its magazine, Walmart Today, to highlight interesting smaller stories that illustrate the initiative. Find out how Mall of America partners with charities in its events, creating stories that news media outlets are willing to promote. For example, a Free Bikes 4 Kidz charitable event gathered 5,512 donated two-wheelers in 2016, earning headlines such as this one from Bicycling: “This Charity Just Broke the World Record for Most Bikes Donated.” Learn how to capture content and how you can develop your own news outlet, telling your own stories, as Denver Water did. When the event’s over, keep using the content you captured, whether you’re blogging or posting on social media. Two weeks after its event, Reebok published a story about a one-armed athlete who had broken several records. “Spread the content out over the following couple of months,” Blakesley says, “so that you can extend the length of the story.” Download your free guide here.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:20 PM, May 10, 2017 Updated: 12:05 AM, May 11, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO - Earlier this year, engineers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> who track rivals' prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly stopped working. Losing access to Amazon.com Inc's <AMZN.O> data was no small matter. Like most big retailers, Wal-Mart relies on computer programs that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents can mean losing a sale. But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs - known commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The previously unreported incident offers a case study in how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the retail competition. Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success. Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more. "Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard," said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View, California-based Boomerang Commerce. A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode but said the company improves its technology regularly and has multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store pickup and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any "campaign" to stop them. "Nothing has changed recently in how we manage bots on our site," she said. Still, she said, "we prioritize humans over bots as needed." Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers to block them. Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issues publicly. Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot wars. [For graphic - click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qXbYfT] The company's technological edge has been good for its profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors. Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said. BRAVE NEW WORLD Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more than a decade ago. Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap labels by hand. In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals' pricing data. To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods including bots to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for even 20 minutes. "That’s like a lifetime during Christmas," said Chief Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like toilet paper and pet food. "If we're not decently priced, we'll see it almost immediately" in sales declines. DISGUISED AS HUMANS Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public websites - a process known as crawling or scraping - has many purposes. Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O> Google, for example, constantly crawls the Web to gather information for its search engine results and to sell ads. In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors' defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy retailers. [For diagram - click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qX4DwB] To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's known as a "CAPTCHA" - typically a distorted string of letters and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers. For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a barrage of clicks to a single source. "It is an arms race," said Keith Anderson, a senior vice president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in Ireland. "Every week or every month, there's some new approach from both sides." Amazon's maneuver that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim at a specialized Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say, Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for programmers - a telltale clue that its users are not typical shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with the situation. It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Wal-Mart in particular, affected other companies. Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among major U.S. retail chains, Amazon had by far the most sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change price frequently - a De'Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech webcam. The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks, which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil programmed bots to hit each retailer's website 3,000 times, but slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon. Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that Amazon's price for the De'Longhi espresso machine changed four times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of April 25, according to price tracking website camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16. SWARMING WITH BOTS Despite Amazon's capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80 percent of the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots, people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third or more of the traffic on other large sites. In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic includes bots from university researchers studying competition, search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying to break into Amazon accounts. For Wal-Mart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India and around the world handle the code, current and former Wal-Mart employees said. Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and organize rivals' data with bots as of several years ago, one of the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or structure of its teams working with bots. According to one U.S. patent application, Amazon is working on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans, to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web pages. [For full patent record - click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qXbYwp] "Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and the wherewithal to do something about it," said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman How to boost coverage of your PR event—even after it’s over It’s a splendid thing to snag TV, magazine or newspaper coverage for a one-day event. Bonus points, however, go to those who tell stories that have legs, drawing further articles and social media sharing long after the event is over. A free, downloadable tip sheet from Ragan Communications and Guinness World Records, „How to land blockbuster coverage during and after a PR event,” offers pointers for using storytelling to boost coverage. The tip sheet offers creative ideas from pros for turning a one-off event into a PR gift that keeps on giving. It cites experts from Reebok, John Deere, Walmart, Mall of America and Denver Water. “It’s not just us forcing Reebok stories down people’s throats,” says Ben Blakesley, Reebok’s director of global social media. “It’s, ‘How can we identify stories that people care about and what they’re talking about?’” The tip sheet tells how Reebok promoted its CrossFit Nano 7 shoe, drawing coverage from publications such as Men’s Fitness when 33 athletes around the globe broke 44 Guinness World Records titles. The download points the way to telling stories that inspire—and explains why certain stories gain major traction in the press. The tip sheet explains why John Deere, the heavy-equipment maker, chose to publish a magazine story not about its tractors, but about the origins of country music. “Farming is just what they do for a living, but they certainly have other interests that may or may not have anything to do with agriculture,” says David G. Jones, editor of The Furrow and Homestead magazines. Learn how Walmart kept pushing the story of its commitment to buy $250 billion worth of products that support U.S. manufacturing over 10 years, using its magazine, Walmart Today, to highlight interesting smaller stories that illustrate the initiative. Find out how Mall of America partners with charities in its events, creating stories that news media outlets are willing to promote. For example, a Free Bikes 4 Kidz charitable event gathered 5,512 donated two-wheelers in 2016, earning headlines such as this one from Bicycling: “This Charity Just Broke the World Record for Most Bikes Donated.” Learn how to capture content and how you can develop your own news outlet, telling your own stories, as Denver Water did. When the event’s over, keep using the content you captured, whether you’re blogging or posting on social media. Two weeks after its event, Reebok published a story about a one-armed athlete who had broken several records. “Spread the content out over the following couple of months,” Blakesley says, “so that you can extend the length of the story.” Download your free guide here.

The deal, which would mark a significant concession by the U.S. government, was being finalized and could change, the Bloomberg report said. In October 2016, Walmart rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle the same corruption probe. Walmart spokesman Greg Hitt declined to comment on the story. Last week , Walmart told Reuters it was considering getting certified under a new international program that could help companies defend themselves against isolated cases of corruption or poor business practices. The proposed resolution would require a guilty plea by at least one Walmart subsidiary, but the parent company would not be charged, the report said. The U.S. Department of Justice has been conducting a long-running investigation into potential misconduct by Walmart in some overseas markets, including China, Brazil, India, and Mexico. Walmart's ethics and compliance system came into focus after the New York Times reported in 2012 that Walmart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Walmart de Mexico business. So far Walmart has spent more than $800 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world.

After lingering at $35 and ranging as high as $49, Amazon's free shipping threshold has returned to $25, a sign that the online retailer is prepared to defend its core business even as it branches out into digital subscriptions and a growing array of consumer electronics devices. The lower threshold is a boon for casual Amazon shoppers who are not Prime members: they can add millions of eligible items to their shopping carts (typically those sold or fulfilled directly by Amazon.com) and enjoy free shipping on orders greater than $25. Related 4 Ways to Avoid Paying $99 for Amazon Prime Free Shipping 4 Ways to Avoid Paying $99 for Amazon Prime Free Shipping Now that numerous other online retailers now offer $35 free shipping thresholds, including Target and Jet.com, Amazon's decision to lower its threshold to the original $25 might seem generous. But before you rush to place orders that have languished while you searched for additional items to meet the former $35 threshold, consider that Amazon is no longer the king of free shipping online. That title now arguably belongs to Walmart, which recently introduced free two-day shipping on orders over $35. Amazon's free shipping option, meanwhile, can take up to eight days if you aren't a Prime member. In fact, Amazon's decision to raise its free shipping threshold to the high watermark of $49 in early 2016 was arguably a way to incentivize more people to sign up for the $99-per-year Prime membership, which offers free two-day shipping with no minimum orders on eligible items, in addition to numerous other benefits. It was also a way to keep rising shipping costs in check. Amazon later returned the threshold to $35, where it had been since the first $10 raise in October 2013.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Apple’s cash pile of $250 billion fuels expectations April 30, 2017 by yalibnan 3 Comments In its quarterly results on Tuesday, Apple Inc. likely will report that its cash hoard has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled milestone for a private corporation that raises a question: Why would any company want to hold that much money? Apple has added to its pile at a blistering pace, doubling it in just over four-and-a-half years. In the last three months of 2016 it wracked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. Its current total, not accounting for debt, exceeds the market values of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and that of Procter & Gamble Co., and outstrips the foreign-currency reserves of the U.K. and Canada combined. The stash has drawn fresh attention recently as President Donald Trump tries to revamp the U.S. tax regime. Apple, like many big companies, keeps most of its cash offshore — some 93% of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities as of December — to avoid U.S. corporate taxes that executives consider too high. The Trump administration this week proposed a one-time tax holiday to encourage companies to bring that cash home, and said it wants to slash the U.S. corporate-income-tax rate to 15% from 35% and largely exempt future foreign profits. That could make it easier for Apple to put its money to use, through acquisitions or by doling out more to shareholders. The latter prospect has propelled Apple’s stock to record highs. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enable it, and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans. One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefitting investors including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January. Wall Street analysts tend to focus more on companies’ net cash position than the headline number. Apple has racked up some $88 billion in debt to fund payouts to shareholders. But even subtracting that, Apple would be left with more cash than the total stockpile of Microsoft, the next richest tech company, which boasts $126 billion in cash, not accounting for debt. With the exception of financial companies, Apple’s stash exceeds that of any other U.S. company in recent history, said Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “I have never seen a company in this kind of extreme position, barring a winding-down,” she said. “Apple’s a cash box right now.” Former executives say Apple’s thrift has deep roots, inspired in part by a brush with bankruptcy in the late 1990s. That forced Chief Executive Steve Jobs to arrange a cash infusion from Microsoft Corp. and set his resolve to keep reserves for future emergencies. Mr. Jobs also believed Apple could better boost its stock price by using its money to develop new products than through buybacks or dividends. His biggest product, the iPhone, has only supercharged the cash machine. Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the devices in the decade since it was introduced, and today claims 91% of all the profits in the smartphone sector. Mr. Cook has been somewhat more accommodating of shareholder desires than his predecessor. He started a dividend-and-stock-buyback program in 2012 that has since sent more than $200 billion to shareholders. And he has invested more in some areas, such as R&D. But the CEO also stared down Carl Icahn in 2013 and 2014 when the activist investor bought a stake in Apple and demanded it increase buybacks. And Apple remains frugal in other realms, such as marketing. It spent less than $1.8 billion on advertising last year — not even half the amounts laid out by smaller rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., according to company filings. Apple also avoids large acquisitions. It bought at a rate of 15 to 20 companies a year over the past four years, generally spending several hundred million dollars on companies it can easily assimilate. Its biggest deal was the $3 billion it spent to buy Beats Electronics LLC in 2014. The swelling war chest has fueled hopes for bigger deals to vault Apple in new directions such as self-driving cars and entertainment. At Apple’s 2015 shareholder meeting, one investor asked Mr. Cook about buying Tesla Inc., which today is valued around $51 billion. The CEO didn’t directly respond. Robert Nichols of Windward Capital Management Co., an Apple shareholder, says it should buy Netflix Inc., valued around $65 billion, to jumpstart its video-streaming business and bolster its position against Amazon. “You can either build [content and distribution] or you can buy it,” and buying would help Apple gain ground where it is behind, he said. With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S. Either way, there is a growing sense that Apple’s cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. “If this a rainy day fund, they’re saving for a millennial flood,” said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.   FOX Filed Under: Business News vs Facebook tries to fix violent video problem with 3,000 new workers http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-crime-idUSKBN17Z1N4 elie meanwhile chinese are working under shitty conditions in apple factories.

Sebastian Colt Ross, 20, of Roswell, is alleged to have stolen pellet guns and some garden and yard items worth about $1,555 during six separate incidents in April. Roswell Police Department officers said that the alleged crimes occurred at a Roswell residence and at Westlake Ace Hardware, Wal-Mart and Home Depot. They also said that Ross was seen wearing a clown mask in some surveillance videos from Westlake Ace, with police identifying him by the pickup he was driving. Their statement indicates that they found a mask, burglary tools and stolen items in Ross’s home and pickup, and officers allege that Ross confessed to some thefts during an interview. At the time of his arrest May 5, Ross was only a few months into a three-year probation term. In February, he had entered guilty pleas to a burglary charge and related crimes said to have occurred in Lea County in 2014. According to court documents filed with the Fifth Judicial District of Lea County, Ross was charged with residential burglary for entering a Eunice home in August 2014 with the intent to steal. He also was charged with conspiracy to commit residential burglary, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and tampering with evidence for altering or hiding stolen jewelry. The conspiracy and delinquency charges arose because a male under the age of 18 allegedly participated in the burglary. Court documents show that, on Feb. 28, Ross entered guilty pleas to the charges and that Judge Gary Clingman gave him conditional discharge for each of the four counts and a total of three years of supervised probation. Ross also was ordered to pay restitution. According to the plea agreement, the Lea County charges could have carried as much as seven-and-a-half years in prison and $15,000 in fines. Ross has not entered any pleas in regard to the current case in Chaves County Magistrate Court. He remains at the Chaves County Detention Center and is scheduled for a hearing May 16. Emily Fry of the Fifth Judicial District Attorney’s Office in Roswell said she could not comment on the case. A request for comment from the Chaves County Public Defender assigned to the case was not responded to by press time.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive VVC unveils new Veterans Center Wednesday May 10, 2017 at 12:01 AM May 10, 2017 at 9:19 PM Charity Lindsey Staff Writer @DP_Charity VICTORVILLE — For Victor Valley College officials, the grand opening of the Veterans Resource Center on Wednesday was a reflection of their commitment to being a “veteran-friendly college.” “If we’re ever not, come to my office and let me know because I want to hear about it,” VVC Superintendent/President Dr. Roger Wagner said. The new center on the lower campus is significantly larger than its former location on the top floor of the Student Activities Center, and includes additional resources for veteran students, including academic counseling, a computer lab and a lounge area. Wednesday’s ceremony included presentations from local dignitaries and a ribbon cutting for the center, which was largely funded through the work of the VVC Foundation and grants provided by Bank of America and Wal-Mart. VVC Financial Aid Director Jason Judkins said he hoped the center would “feel like a second home” for veteran students, and serve as a place where they can relax, meet fellow peers and gain knowledge of additional services available to them in the community. For Jesus Caro, the incoming VVC Veterans Club President, the support from the college is what has kept him enrolled. “A year ago, I didn’t know what I was going to do … At first, I was scared,” Caro said. “The importance of having the Veterans Resource Center is that this is where we come together. We get to feel the camaraderie.” And as Wagner explained, “unless you’ve been in the military, you can’t understand that level of camaraderie.” “I owe everything to the military,” Wagner said. “We’re here to help pay it back.” Representing the High Desert Vet Center, Jamal Fletcher said that the addition of the center at VVC had personal meaning to him as a veteran and a student who uses the G.I. Bill. “It means a lot to see veterans come together and support each other,” Fletcher said. “This doesn’t just have to be our veterans alone … It’s a continuing effort between students, faculty, the community and their families.” The VRC is located in building 80 on VVC’s lower campus and is open to all veteran students and their dependents.

By Erin Mcintosh click to enlarge Lenny Mullins Nestled between two restaurants, shoebox-sized Quinpool Shoe Repair looks today as it has for 59 years. Two windows take up the entire storefront, but you can't get a clear view of the inside. The glass is crowded with stickers: A black jaguar with red eyes and thick yellow letters spelling out the shop's name and number. Quinpool Road is home to fast-food joints, tattoo parlours, the Oxford theatre, flower shops, construction zones and cafes. Yet, the liveliest place on this main street may be a shoe repair shop. Dimitri Christeas—everyone calls him Jimmy—a 48-year-old Greek-Canadian, works seven days a week to keep his shop alive. It's one of the last independent shoe repair stores in Halifax. When you open the door to Quinpool Shoe Repair, you'll notice the smell. For nearly six decades, three intoxicating aromas have filled this room: shoe polish, leather and glue. These smells never go away; they long ago seeped into the walls. Christeas can't smell them anymore. The pungent fumes that can cause others headaches don't affect him. Paper coffee cups teeter on shelves in-between screwdrivers, hammers, scissors and leather scraps. Shoes are scattered on the floor. Men and women stand waiting for service, making small talk about the weather and about the store. Maybe it's the music—ballads from Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin—its close quarters or its old-world charm, but they all wait, unexpectedly patient. The front room is small, no bigger than an airport elevator. It's a room in which four people can stand comfortably, but seven or eight will squeeze in, elbow to elbow. Four chairs are lined up against the left wall. Two people are sitting there, but the other two chairs are filled with bundles of shoes, each pair wrapped in an elastic band, tagged and ready to be fixed. The other wall is lined floor-to-ceiling with five wooden shelves. Since 1958, these shelves have been stacked full with shoes and now each row sags slightly in the middle. Look closely and you will notice a thick layer of dust coating the windowsill, the cash register and the key rack. The place looks like it hasn't been cleaned in decades. click to enlarge Lenny Mullins Everyone waits for Christeas while he rummages around looking for a newly repaired shoe—it might take a few minutes. Then he will have to find another. And another. In the midst of all this dust, leather and chaos, there have been some close calls over the years, but the store's record remains perfect: No shoe has ever gone missing. For a Wednesday afternoon, the shop is unusually quiet. Susan Malay is the only customer. When she walks in, her eyes gloss over 300 pairs of shoes, more than she had expected. She had never been here before, but nor had the zipper ever broken on her $250 brown leather boots. Malay read some reviews of the shop online. Go to a review page and you might read: "They don't make places like these anymore." "So happy with the results and the fella who runs the place is a total delight." "He winterized a few pairs of my heels by adding rubber lifts and rubber to the soles and I no longer fall down when drinking!" Christeas takes her boots to the back. Most cobblers wear an apron while they work, but Christeas finds it confining, like an unnecessary seatbelt. And he doesn't need one: His clothes are immaculate. He wears the same black running shoes, a pair of slacks and a clean, soft pullover sweater nearly every day. For a man who works 80 hours a week grinding, cutting, sewing, hammering and polishing shoes, the only real evidence is in his hands. His nails are jagged, but he will use the sanding machine to make them smooth. Black shoe polish seeps into the cracks on his fingertips and stains his palms. This week, there's a gash on the knuckle of his left thumb, covered up in masking tape—he hates Band-Aids. Christeas fixes Malay's shoe zipper in less than 10 minutes. He has been fixing shoes since he was a teenager. "Take it and try it," he says, handing the boots back to her. "There's no charge." Christeas does his work with confidence. He gets excited watching customers react to the final product. Sometimes, he pictures himself as Superman. "We put the magic dust on it," he says. He watches her zip up the boots as he leans on the shelf, eating his lunch. Malay tries the boots on and walks a couple steps before running into a pile of shoes. The zipper stays shut. She is satisfied. As she opens the door, boots now in hand, she turns her head and calls back to Christeas, "thank you, I'll be back!" Malay is one of the hundreds of happy customers Christeas relies on for business. Some travel hours across the province and return year after year, all in the name of shoes. Christeas was born in Halifax, and lives with his parents a short drive from the shop. He was 12 when he fixed his first shoe, a woman's high heel. Growing up he spent lunch hours and late afternoons with his dad at Bayers Road Shoe Repair. It was not much bigger than the store Christeas owns now. Three years later, in grade nine, Christeas was pulled from school to work full-time. Instead of going to school during the day, he worked at the store; his dad needed the help. He would try to finish high school by taking night classes. As a teenager, Christeas was not passionate about being a cobbler—he liked airplanes. But he cared less for school and preferred working. In the 11th grade, Christeas dropped out. His dad supported this decision. Working with Dad was natural—making and mending shoes had been in the family for generations. Dad grew up in Sparta, Greece, where at 16 he started making shoes by hand in the family shoe shop. He came to Canada in 1960. He was 25. During WWII and the Greek Civil War, more than 100,000 Greeks came to Canada in search of peace, stability and employment. Of these, some 250 families came to call Halifax home. By 2011, Halifax had nearly 3,000 Greek immigrants. The majority of Greek immigrants could not speak English and did not have high school or university degrees. The newcomers set up their own businesses: Restaurants, shoe repairs stores, bakeries and tailor shops. These skills were oftentimes passed down through generations of Greek families. Like Christeas, who learned the craft of caring for shoes from his father, who learned the craft from his father in Greece. At age 82, Dad will still appear at Quinpool Shoe Repair to work, but only when he wants. Christeas took over the store over 10 years ago when his dad retired. Dad still calls it "his." The shoe repair business in 2017 is grim. People who have been in the trade for decades are retiring and it is nearly impossible to find replacements. There is only one school in Canada that teaches shoemaking. At last count, in 2011, there were 1,460 shoe repairers and shoemakers in all of Canada, down from 2,010 in 2006. Sixty years ago, 29 shoe repair stores were scattered around Halifax and Dartmouth. Now, with twice the population, only four indies remain. Christeas runs Quinpool Shoe Repair alone. He says he's lucky to have friends and family who help, but it's not enough to change the reality of his working life. The decline in shoe repair has been accompanied—or led by—a decline in the shoes themselves. In the past 20 years, Christeas remarks that shoes have changed. Now, they're made with cheaper materials, sometimes harder to fix. When he grew up, everything was made with quality leather. This is not a trend limited to footwear. The consumer world in clothes, appliances and electronics is geared towards disposal, not repair. Christeas is part of the solution—a huge part given the small number of cobblers in the city, and Quinpool Shoe Repair is busier than ever. But Christeas will never turn people away. In fact, he'll charm you enough to keep you coming back. Blissfully unaware of his natural charm, Christeas makes every woman feel like she is the prettiest in the room and men feel like they are brothers. When you first meet him, it might feel like you have known him for years. He stands close to look at your shoes, leans in to talk and when he smiles he looks you in the eye. If you get a hug from him—highly likely—his strong cologne will linger on you. Every day Christeas is interrupted at work by friends or family to talk politics, weather or personal affairs. He has regular visitors: Jalal Hosein, his doctor, comes every Saturday; his closest friend Paul Troup, also Greek, works down the road at the liquor store; Antonio Feijoo, a Metro Transit supervisor from Spain—all of whom stop by just to say hello. Christeas enjoys these visits. click to enlarge Lenny Mullins But one regular doesn't just come in to say hello. Paul Ransome has spent every afternoon at Quinpool Shoe Repair for eight years. It's past noon and the door opens. Ransome saunters in with a McDonald's coffee. He wears a black leather coat with a matching leather cap. Ransome is 69, deaf in one ear and blind in one eye. He takes his seat in an empty chair—there's always a chair for Ransome. "It's Pauly-wally," Christeas will call out jokingly. Ransome puts his coffee down on the little brown side table and picks up the paper. He brings it close to his face so his good eye can read the fine print. Ransome met the Christeas family 30 years ago when they owned Bayers Road Shoe Repair. He would occasionally visit the store with his mother. Since her passing, Ransome has found comfort and companionship at Quinpool Shoe Repair. Ransome says coming to the store is better than sitting around his house all day. Sometimes he'll doze off. In winter, he'll shovel the snow off the front steps or salt the sidewalk. At lunch, Christeas buys him chili and a roll. If he gets bored he might mosey to the back and watch Christeas work. If he mumbles about deals at Walmart or the most recent car accident in Halifax, Christeas will always listen. At the end of the day, Ransome is still in his chair. Without turning off the music, Christeas dims the lights and ushers Ransome to his car. Christeas will drive him home or to Walmart, without hesitation. Ransome is family. One evening after 7pm, Kosta Perry is in his bedroom at his mother's place. He's sitting in front of his desktop computer, working on homework. Perry, 24, is Christeas' only child. Perry wants to be an engineer, not a cobbler. His iPhone lights up on his desk, next to him. Dad is calling. He picks up the phone and they exchange pleasantries. "Hey, how are you?" his dad always asks. "Do you need anything? Are you well?" Perry asks his dad about buying a machine to filter the air inside the store—there isn't one. The fumes, Perry says, are the worst they've ever been. This is a typical conversation. Perry doesn't always see Christeas as a dad, but more of a brother. They talk about business, politics and personal matters with ease. Christeas and Perry's mother separated when Perry was six years old. He grew up with his mother. When Perry was 13, he spent seven weeks in Greece with his dad, the longest they'd ever been together. They have continued this tradition ever since, living in Greece, every summer. Quinpool Shoe Repair is closed during this time. They both say it's their favourite time of the year. Mirroring his father's childhood, Perry grew up in the shoe store. At the time, Christeas was the owner of West End Mall Shoe Repair, which he had for four years. While his father worked, Perry would play with leather and tools. Christeas tried to share the work with his son, but he quickly realized Perry had no intention of taking up the trade. Perry lost interest during high school, calling the job "outdated." Perry is enrolled at Dalhousie University where he studies engineering. He helps at Quinpool Shoe Repair two or three hours a week if his father needs extra hands, but his heart is set elsewhere. If school goes well, he wants to move to Toronto. Christeas is happy for his son, but wants him to stay in Halifax. Perry predicts he will not take over Quinpool Shoe Repair. In his softer moments, this realization makes him feel bad, but he is determined not to live his life in guilt. Back on the phone, Christeas and Perry talk for around 15 minutes about new machines. It ends and they say goodnight. They'll talk tomorrow. If you listened in, you would have a hard time deciphering who is who. Perry long ago picked up his father's manner of speech. Perry is concerned about the future of his father's business. He wonders who will do the work and how long his father will last. But this isn't something he and his dad talk about. It's 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon, the busiest day of the week. Martini in the Morning is playing, an online radio station serenading the store with a mixture of America's greatest hits: Billie Holiday, Barbra Streisand, Ella Fitzgerald. There are six customers in the shop. For lunch, there's pizza from King of Donair next door. The delivery person bustles through the store, beelining to the back. He hesitates with the pizza box, unsure where to put it. Everything is covered with shoes, tools and coffee cups. It feels like a circus. Christeas takes the pizza box. The delivery person turns around, wiggling through the customers. "See ya later guys, good luck!" He raises his hands, signaling a wave. Within seconds he's out the door. Christeas' younger sister Tia Caines is standing behind the glass counter. Caines is petite, with manicured eyebrows, clear olive skin and dark hair. She keeps her hands protected from the polish residue and dusty surfaces with clear plastic gloves. Caines spent her childhood in her father's shop too, but she went to university instead of taking over the business. Caines is a pharmacist and works at Quinpool Shoe Repair when she can. When a customer walks in, Caines doesn't spend time with small talk—she treats everyone as customers, not friends. Caines wishes the place were more organized and clean. She thinks Christeas works too much. She wants him to find someone to take over, but she knows this is unlikely. "Jim, I need your help," she'll call out, sometimes in Greek. If a customer asks for pricing she might not know the answer. And finding shoes in the organized chaos can be difficult, especially if Christeas hasn't had time to place them on the shelf. Christeas has a system, but he's the only one who knows where things are. Grabbing the shoes' identification tag from the customer, he'll read the numbers and spin around to face the shelves. His fingers wiggle in circles, hovering over the shoes as he thinks. His eyebrows furrow. His jaw sticks out. He jumps on the shelves reaching for shoes in the back. If he can't find what he's looking for, he'll ask the customer: black or brown? Boots or shoes? What did they need fixed? They'll respond and almost immediately a light bulb goes off. He'll present the restored shoes to the customer like they are a work of art. He's proud of his work. The customer is pleasantly surprised. Christeas says "they can't believe how good the shoes look after it's done." He says the shoes often look better than new. He opens the 59-year-old cash register, an original to the store. He takes cash or cheque—no debit. He calls out while the customer walks out, "If there are any problems, bring them back, we'll fix them—no charge." He likes to reassure the customers that no matter what, their shoes will be fixed. Christeas says that when people leave the store they "always leave with a smile." It's 6pm on the dot. Christeas walks over to the door and turns the lock—one of many satisfying parts of his day. He shuts off the lights in the front room and goes to his computer in the back. Its outer layer is coated in two years worth of dust. From YouTube, he turns on the theme song from Superman. Like a young boy, Christeas loves superheroes. More than anything he wants to fly, to save the damsel in distress—just like Superman. He gets back to work. For 30 minutes a playlist with songs from Batman, Spider-Man and Indiana Jones movies blasts through the speakers, drowning out the roar of the sanding machine. Christeas stays after hours at Quinpool Shoe Repair every night—he has to, he says, to keep on top of the workload. The store is closed Sundays, but he comes in and works during the afternoon to catch up. Christeas powers through the shoes lined up for him on the floor: Spray, shine, repeat. Christeas may not be Superman, but he loves to add this special touch, the final sprinkle of magic dust. a Erin McIntosh is a freelance journalist who hates the smell of shoe polish and leather.

Go here to read the second article. In late 2015, Carolina Hemp Co. began promoting “hemp extracts" and subsequently formed relationships with local pharmacies and doctor’s offices. Then in early spring 2017, the North Carolina Board of Pharmacy circulated a guidance document that disrupted the distributor’s business. Pharmacies, the state pharmacy board cautioned, cannot legally possess or dispense hemp extract. Only “caregivers" may possess hemp extract or cannabidiol (CBD) oil to treat intractable epilepsy under state law, the guidance declared, and pharmacies and pharmacists don’t meet the definition of a caregiver. The pharmacies aren’t willing to “risk their license over it, so bam, we just lost a bunch of customers," divulged Brian Bullman, co-founder of Carolina Hemp Co., in a recent phone interview. “By April 1, the pharmacies had pulled the product and started asking us if they could get a refund." The North Carolina Board of Pharmacy advised pharmacists that hemp extract—also known as CBD oil—would meet the definition of marijuana in the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA). “Marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the federal CSA," the guidance stated, “and only DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration]-approved researchers are allowed to possess Schedule I controlled substances." Asheville, North Carolina-based Carolina Hemp Co. is among a growing number of businesses that stand to profit from the surging demand for CBD and other non-psychoactive substances derived from hemp. With the U.S. population increasingly accepting of cannabis, and becoming better educated on the distinctions between hemp and marijuana, “hemp extracts" and similarly named products often labeled as supplements are being offered through a growing number of distribution channels from independent health food stores to chiropractors’ offices. The CBD-containing products, however, are unlikely to be sold at large grocery stores and other major retailers, symbolizing a muddy regulatory and legal climate rife with uncertainty. “For every five steps forward, we take three steps back," acknowledged Mark Kuspa, vice president of sales with Colorado-based CW Hemp, commenting on efforts to partner with large retailers. “There is still that stigma or that misunderstanding of federal versus state in regulatory compliance, and more than anything…what does it mean, particularly if they have a pharmacy on board?" CBD—and a group of siblings that founded CW Hemp, the Stanley brothers—captured the nation’s attention in 2013 media coverage featuring a Colorado girl who was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy. In recent years, lawmakers in Washington and at state capitols around the nation have promoted wider access to cannabis—including CBD. But the federal government has a far different view on cannabis and even CBD. In warning letters, a Q&A and correspondence with industry and media, FDA has opined CBD cannot be sold in dietary supplements or added to food. The agency has reasoned CBD has been authorized for investigation as a new drug and is the subject of substantial clinical trials that have been conducted by GW Pharmaceuticals. The North Carolina Board of Pharmacy mentioned GW’s CBD product, Epidiolex. The board’s recent letter advised pharmacies that they would be authorized to dispense a CBD drug with a valid prescription if GW Pharmaceuticals or any other pharmaceutical company receives FDA approval for such a drug. “They literally gave GW Pharmaceuticals a commercial in this statement," Bullman said. Kuspa indicated the big retailers are stepping back from sales of CBD-containing hemp extracts until the regulatory environment is more clear. What is the retailers’ largest concern, DEA or FDA? “It’s more DEA," Kuspa said, referring to the agency’s position that CBD is a Schedule I controlled substance. “It is 100 percent the DEA that has put the fear in these accounts, that they don’t know which way they want to go." Some lawyers have argued the federal agencies are mistaken and even sued DEA in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on behalf of the Hemp Industries Association (HIA) and other plaintiffs. In spite of the regulatory uncertainty and pending litigation, a growing number of independent stores are carrying products containing CBD made by the likes of CW Hemp and San Diego-based CV Sciences. CV Sciences’ products are sold in about 1,000 independent health and wellness stores, up from about 400 stores a year ago, said Stuart Tomc, the company’s vice president of human nutrition. In October 2016, Hemp Business Journal projected the U.S. CBD market will grow to US$2.1 billion in consumer sales by 2020, with $450 million in sales coming from hemp-based sources. In 2015, consumer sales of CBD products totaled $90 million, according to the publication. Bullman of Carolina Hemp Co. indicated the willingness of grocery and health food stores to carry hemp extracts creates a domino effect. “They see other people selling it, and making money, and not getting arrested, and then they follow suit," he said. “The retail market is growing very, very rapidly," Mike Harinen, chief brand officer of Bluebird Botanicals, said in an interview during the NoCo Hemp Expo, which was held March 31-April 1 in Loveland, Colorado. “One of the most exciting things right now is that we are just starting to be considered for certain larger retail big box stores," he revealed. Harinen added a caveat. “It’s going slowly because of course with hemp and the stigma around [it]—and especially when it comes to extracted hemp—it’s very … difficult to talk to the large buyers of these huge grocery stores and then convince them that it is a fully legal" product. He said Broomfield, Colorado-based Bluebird Botanicals is in talks with King Soopers. “We’re shooting big," Harinen said. Kroger, which owns King Soopers, did not respond to requests for comment on whether it carries products containing CBD. Asked about any reservations retailers may have in selling his company’s products, Harinen responded, “Mostly the legality. They’re not sure … if cannabinoids are a legal thing to sell—but they’re just as legal as hemp oil or anything else that comes from the hemp plant that’s food-based." “We should be able to sell on Amazon," Kuspa of CW Hemp proclaimed. “We should be able to sell on Walgreens and CVS and Target and Walmart. And we’re being contacted by all of these respective groups." None of the above retailers responded to requests for comment. Daniel Fabricant, Ph.D., executive director and CEO of the Washington-based Natural Products Association (NPA), which serves a large membership of retailers, said the organization does not have a specific policy on CBD. “Our policy is look, we’re not going to … have members who are selling unlawful products," Fabricant said in a phone interview. “People have a lot of questions around CBD … and we always quote chapter and verse on what’s in FDA warning letters." However, he noted NPA would seek to help companies submit premarket safety-related notifications to FDA, such as a new dietary ingredient notification (NDIN) under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). “I’m not saying CBD is unsafe … but what I am saying is the data has to be presented," said Fabricant, the former head supplement official at FDA, “and it has to be presented in a way that gets through the regulatory gate." Re-enter CV Sciences. The company said it has retained a scientific and regulatory consulting firm to conduct toxicological studies to investigate the safety of oral consumption of its hemp-derived CBD oil and to support a self-conclusion that its product is GRAS (generally recognized as safe). Based on the toxicological studies conducted on CV Sciences’ CBD oil, the company expressed confidence that it will satisfy the GRAS standard following review by an expert panel and publication of the data in a peer-reviewed toxicology journal. While such safety data could bolster confidence in the CBD market, conservative national retailers may remain on the sidelines because, in part, their exposure to government enforcement actions and private litigation is greater than independent health food and wellness stores. Many of the former generate billions in sales and do business across state lines. “If they [large retailers] take a critical look at this ingredient, they will pass," said attorney Todd Harrison, a partner with Venable LLP who chairs the firm’s FDA Group. “If they look at the dollar signs in the door, they’ll take it." Asked whether larger retailers would be comfortable selling CBD, Fabricant alluded to the risks associated with selling goods in interstate commerce, which would subject companies to the authority of federal agencies such as FDA. “Some may say the juice is worth the squeeze," the former FDA official observed. “Some may not." DEA officials have said CBD is a marijuana extract, and the agency has adopted a “new Administration Controlled Substances Code Number for ‘Marihuana Extract,’" the subject of HIA’s lawsuit. Rick Collins, a New York-based lawyer who has defended clients in drug cases involving performance-enhancing substances and other products, discussed the potential criminal consequences facing retailers accused of selling marijuana. “The crime would be distribution of a controlled substance," a felony, Collins explained in a phone interview, “and the punishment would be based on the volume of the product that was sold." “The more that was sold, the higher the potential sentence could be," added Collins, a founding partner with Collins Gann McCloskey & Barry. DEA said the new code would help it track quantities of marijuana extract separately from quantities of marijuana, aiding in compliance with relevant treaty provisions, but HIA said the move has caused a chilling effect in the global industrial hemp industry. Retailers pre-emptively removed products from the shelves and halted reorders based on their interpretation that industrial hemp was subject to DEA’s marijuana extract rule, said Colleen Keahey, executive director of HIA, in a phone interview. She indicated large retailers are taking a conservative stance and not carrying hemp-derived CBD products today. What needs to happen for the big retailers to enter the market? Keahey said DEA’s marijuana extract rule should be amended or rescinded. She also supported the development of additional quality standards, such as more rigorous testing and ways to maintain GMPs (good manufacturing practices). “We’re working on that as an industry to help provide those companies that are our members with the best practices," Keahey said. Meanwhile, there is uncertainty over how the Trump administration will treat cannabis—including CBD. “There are strong pulls in both directions," Collins said. “Certainly, you’ve got a national attitude of increasing tolerance toward cannabis in all respects—both medical and recreational. On the other hand, you have an attorney general (Jeff Sessions) who’s opined that, ‘Good people don’t smoke marijuana’ and clearly is not a fan of cannabis. Whether that’s going to translate to enforcement action in the current political climate is open to debate." Violations of the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic (FDCA), not just the CSA, could result in a criminal conviction. And corporate officials could be held liable for a misdemeanor violation of the FDCA, even if they didn’t intentionally violate the law or were aware of the violation, attorneys familiar with the law have explained. Asked about criminal penalties a retailer would face for selling products that contain CBD and other non-psychoactive cannabinoids from the hemp plant, a Justice Department spokeswoman declined “to comment on hypotheticals." “However, if the Justice Department learns about FDCA violations, we consult with our partners at FDA and consider a range of factors in determining whether to pursue an enforcement action," she said in an email. A few sources mentioned one factor that could help mitigate a retailer's exposure to a government action or civil lawsuit: ensuring the content of psychoactive constituent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a CBD product is negligible, distinguishing it from marijuana. Under the 2014 Farm Bill, “industrial hemp" cannot contain a delta-9 THC concentration of more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. “Obviously, the responsible CBD industry that’s providing products in terms of dietary supplements should not be providing products that contain illegal levels of THC," said Jane Wilson, director of program development with the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA). James Prochnow, an attorney in Denver who concentrates his practice on food and drug regulatory matters, doesn’t think it’s likely federal agencies would target retailers selling CBD. “The chances of a large retailer being the object of some enforcement action, such as a seizure by the FDA or the DEA, are in my judgment not substantial at the present time," said Prochnow, a shareholder with Greenberg Traurig, in a phone interview. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, such as a CBD product containing a high amount of THC, Prochnow reasoned it is unlikely FDA or DEA would seek to criminally indict a company. He cited the government’s enforcement discretion, and uncertainty over how the Trump administration will address the CBD and hemp industries. “I don’t think the Trump administration has decided what it really wants to do about hemp and CBD oil," he said. Prochnow, nonetheless, cited other risks facing retailers. For instance, the attorney described as “staggering" the number of class action lawsuits filed against the dietary supplement industry in recent years, and he acknowledged another consideration—enforcement actions taken by state attorneys general against companies, such as retailers of dietary supplements. Prochnow also raised the question of whether a CBD ingredient would run afoul of the CSA. “It presents some criminal considerations that normally aren’t present when you’re dealing with something that isn’t related to the Cannabis sativa plant," he explained. Lawyers also have cited the increased risks of enforcement action by FDA as well class action litigation against marketers of CBD-containing supplements if GW Pharmaceuticals obtains drug approval for Epidiolex. There’s no evidence CBD was sold as a food or dietary ingredient before Epidiolex was authorized for investigation as a new drug, said Harrison, who has examined the regulatory issues for his clients. “Therefore, it’s an absolute bar" to sales of CBD in a supplement, the attorney said, referencing an exclusionary clause in DSHEA. Other lawyers have maintained there is evidence CBD was marketed as a supplement or as a conventional food before GW’s new drug investigations were authorized, but they have declined to disclose the specific evidence to INSIDER. Regardless of the debate, the law grants the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) authority to create an exception to the drug-related exclusion in DSHEA—creating another pathway for CBD to be legally marketed as a supplement. HHS Secretary Tom Price would need to issue a regulation, following notice and comment, finding CBD is lawful as a supplement. But as AHPA pointed out last year in comments filed with FDA in an unrelated matter, HHS hasn't used such authority in DSHEA's 22-year history. Amid the regulatory uncertainty, Tomc of CV Sciences remains bullish. He sees an opportunity for distribution of CBD-containing products through large retailers such as Walmart, Walgreens and Safeway. The big retailers may be reticent to enter the market until they verify companies like CV Sciences have generated sales with independent health food stores, and that the products are safe. “The mid-sized chains," Tomc noted, “aren’t going to start taking products in until they’ve proven themselves among all the independent stores." Referencing sales data from SPINS and the GRAS efforts underway, Tomc maintained his employer could demonstrate it has proven itself among independent stores and show its products are safe. Judging by trends at independent health and wellness stores, CV Sciences’ Plus CBD Oil and similar hemp-derived products could fare well at large retail chains. Alfalfa’s Market, a natural foods store founded in Boulder, carries about 100 different products containing CBD, ranging from capsules to hemp honey to extracts for pets, said Sarah Shebanek, a wellness buyer for the business. Demand has been so strong that the retailer has introduced its own private-label brand of hemp extracts, relying on a manufacturer from Fort Lupton, Colorado, Pure Kind Botanicals. “That’s how well it’s doing that we wanted to make sure we offered our own brand as well," Shebanek said. The products are sold at the natural food retailer’s stores in Boulder and Louisville, Colorado—one of the first states in the country to legalize recreational marijuana. Colorado is also one of several states to operate an industrial hemp pilot program through its agriculture department, as authorized by Section 7606 of the 2014 Farm Bill. Shebanek attributed growing demand for CBD products to two factors. “One, more and more people are learning about it," she said. “And it’s still something that very few people know anything about. And then I think more people are learning about it because so many people have found it works so well for them for a variety of conditions." As a long-term strategy, CW Hemp is eying the big retailers while maintaining its relationships with the likes of Alfalfa’s Market. “We will take care of the regional players—the singles [and] single doors that are out there today," Kuspa said, “but long term, we’re planning on working with these larger chains." ……………………………………………………………………………………………………….... Some Medical Professionals Embrace CBD by Josh Long Cannabidiol (CBD) is attracting the interest of a growing number of professionals in the medical community. Melissa Arnold, a chiropractor in Georgia, described herself as the “poster child" for CBD oil. Arnold said she suffered a sleep disorder for about 20 years, enduring periods of insomnia, and waking up and not feeling rested. She disclosed she began to suffer anxiety, and occasionally panic, due to her sleep disorder. CBD and other therapies have helped her sleep, she explained.  “I sleep through the night now," Arnold said in a phone interview. “I don’t even wake up. If I wake up, pretty much I just go right back to sleep." Arnold said she has been using CBD for nearly two years and selling it in her office for about 1.5 years. The chiropractor has found CBD especially beneficial for individuals who suffer from Lyme disease. Arnold sells products made by Elixinol, a Colorado-based manufacturer of hemp extracts, and she has referred patients who suffer from medical conditions like cancer to Philip Blair, M.D., who identified himself in an email as Elixinol’s medical director. “I have tried at least 8 different CBD brands and Elixinol is the only one that has made a huge difference for me actually," Arnold said in a follow-up email. She acknowledged the controversy surrounding CBD—specifically DEA’s view of it as a Schedule I drug. Is she worried? “They’re not really putting the brakes on it," said the chiropractor, referring to Elixinol. “We haven’t been asked to take it [CBD] off the shelf," she added. “I don’t think anyone’s going to jail over it." CBD typically contains little tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of marijuana, and critics of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) are quick to point out that fact. “There’s nobody getting any euphoria from it, so it’s ridiculous that it’s been classified that way," Arnold said. Most doctors, nonetheless, may be hesitant to embrace CBD, which has yet to be approved in the United States by FDA as a pharmaceutical drug. “I really don’t find much headway in … talking with physicians," Blair acknowledged in a phone interview, explaining his peers are “confused about the law, the legal aspects about their recommendations of anything related to a non-FDA-approved substance." He finds such reactions “absurd," noting many doctors sell nutraceuticals in their offices. “There’s no problem with that, and there would be no problem with doing a legal cannabidiol within their office," Blair maintained. “But very few physicians are willing to go there."

She told officers she had thought the clerk behind the counter was attractive and complimented her on her appearance. In turn, she said the clerk complimented her but she doubted her sincerity and an argument ensued. Officers made contact with the woman's husband and he said he would come for her. While waiting, the woman approached people pumping gas and asked if the men inside the vehicles were her husband. It was also learned the woman inside the store that she thought was the clerk, was actually another customer. The South Euclid woman was cited for disorderly conduct intoxication and released to her husband. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland man, 52, was arrested at Walmart May 2 for the suspected theft of $149.80 worth of energy drinks. He showed signs of drug abuse and admitted he had consumed an unspecified drug. He was subsequently taken to Metro Health Hospital. Fraud, Maywood Road: A man and woman reported May 2 someone had fraudulently filed a request in their names for an address change with the IRS. They were instructed by the IRS to file a police report. Criminal damage, South Green Road: A woman reported at 1 a.m. May 5 she heard noises coming from outside her home and then found her vehicle damaged in the driveway. The antenna was damaged on it and there four brake-pads on the ground near the vehicle. She told officers she had a negative exchange with another woman on social media the previous day and felt she may be responsible for the damage. Officers tried unsuccessfully to contact the Bedford woman. Property damage, Mayfield Road: Employees of a dentist office reported April 29 someone had written various words and phrases on four walls inside the building, using black lead material. They suspected the ex-boyfriend of a recently fired cleaning employee may have caused the damage because he had been calling the office looking for the woman. They said the woman had turned in her keys to the building and suspected the man may have had access to them. Officers advised the staff to change the locks. Impaired driving, Mayfield Road: An officer stopped a vehicle at 1 a.m. April 29 after it started approaching the cruiser head-on. The driver said she was not familiar with the area. She was subsequently arrested for OVI. The Twinsburg woman, 33, was also charged with having a weapon under disability after she said she had a concealed carry permit and admitted she had a gun in the vehicle. Hit-skip, South Green Road: A vehicle struck a parked car around 12:45 a.m. May 1 and left the scene. Officers located it in Cleveland, where the driver claimed the damage on his vehicle was a result of hitting a pothole. He was found to have three active warrants and was driving under suspension. The Avon Lake man, 25, was subsequently charged with OVI and suspected heroin was found inside the vehicle. He later admitted to having injected heroin prior to the incident. He was taken to the hospital for treatment. Menacing, Colony Road: A woman reported April 26 she was receiving threatening emails from a woman, whom her husband had an affair with over the past year. She said her husband had since ended the affair but the woman claimed she was pregnant with his child. Officers spoke with the suspect, who said she made the threats out of anger, but had no intentions to carry them out. They told her to stop all contact with the woman and her husband. An aggravated menacing warrant was later issued against the Cleveland Heights woman. Harassing communication, Avondale Road: A resident reported April 29 he received a threatening email from a man after making a purchase on a website known as Bonanza. He said he purchased a baseball cap, which he found to be defective. After having his money refunded, he received the email from the seller, who was upset that he got a refund and did not return the item. Officers told the man to block the email address of the sender, whom they believed to be a 51-year-old Oregon man. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland woman, 20, was arrested at Walmart April 30 for the suspected theft of pizza rolls and clothing, valued at $19.37. She provided officers with a false identity and was later found to have an active felony warrant after she was correctly identified. She was cited for providing false information and then turned over to a county facility. Stolen vehicle, Felton Road: A man reported April 29 his vehicle was stolen off the road while he was mowing grass at a resident's home. A landscape trailer was also hitched to the vehicle and stolen. He estimated the value of the vehicle at $28,000. Criminal damage, South Belvoir Boulevard: A man reported April 27 his vehicle had its tires slashed while parked behind his apartment residence. There was also a white substance on the hood that had eaten through the paint to the metal of the vehicle.

On Friday and Saturday, Habitat for Humanity construction supervisors will lead crews of women volunteers and anyone who wishes to join them in building walls for a new home for a single mother and her children that will go up in Jonesborough later this year. The building will take place from 9 a.m.-noon, and 1-4 p.m. both days at the new Habitat Restore located off West Mountain View Road at 3201 Kimberly Court near the the Browns Mill Road Walmart. Holston Habitat has dubbed it a “Women Build” event, but is inviting everyone, including men, “to build like a woman in your mother’s name.” In addition to nailing nails and constructing walls, volunteers will also have the opportunity to write messages to the Habitat family who will live in the house or to memorialize their mothers, or other influential women in their lives by writing their names on the boards that will shape the house. Lunch will be provided and all participants will receive a Women Build T-shirt. Volunteer Coordinator Mandy Penz said the goal is to have fun, learn something new about construction and help other women all in honor of mothers. “Every hand makes a difference,” Penz said. “What better way to honor your mother than to join other women and build strength, stability and self-reliance alongside a Habitat family right here in our community?” Anyone who wishes to join in may sign up online at www.HolstonHabitat.org or call the Holston Habitat office at 423-239-7689 to register. More information about Holston Habitat’s work to make homeownership possible for income-eligible residents of Carter, Sullivan and Washington counties in Tennessee and Bristol, Virginia, is also available at the above website or phone number. Those who cannot take part but wish to honor their mothers by supporting Holston Habitat for Humanity during the Women Build project may make tax-deductible donations on behalf of their moms online at www.HolstonHabitat.org or by mail to P.O. Box 5265, Kingsport, TN 37663. The Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy will mark 43 years of conservation of the region’s natural treasures Thursday, May 18, with a benefit Appalachian Spring Celebration at the Yee-Haw Brewing Company in Johnson City. “From the world renowned Roan Highlands to Hampton Creek Cove State Natural Area, and more recently our brand new Rocky Fork State Park, we see the amazing work of SAHC in the protected mountain landscape of Northeast Tennessee,” former SAHC Trustee and Mahoney’s Outfitters Manager David Ramsey said. More than 70,000 acres of the mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina, clean water sources, impressive overlooks, unique habitats, productive farmland and outdoor recreation venues have been protected by the SAHC in those 43 years. And everyone will have an opportunity to build on that legacy at the family-friendly celebration at Yee-Haw. A ticketed event, the night will include live music on the patio by by Redleg Husky, an Americana group from Asheville, N.C., outdoor games, presentation of the conservancy’s 2017 Stanley A. Murray Volunteer of the Year award and savory local brews from which Yee-Haw will be passing along $1 to SAHC for every beer sold. Food from White Duck Taco will also be available for purchase onsite. Yee-Haw Taproom General Manager David McDaniel said the Appalachian Spring Celebration is a SAHC event that the company is most excited to host. “It is our goal to help organizations like the SAHC succeed and be effective and, in turn, ensure the success of the region around us.” Tickets are $10 in advance or $15 at the door and may be purchased online at www.Appalachian.org. More information about the conservancy is available at the website or may be obtained by calling the SAHC at 828-253-0095. Donations to the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy may be made by mail to 372 Merrimon Ave., Asheville, NC 28801.

A Russian consumer shows her passport to identify herself at a goods collection center of AliExpress in Moscow. [Photo/Xinhua] Every week, she snaps up cooking accessories, shoes and electronic gadgets directly from China via AliExpress, a subsidiary of Alibaba Group Holding. A few taps on her device keypad, followed by a few days in wait－that's all it takes for the tamper-proof parcels to materialize at her doorstep. So impressed was Danblier with AliExpress that she created a Facebook page just to share images of the goodies as well as information on online deals. Two years on, the page has 100,000 followers. Alibaba has also become famous in Europe for its Singles Day shopping extravaganza on Nov 11, which created a buzz on online social media. The shopping fest has made Alibaba the world's top e-commerce marketplace by transaction value. It reported a gross merchandise volume of $485 billion in fiscal year 2016. This is higher than $482 billion in revenues netted by Walmart Inc in the same period. Alibaba is expanding overseas aggressively using AliExpress, in the process taking on global rivals such as Amazon and eBay. Founded in 2010, AliExpress is the equivalent of Alibaba's business-to-customer site Tmall, but targets only overseas customers. It has attracted more than 100 million international buyers as of April, said Dai Shan, president of Alibaba's business-to-business unit. Following a decade of explosive growth, China's online retail market is expected to slow down to a 15 percent compounded annual growth rate, consultancy Mintel has projected. This means internet behemoths like Alibaba need to foray abroad for new sources of income. AliExpress is gaining traction among users such as Danblier by reshaping their shopping behavior and building a personal rapport, said Zuniga Perez Pell, an employee at AliExpress' Spanish operations. "Wedding is perhaps the most important occasion for women. In the past, Spanish women never bought wedding dresses online. But now, taking a look at AliExpress before buying is becoming a ritual," he said. Agreed John Arregui, a regular Spanish shopper on Ali-Express. His personal favorite is footwear. "I really like the clear assortment of all types of shoes, and I'd say China-made footwear is of superb quality." Alfonso Noriega Gomez, economic and commercial counselor of the Consulate General of Spain in Shanghai, believes e-commerce is an essential engine to promote trade and economic relations and a major conduit for products made around the world. "Through Tmall and Tmall Global, Chinese consumers are able to enjoy products from Spain. We hope AliExpress can bring alive the virtual Silk Road by connecting Chinese merchandise with countries including Spain," he said at an AliExpress conference in Hangzhou earlier this month. Customers from more than 220 countries and regions have placed orders via the platform, according to the company. The top three countries ranked by total spending are Russia, the United States and Spain. Apart from Spain, AliExpress also found early success in Russia, by offering Chinese products including clothing and car parts at a lower price. It also advertised its services and teamed up with local payment providers. The platform has been Russia's biggest shopping site since 2014, according to researcher TNS. A wide array of goods, partnerships with several key Russian payment providers, and a strong social media presence have helped make AliExpress the top player, said Shen Difan, general manager in Russia. "AliExpress is planning to tie up with more local vendors, ship from local warehouses, and provide local after-sales service, including a no-excuse return policy in 72 hours," Shen said. Relatively super-quick delivery has become the real gamechanger. In Russia, parcels normally take weeks, or even up to two months, to reach buyers. Backed by big data technology, AliExpress has managed to shorten the delivery period to just four days. This is part of an even bigger goal of global delivery within 72 hours in three to five years, using algorithm-based realtime analysis by Cainiao Network Technology Co Ltd, Alibaba's smart logistics network. Alibaba will be wading into a number of markets where no single player has yet to dominate. Challenges abound. Many developing nations still lack the infrastructure crucial to widespread adoption of e-commerce. According to Wan Lin, Cainiao's president, the logistics network has teamed up with various postal services to ensure faster customs clearance, including a partnership with US Postal Service, Brazilian Post and Australian Post. It has picked up a stake in Singapore Post. It will manage logistics globally and provide users with global traceability of their parcel shipment movement. AliExpress aims to build a "cyber Silk Road" and serve up to 1 billion people from overseas, Shen said. "The Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to strengthen infrastructure, economic and trade ties in the Eurasian and Africa region, will lend AliExpress new momentum to grow its customer base tenfold in less than seven years." That creates a win-win scenario for both global shoppers and export-driven Chinese manufacturers, who are transitioning from being original equipment manufacturers to providers of higher-end branded products. Napearl, a Chinese curtain maker, is riding the consumption boom overseas. Via AliExpress, the company receives regular orders from US customers for tailor-made curtains used in villas. Its monthly revenue could top $500,000, said Wang Yuting, its operations director. Also reaping the gains is earphone maker Bluedio. According to Li Jiacheng, its marketing head, sales on Singles Day last year surged 120 percent compared to the previous fest. "We've devoted a 30-people taskforce to research and development of critical technologies, and are on course to bagging a handful of patents. We're building our own brand, and AliExpress is a good starting point," Li said. To date, AliExpress has groomed and fostered over 1,000 smaller merchants whose monthly sales in cross-border deals have surpassed $500,000 each. "While globalization offers many benefits to multinational corporations, the Belt and Road Initiative aims to unlock the potential of SMEs (small and medium enterprises) by enhancing connectivity, and e-commerce is a critical channel to reach that goal," said Zhao Lei, a professor at the Institute for International Strategic Studies, which is part of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Economy Food retail reforms: Narendra Modi government mulls relaxing FDI rules Food retail reforms: Narendra Modi government mulls relaxing FDI rules The move to relax the rule comes after several global retailers conveyed to the government their willingness to set up shops here By: Banikinkar Pattanayak | New Delhi | Published: May 11, 2017 6:50 AM The non-food items could be related products like personal care or kitchenware that consumers would usually like to pick up along with food items in a supermarket. The government is considering a proposal to ease foreign direct investment (FDI) guidelines in the retailing of food products to allow a certain percentage of locally-produced non-food items along with the edible products. Food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal told FE her ministry has suggested that a foreign retailer be allowed to sell locally-produced non-food items worth 25% of its investments at the farm-gate level. However, a final decision will likely be taken after comprehensive consultations among ministries, including commerce and industry, food processing, and finance. The move to relax the rule comes after several global retailers such as Walmart, Tesco, Metro Cash and Carry and Auchan Group conveyed to the government their willingness to set up shops here, provided the rules are relaxed to add more items to the shelves, official sources had told FE early last month. Even a Brazilian retailer is learnt to be exploring opportunities to invest in India with a local partner. Although these retailers haven’t submitted details of investments that they may make in India, the food processing ministry believes potential investments could be as much as $5-10 billion if rules are suitably relaxed. According to the food processing ministry proposal, if a foreign retailer invests, say, 20% of its total FDI in setting up infrastructure at the farm-gate level, it would be allowed to sell locally-produced non-food items worth 5% of the total FDI, along with the food items that must have been manufactured in the country. The non-food items could be related products like personal care or kitchenware that consumers would usually like to pick up along with food items in a supermarket. In June last year, the government notified that 100% FDI will be permitted (with government approval) in trading— including through e-commerce— of food products produced or manufactured in India to boost the realisations for farmers. Critics, however, pointed out that no supermarket would attract massive footfall and be profitable with just food items on its shelves. Recently, e-commerce players Amazon, Big Basket and Grofers applied for approval for retailing locally-produced food products, promising a combined investment of $695 million. Although a final approval by the government is expected soon, the food processing ministry—the administrative ministry in this case—has endorsed the proposals, setting the stage for the first lot of investments to flow in since the government tweaked FDI rules for the sector last year. Already, the food processing sector has started to see a jump in foreign investments. FDI inflows (in equity) in the sector touched $663.20 million in the April-January period, which were much higher than those of $506 million in the entire 2015-16 fiscal. The decision to allow 100% FDI in marketing of locally-produced food items was important as food and farm items worth Rs 92,651 crore go waste annually in India due to a low level of processing and inadequate infrastructure for scientific storage. The Narendra Modi government has already announced two big rounds of relaxations in the FDI regime, first in November 2015 and then in June last year, easing rules in over a dozen sectors ranging from real estate, pharmaceuticals, food marketing, aviation, defence to e-commerce and banking.

Mexican retailers' association ANTAD said sales at stores open at least a year rose 6.0 percent from April last year, the biggest jump since October 2016. Trump's surprise election in November raised the specter of recession in Mexico after his threats on the campaign trail to shred the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a lynchpin of Latin America's second-largest economy. ANTAD members include Wal-Mart de Mexico WALMEXV.MX, or Walmex, and Soriana (SORIANAB.MX). Total sales, which include stores opened during the last 12 months, grew 9.1 percent from April 2016, the group said. Walmex, the country's biggest retailer, said on Monday that sales at its Mexican stores open at least a year rose 10.2 percent from April 2016, the strongest growth in six months. Trump's victory sent the peso into a tailspin, prompting several economists to slash growth forecasts. Inflation has hit its fastest pace in nearly eight years as government-administered gasoline prices have spiked. But Mexico's economy has so far defied the predictions, with several leading companies posting strong first-quarter earnings. Underlining the brighter outlook, retail brand manager Grupo Axo plans to revive a stalled initial public offering later this month, sources told Reuters on Wednesday. Despite occasional threats from Trump, his administration has moderated its tone on how it would approach a renegotiation of NAFTA, helping the peso to rebound from a record low in January. The peso's recovery should help cool price pressures, while robust job creation and abundant consumer credit have combined to buttress consumption. With Trump threatening to crack down on illegal immigrants, remittances from Mexicans living abroad have lent added support to consumer spending. Remittances surged in March by 15.1 percent versus a year ago to $2.52 billion. "Consumer confidence is recovering after the January shock. It's a temporary shock," said Rafael Camarena, an economist at Santander.

Delay seen, again, on Trump growth agenda after Comey sacking NEW YORK Not even a week after the Trump administration and Congress rekindled optimism that they could soon make progress on a pro-growth agenda including tax cuts, the unexpected firing of the head of the FBI late Tuesday presented investors with a fresh reason to second-guess their confidence in the "Trump trade."

Eight years later, the mystery remains: How did Jody die? Abbott Koloff , NorthJersey Prelude The mystery begins in 2009 Share This Story 1 Tweet Share Share Pin Email Comment On May 8, 2009, a paraglider soaring over Poteau Mountain in eastern Oklahoma made a gruesome discovery. He spotted a body near the top of the mountain in the woods about 35 feet off a dirt logging road. Two days later, authorities confirmed the identity of the body — Jody Rilee-Wilson. The 23-year-old native of Roxbury Township in North Jersey had moved to Oklahoma a little more than a year before, seeking a fresh start outside of Morris County. In the spring of 2009, Jody was newly married and the doting mother of a little girl named Annabelle, living in the tiny town of Wister, Okla., population 1,100. Those closest to her said she was a proud mom, filled with a renewed sense of purpose and excited about starting a new job selling Avon cosmetics. Today, back in Roxbury, her parents, Jim and Stacey Rilee, remain in limbo. The past eight years have been marked by heartache and frustration as Oklahoma authorities – who said Jody was dragged into the woods after she died – have fruitlessly chased clues and been unable to solve the case. The trail has grown cold. “Without finalization,” Jim Rilee, a Roxbury councilman, said, “it makes it difficult to move on.” Just three days before her body was found, on the last day she was seen alive, Jody was planning to attend a family funeral in New Mexico  with her husband, their 3-month-old daughter and her in-laws. Inexplicably, Jody did not make the trip. Her body was found by the paraglider on the same day her family attended the funeral more than 550 miles away. Eight years later, the mystery remains: How did Jody die? CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Reporter Abbott Koloff talks about an upcoming multi-part series about the unsolved death of a NJ woman who moved to Oklahoma to start a new life. Danielle Parhizkaran/NorthJersey.com   Getting a fresh start In 2009, she had a new husband, a new baby and a life in Oklahoma Jody Rilee’s friends were stunned when she told them she was getting married and having a baby — just months after moving from Roxbury to Oklahoma to live with a great aunt nine years ago. The body of Jody Rilee Wilson, the daughter of Roxbury Jim Rilee and his wife Stacey, was found on the top of an Oklahoma mountain in 2009. (Photo: Courtesy of the Rilee family) But that was Jody, they said, making up her mind about something and plunging headlong into life. Outgoing and quick with conversation, she made friends easily, though she was occasionally bored by eastern Oklahoma’s slow pace. She told friends and family that she missed some things she had taken for granted in New Jersey: good pizza, Taylor ham, stores that stayed open later than 8 p.m. – and not having to pump your own gas. But she resisted the temptation to return. After all, she left the Garden State because her life wasn’t moving forward as she had hoped. The 2003 Roxbury High School graduate considered becoming a nurse and then took interior design classes at the County College of Morris. But she wound up doing clerical work for a furniture store. She told her family and friends that she wanted more. Hoping for a fresh start, she moved west in 2008, but a similar pattern emerged. Jody, with her large brown eyes and warm smile, landed a job working as a cashier in a Walmart pharmacy in the small city of Poteau (pronounced po-tow) near the Arkansas border. She told friends she was determined to be independent. The body of Jody Rilee-Wilson, a 2003 Roxbury HS grad, was found on an Oklahoma mountain. (Photo: File photo) But she seemed stuck in the same rut. Then, in early 2008, she met Donald Lee Bocephus “Bo” Wilson and everything changed. Her friends were uncertain how or where Jody met Bo, a mechanic for a natural gas company. They might have been introduced by a mutual friend, not an unusual occurrence in the region, which is made up of several towns so small that it seems everyone knows each other. What was certain was how quickly their relationship grew serious. A new family On Mother's Day, Jody called her parents to tell them that she was having a baby and that Bo had proposed. Such a move wasn't necessarily out of character for Jody, said Lisa Anderson, Jody’s childhood friend from Roxbury who now lives in Florida. Jody had “an amazing energy and thirst for life,” Anderson said, recalling a vacation to Mexico the two shared after high school. “Jody would be the first one to be dancing on the table,” Anderson said. “She wasn’t afraid of anything. I wanted to be like her.” Still, Anderson was concerned when Jody said she was getting married after knowing Bo for just a short time. But Jody assured Anderson that she had no reservations. “When she had her mind made up, she would stick to her guns,” Anderson said.

(Photo: Courtesy of the Rilee family) Jody’s closest friend in Oklahoma also said she seemed certain about the marriage. Even so, Jody didn't talk a great deal about her attraction to Bo, said Holly Logston, who had been a student of Jody’s great aunt, an art teacher at Poteau High School. “She saw something in him,” Logston said, adding that Jody visited her at work to show off her engagement ring. “She was so excited, and so happy,” Logston said. “She was getting married; she was having a baby – life was great.” Jody and Bo were married in September 2008, with the reception held at a hotel in Fort Smith, Ark., the closest city. Their daughter, Annabelle, was born a few months later in January 2009. Within a year of moving to Oklahoma, Jody, who longed to be a mother and always prized traditional values, had a family of her own. The importance of family was something she learned in her hometown of Roxbury, which has a population of more than 20,000 and is a bustling suburban township in Morris County, crisscrossed by highways and dotted with shopping plazas. Her life in Wister, where she lived in a trailer with Bo and Annabelle, couldn't be more different. “Being wrapped up in his family is what made her feel like an outsider. I know she felt like that at times.”Lisa Anderson, Jody Rilee-Wilson's childhood friend Some 20 times smaller than Roxbury, there was little to do in Wister, a town of 1,100. So Jody's life revolved around her baby. “She was head over heels in love with her little girl,” Anderson said. “Everything was about Annabelle.” Under the surface, though, beyond the flush of excitement that comes with the first year of marriage and the joy of a new child, there were signs of tension. Jody had told Logston that she had unspecified “issues” with her in-laws, who also lived in Wister, but did not share more detail. But, Logston said of the couple: “They were happy. And that’s what matters.” Anderson — who was Jody’s maid of honor at her wedding — said her friend did not feel accepted by some members of her new family. “Being wrapped up in his family is what made her feel like an outsider,” Anderson said. “I know she felt like that at times.” Thoughts of returning to New Jersey Even before Annabelle was born, Jody had told Anderson that she had been thinking about returning home to Roxbury where her parents still live. That feeling continued after the birth, Anderson said. Although she appeared to be happy in Oklahoma in many ways, Jody told Anderson that she argued with her husband and had “differing opinions” with her in-laws about raising the baby. “It never got to the point of her bags being packed,” said Anderson, who declined to discuss the reason for the arguments and said Jody didn’t specify her differences with Bo’s parents. But, Anderson said, the idea of coming home to Roxbury with Annabelle was a “recurring theme.” Jim and Stacey Rilee of Roxbury. (Photo: northjersey.com File photo) Still, Jody was determined to make this new life a success. In the days before she disappeared, Jody seemed to have found a new focus, landing a job selling cosmetics for Avon and telling friends how excited she was to get started. She even planned to take Annabelle on sales calls. During a lunch meeting near her home with a company district manager to brainstorm sales ideas, Jody mentioned that she would be away for a few days attending a funeral. That night, Jody sent the manager an email, saying that she had purchased neon paper for an Avon party and was bubbling with ideas after participating in a conference call on sales techniques. “I am SO GLAD I listened to it, it gave me even MORE ideas than you gave me today!!” she wrote. She added that “*my brain is on overload lol*” and that she was eager to follow suggestions made in the conference call, like asking clients for referrals. “I am going to try that tomorrow,” she promised. The email was sent at 9:17 p.m. on Tuesday, May 5, 2009. It was the last time anyone heard from Jody Rilee-Wilson. It was last night she was seen alive.   Email deepens the mystery The email raised questions about Jody's disappearance Jody Rilee-Wilson was as happy as she had been in some time — and that came through when she told friends and family about her new job at Avon. She spoke to her parents about pushing her 3-month-old daughter, Annabelle, in a carriage from house to house while on sales calls. She wrote to the Avon district manager to say she was “VERY excited” about working with her.  Then, in a casual reminder that seemed insignificant at the time, she wrote to her boss that she was planning to be “out of town Thursday through Saturday.” She had lost her cellphone but added that she could be reached on her husband’s phone. “Talk to you soon!!!” she concluded. That was Tuesday, May 5, 2009, the same day that a missing person report indicates that Jody’s husband — who was accompanied by his parents, baby Annabelle and a pet possum — left without her to attend a funeral more than 550 miles away in New Mexico. Jody Rilee-Wilson, on her wedding day in 2008. (Photo: File photo) Jody was never again seen alive. Eight years later, it is still not clear whether her family left earlier than planned, or whether Jody was mistaken about when they were going to leave. Perhaps most of all, it’s unknown — almost unfathomable, her friends said — why Jody would have stayed at home in Wister, Okla., but allowed her newborn baby to make the trip. “She would never have let Annabelle go away from her for that long,” said Lisa Anderson, Jody’s childhood friend from Roxbury, a Morris County township where Jody grew up. Holly Logston, Jody’s friend from Oklahoma, said that she never remembers seeing Jody without Annabelle. Mother and daughter were inseparable. “I don’t think she would ever have parted with her baby,” Logston said. Jody’s husband, Bo Wilson, told people that Jody changed her mind about going to the funeral. But the reason, to this day, remains unknown. Reached by phone recently, Wilson did not respond to a request to be interviewed about Jody. The line went dead, and he did not reply to a subsequent voicemail message. His phone was later disconnected. His parents did not respond to messages requesting interviews. His father, Jerry Don Wilson Sr., said in a 2009 telephone interview that the family left for the funeral in the evening on that Tuesday, May 5. However, he declined to answer additional questions or offer more details. A funeral in New Mexico The funeral had been for one of Bo’s maternal uncles, S.D. Mayfield. The Mass was held three days later, on Friday morning, May 8, at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Clayton, N.M. And the burial was 40 minutes away in Wheeless, Okla. St. Francis Xavier Church in Clayton, N.M., the site of a 2009 funeral Mass for Bo Wilson's uncle. (Photo: St. Francis Xavier Church) Mayfield's widow, Earlene, who has since died, said in a 2009 interview that the Wilsons met her at an Amarillo, Texas, funeral home days earlier. She said that Bo later was “beating himself up” for leaving Jody in Wister. “I do know Bo worshiped that girl,” she said. After returning home from the funeral early on Saturday, Bo Wilson filed a missing person report with the police in Wister, indicating on a form that Jody was last seen on Tuesday, May 5. Frank Pittman, a retired Roswell, N.M., police officer who is Bo’s maternal uncle, said in a recent interview that he and other family members gathered early for the funeral in Clayton. He did not question why Jody was not with the Wilsons. He did note that his sister Kathy, Bo’s mother, traveled to New Mexico with a pet sugar glider, a type of possum, which she kept in a cage. Jody had told her parents, Jim and Stacey Rilee, that she was going to attend the funeral. But Stacey Rilee was unsure of when Jody was leaving for the funeral. The last time she spoke to her daughter, on Tuesday evening at about 9 p.m., Jody told her mother that she had lost her phone. After Jody didn’t respond to an email, Stacey called Bo Wilson on Thursday and was told her daughter had stayed home. Bo Wilson had a friend check the house on Friday, the Rilees have said. But Jody wasn’t home and her SUV wasn’t there. The Rilees said Bo told them she might be visiting a friend. It wasn’t until Saturday that the Rilees knew something was terribly wrong. The Wilsons returned home from the funeral to Wister, and Jody was still missing. The family dogs, including Jody’s Boston terrier, named Buttons, were without food. And two rain-soaked packages were sitting on steps outside Bo and Jody’s home. One of them contained a locket the Rilees had sent to their daughter — a gift for her first Mother’s Day.   Frantic search ends in heartbreak Friends, family search for Jody Rilee-Wilson, not knowing her body had been found As her family and friends frantically searched for her, Jody Rilee-Wilson's body had already been found — but not yet identified — on Poteau Mountain in Oklahoma, a little more than 10 miles from where she lived in the small town of Wister. “It would have been Jody's first Mother's Day" as a mother. "She and her mom were so close. She would never let the day go by without calling her mother. When the day dragged on, that's when I knew she wasn't here.”Lisa Anderson, Jody Rilee-Wilson's childhood friend Lisa Anderson, her closest friend from their Morris County hometown of Roxbury, said she had been sure Jody would show up by Mother's Day, May 10, 2009. Her heart sank when there was no word of her return. "It would have been Jody's first Mother's Day" as a mother, Anderson said. "She and her mom were so close. She would never let the day go by without calling her mother. When the day dragged on, that's when I knew she wasn't here." Jody's father, Jim Rilee, a Roxbury councilman who was the township's deputy mayor at the time, flew to Oklahoma on Mother's Day and went straight to the Wister police station. He said he was speaking with a police officer when an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agent approached him. Jody's body, he was told, had just been identified. She had been found two days earlier, on the same day her husband, baby and in-laws attended a funeral in New Mexico. "I punched a filing cabinet," Rilee said.

The case remains unsolved. (Photo: Viorel Florescu/NorthJersey.com) He implored the agent to find whoever was responsible for his daughter's death. Then he made what he described as the most difficult phone call of his life: telling his wife that their only daughter was dead. On the other end of the line, his wife, Stacey, broke down in tears, unable to speak. One of Jody's friends from Oklahoma, Holly Logston, said she had been helping in the search by making calls to friends in an attempt to find Jody. She was driving in the small city of Poteau (pronounced po-tow), near the Arkansas border, when she received a phone call. Though her memories of that time are fuzzy, she said that she is "almost sure" the person on the other end was Kathy Wilson, Jody's mother-in-law, who told her that Jody had been found. Logston asked where, and said she was stunned by the response, words that still ring in her ears: "Honey, she's dead." Jim and Stacey Rilee at their Morris County home on April 29. Photos on the wall are of their daughter, Jody Rilee-Wilson, whose body was found in Oklahoma in 2009. (Photo: Michael Karas/Northjersey.com) "I couldn't believe it," Logston said. "This just doesn't happen here." Jerry Don Wilson Jr. said he drove from Missouri to Oklahoma to comfort his half-brother, Bo Wilson, Jody's husband, after her death. He said Bo kept staring at a picture of her from their wedding. "He would look at that and bawl like a baby," said Wilson Jr., who now lives in Wyoming. "He didn't say anything. I honestly thought he loved her and missed her. … I guess they seemed happy." When he visited the couple in early 2009, he said, Jody raced from the house to show him their baby. He said that he loved Jody and thought she was a "sweet girl." He described Bo as a "real nice guy, quiet and mellow." But he did say that it was "kind of weird" when his brother told him Jody changed her mind about going to the funeral in New Mexico. He was never given a reason. Jody's car recovered 100 miles away More than a month after Jody died, her Chevy S-10 Blazer was found more than 100 miles from where her body was found, in the parking lot of the Pig Out Palace, a 24-hour buffet restaurant in Henryetta, Okla.

(Photo: Courtesy of Joe Dunnington) The owner of the restaurant, which has since closed, said in a 2009 interview that the car had been there for weeks, at least, and was unlocked with the keys in the ignition when he had it towed away. He said it wasn't unusual for people to leave cars in the lot because of its location — just off Exit 237 on westbound Interstate 40, a heavily traveled route that crosses Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle on the way to New Mexico. Police took possession of Jody's car on June 12, 2009, but have not provided information about whether they were able to obtain any clues. There were cameras inside the restaurant, but the owner said they hadn't worked for years. There were no video surveillance cameras in the restaurant parking lot. Investigation into Jody's death stalls Slow pace of investigation leaves Rilees in limbo Three months after their daughter’s death, Jim and Stacey Rilee took a bumpy ride up an Oklahoma mountain logging road with authorities to see where her body had been found.  The rock and dirt path was even more difficult to traverse during the week that Jody Rilee-Wilson disappeared, they were told, because it had been partially washed out by rain. They stopped near the top of Poteau Mountain, with an elevation of more than 2,600 feet. Jody’s father, Jim Rilee, followed agents through the woods to a spot that he said was so far out of the way that not even hunters would stumble upon it. Roxbury Councilman Jim Rilee and his wife, Stacey, talk about their daughter, Jody Rilee-Wilson, whose body was found on the top of an Oklahoma mountain in 2009. (Photo: Viorel Florescu/NorthJersey.com) Rilee said it was a matter of luck that a paraglider spotted Jody’s body from the air and reported it to authorities. “There was zero doubt she was put there with the hope that she would never be found,” said Rilee, a Roxbury councilman. “We didn’t know what happened, but at least we had her body, so we didn’t have to wonder whether she was alive or dead.” The Rilees anticipated that an arrest would be made in the case, perhaps within days or weeks. They have declined to discuss what they believe happened to their daughter. But as the years passed, they have been left in limbo, no closer now than they were eight years ago to knowing how their daughter died. Rilee said his daughter was “murdered.” CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Jim and Stacey Rilee talk about their daughter Jody Rilee-Wilson, whose body was found on a mountaintop in Oklahoma in 2009. Michael Karas/NorthJersey However, authorities have not labeled her death a homicide because her body was badly decomposed, masking possible injuries. Dental records and tattoos — a butterfly and a four-leaf clover — were used to identify her. Instead, authorities called it a “suspicious” death after determining from scratches that her body had been dragged into the woods after she died. A toxicology report showed no evidence of drug abuse. “Without finalization,” Jim Rilee said, “it makes it difficult to move on.” Stacey Rilee said that she and her husband “really never got to properly say goodbye to our daughter." "We could not really grieve because there was so much to look into,” she said. Stacey, as she looked at family photos, noted Jody's smile and the resemblance to Annabelle, Jody's child, who was only 3 months old when her mother died. Annabelle, now 8 years old, is the daughter of Jody Rilee-Wilson, whose body was found on the top of an Oklahoma mountain in 2009. (Photo: Viorel Florescu/NorthJersey.com) “She was our child,” Stacey said of Jody. “The way she was left …” Her voice trailed off as her husband finished the sentence: “... was not suitable for anybody.” Oklahoma authorities said that by late 2009 they had exhausted all clues, and had just one agent assigned to the case while juggling other duties. Jessica Brown, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, said then that additional agents would be assigned if the agency received “an influx of leads.” In an email this January, Brown said “agents are busy working the case” but declined to comment on whether there were new leads or to provide details about the status of the case. REWARD: Rilees offering $30,000 for leads in daughter's death One of Jody’s friends from Oklahoma, Holly Logston, said the case is never mentioned anymore by local media. Jody’s friends put up posters seeking information in the weeks after her body was found and identified, she said, but now she wonders whether there ever will be an arrest. In the home of (not pictured) Jim and Stacey Rilee, a picture of their daughter Jody Rilee-Wilson hangs on the wall on Friday, April 29, 2017. Jody Rilee-Wilson moved to Oklahoma to find a new life. She got married and had a baby. Her body was found on a mountaintop in Oklahoma in 2009. (Photo: Michael Karas/Northjersey.com) “It’s not something I like to think about,” Logston said, questioning whether law enforcement has done enough to solve the case. “Sadness has turned to anger,” she said. Not long ago, she said, she saw the Rilees with Jody’s daughter, Annabelle, at a store in Fort Smith, Ark., the largest city in the area. “I think she looks just like her mother,” Logston said. “Jody would be proud.” Now remarried and a preacher, Jody’s husband, Bo Wilson, attends the Family Praise and Worship Center, a Pentecostal church in Heavener, Okla., with his family, according to the church’s pastor, Don Benefield. The pastor said Bo had been helping take care of his father, Jerry Wilson Sr. Bo Wilson and his parents did not respond to interview requests for this article. Cecil Woolery, 82, who said he has been friendly with the Wilson family for more than 20 years, said Bo Wilson is a skilled carpenter and mechanic and has rebuilt motorcycles. Bo’s father rarely leaves home anymore because of an unspecified medical condition, Woolery said. He has been spending most of his time watching “Lone Ranger” videos and Western movies starring Tom Mix and John Wayne. Roxbury native Jody Rilee-Wilson was dragged into the woods in Oklahoma after she died, an autopsy report found. (Photo: File photo) Oklahoma court records show that Bo’s father was charged with aggravated assault in 2013, when police said he threatened to cut a man’s “guts out” and swung a 6-inch knife at him inside a restaurant. The man pushed Wilson Sr. backward with a chair to protect himself but stopped when he noticed Annabelle, then 5 years old, “standing at Jerry’s hip,” police said in an arrest warrant. Other patrons subdued Wilson Sr. He received a suspended sentence, records show, after a child endangerment charge was dropped. Bo’s half-brother, Jerry Don Wilson Jr., said he was aware of that incident. Their father loves Annabelle, he added, as do all of her grandparents. His father, he said, did not seem to trust the Rilees and referred to them as “those damn Yankees.” He hopes Jody’s death is solved. “Her family needs to know what happened,” Wilson Jr. said. “Annabelle needs to know.” Jody’s friends and family have an enduring faith that there will be an arrest someday. But a childhood friend, Lisa Anderson, who has visited Oklahoma with Jody’s parents, noted that people there seem to have forgotten her. It was “almost like she was never there.” Epilogue Rilees see Jody in her daughter, Annabelle Eight years after their daughter’s death, Jim and Stacey Rilee see Jody’s smile in their 8-year-old granddaughter, Annabelle, as they play together with Barbie dolls during weekly computer video chats. They hear their daughter’s laughter when they take Annabelle to a mall near her Oklahoma home to sit on Santa’s lap, keeping alive a family tradition. Stacey Rilee at her home on Friday, April 29, 2017. Her daughter Jody Rilee-Wilson moved to Oklahoma to find a new life. She got married and had a baby. Her body was found on a mountaintop in Oklahoma in 2009. Pictures of Jody hang on the wall. (Photo: Michael Karas/Northjersey.com) But for two years after Jody’s death, they had limited contact with their granddaughter — greatly compounding their feelings of loss and grief. That changed when they went to court and an Oklahoma judge granted them unsupervised visits in a ruling issued on Nov. 29, 2011. The Rilees declined to discuss that case in a recent interview, but said in prior interviews that they went almost a year without seeing their granddaughter before the judge’s order. Now, the Rilees travel for regular visits to Fort Smith Ark., not far from where Annabelle lives. They taught her to swim and to do cannonball dives in their hotel pool. They told her about her mother’s love of music and that she played the flute. They said they feel a strong connection to Jody when they spend time with Annabelle, who greatly resembles her mother and has some of her personality traits. "She doesn't like to lose at games," Stacey Rilee said. Jim and Stacey Rilee of Roxbury have decorated their late daughter's old room in pink, anticipating that her daughter, 8-year-old Annabelle, will come for a visit. (Photo: Michael Karas/Northjersey.com) "We have reminders every day of who she was," Jim Rilee said of Jody. Annabelle has yet to stay with the Rilees at their Roxbury home. In anticipation that she will visit, they have decorated Jody’s old room with pink pillows and curtains, a Hello Kitty comforter, photos of Jody, and their daughter’s Barbie dollhouse, which had been stored in the attic. Stacey Rilee said she often talks to Jody in her head, seeking guidance and assurance that she and her husband are doing what Jody would have wanted for her daughter and their granddaughter. Annabelle knows her mother died years ago. She has not asked for details but sometimes wants to know something about her mom. Stacey told her that she reminds her of Jody, who is watching over her. “I basically tell her that her mom is looking down on her from heaven,” she said.   Share This Story 1 Tweet Share Share Pin Email Comment © 2017 northjersey.com, All rights reserved.

The Pioneer Woman Magazine, under the ownership of Hearst Magazines and Scripps Networks Interactive, will release its first issue in Walmart stores on June 6th—and we’ve got an exclusive first look at the debut cover. Like her wildly popular blog, the publication will feature a combination of food, home and decor ideas, parenting advice, and a glimpse into life on her Oklahoma ranch. Pioneer Woman Magazine The first issue promises easy family recipes, fashion tips (a cowgirl boots buyer’s guide!), and a personal essay from Drummond on the death of her family dog, Charlie, who fans were familiar with through social media and frequent appearances on her Food Network show. This is just the latest of a vast portfolio of business ventures from the culinary expert, who recently opened The Mercantile, a restaurant, coffee shop and retail store in Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Since opening its doors, the space has attracted visitors from across the country to the small town with a population of only 3,000. Drummond also has a popular homeware collection and a multitude of cookbooks and children’s books. FROM COINAGE: Should You Be Tipping In Cash Only? “Everything just kind of plays into the other, and feeds off the other,” she told PEOPLE in November of her many entrepreneurial endeavors. “I do think of myself as a blogger first, but in a way it’s kind of all one big picture.” We can’t wait to see what she’ll cook up next.

Mexican retailers' association ANTAD said sales at stores open at least a year rose 6.0 percent from April last year, the biggest jump since October 2016. Trump's surprise election in November raised the specter of recession in Mexico after his threats on the campaign trail to shred the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a lynchpin of Latin America's second-largest economy. ANTAD members include Wal-Mart de Mexico WALMEXV.MX, or Walmex, and Soriana (SORIANAB.MX). Total sales, which include stores opened during the last 12 months, grew 9.1 percent from April 2016, the group said. Walmex, the country's biggest retailer, said on Monday that sales at its Mexican stores open at least a year rose 10.2 percent from April 2016, the strongest growth in six months. Trump's victory sent the peso into a tailspin, prompting several economists to slash growth forecasts. Inflation has hit its fastest pace in nearly eight years as government-administered gasoline prices have spiked. But Mexico's economy has so far defied the predictions, with several leading companies posting strong first-quarter earnings. Underlining the brighter outlook, retail brand manager Grupo Axo plans to revive a stalled initial public offering later this month, sources told Reuters on Wednesday. Despite occasional threats from Trump, his administration has moderated its tone on how it would approach a renegotiation of NAFTA, helping the peso to rebound from a record low in January. The peso's recovery should help cool price pressures, while robust job creation and abundant consumer credit have combined to buttress consumption. With Trump threatening to crack down on illegal immigrants, remittances from Mexicans living abroad have lent added support to consumer spending.

The CEO expects the company will return to positive comps and earnings growth by fiscal-year end 2018. The company is targeting an additional $300 million in cost savings. Earlier Wednesday, Whole Foods reported its earnings and announced a shake up of its board. Jeff Daniels | @jeffdanielsca 8 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Keith Beaty | Toronto Star | Getty Images A Whole Foods store Whole Foods Markets co-founder and CEO John Mackey insisted the company's smaller-format 365 stores are doing well as he provided an update on the retailer's turnaround strategy Wednesday. The call comes one month after activist investor Jana Partners disclosed a nearly 9 percent stake in the Austin, Texas-based chain and ratcheted up pressure on management to deliver better results. It also came on the same day Whole Foods announced a shake up of its board of directors, including the exit of five members and the naming of a new chairperson. "We understand that we need to do much more, and faster," said Mackey. "Initiatives in operational improvements we're undertaking will drive sales, EBITDA, and EPS growth and shareholder value." Mackey projected the retailer will return to positive comps and earnings growth by fiscal-year end 2018. Extend Rewards Program, Focus on Cost Cuts He said one way the retailer plans to achieve the goals is by focusing on its affinity rewards and marketing initiatives as well as through cost savings. At the same time, the CEO said the company plans $300 million in additional cost savings on top of what was already announced in 2015 and is "taking a number of steps to reach these incremental savings." Whole Foods is struggling as competition in the organic and natural foods retail space intensifies. It comes as archrival Sprouts Farmers Market, Wal-Mart Stores and others have pushed to lure customers with lower prices. The company's fiscal second-quarter same-store sales or comps reported Wednesday marked the seventh consecutive quarter of negative comps for the company. Same-store sales in the quarter ended April 9 were down 2.8 percent, although better than the 3.1 percent decline in comps that had been projected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. One part of the company's turnaround strategy is to roll out more of its 365 stores, which are smaller than its traditional Whole Foods outlets and aimed at value-focused consumers. Also, the company plans to continue cost cutting in its business. "We continue to test and refine our 365 model," said Mackey. "We like the profit model that 365 delivers. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that Whole Foods has but also has significantly lower capital costs." The company currently operates four of the 365 format stores and indicated it has 22 more in the pipeline and will be increasing that number. The company said it's made "significant improvements" to the 365 model since originally rolling out the concept. Meantime, Whole Foods named five new independent directors, effective immediately, as well as announced that Gabrielle Sulzberger was appointed the new chairperson of the retailer's board. She has been a board member of the company since 2003. Also, Whole Foods named Keith Manbeck as its new chief financial officer. Most recently, Manbeck was a senior vice president in charge of digital finance, strategy management and business transformation at Kohl's. He assumes the new post, effective May 17. Whole Foods' new chair takes swipe at Jana Partners During the call, the new chairperson commented on Jana Partners and its recent purchase of a stake in the retailer. She also took a swipe at the activist investor. According to Sulzberger, Whole Foods was not contacted by Jana prior to the April 10 filing but afterward held discussions with them and even identified two of Jana's nominees it was prepared to add to a new board. "Jana indicated they were pleasantly surprised by the changes but they currently didn't want to tie their hands with an agreement," said Sulzberger. "Both sides suggested that we would continue the dialogue." Added the Whole Foods chair, "We are disappointed that our confidential discussions have been provided by Jana to the press. We look forward to constructive dialogue with all of our shareholders, including Jana." Besides Jana Partners, Whole Foods is facing pressure from investor Neuberger Berman, which owns just under 3 percent of the retailer. Neuberger last month notified the board that it should "immediately engage shareholders" to consider options, including a possible sale of the company. There's also been speculation another grocer may want to acquire Whole Foods, including perhaps Albertsons. During Wednesday's call, Whole Foods management wasn't asked specifically about a possible sale of the company or possible suitors. Jana didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. One analyst during the call asked if Whole Foods had "enough depth of management to execute" the ambitious plan or whether they might "bring in additional help." The CEO seemed to be taken aback, responding: "We feel like we're well advised. We have a number of excellent consulting firms we're working with." He also pointed out the company just hired a new CFO who will "add new depth to our leadership team."

Shares of Whole Foods rose more than 2 percent to $37.25 in after-hours trading on Wednesday, as it named former Kohl's Corp executive Keith Manbeck as chief financial officer, effective May 17. Whole Foods, which posted its seventh straight quarterly same-store sales decline, also appointed Gabrielle Sulzberger as chairman. The new independent directors are former Footlocker Chief Executive Ken Hicks, Morningstar founder and Executive Chairman Joe Mansueto, former Best Buy Co Inc Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam, Panera Bread Co founder and Chief Executive Ron Shaich, and State Street Global Advisors CEO Scott Powers. The shakeup came after Jana Partners took an 8.3 percent stake in the company and nominated four directors for the board. Mutual fund firm Neuberger Berman, which owns a 2.7 percent stake, has also pressured Whole Foods to take steps to improve its stock price, which has fallen steadily since peaking in 2013. Reuters earlier on Wednesday reported that Whole Foods planned to remove more than half its board, citing a person familiar with the matter. The board, with 12 directors, is expected to remove another two directors by year-end, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and requested anonymity. Whole Foods has been losing shoppers to rivals as the natural and organic category it pioneered has gone mainstream at retailers including Kroger Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc , as well as newer competitors like Amazon.com Inc and meal kit provider Blue Apron. The grocer has not struck a standstill agreement with Jana, the source said, meaning the hedge fund can continue to pressure it to improve performance. Standstill agreements usually offer an activist hedge fund representation on the company's board in exchange for support and silence for at least the next year. Jana and a spokesman for Whole Foods were not immediately available for comment. In a filing in April, Jana said it was frustrated with Whole Foods' lack of engagement regarding its strategic review, noting its "apparent unwillingness to engage in discussions with third parties regarding such alternatives." Jana has nominated four directors for Whole Foods' board, including former Gap Inc CEO Glenn Murphy, former Harris Teeter Supermarkets CEO Thomas "Tad" Dickson and former Barclays stock analyst Meredith Adler. Jana can still nominate that slate at the next Whole Foods annual meeting, which is expected in February. Late last year, Whole Foods returned co-founder John Mackey to the role of solo CEO after six years of splitting the job with Walter Robb, who focused on operations, betting that Mackey would be best to lead a turnaround. After Jana disclosed its stake, acquisition speculation swirled around the company, though a suitor has yet to emerge. Whole Foods posted quarterly sales of $3.74 billion, edging past analysts' average estimate of $3.73 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Austin, Texas-based company reported a 2.8 percent fall in sales at stores open at least 13 months, less than the 3.1 percent drop expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. Net income declined to $99 million, or 31 cents per share, from $142 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, earnings of 37 cents per share in the second quarter ended April 9 were in line with the analysts' average estimate. The company trimmed its 2017 earnings forecast to $1.30 per share, from the previous forecast of $1.33.

Both lawmakers and the nominee himself made it a point to address that immediately during the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on President Donald Trump’s pick for the post. “Twenty-seven years ago, the Chief Financial Officers Act was passed, and to this day, the department of Defense is still not auditable. The department of defense is the only department in the federal government which has failed to meet this mandate,” committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in his opening statement at the May 10 hearing. “This has been a very public continuing failure for the department due to a failure of senior management to make this a priority for the department and invest the necessary time and will to get it done. This must end with you, Mr. Norquist and Ms. McCusker.” David Norquist is the President’s nominee for the DoD comptroller position. He was formerly the chief financial officer at the Department of Homeland Security, and oversaw DHS’ first audit. Elaine McCusker is the nominee for principal deputy undersecretary of Defense. “Let me address it directly: it is time to audit the Pentagon. For seven years or more, the department has engaged in audit readiness, preparing for a full-scope audit without starting it. This approach has diminishing returns,” Norquist said. “I recognize it will take time for the department to go from being audited to passing an audit. Everything you have heard about the size and complexity of the department is true. And this legitimately makes any endeavor, including an audit, harder. But that is not a reason to delay the audit. That is a reason to begin.” Sign up for the online chat with Col. Brandon Pearce, NGA's chief information security officer, May 15, 12:30 p.m. Advertisement Before Norquist became CFO at DHS in 2006, the department had never passed an audit. It’s now achieved four consecutive clean opinions. The only real difference between DHS and DoD, Norquist said, is that DHS didn’t have a choice; the audit had already started. Norquist and McCusker agreed that the most important thing is to actually start the audit immediately, rather than waiting until DoD is confident it can pass. “Not starting the audit because you’re afraid of what it might find is like not going to the doctor because you’re afraid what he might say. It does not make problems better,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). But this perspective also stems from a lack of experience with audits. Norquist said DoD officials view auditors coming back in a year as a problem, whereas those with experience in audits take a outlook, which helps things run more smoothly. The other commonly expressed major barrier to starting the audit is DoD’s size and complexity as an organization. “If you look at the size and complexity issue, my point, coming from the business world, is if you look at it, the Department of Defense is only a little larger than Wal-Mart,” said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). “I can’t imagine Wal-Mart calling the [Securities and Exchange Commission] or any other agencies and saying ‘we’re too large and complex to file our documents this quarter.'” ‘If you’re a really good federal worker, you should welcome’ the reorganization plan, OMB says Norquist said one successful strategy is to break down the accountability to the smallest level where people actually have the authority to make changes. At DHS, as these groups were consistently held accountable, their peers began to improve their efforts to comply as well. Finally, DoD’s systems present a significant challenge to the audit. “To get a clean audit, you have to have an accounting system that actually works. That’s my concern: that we don’t have an accounting system in the DoD that actually works,” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R- Iowa). But the problem isn’t quite as simple as a broken system. “The first challenge is there are a large number of accounting systems at the Department of Defense,” Norquist said. “It’s not essential to get down to one, but getting down to a small number would be a step in the right direction.” This was also one of the main priorities for Robert Daigle, the nominee for director of the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation at DoD. He said there are too many legacy systems that simply don’t talk to one another, and that these disparate data structures mean someone has to manually collect and translate the data when moving from one system to another. Consolidating these systems into a single, enterprisewide system would allow the department a centralized view of the accounting. “That’s the kind of attitude and foresight we’re looking for,” Ernst said. McCain pointed out that until the audit is finally completed, it will be impossible to tell how much money is being spent by DoD, and on what. And that, despite the focus of the hearing, is the primary responsibility of all three positions. “It seems to me that none of the three of you can do your job unless you have a handle on how much money is being spent,” he said.

Here’s a list of gear and advice on how to avoid it. By: Joe Jackson May 10, 2017 Share This Facebook Icon Share Twitter Icon Tweet Pinterest Icon Pinterest SMS Icon Text Email Icon Email Whether hiking or running, summertime heat can take a toll. Here's how to prepare. Photo: Louis Arevalo/TandemStock If you’re just headed out for a short hike or run near your house this summer, bring water and wear sunscreen. If you’re planning a longer epic, you’ll need to be more careful. For advice on hot-weather mistakes and helpful gear to stay cool, I called up four professional ultrarunners—people accustomed to running stupid-far distances in unbearable heat—who gave me a host of smart, surprising ideas. Here are the six mistakes they see most often.  #1. Stripping Down It’s tempting to take off your shirt to stay cool, but that can actually make you hotter. “That radiation from the sun is going to heat your core temperature up more than if you have a light layer and a hat that will give you a little shade,” says Salomon pro Max King. He suggests a breathable white layer that will let you vent and also reflect the sun. My pick is Patagonia’s Capilene Lightweight Crew. Also make sure your lid breathes: trucker hats with a brim and mesh back are an easy, cheap solution.   #2. Drying Out During the winter, you want your clothes to stay dry. During the summer, you want them to stay wet. “I want my top to stay as wet as possible,” says Nike runner David Laney. Cotton T-shirts are great at holding onto moisture, so that’s what Laney suggests for the hottest days. I personally like the cheapest cotton T-shirts I can find at places like Walmart and Target. He also suggests dunking your shirt in a river or pouring water onto your head and chest every chance you get. #3. Ignoring Your Core Many of us just pay attention to how our skin feels under the sun. But when it’s dangerously hot, you also need to pay attention to your core temperature. Dean Karnazes, who has run the Badwater ultramarathon through California’s Death Valley ten times, says temperatures creep up to an astounding 130 degrees. When it's this hot, he likes to place ice around major arteries so that it can cool his blood. For example, he’ll tie a bandana around his neck and fill it with ice to cool his carotid. (A Buff would work equally well.) He also recommends RecoFit arm sleeves, which can hold ice on your radial arteries.  #4. Soaking Your Feet You do want a wet core, but you don’t want wet feet. “Wet socks in hot shoes and hot ground conditions is a recipe for blistering,” Karnazes says. When you’re dumping water over your head, spread your legs to avoid your feet. Also, avoid waterproof shoes. No waterproof liner can vent sweat fast enough in hot conditions to keep you from getting wet feet and possible blisters. On hot days, I like to run in the Hoka Speed Instincts because of their lightweight uppers. #5. Poor Water Planning On long hikes or runs, you can’t realistically carry enough water to drink and pour over your head. So you’ll need to carefully plan to stop by water sources along the way, whether that’s a mountain stream or a 7-Eleven. King also suggests that you plan for your terrain. You’ll get much hotter running or hiking up hills, of course, and so you’ll need more water to cool off. #6. Not Acclimating “The biggest mistake that I think people make is heading out early in the summer thinking that they can do the exact same [distance and speed] that they could do at the end of the summer last year,” King says. “It takes time to acclimate to the heat.” One acclimation tip from King: overdress in the spring. When you head out for a run on a 60-degree March or April day, wear a thick midlayer like the OR Deviator Hoody instead of a just a running shirt, which can simulate hotter temperatures. King also suggests spending time in a dry sauna for 30 minutes a day to get your body ready for the heat.  Filed To: Road Running, Trail Running, Hiking and Backpacking, Hiking Shoes, Thru-Hiking Share This Facebook Icon Share Twitter Icon Tweet Pinterest Icon Pinterest SMS Icon Text Email Icon Email Subscribe to Outside Save 72% and Get the Special Women's Issue!

Dirksen Parkway. Jessica N. Spencer, 26, of Flowerbrook Court, is facing possible charges of attempted robbery and aggravated battery, a press release from Springfield police said. The 52-year-old female victim said she was loading groceries in her car about 5:15 p.m. when a woman, allegedly Spencer, took her purse from the shopping cart. Spencer jumped into a moving truck and the 52-year-old also jumped into the vehicle.

Published: 10 hours ago (DAILY CALLER) — DCRTV.com founder and editor Dave Hughes, one of the most obnoxious bloggers in the Washington area, is now living out of his car. “Living in my car in the parking lot of the Rehoboth Beach Wal-Mart,” Hughes announced Wednesday on Facebook. “Walking distance to the ‘world’s biggest liquor store,’ a Taco Bell, and a Wendys. Life is good!” Hughes, with his characteristically bizarre beard that hangs from his chin in a thatch of unkempt silver fuzz, is supposed to close on a condo in Virginia in a few days to give him some financial relief. What happens there will determine his immediate future. If it goes through, it’ll give him a pile of cash. If not, he said, “Hell, I’ll still own the condo.” For now, he’s living in a Walmart parking lot in Rehoboth, Del.

When Carlee Wendell realized that feminine hygiene products are taxed and other products like Rogaine and gauze aren't, Carlee did more than just complain to her friends and on social media: Carlee Wendell sued the State of Florida and five major retailers, including Walmart, Target, and Walgreens. The subsequent publicity resulted in a flood of outraged emails and phone calls from women to Wendell's Tallahassee attorney, Dana Brooks Cooper of Barrett, Fasig & Brooks. Five months later, when the Florida Legislature came back into session, bills were promptly introduced to eliminate the 'tampon tax.' "I have gotten more positive email on that than I have on any other bill I've sponsored in this Legislature," said Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, a Naples Republican who sponsored legislation to eliminate the tax."" If signed into law by Governor Rick Scott, women will stop paying taxes on feminine hygiene products on January 1, 2017. However, litigation is the only way in which a refund of the illegal taxes already collected from Florida women can be returned to them. Cooper noted, "While the proposed budget will eliminate the taxes on feminine hygiene products, it doesn't do anything to compensate the women of Florida who have been illegally taxed for years."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman e.l.f. Beauty Announces First Quarter 2017 Results OAKLAND, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF), today announced results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. “We are pleased to report a strong start to the year as e.l.f. grew net sales by 15%, expanded gross margin nearly 750 basis points, and made progress toward our mission to make luxurious beauty accessible for all,” stated Tarang Amin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “This performance is notable given the significant amount of shipments to customers for shelf resets in Q1 2016.” Three Months Results Ended March 31, 2017 Net sales increased 15%, or $7.9 million from the first quarter of 2016, to $60.6 million, driven by sales growth across leading national retailers and the Company’s direct business. Gross margin expanded to 63% from 56% in the first quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of margin accretive innovation, coupled with improvements in freight costs and the benefit of foreign exchange rate movements. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased to 54% of net sales, compared to 44% of net sales in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to continued investment to support long-term growth. SG&A includes $3.6 million of costs and expenses that are non-cash or that management does not believe are reflective of the Company’s ongoing operations. Adjusted SG&A, excluding the aforementioned $3.6 million of costs and non-cash expenses, was 49% of net sales, compared to 40% of net sales in the same period in fiscal 2016. On a GAAP basis, net income was $2.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, based on a weighted-average share count of 49.5 million shares. This compares to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $34.1 million, or $(69.57) per share, based on a weighted-average share count of 0.5 million shares in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income (net income excluding the items identified in the reconciliation table below) increased 40% to $4.4 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, based on a weighted-average share count of 49.5 million shares. This compares to adjusted net income of $3.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, based on a pro forma share count of 49.5 million shares in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA excluding the items identified in the reconciliation table below) was $11.7 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $11.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was 4.8% compared to 43.4% in the first quarter of 2016. The change in the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the impact of discrete items, such as stock option exercises which generated a tax benefit of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Balance Sheet At March 31, 2017, the Company had $5.4 million in cash, as compared to $14.8 million as of March 31, 2016. Inventory at March 31, 2017, totaled $76.9 million, as compared to $28.4 million on March 31, 2016. The increase over 2016 primarily reflects an increase of inventory in the Company’s fastest moving items. At March 31, 2017, long-term debt totaled $154.2 million, as compared to $136.8 million as of March 31, 2016. Company Outlook The Company reaffirmed its outlook for 2017, with expectations for strong revenue growth and expansion in gross margin, as well as the full-year impact of public company expenses and continued investments in people, infrastructure, and brand building:     Full Year Full Year 2017 Outlook 2016 Actual Results Net Sales $     285 – 295 million $   230 million Adjusted EBITDA $ 61 – 64 million $ 54 million Adjusted Net Income $ 21 – 23 million $ 18 million Adjusted Pro Forma Diluted EPS $ 0.40 – 0.43 $ 0.36   First Quarter 2017 Conference Call The Company will hold a conference call today, May 10, 2017, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2017 results.

Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes references to Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma Diluted EPS. The Company presents these measures because its management uses these as supplemental measures in assessing its operating performance, and believes they are helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the Company’s performance. The measures referenced above are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and they should not be considered as alternatives to measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these alternative measures should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. These alternative measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. The Company’s definitions and calculations of these alternative measures are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. These non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the tables at the end of this press release. With respect to the Company’s expectations under “Company Outlook” above, the Company is not able to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Diluted EPS guidance non-GAAP measures to the corresponding Net Income and Diluted EPS GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. The Company cannot provide meaningful estimates of the non-recurring charges and credits excluded from these non-GAAP measures due to the forward-looking nature of these estimates and their inherent variability and uncertainty. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The company is expected to announce the departure of five directors, including Chairman John Elstrott, when it reports earnings on Wednesday, the person said, with two more due to leave later this year. Whole Foods , whose board currently has 12 directors, will also announce the appointment of four new directors on Wednesday, the person said. Final details were still being worked out and could change ahead of the earnings release, the person said. The move comes after Jana Partners took an 8.3 percent stake in the company and nominated four directors to serve on the board. Mutual fund firm Neuberger Berman, which owns a 2.7 percent stake, has also pressured the company to take steps to improve its stock price, which has fallen steadily since peaking in 2013. Whole Foods has been losing shoppers to rivals as the natural and organic category it pioneered has gone mainstream at retailers including Kroger Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc as well as newer competitors like Amazon.com Inc and meal kit provider Blue Apron. Advertisement Advertisement Whole Foods has not struck a standstill agreement with Jana, the source said, meaning the hedge fund can continue to pressure the company to turn around performance. So-called standstill agreements usually offer an activist hedge fund representation on the company's board in exchange for support and silence for at least the next year. Jana Partners and a spokesman for Whole Foods were not immediately available for comment. In a filing in April, Jana said it was frustrated with Whole Foods' lack of engagement regarding its strategic review, noting its "apparent unwillingness to engage in discussions with third parties regarding such alternatives." Jana has nominated four directors to serve on the company's board, among them former Gap Inc Chief Executive Glenn Murphy, former Harris Teeter Supermarkets CEO Thomas "Tad" Dickson and former Barclays stock analyst Meredith Adler. Jana can still nominate that slate at the next Whole Foods annual meeting, which is expected to be held in February. Late last year, Whole Foods returned co-founder John Mackey to the role of solo CEO after six years of splitting the job with Walter Robb, who focused on operations, betting that Mackey would be best to lead a turnaround. After Jana disclosed its stake, acquisition speculation swirled around the company, though a suitor has yet to emerge. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the Whole Foods board departures.

Written by Mohamed Thaver | Mumbai | Published:May 11, 2017 1:45 am A 25-YEAR-OLD public relations consultant from Khar became the latest victim of a debit card fraud when her card details were compromised and used for transactions in the United States. The Khar police suspect that her card details were cloned and sent to the US where they were used at a departmental store by the accused person to make purchases. Investigators in the Cyber Crime cell of the Mumbai Police said there is a growing trend of card details being obtained fraudulently in one country and used to make purchases in another country in order to remain out of reach of law enforcement agencies. Talking to The Indian Express, victim Vinita Jeswani said that on April 25, following an event at a five-star hotel in South Mumbai, she was headed back to her Khar residence. “It was at 8.58 pm when I got an SMS saying that my ICICI debit card had been used in a Walmart store in the US to make a purchase. Within the next five minutes, from 8.58 pm to 9.03 pm, I got a series of 15 messages saying that someone had cleaned out Rs 48,000 from my account,” said Jeswani. The damage was, however, not limited to these transactions. “The next morning, a few more unauthorised transactions in the US took place on the same card. All this while I was in Mumbai and the card was with me,” she added. Jeswani then approached the local Khar police station where an FIR under Section 420 (cheating) and sections of the Information Technology Act were registered against unidentified persons. Jeswani then approached the ICICI bank head office at Bandra Kurla Complex to inform it about the incident. “However, at the bank they kept telling me that I must have given my debit card details to someone. I told them that I had not given my card details to anyone,” alleged Jeswani. According to her, she was told that the sum could not be credited to her account until an investigation was complete, a process that would take 45 days. Responding to the allegations, a spokesperson for ICICI Bank said: “… In this case, the customer’s debit card was used on some international e-commerce websites, which do not require 3D secure authentication … The bank is very keen to help the customer in this matter. We have received the Charge Dispute Form and the chargeback has been raised. It takes 45 days to complete the investigation, as per the MasterCard/Visa guidelines…” In the meantime, luckily for Jeswani, some of the transactions carried out fraudulently did not go through and some service establishments in the US returned the money. “Currently, the total loss stands at Rs 30,000. However, it is a scary experience, especially since I am careful with my card details,” said Jeswani. An officer linked to the cyber cell said there have been several such cases where the accused obtain debit card details of people and use it abroad. “The modus operandi used to get debit card details are several. In certain cases, cyber criminals install skimmers on ATM machines and get debit card details. In other cases, waiters at restaurants would swipe debit cards through skimming machines and make cloned cards,” the officer said. mohamed.thaver@expressindia.com For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now No Comments.

Bringing much-needed transparency to RTB Real-time bidding (RTB) is great for scale and efficiency, but it can come with risks for brand image, as recent developments have highlighted. Columnist Alex Bornyakov discusses these risks and explores whether it is possible to increase transparency in this programmatic channel. Alex Bornyakov on May 9, 2017 at 11:32 am More Controversies involving YouTube are nothing new, but when well-known brands including Walmart and PepsiCo start boycotting the platform, it’s clearly time to sit up and take notice. Many brands have pulled ad campaigns from Google-owned YouTube following revelations their ads were being served alongside extremist or offensive content. Not only is poor ad placement bad for brand image, it also provides revenue for content creators; in other words, brands are unintentionally funding bigotry, racism and terrorism. The automated real-time bidding (RTB) environment YouTube uses to place ads is taking some of the blame for the situation, with advertisers now demanding increased transparency into where their ads appear. So, is RTB worth the risk for brands, and is it possible to increase transparency in this programmatic channel? With the negative reports around RTB and open exchanges, you might wonder why any advertiser would choose to transact via this channel. The simple answer is that RTB provides unprecedented scale and efficiency, which non-biddable environments have so far been unable to achieve. Advertisers can reach thousands of publisher websites with only a fraction of the administrative hassle and contractual obligations of direct deals. When this is added to the flexibility and precise targeting capabilities of programmatic, using an RTB-based open exchange is a very attractive prospect for brands looking to gain the maximum return on their marketing budgets. The real-time nature of RTB does bring an element of uncertainty, especially on vast platforms such as YouTube, where new content is continually uploaded and is therefore difficult to monitor. Google has already come under fire for its attempts to increase brand safety and remove ads from potentially offensive YouTube content, as these efforts have inadvertently penalized credible content creators — illustrating that algorithms simply can’t keep everybody happy. The inherent risk in RTB has led advertisers to shift their budgets toward non-RTB programmatic direct models, such as private marketplaces, in an attempt to gain more transparency into where their ads are being placed and regain control over brand safety. In fact, eMarketer predicts less than half (44 percent) of programmatic display dollars will be spent via RTB this year — though with total US programmatic spend expected to reach almost $33 billion, that is still a sizable amount. When deciding which programmatic model to use, marketers must weigh the enormous benefits of RTB and the open exchange against the potential fallout from a brand safety breach. Depending on their product and brand values, some may feel this compromise is justified, while others may not. Many advertisers choose to use a platform that combines multiple programmatic models such as open RTB and private deals to get the best of both worlds. But just because there is an intrinsic risk in RTB, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to limit the chances of brand safety breaches, and there are plenty of ways we can increase transparency into where ads are placed. Google has already committed to changes that will “give brands more control over where their ads appear,” including tightening default brand safety settings so advertisers have to opt into ambiguous content categories, simplifying the process for preventing ads appearing on specific websites or channels, and providing enhanced controls for advertisers to fine-tune ad placement preferences. It also pledged to improve reporting to further increase transparency into where ads are running. Other tech providers must also take steps to ensure their solutions continue to provide increased visibility into the processes behind RTB and programmatic. For instance, the emergence of header bidding has enabled increased transparency, but as header-bidding technology moves server-side to resolve latency issues, developers must ensure this level of clarity is retained, and even enhanced. Programmatic platforms should incorporate brand safety tools, from basic keyword lists and risk category filters to more advanced solutions specifically designed for video which look at visual frame content and audio tracks to analyze the context of content. They should also be open to third-party verification, which provides independent validation of where ads are appearing, for how long, and in what context. In addition to technological advances, education around brand safety has a key role to play. Advertisers need to determine what constitutes a safe context for their specific brands and understand how to avoid placements that could threaten brand image. The definition of a safe impression varies greatly by brand and would look very different for a company that provides home insurance, for instance, than for a business specializing in extreme outdoor adventures. While the revelations around YouTube advertising have pushed transparency in programmatic into the media limelight, it is not a new issue; advertisers have pushed to secure additional control over how their ad dollars are spent for some time. The World Federation of Advertisers reports satisfaction among its members around the level of programmatic transparency is already increasing significantly for both agency and independent trading desks, which is an encouraging trend. Google may not feel it now, but the latest YouTube controversy is actually a positive development. It is forcing the digital advertising industry to face up to brand safety concerns and to provide greater transparency, not only in RTB, but across all programmatic models.

Scale: The Universal Laws of Growth, Innovation, Sustainability, and the Pace of Life, in Organisms, Cities, Economies, and Companies Geoffrey West Penguin: 2017. ISBN: 9781594205583 Buy this book: US UK Japan Michael H/Getty New York City is in some respects a scaled-up version of smaller settlements. Plato and Aristotle stand proxy for two types of scientist: those who see similarities, patterns and universals, and those who see differences, variation and specifics. Both viewpoints are needed, but they are hostage to disciplinary and cultural fashions. It's probably safe to say that physics stresses the former, biology the latter. Geoffrey West — a theoretical physicist and erstwhile head of that mecca of multidisciplinary complexity studies, the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico — takes a Platonic view. In Scale, he explains mathematical relationships between the size and properties of many complex systems, natural and human, that are more often subjected to an Aristotelian scrutiny of particulars — living organisms, cities, companies, economies. Each has properties predictable from their scale: an elephant is a scaled-up mouse; New York City, a scaled-up Santa Fe; Walmart, a scaled-up version of your local grocery. Scaled up how? Elephants don't have fur and whiskers; New York has (to my knowledge) no skyscrapers made from adobe. Instead, these relationships are apparent in measures of what one might call performance or metabolism — rates of wealth creation, say, and of energy consumption. Crucially, the link isn't linear. Owing to economies of scale (efficiencies that arise from increased size), New York has half the per-capita carbon footprint of Santa Fe, even though the former feels grimy and gridlocked and the latter eco-friendly. As a result, such scaling relationships tend to obey power laws: a parameter will increase in proportion to size raised to some exponent. The canonical example is that metabolic rate scales as (body mass)3/4. So, for cities, size determines (among other things) the pace of life. Anyone can get a sense of that by trotting along New York's mammoth thoroughfare Fifth Avenue or strolling the pueblo-style streets of Santa Fe. And it is quantitatively revealed in the statistics. As West says, in big cities “diseases spread faster, businesses are born and die more often, commerce is transacted more rapidly, and people even walk faster”. The average walking speed in cities with more than one million inhabitants is nearly double that in towns of a few thousand. For living things, it's the reverse: if an animal is small, then, with very rare exceptions, it lives fast and dies young. Those two factors, as measured by heart rate and lifespan, balance out so precisely that all creatures, from pygmy shrews to whales, have equal lifespans when accounted in number of heartbeats: about one billion of them. West also discusses the inevitable laws of growth, ageing and death, both in living and human-made systems — why, say, companies have life cycles but cities persist. If you find such regularities astonishing, you're a Platonist at heart. If you shrug, feeling that they reveal little about pygmy shrews or what makes Shanghai so captivating, you're an Aristotelian. There is a suspicion, often heatedly voiced, that the universality of the laws West and others have uncovered can't tell us anything very interesting about any one system. That criticism has long been levelled at those who posit that mathematical laws govern aspects of life, arguably starting with biologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson and his magisterial book On Growth and Form, published 100 years ago (see P. Ball Nature 494, 32–33; 2013). But a recognition of mathematical principles in biology and social science — in particular, an acknowledgement that simple laws underpin complex growth, form and dynamics — has been growing over the past several decades. Computer algorithms have helped tremendously in that process. Since the 1980s, the Santa Fe Institute has been hugely influential, inspiring similar complexity hubs from Singapore to Arizona, Amsterdam and Vienna. Yet this broader view of complex human systems has been slow to enter the mainstream, and its absence has had some troubling consequences. The narrow focus on growth, turnover and gross domestic product as indicators of economic well-being, for example, has led to unsustainable growth coupled to environmental despoliation and climate change. That point has been made before, but West brings it home with particular clarity. He notes that although thermodynamic flows — rates of fossil-fuel consumption, say, and consequent entropy production — are central to socio-economic progress, discussion of that hardly figures in economics textbooks: “Remarkably, concepts like energy and entropy, metabolism and carrying capacity have not found their way into mainstream economics.” If these are acknowledged at all, it tends to be by economists such as Julian Simon and Paul Romer, who have argued that human ingenuity will solve any problems. Ideas, however, are themselves the product of complex social systems — vitally dependent on institutions, opportunities, equality, liberty and the spiritual health of societies. This blind belief in innovation as a panacea is, as West points out, often coupled to misapprehension or even denial of the costs of open-ended growth, such as climate change. At best, such issues are swept under the carpet as “externalities”, market failures that pose a nuisance for economic accounting. An economics afflicted by such attitudes is not even a dismal science; it's a pseudoscience. Likewise, cities have often been regarded as if they are mechanical entities that can be arbitrarily redesigned, rather than, as urban theorist Lewis Mumford argued, being more like living organisms, constantly adapting and evolving. West particularly highlights the pioneering ideas of another urban theorist, Jane Jacobs. Her advocacy of the organic approach to urbanism in the 1950s and 1960s invoked the idea of self-organization, now so central to the science of complex systems, before that language even existed (see A. Williams Nature 537, 614–615; 2016). West is too canny to imagine that universal laws of size and growth say all that needs saying about such systems. But Scale, a grand synthesis of topics he has studied for several decades, makes an important and eloquent case for their significance in an ecology of the natural and human world — and in understanding whether the two can fit together. He calls this “a grand unified theory of sustainability”, allowing “quantitative, predictive, mechanistic” parsing of that relationship. West has no prescription for what such a theory might look like. It surely won't be built bottom-up from an Aristotelian assemblage of details; neither will it reduce simply to a series of scaling laws. Much of what Scale contains has been popularized before, but West manages to reveal the deeper principles on which these regularities rest. These are inevitable aspects of complex systems. You can ignore them, but you can't escape them. Author information Comments• Related links Affiliations Philip Ball is a writer based in London. His latest book is The Water Kingdom.

Here we have an inductive or empirical approach, which, in my view, means that the results are not even wrong. Einstein has described the two approaches quite well here: Albert Einstein : "From a systematic theoretical point of view, we may imagine the process of evolution of an empirical science to be a continuous process of induction. Theories are evolved and are expressed in short compass as statements of a large number of individual observations in the form of empirical laws, from which the general laws can be ascertained by comparison. Regarded in this way, the development of a science bears some resemblance to the compilation of a classified catalogue. It is, as it were, a purely empirical enterprise. But this point of view by no means embraces the whole of the actual process ; for it slurs over the important part played by intuition and deductive thought in the development of an exact science. As soon as a science has emerged from its initial stages, theoretical advances are no longer achieved merely by a process of arrangement. Guided by empirical data, the investigator rather develops a system of thought which, in general, is built up logically from a small number of fundamental assumptions, the so-called axioms."

The short-seller is still betting against online furniture retailer Wayfair because of the rising competitive threat from Amazon. The company's shares surged 21 percent Tuesday after the firm reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings. Tae Kim | @firstadopter 9 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Wayfair running an unsustainable business: Citron's Andrew Left    14 Hours Ago | 02:20 Citron Research's Andrew Left, who gained notoriety for successful bets against companies such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, said he is still short online furniture retailer Wayfair even after the shares have surged this week due to the rising competitive threat from Amazon. "I'm still short Wayfair ... The company still loses more money. I think their cash burn was the second-highest ever. They are showing no path toward profitability whatsoever," Left said in an exclusive interview on CNBC's "Halftime Report" Wednesday. "I'm going to leave this interview, and I'm going to go play golf. And when I go play golf I have Jeff Bezos and I have Marc Lore from Wal-Mart, who have not yet competed in this space, who said we're going to start getting more aggressive on furniture. They're working for me," he added. Lore is the CEO of Walmart.com. The short-seller said he doesn't focus on the short-term moves in Wayfair's stock price and is more interested in how the online furniture competitive landscape turns out one year from today. "With Wayfair, my timing is off right now, which is fine," Left said. Wayfair shares rallied 21 percent Tuesday after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. The firm reported it had a first-quarter loss of 48 cents per share versus the Wall Street consensus for a loss of 57 cents per share. It also posted $961 million in sales for the quarter compared with the $935 million Street estimate. Left isn't alone betting against the stock. Wayfair's short interest is 13.6 million shares, or 37.5 percent of its float, according to FactSet. "Wayfair was the fifth most shorted stock in the internet retail sector and had the third largest monthly increase in short interest, trailing only Amazon.com and Priceline.com," S3 Partners, a financial technology firm, wrote in an email to clients Wednesday. Short-sellers lost $150 million in Wayfair Tuesday, bringing the total loss to $366 million this year in the stock, according to S3 Partners estimates. The shares are up nearly 80 percent year-to-date. Left also posted his Wayfair bear thesis on Twitter Tuesday. TWEET LINK "While some $W shorts cover, Citron loves the opportunity to short more here," Citron Research wrote on its Twitter feed. "Citron believes the stock should trade right back to $45." Wayfair shares traded up 3 percent midday Wednesday. The company declined to comment on the TV interview with Left.

Here is how Story described its new theme:    “What’s fresher than fresh? Having healthy produce dropped at your door—and you don’t even have to be home to receive it. This is the magic of Jet.com, and to celebrate their innovative approach to delivering perishable groceries, we’ve teamed up with the online service to bring to life Fresh Story at a time when the city feels ripe with energy and inspiration.”   This is Jet.com’s first physical venture of any kind. It comes as Amazon is testing its own offline food concepts, including the no-checkout AmazonGo convenience store and its new AmazonFresh Pickup format.    The merchandise mix at the 2,000-sq.-ft. Story is heavy on cool kitchen gadgets and accessories, along with cookbooks, fresh produce and select menu-inspired grocery items. In-store events will include talks and workshops by food and beverage pros. In June, Story will bake cookies and pizzas everyday on site — using jet.com ingredients.     Story always revamps its décor to match its new theme, and this time around is no exception. The floor is carpeted with green faux-grass, and the walls are accented with life-sized recipes done by food illustrator Claudia Pearson. The scent of cherries wafts through the store, courtesy of cherry-scented wallpaper (from Brooklyn-based Flavor paper). In some areas, Jet.com boxes are artfully stacked up and serve as display fixtures.     Story is located at 144 10th Avenue, at 19th St., in Manhattan. It opens at 11 a.m. seven days a week, and closes at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m., depending on the day.

Thurber, 56, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Brian C. Wimes to two years and six months in federal prison without parole. The sentence reflects an upward variance from the recommendation under the federal sentencing guidelines. The court also ordered Thurber to pay $9,000 in restitution to several Missouri businesses in Mountain View, Springfield and West Plains as well as businesses in Nevada and California. On Sept. 6, 2016, Thurber pleaded guilty to possessing electronic images for the purpose of counterfeiting. Obverse of the series 2009 $100 Federal Reserve Note. Photo courtesy of wikipedia.org / Public DomainThurber was arrested on April 5, 2016, by Mountain View, MO police officers for passing counterfeit $100 bills. When officers searched his truck and travel trailer in the Wal-Mart parking lot, they found three laptop computers, two hard drives and two printers. Thurber admitted that these items were used to print counterfeit $100 bills. Thurber also acknowledged that the government could establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he engaged in counterfeiting from January 2014 to June 2016. Thurber, who lived in his Dodge Dakota pick-up and travel trailer, engaged in a counterfeiting operation whereby he “washed” the ink off of genuine bills and used his computer and color printer to create counterfeit $100 bills, which he then passed to unsuspecting businesses throughout the United States. Thurber manufactured and passed at least 93 counterfeit $100 bills in the Western District of Missouri. Among the victims of Thurber’s criminal activity was Dollar General and Wal-Mart in Mountain View, Southern Supply in Springfield, MO and Dollar General in West Plains, Mo. At the time of his arrest, Thurber attempted to avoid detection and punishment by claiming to be a citizen of New Zealand and presenting a counterfeit New Zealand identification card in the name David Turnbull. This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven M. Mohlhenrich. It was investigated by the U.S. Secret Service, the Mountain View, MO Police Department, the Ozark, MO Police Department and the West Plains, MO Police Department.

Life is good!” Hughes, with his characteristically bizarre beard that hangs from his chin in a thatch of unkempt silver fuzz, is supposed to close on a condo in Virginia in a few days to give him some financial relief. What happens there will determine his immediate future. If it goes through, it’ll give him a pile of cash. If not, he said, “Hell, I’ll still own the condo.” For now, he’s living in a Walmart parking lot in Rehoboth, Del. “Welcome to my new home,” he said in a YouTube video update. “…Got my camos on.” He says he went to a 3 a.m. “radio gig” on Monday that “just didn’t work out.” Hughes sees no shame in bragging about how “famous” he is. “There’s a few lessons I’ve learned in life,” he began, in a rambling monologue. “One is if somebody knows you from the Internet…because I’m pretty famous amongst a small cadre of people…and then that person, who’s a friend of yours, hires you for a job, all of a sudden that relationship changes from being friendly and jocular and whatever to being employer and employee and it’s a whole different thing. Somewhere between those two things is a personal gray area. I didn’t quite walk it the way I should have. …There’s something that just didn’t jive there.” Bottom line: “It ain’t gonna happen.” Hughes said he’s covered for a few weeks. When he’s not in his car, he’s staying with a friend in a house on the bay for a few days, maybe a week. Hughes said he has no idea where he’ll wind up. “Whoa, bug’s in my face,” he said, interrupting himself in his video. “…It’s all kind of limbo for the moment. …But I am somewhat nomadic in my car.” Hughes’ first newspaper job came just out of college at The Reston Times. He started DCRTV in 1997 to blog about media in the DMV. In a 2006 FishbowlDC interview, he was asked which one of the seven deadly sins he is. “Lust, mainly,” he replied.

By Pete May 10, 2017 9:30 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Ahem. The kind folks at Road Snacks put together a clever (science based) list analyzing the 10 most redneck cities in Washington.  Getty Images The official “by the book” definition is either 1.) “a white member of the Southern rural laboring class” or 2.) “a person whose behavior and opinions are similar to those attributed to rednecks.” We’ve all seen rednecks. They like big, muddy trucks. They may have a case of Natty Ice at any given function. There’s usually a lot of dip in the face. They hunt a lot. They breathe life into Walmart stores everywhere. It’s a mutually beneficial relationship. Hell, Walmart even bought merchandising rights to Duck Dynasty. This blog is all in good fun and if you identify as a redneck, let that flag fly high. Always be YOU! If you thought Tri-Cities is on the list, good news – we’re NOT! Yippee! West Richland actually ranks 48, while Benton City ranks 50. But, let’s take a look at the official top 10 list: 1 Chelan       2 Shelton       3 Montesano       4 Zillah       5 Woodland       6 Colville       7 Moses Lake       8 Aberdeen       9 Burlington       10 Omak       Category: Tri-Cities News Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More Leave a comment Send to a friend!

By Harmeet Singh 16 hours ago Canada is in the midst of a “discount renaissance,” and growing competition and consumer expectations has led No Frills to launch its largest mass campaign ever. The Loblaw Companies-owned banner has historically stuck to flyers and print advertising, though it did have some mass advertising in 2010, says Mary MacIsaac, VP of marketing for the discount division. But competition in discount is rising, she says. “If we think about the market right now, being frugal and being a smart shopper – it’s a badge of honour,” she says. “People are proud to be seeking out value.” Walmart has in the past few years upped its focus on grocery, including with click-and-collect and delivery programs, while Quebec’s Maxi (also owned by Loblaw) recently launched its own mass campaign focused on fresh. Consumers are also showing more interest in wholesale retailers like Costco and dollar stores. National research undertaken by Loblaw also suggests fair pricing and good value for money are two important factors for Canadian shoppers, with 87% of those in the survey of 1,700 agreeing those things are crucial. Consumers aren’t changing their high expectations either, MacIsaac says. In other words, we’re increasingly value-oriented but also not willing to give up freshness and overall quality. No Frills has been the leader in discount grocery and is now leveraging its history and its focus on store owners for a mass campaign targeting value shoppers and “smart shoppers” – those who don’t necessarily have limited incomes and might shop at other banners but are still value conscious. Working with John St., the brand has created a mass campaign focused on – what else? – it’s lack of frills. In the core TV spot, a woman questions why apples in the store are so expensive, with her explanation coming from an in-store jazz singer who poetically lets her know that entertainment like him are the reason prices are sky-high. It’s hard to ignore that the Loblaws banner, which shares its parent with No Frills, does have locations that are home to luxuries like in-store entertainment and product demonstrations. But MacIsaac says that from a marketing perspective, each banner is focused on a message that’s right for its target shopper and customer base. For No Frills, that base is a loyal one, with the brand leveraging a highly engaged Facebook audience of shoppers and store owners for the campaign. The tone of the campaign – including with radio in particular – is also meant to be no-nonsense, just like the way the franchisees operate their frill-free banners, MacIsaac says. As more creative rolls out over summer, the messaging will get even more bold, especially to resonate with a younger, millennial target, she adds. http://strategyonline.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/No-Frills.Jazz-Trio-30-Radio.NFR17-289-30RE.mp3   Tags: john st, Loblaw Companies Limited, Mary MacIsaac, No Frills Related Articles Chevrolet pursues the ‘Canadian dream’ Scotiabank’s democratic approach to the arts CIBC drops everything to fly OCA focuses on the simple things Desjardins reinforces the big picture Popular Recent Featured No Frills’ no-nonsense strategy Scotiabank’s democratic approach to the arts CIBC drops everything to fly Honey Nut Cheerios wins 2017 SIA Grand Prix BRP consolidates with Anomaly Careers » Screening Room » Reitmans taps into style habits Scotiabank’s democratic approach to the arts Ontario Tourism localizes its riddle Aeroplan targets members’ FOMO Twitter Tweets about "from:StrategyOnline OR @StrategyOnline OR strategyonline.ca" Follow @StrategyOnline Facebook ﻿ About Strategy strategy™ uncovers and shares the "bold vision, brand new ideas" of Canada’s national marketing community.

West Wednesday, May 10, 2017 TechTank Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print SMS More Reddit Google Stumbleupon In 2017, major retailers have already closed stores at a faster rate than in 2008 during the Great Recession. This downsizing occurs during a rise in online sales, and while traditional retailers have been slow to adopt new technologies, e-commerce companies eagerly embrace them to gain an advantage over their brick-and-mortar competition. Store closings are often by followed layoffs in an industry that employs one-tenth of the U.S. workforce, but expanding internet operations may require workers with a different set of skills. Given the size of the industry, the pace at which e-commerce sites and traditional retailers adopt new technologies could have large impacts on employment. Authors Jack Karsten Center Coordinator - Center for Technology Innovation Twitter jtkarsten Darrell M. West Vice President and Director - Governance Studies Founding Director - Center for Technology Innovation Twitter @DarrWest E-commerce technology Because anyone can easily switch from one e-commerce website to another, there is heavy competition to provide the best customer service. As these sites compete to deliver purchases to customers as quickly as possible, they approach the convenience offered by brick-and-mortar retailers. At an additional cost, same-day delivery is available on selected items, and even one-hour delivery in larger cities. Achieving rapid delivery times requires intensive logistical support from warehouses and delivery drivers.  A network of warehouses requires fewer locations than a national chain of stores, and also lowers costs by balancing proximity to customers with lower rent. Fewer locations also require fewer employees: In 2016, Amazon had over 340,000 staff excluding seasonal workers, compared to Walmart’s 1.5 million, the nation’s largest private workforce by a wide margin. E-commerce sites employ new technology at nearly every step of online shopping, from initial order to final delivery. The internet simplifies comparison shopping for buyers, so sellers use pricing algorithms to constantly undercut their competition. In warehouses, robots move warehouse shelves to workers so they can save time filling each order. Products are then shipped by third-party carriers, who use algorithms to map out routes that minimize delivery times and fuel consumption. Tech companies are also experimenting with drones, robots, and driverless vehicles to make deliveries with little human supervision. The technology deployed at each step raises worker productivity in warehouses and delivery, but doing so may also reduce the number of workers needed for each task. In contrast, traditional retailers have relied far less on technology to streamline the in-store experience for customers. However, this may change with increased competition from e-commerce sites, especially as some open physical locations for showcasing their products. After customers try on Warby Parker glasses in stores, their purchases are shipped directly to their homes, just like an online sale. This hybrid approach that separates the products for sale from the services offered has already yielded some striking results: Warby Parker generates the second-highest sales per square foot of retail space behind Apple, though most of its glasses sell for less than $100. By dividing sales from stocking merchandise, technology can make stores and their workers much more productive. The proliferation of smartphones and other internet-connected devices has also blurred the lines between online an in-store shopping. Customers are increasingly likely to research product and pricing information on a smartphone while shopping in stores, and to make their final purchases on their devices. In 2015, mobile purchases accounted for nearly one-third of all online sales. Meanwhile, e-commerce companies aim to recreate the personalized experience of shopping in-store on their websites. Several have created chatbots, artificial intelligence systems operating within a number of popular messaging apps that can process orders, answer customer questions, and make recommendations using natural language. Cameras could also be used to give advice on what clothes to wear, or even order custom-made clothing. More sales happening outside of stores or on mobile devices will lead to fewer interactions between customers and sales staff. Raising retail productivity To stay competitive with online retailers going forward, traditional retailers must match their pace of innovation. While an e-commerce company can gather customer data with every click and then rapidly redesign their website to boost sales, brick-and-mortar stores might only track final purchases through a rewards program. However, this may start to change as stores begin to install sensors to track customer behavior. More than just competing for customer dollars, traditional retailers are increasingly competing for customer data that they can use to improve their operations.

West and Jack Karsten Monday, October 26, 2015 TechTank How technology is changing manufacturing Darrell M. West Thursday, June 2, 2016 Analyzing more data may lead retailers to downsize as they identify ways to increase sales with less floor space. Smaller, technology-enabled stores may require fewer workers with a different skillset. Besides selling products, workers must learn how to manage new technologies deployed in stores and warehouses. Robots will complement warehouse employees trained to program and maintain them, while autonomous vehicles will require fewer drivers but more programmers, technicians, and logistics specialists. Brick-and-mortar stores may be reconfigured to emphasize non-sales services that cannot be replicated online. Given more technology in the workplace, retail employees will spend much more of their time interacting with customers and far less time managing products. The shift to higher-level skills will increase wages for workers that possess the necessary technical or interpersonal skills. As technology makes these workers much more productive, others may find their skills become redundant, and retail may lose its place as an employer of large numbers of Americans. On the other hand, greater efficiency may eventually increase the number of retail stores and employees, much like ATMs allowed banks to open a greater number of branches with tellers that handle a wider variety of financial services. Regardless of the retail industry’s future, its current transformation demonstrates how automation is spreading beyond factories and back offices. Computers now wield enough processing power to navigate and manipulate physical objects in addition to digital information. This will have profound economic impacts as businesses divide tasks between workers and machines. Companies that adopt new technology will become more productive, but unless their employees can adapt, the gains from greater productivity will concentrate among the few.

The move means the president will head to the G7 summit in Italy at the end of May amid continued global uncertainty over whether the United States will remain in the emissions-cutting deal struck in Paris under the Obama administration. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump wants to “continue to meet with his team,” seeking advice from both an economic and an environmental perspective as he works to make a decision. A meeting for top advisers to discuss the deal had been set for Tuesday afternoon but was postponed. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to renegotiate the accord, but he has wavered on the issue since winning the presidency. His top officials have appeared divided about what to do about the deal, under which the United States pledged to significantly reduce planet-warming carbon emissions in the coming decade. Leading up to the expected Tuesday meeting, a number of high-profile businesses spoke out in favor of remaining part of the agreement. A group including Apple, Google and Walmart signed a letter sent to Trump last week. And this week, a larger coalition signed on to ads run in the Washington editions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. On Instagram Tuesday, renowned jeweler Tiffany and Company wrote a message to the president, saying “we’re still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement.” Ted Halstead, president of the Climate Leadership Council, said that “there is a nearly unanimous position on the part of big business.” Halstead co-authored an opinion piece that ran in the New York Times Tuesday, titled “The Business Case for the Paris Climate Accord.” “American business leaders understand that remaining in the agreement would spur new investment, strengthen American competitiveness, create jobs, ensure American access to global markets and help reduce future business risks associated with the changing climate,” said the piece, written with George P. Shultz, who served as secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. Opponents of the deal have also lobbied the president this week, with a group of conservative organizations signing a letter saying “the treaty is not in the interest of the American people and the U. S. should therefore not be a party to it.” Signatures on the letter include veteran anti-tax activist Grover Norquist and Myron Ebell, who led transition efforts at EPA prior to the president’s swearing in. The Paris accord, signed by nearly 200 nations in 2015, was never ratified by the Senate due to the staunch oppositions of Republicans. It therefore does not have the force of a binding treaty, and the United States could potentially withdraw from the deal without legal penalty. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of the oil company Exxon, said at his Senate confirmation hearing in January that he supports staying in the deal. But Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has said the Paris pact “is a bad deal for America” that will cost jobs. Like Trump, Pruitt has questioned the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are the primary driver of global warming. A senior administration official said the president’s inclination has been to leave the pact, but Ivanka Trump set up a review process to make sure he received information from experts in the public and private sector before a making a decision. The official requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Ivanka Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father, was supposed to meet separately Tuesday with Pruitt, but that meeting was also postponed, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to discuss private talks. more from business RCB’s star batsman Chris Gayle turns investor May 10, 2017 19:41 IST Govt owes Rs 451.75 crore to Air India for VVIP flights May 10, 2017 18:55 IST Is Your Couch Making You Cough?

For the fourth-generation retired miner, the politicians -- Donald Trump chief among them -- who won votes in his native West Virginia on a promise to bring back coal are peddling false hopes. Economists agree: despite a recent uptick, few believe in a lasting revival for a sector that is ever more mechanized, requiring fewer workers, and pummeled by competition with cheap, clean natural gas. So how does a small state with few other industries, where the biggest single employer is Wal-Mart, find a path to replace high-paying albeit dangerous mining jobs? The "Mountain State" just west of the nation's capital long suffered from a condition known as "Dutch disease" -- in economic parlance, the over-reliance on a single product, especially a natural resource, to the exclusion of other industries. "When are we ever going to be economically free, not serfs to the coal industry, unless there is economic diversity," asks the filmmaker Mari-Lynn Evans, whose documentary "Blood on the Mountain" explores the troubled history of the state's coal industry. - 'Wild and wonderful' - If West Virginia has a competitive advantage besides coal, the most obvious is tourism. Skiing, hiking, white-water rafting and a well-known resort -- site of the underground bunker intended to house the US government in the event of a nuclear war -- make it a vacation destination. Fuelled by a "wild and wonderful" ad campaign, tourism last year generated $4.5 billion in travel spending making it the state's fourth largest industry. But mining companies have used bankruptcies to escape the obligation to restore damaged and polluted land, leaving the state with billions of dollars in restoration costs. Maria Gunnoe lives in the shadow of a mountain-top removal site, just below a slurry pond filled with toxic mine waste. The dam broke a few years ago and just missed wiping out her house at the base of the hollow. The environmental activist talks of catching fish with black ulcers on them, of waking up one morning to find the creek running white, and of the neighbor girl who developed four kinds of cancer -- well aware of studies that point to elevated rates of the disease. AFP / Kun TIAN, Jonathan JACOBSEN Coal production, employment in West Virginia "Our streams are spillways," says Gunnoe, who like many locals fears the environmental scars left by a dying industry now threaten one of their best chances at a brighter future. - 'Renaissance' - Amid West Virginia's economic struggle, the state has been hard hit by America's opioid epidemic with the highest rate of overdose deaths in the country. Huntington, where 28 people overdosed, two fatally, in a single day last year, is considered the epicenter of the crisis. But Huntington is also fighting to invent a new future for itself. It was recently named "America's Best Community" winning a $3 million redevelopment prize after a two-year competition against 50 other cities. "We're on the verge of a renaissance," insists Mayor Steve Williams. That rebirth involves deploying high-speed internet -- scarce in the remote state -- turning blighted industrial areas into a new research and development park, and retraining dislocated workers in highly-skilled fields from solar and craft furniture, to organic farming on former strip mine sites. Such revitalization, Williams says, is key to beating the opioid epidemic as well. "If we're going to win on this we have to turn the economy," he says. "As you do that you start to attract investment, put people back to work and give them hope." - Inner colony - AFP/File / NICHOLAS KAMM View of an unused coal mine at Black Mountain, Virginia, on April 18, 2017 While it shares borders with traditional mining states like Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Virginia, West Virginia has perhaps more in common with former colonies, where foreign companies reaped the profits from diamonds or oil and left little to show for it. More than two-thirds of its private land and mineral rights are owned by outside interests, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. "It's a colony. It always has been," Ted Boettner, head of the budget center told AFP, who says the state has long been trapped in a "vicious cycle of boom and bust, with a very under-educated, under-invested economy." Boettner points to states such as North Dakota and Alaska, that funneled tax revenue from their dominant industry into schools and other development -- and hopes West Virginia can learn from their example. West Virginia has "given more to the American dream than any other state," he says, "and received less in return." 10 May 2017 Previous Back to summary Next Newsletter AFP Subscribe to our newsletter AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 10, 2017 10:59am   Comments Share: A market desperate for news to trade has some thanks to President Trump, whose firing of FBI Director James Comey seems to be the topic du jour on Wall Street. Though the head of the FBI isn’t normally a market-moving factor, there’s concern that more turbulence in Washington, D.C., could potentially distract from or delay the president’s agenda of tax reform, health care, and infrastructure spending. That might help explain some of the weakness in stock futures early Wednesday, though it’s a little early to assess the ultimate impact. Meanwhile, volatility, which touched historic lows earlier this week, bounced back a little as the VIX climbed above 10. The market is coming off a rather ho-hum day Tuesday, which saw a divergence between a lower S&P 500 (SPX) and the Nasdaq (NDX) setting its 31st high of 2017. The tech-heavy NDX continues to dominate the action, while the SPX has had a little trouble making a decisive move above all time highs. The SPX hasn’t closed above the psychological 2400 mark as of yet, though it finished just below that a couple of times recently. On the earnings front, Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) reported after the close and shares fell in overnight trading after the company beat Wall Street analysts’ estimates on earnings per share but missed on revenue. The EPSN franchise once again was one of the primary sources of disappointment. Still, it’s worth noting that DIS outdid many analysts’ expectations with its theme park, resort, and movie revenues. Priceline Group Inc (NASDAQ: PCLN), the other big name reporting earnings yesterday afternoon, beat estimates on earnings per share, but the company’s lower forward guidance helped lead to after-hours selling. By the end of the week, we’ll be 90% of the way through earnings, but there’s still plenty to sort through before we get there. Retailers take the spotlight over the next few days, including Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M), Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE: KSS), Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN), and J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE: JCP). Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Wal-Mart Store Inc (NYSE: WMT) report next week. The fun starts before the open tomorrow with M and KSS. Listening in on the calls could be interesting as we get a chance to hear some of the big store retailers discuss consumer demand and their strategies to deal with Internet competition. Economic data keeps pouring in, and wholesale inventories for March released yesterday looked a little better than expected, rising 0.2%. However, in a bit of potentially troubling news to keep an eye on going forward, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow indicator lowered its Q2 growth estimate to 3.6% from 4.2%. Today brings the weekly U.S. crude oil stockpiles report. Late yesterday the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported oil stockpiles rising 5.8 million barrels. That gave crude a lift back above $46 a barrel by early Wednesday, but we’ll see if the government’s number later today reinforces the API data. Energy sector stocks fell Tuesday amid the recent oil price slump. A couple of Fed speakers are on tap today, and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi gives a speech as well. Earlier Wednesday, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Japan’s current quantitative easing program would continue and there will be no adjustment to the 0% cap on the yield of the Japanese 10-year bond, TheStreet.com reported. The euro rose against the dollar and the dollar fell against the yen, while the gold market ticked a little bit higher. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields finished back above 2.4% on Tuesday for the first time in more than a month as economic confidence seemed to grow. There’s a $23 billion Treasury auction of 10-years scheduled for today. The last auction, a month ago, saw a high yield of 2.332%. Producer Prices Up Next April’s producer price index (PPI) bows before the open tomorrow, offering a chance to assess whether increased demand for goods is starting to be felt at the producer level. Wall Street analysts’ consensus for both PPI and core PPI — which excludes food and energy — is 0.2%, according to Briefing.com. That compares with a 0.1% decline in PPI and a flat core PPI in March. A few signs point toward slightly better economic growth in April following a sluggish Q1, and April PPI could help confirm whether that’s the case. Fed Watch Rate hike odds keep climbing, with chances of a hike by June now above 80%, according to Fed funds futures. Additionally, chances for an additional hike by the September meeting also ticked up, now at above 40%. Before last week’s Fed meeting and jobs report, most estimates pointed to no additional moves by the Fed (following an anticipated June hike) until December. So perhaps the solid jobs data and impressive earnings have market participants thinking the Fed might speed up. The Danger Of Complacency With the VIX settling at the historically low level of 10 on Tuesday, it’s important not to get complacent just because the market seems to be. Lack of complacency in and of itself can be a dangerous sign, because it might mean investors aren’t prepared for possible sudden swings from outside events. Media reports late Tuesday that North Korea might resume nuclear testing gave the market a twitch, though indices recovered pretty quickly. It served as a reminder, however, that geopolitics never really goes away. There isn’t likely to ever be another day with no news, as the BBC so infamously reported back on April 18, 1930.

The move means the president will head to the G7 summit in Italy at the end of May amid continued global uncertainty over whether the United States will remain in the emissions-cutting deal struck in Paris under the Obama administration. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump wants to "continue to meet with his team," seeking advice from both an economic and an environmental perspective as he works to make a decision. A meeting for top advisers to discuss the deal had been set for Tuesday afternoon but was postponed. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to renegotiate the accord, but he has wavered on the issue since winning the presidency. His top officials have appeared divided about what to do about the deal, under which the United States pledged to significantly reduce planet-warming carbon emissions in the coming decade. Leading up to the expected Tuesday meeting, a number of high-profile businesses spoke out in favor of remaining part of the agreement. A group including Apple, Google and Walmart signed a letter sent to Trump last week. And this week, a larger coalition signed on to ads run in the Washington editions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. On Instagram Tuesday, renowned jeweler Tiffany and Company wrote a message to the president, saying "we're still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement." Ted Halstead, president of the Climate Leadership Council, said that "there is a nearly unanimous position on the part of big business." Halstead co-authored an opinion piece that ran in the New York Times Tuesday, titled "The Business Case for the Paris Climate Accord." "American business leaders understand that remaining in the agreement would spur new investment, strengthen American competitiveness, create jobs, ensure American access to global markets and help reduce future business risks associated with the changing climate," said the piece, written with George P. Shultz, who served as secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. Opponents of the deal have also lobbied the president this week, with a group of conservative organizations signing a letter saying "the treaty is not in the interest of the American people and the U. S. should therefore not be a party to it." Signatures on the letter include veteran anti-tax activist Grover Norquist and Myron Ebell, who led transition efforts at EPA prior to the president's swearing in. The Paris accord, signed by nearly 200 nations in 2015, was never ratified by the Senate due to the staunch oppositions of Republicans. It therefore does not have the force of a binding treaty, and the United States could potentially withdraw from the deal without legal penalty. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of the oil company Exxon, said at his Senate confirmation hearing in January that he supports staying in the deal. But Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has said the Paris pact "is a bad deal for America" that will cost jobs. Like Trump, Pruitt has questioned the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are the primary driver of global warming. A senior administration official said the president's inclination has been to leave the pact, but Ivanka Trump set up a review process to make sure he received information from experts in the public and private sector before a making a decision. The official requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Ivanka Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father, was supposed to meet separately Tuesday with Pruitt, but that meeting was also postponed, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to discuss private talks.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Vigilant Personal Protection Systems Launches Wearable 120dB Personal Alarm (Wrist Alarm) Vigilant’s „Bad Guy Repellent” Wrist Alarm Wear it on your wrist, and the one touch button activates a 120dB alarm in the event of an emergency. It’s a ruggedized, sweat proof bad guy repellent. Wear it on your wrist, and the one touch button activates a 120dB alarm in the event of an emergency. It’s a ruggedized, sweat proof bad guy repellent.” — Vigilant Personal Protection Systems TAMPA, FL, UNITED STATES, May 10, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — Tampa-based Vigilant Personal Protection Systems began shipment this week to select retailers the latest in self defense technology, the Vigilant Wrist Alarm™. The new design from Vigilant is a ruggedized, sweat proof hands free personal rape / jogger / student attack alarm with flashing LED lights. Vigilant calls it a „bad guy repellent.” Designed to worn like a watch, the Wrist Alarm™ features an attention demanding 120dB alarm aimed at diffusing dangerous situations. The Wrist Alarm is available exclusively on line at Amazon.com, Sears.com, eBay.com, Walmart.com, and VigilantPPS.com for $24.99 (model PPS35BRS) Personal alarms are one of the fastest growing segments at retail in the self defense industry, because an attacker’s worst enemy is attention. Personal alarms are legal to carry in all 50 states (even on airplanes!) and are a very safe and effective method of self defense. They require no training or skill to operate, and can be used by anyone regardless of age or physical ability. Police Officers, Campus Safety and Security Consultants recommend the use of personal safety alarms. Victims are often too traumatized to shout for help in unfamiliar and dangerous situations, increasing their vulnerability. The high pitched alarm is intended to scare off an assailant while switching the element of surprise from the attacker to the victim. Criminals do not like to draw attention, and will likely run off when they realize the alarm cannot be stopped. The flagship model of Vigilant Personal Protection Systems, the Wrist Alarm™ is an exclusive design. The Wrist Alarm™ is worn on the wrist and is easily concealed. It was designed for one-touch activation with hands free operation providing personal safety protection without hindering any activity. Many people enjoy sports like hiking, running, or cycling, but these activities can leave you isolated and vulnerable. If you feel threatened or need emergency assistance, simply activate The Wrist Alarm. Based on customer feedback Vigilant included both a small and large wrist band with this new design to make the Wrist Alarm truly a one-size-fits-all model. Vigilant Personal Protection Systems products include the best selling PPS8, a 130db personal alarm that uses standard AAA batteries for easy replacement. The PPS8 is the preferred model sold to the US military, police departments, correctional institutions and individuals nationwide. Vigilant recently launched the Night Vision Personal Alarm™ with ripcord activation, a unique 135dB personal alarm with a red LED flashlight. Vigilant is introducing one additional model per month through the balance of 2017 including a variety of colors, applications, and price points.

For the fourth-generation retired miner, the politicians -- Donald Trump chief among them -- who won votes in his native West Virginia on a promise to bring back coal are peddling false hopes. Economists agree: despite a recent uptick, few believe in a lasting revival for a sector that is ever more mechanized, requiring fewer workers, and pummeled by competition with cheap, clean natural gas. So how does a small state with few other industries, where the biggest single employer is Wal-Mart, find a path to replace high-paying albeit dangerous mining jobs? The "Mountain State" just west of the nation's capital long suffered from a condition known as "Dutch disease" -- in economic parlance, the over-reliance on a single product, especially a natural resource, to the exclusion of other industries. "When are we ever going to be economically free, not serfs to the coal industry, unless there is economic diversity," asks the filmmaker Mari-Lynn Evans, whose documentary "Blood on the Mountain" explores the troubled history of the state's coal industry. - 'Wild and wonderful' - If West Virginia has a competitive advantage besides coal, the most obvious is tourism. Skiing, hiking, white-water rafting and a well-known resort -- site of the underground bunker intended to house the US government in the event of a nuclear war -- make it a vacation destination. Fuelled by a "wild and wonderful" ad campaign, tourism last year generated $4.5 billion in travel spending making it the state's fourth largest industry. But mining companies have used bankruptcies to escape the obligation to restore damaged and polluted land, leaving the state with billions of dollars in restoration costs. Maria Gunnoe lives in the shadow of a mountain-top removal site, just below a slurry pond filled with toxic mine waste. The dam broke a few years ago and just missed wiping out her house at the base of the hollow. The environmental activist talks of catching fish with black ulcers on them, of waking up one morning to find the creek running white, and of the neighbor girl who developed four kinds of cancer -- well aware of studies that point to elevated rates of the disease. Coal production, employment in West Virginia "Our streams are spillways," says Gunnoe, who like many locals fears the environmental scars left by a dying industry now threaten one of their best chances at a brighter future. - 'Renaissance' - Amid West Virginia's economic struggle, the state has been hard hit by America's opioid epidemic with the highest rate of overdose deaths in the country. Huntington, where 28 people overdosed, two fatally, in a single day last year, is considered the epicenter of the crisis. But Huntington is also fighting to invent a new future for itself. It was recently named "America's Best Community" winning a $3 million redevelopment prize after a two-year competition against 50 other cities. "We're on the verge of a renaissance," insists Mayor Steve Williams. That rebirth involves deploying high-speed internet -- scarce in the remote state -- turning blighted industrial areas into a new research and development park, and retraining dislocated workers in highly-skilled fields from solar and craft furniture, to organic farming on former strip mine sites. Such revitalization, Williams says, is key to beating the opioid epidemic as well. "If we're going to win on this we have to turn the economy," he says. "As you do that you start to attract investment, put people back to work and give them hope." - Inner colony - View of an unused coal mine at Black Mountain, Virginia, on April 18, 2017 While it shares borders with traditional mining states like Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Virginia, West Virginia has perhaps more in common with former colonies, where foreign companies reaped the profits from diamonds or oil and left little to show for it. More than two-thirds of its private land and mineral rights are owned by outside interests, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. "It's a colony. It always has been," Ted Boettner, head of the budget center told AFP, who says the state has long been trapped in a "vicious cycle of boom and bust, with a very under-educated, under-invested economy." Boettner points to states such as North Dakota and Alaska, that funneled tax revenue from their dominant industry into schools and other development -- and hopes West Virginia can learn from their example. West Virginia has "given more to the American dream than any other state," he says, "and received less in return."

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is delaying a decision on whether to withdraw from a landmark climate deal until after an international summit later this month. The move means the president will head to the G7 summit in Italy at the end of May amid continued global uncertainty over whether the United States will remain in the emissions-cutting deal struck in Paris under the Obama administration. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump wants to “continue to meet with his team,” seeking advice from both an economic and an environmental perspective as he works to make a decision. A meeting for top advisers to discuss the deal had been set for Tuesday afternoon but was postponed. Advertisement Continue reading Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to renegotiate the accord, but he has wavered on the issue since winning the presidency. His top officials have appeared divided about what to do about the deal, under which the United States pledged to significantly reduce planet-warming carbon emissions in the coming decade. Leading up to the expected Tuesday meeting, a number of high-profile businesses spoke out in favor of remaining part of the agreement. A group including Apple, Google and Walmart signed a letter sent to Trump last week. And this week, a larger coalition signed on to ads run in the Washington editions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. On Instagram Tuesday, renowned jeweler Tiffany and Company wrote a message to the president, saying “we’re still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement.” Ted Halstead, president of the Climate Leadership Council, said that “there is a nearly unanimous position on the part of big business.” Halstead co-authored an opinion piece that ran in the New York Times Tuesday, titled “The Business Case for the Paris Climate Accord.” “American business leaders understand that remaining in the agreement would spur new investment, strengthen American competitiveness, create jobs, ensure American access to global markets and help reduce future business risks associated with the changing climate,” said the piece, written with George P. Shultz, who served as secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. Opponents of the deal have also lobbied the president this week, with a group of conservative organizations signing a letter saying “the treaty is not in the interest of the American people and the U. S. should therefore not be a party to it.” Signatures on the letter include veteran anti-tax activist Grover Norquist and Myron Ebell, who led transition efforts at EPA prior to the president’s swearing in. The Paris accord, signed by nearly 200 nations in 2015, was never ratified by the Senate due to the staunch oppositions of Republicans. It therefore does not have the force of a binding treaty, and the United States could potentially withdraw from the deal without legal penalty. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of the oil company Exxon, said at his Senate confirmation hearing in January that he supports staying in the deal. But Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has said the Paris pact “is a bad deal for America” that will cost jobs. Like Trump, Pruitt has questioned the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are the primary driver of global warming. A senior administration official said the president’s inclination has been to leave the pact, but Ivanka Trump set up a review process to make sure he received information from experts in the public and private sector before a making a decision. The official requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Ivanka Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father, was supposed to meet separately Tuesday with Pruitt, but that meeting was also postponed, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to discuss private talks. ___ Follow Catherine Lucey at http://twitter.com/catherine_lucey and Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Most Recent Biz News Nation Politics Suggested Stories: Trump win raises questions about US pledge in climate deal – Nov 9, 2016 Gore: There's a 'realistic chance' that Trump won't bail on Paris climate agreement – Mar 14, 2017 White House cancels meeting to decide stance on climate pact – Apr 18, 2017 Trump delaying decision on Paris climate deal – May 9, 2017 Advertisement Load comments Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

(Evan Vucci/Associated Press) By Catherine Lucey and Michael Biesecker | AP By Catherine Lucey and Michael Biesecker | AP May 10 at 4:11 AM WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is delaying a decision on whether to withdraw from a landmark climate deal until after an international summit later this month. The move means the president will head to the G7 summit in Italy at the end of May amid continued global uncertainty over whether the United States will remain in the emissions-cutting deal struck in Paris under the Obama administration. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump wants to “continue to meet with his team,” seeking advice from both an economic and an environmental perspective as he works to make a decision. A meeting for top advisers to discuss the deal had been set for Tuesday afternoon but was postponed. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to renegotiate the accord, but he has wavered on the issue since winning the presidency. His top officials have appeared divided about what to do about the deal, under which the United States pledged to significantly reduce planet-warming carbon emissions in the coming decade. Leading up to the expected Tuesday meeting, a number of high-profile businesses spoke out in favor of remaining part of the agreement. A group including Apple, Google and Walmart signed a letter sent to Trump last week. And this week, a larger coalition signed on to ads run in the Washington editions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. On Instagram Tuesday, renowned jeweler Tiffany and Company wrote a message to the president, saying “we’re still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement.” Ted Halstead, president of the Climate Leadership Council, said that “there is a nearly unanimous position on the part of big business.” Halstead co-authored an opinion piece that ran in the New York Times Tuesday, titled “The Business Case for the Paris Climate Accord.” “American business leaders understand that remaining in the agreement would spur new investment, strengthen American competitiveness, create jobs, ensure American access to global markets and help reduce future business risks associated with the changing climate,” said the piece, written with George P. Shultz, who served as secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. Opponents of the deal have also lobbied the president this week, with a group of conservative organizations signing a letter saying “the treaty is not in the interest of the American people and the U. S. should therefore not be a party to it.” Signatures on the letter include veteran anti-tax activist Grover Norquist and Myron Ebell, who led transition efforts at EPA prior to the president’s swearing in. The Paris accord, signed by nearly 200 nations in 2015, was never ratified by the Senate due to the staunch oppositions of Republicans. It therefore does not have the force of a binding treaty, and the United States could potentially withdraw from the deal without legal penalty. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of the oil company Exxon, said at his Senate confirmation hearing in January that he supports staying in the deal. But Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has said the Paris pact “is a bad deal for America” that will cost jobs. Like Trump, Pruitt has questioned the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are the primary driver of global warming. A senior administration official said the president’s inclination has been to leave the pact, but Ivanka Trump set up a review process to make sure he received information from experts in the public and private sector before a making a decision. The official requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Ivanka Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father, was supposed to meet separately Tuesday with Pruitt, but that meeting was also postponed, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to discuss private talks. ___ Follow Catherine Lucey at http://twitter.com/catherine_lucey and Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

John S. Weinberg, 60, whose surname had been synonymous with the bank for decades, left as co-vice chairman in 2015. A year later he joined Evercore Partners Inc., reaping sign-on awards worth $124 million as of Dec. 31. That placed him third on the Bloomberg Pay Index, a ranking of the best-compensated U.S. executives for 2016. He joins an exclusive club increasingly dominated by bosses at companies that are, at best, just a few decades old. He’s surpassed only by Jet.com Inc. co-founder Marc Lore, whose $236.9 million in awarded compensation last year was largely composed of money Wal-Mart Stores Inc. paid to buy his company, and Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who received $150 million. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, 44, and Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk, 45, round out the top five. An old-school corporate adviser whose father and grandfather led Goldman Sachs, Weinberg is an odd fit in that quintet. For Evercore, founded in 1995, it was a rare coup to land a 32-year veteran from one of Wall Street’s most storied firms -- one who brings relationships with some of the biggest U.S. companies. As Evercore’s new executive chairman, he also gives founder Roger Altman more freedom from daily responsibilities. “The concept of nine-figure compensation numbers can be startling,” said Steven Hall, managing director at Steven Hall & Partners, a compensation-consulting firm. “But these are executives whose proven talents make them heavily sought after by other firms.” Weinberg, who was awarded $22.9 million in 2013, the last year Goldman Sachs disclosed his pay, has a “proven track record as a leader of investment-banking businesses,” Evercore said in its annual proxy filing. His pay package for last year included $88.9 million in partnership units and restricted stock, of which about one-third is tied to performance, and the opportunity to collect $35 million in cash if targets are met. Some of it replaced awards from Goldman that were forfeited when he joined Evercore. It puts him ahead of other finance titans, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and KKR & Co. founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts, both 73. Boards often heap big equity grants on executives when they join a company or sign new employment contracts, which can cause compensation to spike in that particular year. Examples include Weinberg and CBS Corp. CEO Les Moonves, 67, who’s ninth on the index and signed a deal that keeps him on the job until 2019. Similarly, executives who leave sometimes get severance and stock awards that vest ahead of schedule, such as Viacom Inc.’s ex-CEO Philippe Dauman, 63, who ranks eighth. As a result, those three are less likely to be near the top of the index next year -- a fate familiar to billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong. He took over as CEO of cancer researcher NantKwest Inc. in 2015 and got stock options that vaulted him to the top of the ranking for that year. A $602,308 salary was his only compensation for 2016. The Bloomberg Pay Index tracks the 200 highest-paid executives who appear in filings from companies that submit compensation details to U.S. regulators. The index adds salaries, bonuses, perks, options, restricted shares and changes in pension values that a person was awarded for the most recent year. All equity awards are valued at each company’s fiscal year-end. The index’s figures can therefore differ from those disclosed in filings, in some cases by a lot, depending on stock-price changes and dividend payouts. Recurring annual grants of stock or options are included in the year they’re bestowed, not when they vest. One-time grants, meant to pay an executive for several years, are allocated over the life of the award as explained in regulatory filings. The top-ranked executives or their representatives declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests for comment. Apple’s Cook, 56, received a mega-grant of restricted stock units when he took over the iPhone-maker in 2011, scheduled to vest over 10 years. In filings, Apple’s board said the CEO wouldn’t receive additional equity compensation in those years. In that instance, the Bloomberg Pay Index annualized the award, which is partly tied to stock performance, over the intended lifetime. Cook’s 2016 payout was bigger than in previous years because of how Apple’s board structured the distribution of shares. Tesla’s Musk got a similar award in 2012 that’s meant to pay him for a decade. See also: The intensely private life of Apple CEO Tim Cook Similarly, Charter Communications Inc. CEO Tom Rutledge, 63, got a 2016 pay package that the company valued at $98.5 million. The bulk came from option grants that are the only equity compensation he’ll get through 2020. The index allocates the options over five years and values his 2016 pay at $62.6 million, placing him 13th. Other pay rankings that don’t annualize one-time awards are unlikely to feature Cook, whose 2016 compensation as reported in Apple’s most recent proxy statement was a comparatively meager $8.75 million. Rutledge, however, would likely end up near the top of any ranking for last year based on reported pay. Certain executives show up on the index perennially, including Gamco Investors Inc.’s Mario Gabelli, 74, who ranks 10th with $76 million for 2016, followed by private-equity leaders Roberts and Kravis at about $64 million each. Those payouts are all cash, putting them on the opposite side of the spectrum from Pichai, whose pay from Google parent Alphabet Inc. is almost entirely in stock that’s granted every other year. Wal-Mart’s Lore, who tops the Bloomberg Pay Index after selling Jet.com to the retail giant for $3.3 billion, makes for a special case. Most of his compensation is tied to the deal and composed of restricted shares that will fully vest by September 2021. While the stock qualifies as compensation for regulatory purposes, Wal-Mart’s board said in a proxy statement that it doesn’t consider it to be part of his pay. Excluding shares from the acquisition, Lore got $1.43 million in salary, bonus and perks for the most recent fiscal year. Lore, who’s 45 and worked in finance before becoming an entrepreneur, might seem like a surprise find at the top of Bloomberg’s pay ranking. In 2015, two years after he left Amazon.com Inc. to start Jet.com, he wrote a LinkedIn post titled “Chasing Money Will Cripple Your Career.” “Over my six years in finance, I learned to approach my career as an individual sport, where I was judged by the size of my bonus,” Lore wrote. “Ultimately, I have realized that success is not a measure of your salary, title or degree, but the impact you have on others and the collective happiness of the people you touch.” Editing: Alicia Ritcey, Peter Eichenbaum and Steven Crabill With assistance from: Jenn Zhao Design & development: Cedric SamCedric Sam Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Trump delaying decision on Paris climate deal World by Catherine Lucey And Michael Biesecker, The Associated Press Posted May 10, 2017 2:30 am MDT Last Updated May 10, 2017 at 3:40 am MDT WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is delaying a decision on whether to withdraw from a landmark climate deal until after an international summit later this month. The move means the president will head to the G7 summit in Italy at the end of May amid continued global uncertainty over whether the United States will remain in the emissions-cutting deal struck in Paris under the Obama administration. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump wants to “continue to meet with his team,” seeking advice from both an economic and an environmental perspective as he works to make a decision. A meeting for top advisers to discuss the deal had been set for Tuesday afternoon but was postponed. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to renegotiate the accord, but he has wavered on the issue since winning the presidency. His top officials have appeared divided about what to do about the deal, under which the United States pledged to significantly reduce planet-warming carbon emissions in the coming decade. Leading up to the expected Tuesday meeting, a number of high-profile businesses spoke out in favour of remaining part of the agreement. A group including Apple, Google and Walmart signed a letter sent to Trump last week. And this week, a larger coalition signed on to ads run in the Washington editions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. On Instagram Tuesday, renowned jeweler Tiffany and Company wrote a message to the president, saying “we’re still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement.” Ted Halstead, president of the Climate Leadership Council, said that “there is a nearly unanimous position on the part of big business.” Halstead co-authored an opinion piece that ran in the New York Times Tuesday, titled “The Business Case for the Paris Climate Accord.” “American business leaders understand that remaining in the agreement would spur new investment, strengthen American competitiveness, create jobs, ensure American access to global markets and help reduce future business risks associated with the changing climate,” said the piece, written with George P. Shultz, who served as secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. Opponents of the deal have also lobbied the president this week, with a group of conservative organizations signing a letter saying “the treaty is not in the interest of the American people and the U. S. should therefore not be a party to it.” Signatures on the letter include veteran anti-tax activist Grover Norquist and Myron Ebell, who led transition efforts at EPA prior to the president’s swearing in. The Paris accord, signed by nearly 200 nations in 2015, was never ratified by the Senate due to the staunch oppositions of Republicans. It therefore does not have the force of a binding treaty, and the United States could potentially withdraw from the deal without legal penalty. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of the oil company Exxon, said at his Senate confirmation hearing in January that he supports staying in the deal. But Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has said the Paris pact “is a bad deal for America” that will cost jobs. Like Trump, Pruitt has questioned the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are the primary driver of global warming. A senior administration official said the president’s inclination has been to leave the pact, but Ivanka Trump set up a review process to make sure he received information from experts in the public and private sector before a making a decision. The official requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Ivanka Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father, was supposed to meet separately Tuesday with Pruitt, but that meeting was also postponed, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to discuss private talks. ___ Follow Catherine Lucey at http://twitter.com/catherine_lucey and Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck Movie Trailers May 5, 2017 to May 11, 2017 Landmark 6, 10015 Manning Ave. PH:791-6610 Landmark Cinemas Landmark Cinemas Fort McMurray Weekend Listings: The Boss Baby (G) 11:45am / 3:00pm / 6:30pm / 9:30pm Smurfs: The Lost Village (PG) 12:00pm / 3:15pm / 6:15pm / 9:00pm The Fate and the Furious (PG) 11:30am / 12:30pm / 2:45pm / 3:45pm / 6:00pm / 7:00pm / 9:15pm / 10:15pm Going in Style (PG) 12:45pm / 4:00pm / 7:15pm / 9:45pm Beauty and the Beast (PG) 12:15pm / 3:30pm / 6:45pm / 10:00pm          660 NEWS CALGARY NATIONAL Zoo officials make changes to Humboldt penguins exhibit Just moments ago Student teacher recognized for saving the life of a student Just moments ago Silly Putty to apps, teen girls get look into the future of careers in technology Just moments ago Airport volunteers help Calgary families with autistic children with air travel Just moments ago Tunnel collapse renews safety concerns about nuclear sites 29 minutes ago Alberta peace officers concerned over speeders, issued over 3,600 tickets in April 30 minutes ago Staff at Canada's largest zoo walk off the job in contract dispute May 10, 2017, 11:10 PM B.C. political parties ponder common issues after close vote, possible deals May 10, 2017, 5:49 PM Experts see instability in the legislature after B.C. election May 10, 2017, 5:34 PM Final results in tight B.C. election could take weeks to be finalized May 10, 2017, 4:26 PM Victim was a grandmother: Manitoba RCMP make arrest in 10-year-old homicide May 10, 2017, 3:40 PM Former ICBC employee pleads guilty in B.C.

Halstead co-authored an opinion piece that ran in the New York Times Tuesday, titled "The Business Case for the Paris Climate Accord." "American business leaders understand that remaining in the agreement would spur new investment, strengthen American competitiveness, create jobs, ensure American access to global markets and help reduce future business risks associated with the changing climate," said the piece, written with George P. Shultz, who served as secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. Opponents of the deal have also lobbied the president this week, with a group of conservative organizations signing a letter saying "the treaty is not in the interest of the American people and the U. S. should therefore not be a party to it." Signatures on the letter include veteran anti-tax activist Grover Norquist and Myron Ebell, who led transition efforts at EPA prior to the president's swearing in. The Paris accord, signed by nearly 200 nations in 2015, was never ratified by the Senate due to the staunch oppositions of Republicans. It therefore does not have the force of a binding treaty, and the United States could potentially withdraw from the deal without legal penalty. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of the oil company Exxon, said at his Senate confirmation hearing in January that he supports staying in the deal. But Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has said the Paris pact "is a bad deal for America" that will cost jobs. Like Trump, Pruitt has questioned the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are the primary driver of global warming. A senior administration official said the president's inclination has been to leave the pact, but Ivanka Trump set up a review process to make sure he received information from experts in the public and private sector before a making a decision. The official requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Ivanka Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father, was supposed to meet separately Tuesday with Pruitt, but that meeting was also postponed, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to discuss private talks. ___ Follow Catherine Lucey at http://twitter.com/catherine_lucey and Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck Copyright 2017 by The Associated Press.

The move means the president will head to the G7 summit in Italy at the end of May amid continued global uncertainty over whether the United States will remain in the emissions-cutting deal struck in Paris under the Obama administration. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump wants to "continue to meet with his team," seeking advice from both an economic and an environmental perspective as he works to make a decision. A meeting for top advisers to discuss the deal had been set for Tuesday afternoon but was postponed. Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to renegotiate the accord, but he has wavered on the issue since winning the presidency. His top officials have appeared divided about what to do about the deal, under which the United States pledged to significantly reduce planet-warming carbon emissions in the coming decade. Leading up to the expected Tuesday meeting, a number of high-profile businesses spoke out in favour of remaining part of the agreement. A group including Apple, Google and Walmart signed a letter sent to Trump last week. And this week, a larger coalition signed on to ads run in the Washington editions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. On Instagram Tuesday, renowned jeweler Tiffany and Company wrote a message to the president, saying "we're still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement." Ted Halstead, president of the Climate Leadership Council, said that "there is a nearly unanimous position on the part of big business." Halstead co-authored an opinion piece that ran in the New York Times Tuesday, titled "The Business Case for the Paris Climate Accord."

The move means the president will head to the G7 summit in Italy at the end of May amid continued global uncertainty over whether the United States will remain in the emissions-cutting deal struck in Paris under the Obama administration. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump wants to “continue to meet with his team,” seeking advice from both an economic and an environmental perspective as he works to make a decision. A meeting for top advisers to discuss the deal had been set for Tuesday afternoon but was postponed. Sign up for the online chat with Col. Brandon Pearce, NGA's chief information security officer, May 15, 12:30 p.m. Advertisement Trump pledged during the presidential campaign to renegotiate the accord, but he has wavered on the issue since winning the presidency. His top officials have appeared divided about what to do about the deal, under which the United States pledged to significantly reduce planet-warming carbon emissions in the coming decade. Leading up to the expected Tuesday meeting, a number of high-profile businesses spoke out in favor of remaining part of the agreement. A group including Apple, Google and Walmart signed a letter sent to Trump last week. And this week, a larger coalition signed on to ads run in the Washington editions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. On Instagram Tuesday, renowned jeweler Tiffany and Company wrote a message to the president, saying “we’re still in for bold climate action. Please keep the U.S. in the Paris Climate Agreement.” Ted Halstead, president of the Climate Leadership Council, said that “there is a nearly unanimous position on the part of big business.” Halstead co-authored an opinion piece that ran in the New York Times Tuesday, titled “The Business Case for the Paris Climate Accord.” “American business leaders understand that remaining in the agreement would spur new investment, strengthen American competitiveness, create jobs, ensure American access to global markets and help reduce future business risks associated with the changing climate,” said the piece, written with George P. Shultz, who served as secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. Opponents of the deal have also lobbied the president this week, with a group of conservative organizations signing a letter saying “the treaty is not in the interest of the American people and the U. S. should therefore not be a party to it.” Signatures on the letter include veteran anti-tax activist Grover Norquist and Myron Ebell, who led transition efforts at EPA prior to the president’s swearing in. ‘If you’re a really good federal worker, you should welcome’ the reorganization plan, OMB says The Paris accord, signed by nearly 200 nations in 2015, was never ratified by the Senate due to the staunch oppositions of Republicans. It therefore does not have the force of a binding treaty, and the United States could potentially withdraw from the deal without legal penalty. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of the oil company Exxon, said at his Senate confirmation hearing in January that he supports staying in the deal. But Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has said the Paris pact “is a bad deal for America” that will cost jobs. Like Trump, Pruitt has questioned the consensus of climate scientists that man-made carbon emissions are the primary driver of global warming. A senior administration official said the president’s inclination has been to leave the pact, but Ivanka Trump set up a review process to make sure he received information from experts in the public and private sector before a making a decision. The official requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Ivanka Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father, was supposed to meet separately Tuesday with Pruitt, but that meeting was also postponed, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to discuss private talks. ___ Follow Catherine Lucey at http://twitter.com/catherine_lucey and Michael Biesecker at http://twitter.com/mbieseck Related Topics All News Business News Government News Health News Science News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Government News » Trump delaying decision on… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1924: J.

Name: Subject: Message: Xiaomi makes push into North American market via Mexico Newsby Scott Adam Gordon23 hours ago 12 413 14 Xiaomi has jumped into the North American market with an official product launch in Mexico. The Chinese manufacturer will sell its Redmi Note 4 and Redmi 4X smartphones in the country via Best Buy, Coppel and Sam’s Club stores from late May. Customers will also find them online at Amazon, Walmart, Soriana and Elektra. Xiaomi’s smartphones had previously been available in Mexico via resellers but the release of these devices is part of a bigger push into the territory. Xiaomi will also introduce its Mi Community app to Mexico, which acts as a way for Xiaomi to deliver product news and updates to its fans. This news may prompt Xiaomi fans to ask once more about US expansion. In a statement, Donovan Sung, director of product management and marketing at Xiaomi, said this move was a stepping stone for the company, but not towards the States. “Mexico is a really important market for us and acts as our starting point to reach the rest of Latin America,” he said. See also: Xiaomi Mi 6 reportedly hit with processor and ceramic shell supply issues 2 days ago Meanwhile, Xiaomi’s global chief Xiang Wang (who replaced Hugo Barra) said in April that Xiaomi would launch phones in the US in “two years, if not sooner.” Xiaomi is facing increasing competition from other Chinese OEMs and, last month, Canalys Research Analyst Mo Jia said: “Xiaomi’s desire to move up the value chain in China will be an uphill struggle.” It seems like Xiaomi’s expansion into other countries might be the smartest move for the company right now. The Redmi Note 4 price is set at 5,499 Mexican pesos (~$296), while the Redmi 4X will cost 3,999 Mexican pesos (~$209).

But if we opened up the grocery store tomorrow, it's going to be the same issues.” Councilwoman Demetrus Coonrod Related Article After meeting with DA, Westside Shop property owners offer Chattanooga police rent-free substation Read more Down 12th Street, on the other side of the interstate, and a half mile from the Chattanooga Convention Center, the Marriott and the peaks of downtown, the people come to eat. The residents of the city's Westside are used to this, gathering underneath plastic tents every two weeks for two years to fill their arms with apples and onions and cabbages and candy bars. Most days on Grove Street are a battle against hunger and the crime that comes from it, from a revitalized city and the fear of being pushed out. But life became much harder when authorities closed the Westside Shop last month, residents said. "That hurt a lot of people," said Linda, a 70-year-old woman who did not want to give her last name. "I'd get in my chair and wheel on down here. But now we've got to go way out to Food City in St. Elmo or the Signal Mountain Wal-Mart." Linda was among 100 or so residents who showed up Tuesday to receive free produce from community members and activists who say the shutdown has stripped the Westside of its only food source. Also there was Billy Pitts, 53, who said he found refuge in College Hill Courts a few months ago after he and his daughter could no longer deal with the mold in their Patten Towers home. He used to lean on the shop for snacks and basic necessities. Now he takes the bus for $6 round trip to Roger's Supermarket on Main Street. "I have to keep a lot of quarters," Pitts said as he carried three bags of food in his hands and balanced another two boxes of Zebra Cakes under his arms.

"But fresh foods is a different story. You cannot live on canned goods alone. More people than I would like to think about [live like that]," he said. Community members from Concerned Citizens for Justice and the local Nation of Islam say they are concerned about the food crisis, but also what Hamilton County District Attorney General Neal Pinkston's shutdown of the shop represents. "They're not trying to fix anything," Concerned Citizens member Aysja Pryor said to a group of residents gathered underneath a tent. "They're trying to push us out." "They want this property!" one man shouted. "Uh, huh," Pryor replied. Prosecutors say the Westside Shop became a breeding ground for fights, gambling, reports of shots being fired, and occasional burglaries between 2014 and 2016, and that drug deals also sidelined the goal of providing food and necessities. The shop will remain closed until its owners can prove they've taken steps to address those complaints. The next court date is today at 8:30 a.m. before Criminal Court Judge Tom Greenholtz. Last week, the owners offered to sell the empty retail space on Grove Street to the Chattanooga Police Department, which hasn't maintained a substation there since 2003. Those negotiations will begin this week. Kevin Muhammad likened the increase in police oversight to a warzone. "What is this, Afghanistan?" he asked. Others continued to ask similar questions at Tuesday evening's city council meeting. "We've been giving out produce for quite some time," Pryor said. "And there will be times when we have thousands of pounds of produce and we're out in five minutes. There are other times where we come to set up and there's six police cars. There are community members who are literally terrified to be at the site of a police officer." Councilwoman Demetrus Coonrod said the issues of crime and food availability have plagued the west side for a long time, and said she'd like to see further discussion on how to address them. "We need a grocery store in this area, I agree with that," Coonrod said. "But if we opened up the grocery store tomorrow, it's going to be the same issues. It was the same issue when I was 18. The community was starving then, but nobody took time to address the real issues." Muhammad presented a solution, asking the council to partner with him and the food bank to provide $250,000 for a program that would address the individual nutritional needs for Westside families living in hunger. "We've been doing this for 30 years out of our pockets," Muhammad said. "We're only asking for .001 percent of your budget. That's $250,000, just as a PILOT [payment-in-lieu-of-taxes agreement] that we can work together to build some trust. We're asking that you write the check to the Chattanooga Area Food Bank, where 100 percent will go toward food." Council members showed interest in the idea, but did not say whether such an expenditure would be considered. Contact staff writer Zack Peterson at zpeterson@timesfreepress.com or 423-757-6347.

For the fourth-generation retired miner, the politicians -- Donald Trump chief among them -- who won votes in his native West Virginia on a promise to bring back coal are peddling false hopes. Economists agree: despite a recent uptick, few believe in a lasting revival for a sector that is ever more mechanized, requiring fewer workers, and pummeled by competition with cheap, clean natural gas. So how does a small state with few other industries, where the biggest single employer is Wal-Mart, find a path to replace high-paying albeit dangerous mining jobs? The "Mountain State" just west of the nation's capital long suffered from a condition known as "Dutch disease" -- in economic parlance, the over-reliance on a single product, especially a natural resource, to the exclusion of other industries. "When are we ever going to be economically free, not serfs to the coal industry, unless there is economic diversity," asks the filmmaker Mari-Lynn Evans, whose documentary "Blood on the Mountain" explores the troubled history of the state's coal industry.  - 'Wild and wonderful' - If West Virginia has a competitive advantage besides coal, the most obvious is tourism. Skiing, hiking, white-water rafting and a well-known resort -- site of the underground bunker intended to house the US government in the event of a nuclear war -- make it a vacation destination. Fuelled by a "wild and wonderful" ad campaign, tourism last year generated $4.5 billion in travel spending making it the state's fourth largest industry. But mining companies have used bankruptcies to escape the obligation to restore damaged and polluted land, leaving the state with billions of dollars in restoration costs. Maria Gunnoe lives in the shadow of a mountain-top removal site, just below a slurry pond filled with toxic mine waste. The dam broke a few years ago and just missed wiping out her house at the base of the hollow. The environmental activist talks of catching fish with black ulcers on them, of waking up one morning to find the creek running white, and of the neighbor girl who developed four kinds of cancer -- well aware of studies that point to elevated rates of the disease. "Our streams are spillways," says Gunnoe, who like many locals fears the environmental scars left by a dying industry now threaten one of their best chances at a brighter future. - 'Renaissance' - Amid West Virginia's economic struggle, the state has been hard hit by America's opioid epidemic with the highest rate of overdose deaths in the country. Huntington, where 28 people overdosed, two fatally, in a single day last year, is considered the epicenter of the crisis. But Huntington is also fighting to invent a new future for itself. It was recently named "America's Best Community" winning a $3 million redevelopment prize after a two-year competition against 50 other cities. "We're on the verge of a renaissance," insists Mayor Steve Williams. That rebirth involves deploying high-speed internet -- scarce in the remote state -- turning blighted industrial areas into a new research and development park, and retraining dislocated workers in highly-skilled fields from solar and craft furniture, to organic farming on former strip mine sites. Such revitalization, Williams says, is key to beating the opioid epidemic as well. "If we're going to win on this we have to turn the economy," he says. "As you do that you start to attract investment, put people back to work and give them hope." - Inner colony - While it shares borders with traditional mining states like Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Virginia, West Virginia has perhaps more in common with former colonies, where foreign companies reaped the profits from diamonds or oil and left little to show for it. More than two-thirds of its private land and mineral rights are owned by outside interests, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. "It's a colony. It always has been," Ted Boettner, head of the budget center told AFP, who says the state has long been trapped in a "vicious cycle of boom and bust, with a very under-educated, under-invested economy." Boettner points to states such as North Dakota and Alaska, that funneled tax revenue from their dominant industry into schools and other development -- and hopes West Virginia can learn from their example. West Virginia has "given more to the American dream than any other state," he says, "and received less in return."

Make Save Borrow Grow Live More Deals Amazon Lowers Free Shipping Threshold; Target to Try 1-Day Delivery Karla Bowsher May 9, 2017 Photo by Jeramey Lende / Shutterstock.com Amazon Lowers Free Shipping Threshold; Target to Try 1-Day Delivery 0 Amazon has lowered its free-shipping threshold for the second time this year, dropping it from $35 to $25. This change comes less than three months after Amazon lowered the threshold from $49 to $35, a move that followed Walmart’s reducing its free-shipping threshold from $50 to $35. While Amazon has not formally announced its latest change, news outlets and other websites started reporting it late Monday. The “help” section of Amazon’s website also reflects the change. The “About Free Shipping by Amazon” page states: “You receive free shipping if your order includes at least $25 of eligible items. Any item with ‘FREE Shipping’ messaging on the product detail page that is fulfilled and shipped by Amazon is eligible and contributes to your free shipping order minimum.” There are still a few circumstances in which you can get free shipping even if you don’t meet the minimum required purchase amount: Orders of Amazon gift cards will continue to qualify for free one-day shipping, although they do not count toward the $25 threshold. Eligible orders placed by Amazon Prime members will continue to qualify for free two-day shipping — with no minimum threshold. To learn more about the perks of Prime, check out “8 Major Freebies and Discounts You Get With Amazon Prime.” Amazon now has the lowest free-shipping threshold among major retailers. Competitors Best Buy, Jet, Target and Walmart have the next-lowest threshold of $35. Target had a $25 threshold in recent years, but its shipping webpage now reflects a $35 threshold. Customers who pay with a Target REDcard credit card still get free shipping with no minimum, though. Target to explore 1-day shipping Target and Walmart also continue to take advantage of their brick-and-mortar presence by offering free store pickup for eligible items ordered online, with no minimum purchase amount required. Last month, Walmart even added a pickup discount on certain items that are sold online but shipped to a store for pickup there. Target is now seeking to step up its delivery offerings by exploring one-day shipping. The retailer announced Monday that its Minneapolis headquarters will test a pilot program called Target Restock starting this summer. The pilot will be open to REDcard holders in the Minneapolis area. Target describes the program as designed to enable customers to buy “household essentials” online and have them delivered to their home the next day: “… guests will be able to fill a box with multiple items and have their orders shipped to their homes for a low, flat fee. The items will be packaged at a nearby store, allowing us to fulfill orders placed before 1:30 p.m. by the next business day.” It sounds like Target is gunning for Amazon’s Prime Pantry program, if you ask me. Prime Panty, which is available only to Prime members, enables them to fill a box with “groceries and household products” for a flat delivery fee of $5.99 per box, or for free if you purchase five qualifying items.

Cyber Monday 2016 at Amazon Fulfillment Center in Dupont, Wash. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) Amazon has dropped the threshold for free shipping for non-Prime members to orders of $25 or more, down from a $35 minimum. Amazon made the change quietly, updating a support page with the new number. It is the second time Amazon has lowered the non-Prime free-shipping threshold this year. Amazon dropped the free-shipping minimum back to $35 one year after it increased the threshold to $49 per order, and a few weeks after Walmart introduced its new $35 minimum order policy for free shipping. Amazon confirmed the change and said more than 50 million items across all categories qualify for free shipping. According to the support page, any item Amazon fulfills and ships itself that includes a “free shipping” tag on the product detail page counts toward the $25 order minimum. Free shipping is a tricky issue for Amazon, fueling sales but also requiring the company to absorb significant costs. Amazon’s net loss on shipping — the difference between what Amazon charges customers for shipping and what the company spends to get those items to customers — reached an all-time high of nearly $7.2 billion in 2016, according to GeekWire’s analysis of Amazon’s financial results. The trend is toward more and more free shipping. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos noted in the company’s year-end earnings release that more than 50 million items are now eligible for free two-day shipping, an increase of 73 percent from the previous year. Much of that increase is driven by the company’s $99/year Prime membership program, which has no minimum for free shipping on eligible items.

Menu Local News Obituaries Opinion Classifieds Back to Local News Two men arrested in connection to robberies May 09, 2017 at 4:00 pm | Print Article BELOIT — Two men have been arrested in connection with robberies at the Speedway gas station and Walgreen in Beloit and Lions Quick Mart Gas in Janesville. Thomas J. McKee, 30, of Janesville, and Ray D. Trickie, 34, of Beloit, face three counts of armed robbery. They were arrested at 11 a.m. Monday, according to Lt. John Kaltenbrun. Two men entered the Speedway gas station at Milwaukee and Cranston roads, at about midnight Monday, threatening the employee with a knife while demanding money and cigarettes. After obtaining money and cigarettes the suspects fled the scene. Two employees of the Walmart located north of the Speedway, saw the suspects fleeing from the Speedway and entering an auto in the Walmart parking lot. Just before 4 a.m. the two men committed a similar robbery at the Lions Quick Mart Gas on Highway 14, just outside of Janesville. At about 10:15 a.m., one of them entered the Walgreens at Madison Road and Sun Valley Drive, threatened the employee with a knife, demanded and obtained money. Officers with the Beloit Police Departments Violent Crimes Interdiction Team spotted a vehicle matching the description of the suspect vehicle and arrested the two male suspects. Stolen property and other evidence were recovered from the vehicle along with weapons. The Rock County Sheriffs Office assisted with the investigation.

After they did just that, Seth Meyers used a segment of his late-night show to savage House Speaker Paul Ryan, almost entirely by using his own words against him, in the best Daily Show/ Jon Stewart fashion. And there was Stephen Colbert, firing off an anti-Trump diatribe that amounted to the comedic version of a drone strike. Jimmy Fallon, meanwhile, had the following exchange with Goldie Hawn, who was promoting her new comedy Snatched. Fallon: “You and Amy Schumer. I mean, come on. This is a perfect combo.” Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week Hawn: “It was so perfect.” Fallon: “It’s a perfect combo.” That’s not to say that Fallon’s show was light on substance. His week, after all, included slapping actor Chris Pine with an oversized fake hand and reworking a Smash Mouth song from 1999. You can’t exactly blame Fallon for wanting to return to the final year of Clintonia, a time before hanging chads and burning towers, before Putinism and long before Trumpism. That was the beginning of a good stretch for Fallon, who’d joined Saturday Night Live in ’98. He was best as an over-enthusiastic Bostonian in a recurring skit he shared with Rachel Dratch. He did a funny song about Valentine’s Day. He did one about Halloween too. Here was the sensitive fratboy singing the nation its lullabies as Osama bin Laden’s most fanatical acolytes learned about box cutters and flight controls. SNL creator Lorne Michaels put Fallon in the coveted Weekend Update anchor’s chair in 2000. His co-anchor, Tina Fey, made the smarter jokes, but it didn’t matter, because Fallon looked very good in a suit, grinning devilishly (but not too devilishly) into the camera. He left SNL in 2003, spent a decade making good money for bad movies. Then, in 2013, Jay Leno announced he would be retiring from The Tonight Show. NBC had the perfect replacement: the sweet, inoffensive, uncomplicated Fallon, who could appeal to Walmart America just as Leno had, with easy topical one-liners and gentle celebrity interviews. Of course, the executives at 30 Rock didn’t foresee the political ascendance of Donald Trump any more than the rest of us. Nor could they have known that in the Age of Trump, late-night comedians, told for years they were being supplanted by YouTube “personalities,” would suddenly become the conscience of a riveted, anxious nation, their humor weaponized into political commentary, virtually all of it in the service of anti-Trump forces. “Trump was the butt of 1,060 zingers on late-night TV during his first several months in office, higher than any of his prior three processors drew within their entire first years in the White House,” Politico reported last week. That’s especially astonishing when you consider that the Oval Office was once occupied by George W. Bush, who frequently struggled with subject-verb agreement. Not only that, but Trump reached the record number of jokes in just his first 100 days. More than 1,300 days remain. Fallon’s first Tonight Show was on February 17, 2014, well before Trump descended the escalator in his Midtown tower to ramble about Mexico and declare his bid to make America great again. During his first monologue, Fallon reminisced about how his parents let him watch Johnny Carson’s monologue before bed when he was a kid. Carson has proven to be Fallon’s biggest influence, a relentlessly chipper host who understood that any political stance he took was bound to lose him viewers. Carson, though, is painfully irrelevant today. If the late-night comedy of 2017 has a precedent, then it is in The Dick Cavett Show. Cavett, the cool-blooded Yale graduate, became famous for his aggressive coverage of Watergate, which must have been strange terrain for a late-night host. Then again, Cavett was less comedian than witty conversationalist, one who has aged much better than his competitors (he frequently contributes political columns to The New York Times ). “The Dick Cavett Show demonstrated the ability of late-night to not just make fun of the political elite but to cover hard news with both pointed questioning and a sly wink,” noted a 2014 item in the Columbia Journalism Review about whether late-night would ever become political again. Would it ever. But then there’s Jimmy, poor Jimmy, who wants to offend nobody. In what has been called the age of the “woke” late-night comedian, Fallon has been hosting The Tonight Show through squinted eyes, doing his best to pretend that we are still in the age of Smash Mouth, not that of Kid Rock invited to the White House by President Trump (Ted Nugent and Sarah Palin were there, too). As his fellow late-night comedians do their own part to stoke the resistance, Fallon smirks into the camera, pained and awkward, wondering when it will all end so he can do hip-hop medleys with Justin Timberlake again. Fallon’s desire to be liked, once his main asset, has become a lethal liability. This was on full display when then-candidate Trump appeared on Fallon’s show in mid-August, in an episode that may taint the rest of Fallon’s career. Of all the questions Fallon could have asked, he posed one that will live in infamy: “Can I mess your hair up?” An obliging Trump leaned forward and Fallon mussed his golden mane. This thrilled him to an unimaginable degree. “Donald Trump, everybody,” Fallon shouted, rising from his hair as if in the midst of sexual rapture. He messed up his own hair, then pointed to Trump again. “Donald Trump, everybody!” The interview didn’t go over well, at least with those of us who publicly broadcast their opinions about late-night television. “In his defense, Jimmy Fallon just pulled in a 35 share among white supremacists 18-49,” tweeted the former Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings. A lot has happened since that September night, you might say. One of those things — among many others, like possible war against North Korea — is that Fallon has been supplanted in the ever-crucial ratings contest by Stephen Colbert. That first happened in December, according to analysis by JumpShot, which measures the streaming of web videos. The more traditional metric of Nielsen ratings had Colbert overtaking Fallon a little later, in February. That’s almost certainly because Colbert decided to embrace the dismay over Trump, while Fallon tried to ignore it. It’s not only that Fallon is losing to Colbert, he’s becoming ever more irrelevant as the Jon Stewart brand of journalism supplants that of Jay Leno (Colbert is a Jon Stewart alumnus, as are Samantha Bee, Trevor Noah and John Oliver, all of which have successful, aggressively political shows of their own). It’s notable that Fallon’s competitor for Leno’s seat was Conan O’Brien, once seen as NBC’s most promising star. Smarter and edgier than Fallon, he shared with Fallon an aversion to politics and a profound, almost pathological desire to be liked by all. He has been relegated to the wilds of TBS, where he reportedly still tells jokes. Fallon’s apolitical stance was becoming indefensible as election turned into transition, Obama handing the keys to American democracy to a driver you wouldn’t trust in an empty parking lot. In March, David Letterman told New York magazine about Fallon’s interview with Trump, “I don’t want to criticize Jimmy Fallon, but I can only tell you what I would have done in that situation: I would have gone to work on Trump.” He compared Fallon with Carson, who, according to Letterman, “had an unstated policy that he would never mention” the Vietnam War. That same week, the New York Post ’s gossip column, Page Six, had an item about NBC execs pushing Fallon to be more political. While one wants to think this was the product of good reporting, it is far more likely the result of a tip whose subject was also its intended recipient. We’re about two months into that experiment. I don’t want to call it a failure just yet, because next Friday’s interview with Derek Jeter could be the one that has Fallon finally speaking truth to power.  To be fair, Fallon has been delivering more Trump jokes during his monologue, but these have a rushed, checking-the-box quality; you get the feeling that after each one, he wants to look over to some executive standing backstage for an approving smile. The jokes are also relentlessly topical, dinging Trump on his most superficial faults, ones even his supporters would admit: the ties to Russia, the intellectual incuriosity, the manic tweeting.   “President Trump canceled his White House Cinco de Mayo celebration,” he said last Thursday. “He made the decision after Mexico said they wouldn’t pay for it.” Well, OK. Does a late-night comedian need to make jokes about Trump? Of course not. Earlier this week, Maureen Callahan of the New York Post persuasively argued that Colbert and his fellow anti-Trump late-night comedians have become mired in “unblinking self-righteousness,” preaching all-too-loudly to a choir. She has a point, about Colbert and Noah especially. Neither host seems to have quite come by his outrage honestly; their jokes, though far better than Fallon’s, do have a pandering quality. Bee and Myers, on the other hand, plainly relish flailing Trump, she with dismay and he with glee. Oliver is snooty and annoying. Some are said to like him precisely for that. Given the surfeit of anti-Trump animosity in late-night television, I’d far more prefer a totally apolitical Fallon who decided that his viewers needed a respite from politics, and that he was going to be an oasis of humor in the pitiless desert that is the 24-hour news cycle. I’d be curious about a pro-Trump comedian, too, one who runs counter to the prevailing late-night sentiment. Because, let’s face it, there’s plenty on the left to skewer: microaggressions, Bernie Sanders, the idea of Chelsea Clinton running for office. I’m thinking of the Dennis Miller of the late ‘90s, before he started making appearances on Fox News. Except that isn’t the decision Fallon and NBC have made. Sensing the nation’s hunger for anti-Trump humor, the suits have forced him into throwing weak punches in hopes that they seem like upper-cuts. But as the diminishing ratings indicate, people aren’t fooled. If the election showed anything, it is that Americans want rage, whether channeled by a rumpled Vermont socialist or a real-estate developer from Manhattan. So what is someone like Fallon to do? He has no views, it seems, on North Korea or the Affordable Care Act. He just wants people to like him. He just wants to tell Goldie Hawn how great her new movie is going to be.
