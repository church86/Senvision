Supporters say the acquisition should help Walmart improve its e-commerce business, which has been criticized in the past for falling so far behind Amazon. Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in fiscal 2015, while Amazon's sales in 2015 were $107 billion. The deal is also expected to give Walmart access to Jet's shoppers, who tend to be wealthier, younger, and more urban than Walmart's core customers. But some people, like former Sears Canada CEO Mark Cohen, think the acquisition was a waste of money. "I think they just spent $3 billion on an idea that they should have been able to create for themselves," Cohen, now the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said in an interview with Business Insider. "It looks and feels like a 'Hail Mary' pass. I think it is a terrible mistake." Jet.com is not yet profitable, but it has grown exponentially — adding approximately 350,000 customers a month — since it launched last year. The company, which sells household goods and groceries, offers lower prices than Amazon and free shipping on all orders over $35. By comparison, Amazon charges $99 annually for free two-day shipping as part of its Prime membership. Jet has a unique business model — enabling customers to bundle items together or waive free-return privileges to save more money — but in Cohen's opinion, it doesn't have "any viability or any likely profitability." "Anyone can offer prices lower than Amazon," but no one has figured out how to do as profitably as Amazon, Cohen said. Some have speculated that the purchase of Jet.com was an expensive way for Walmart to get Jet's founder, Marc Lore, to run Walmart's e-commerce business. View photos Marc Lore QuidsiMore (Jet.com founder Marc Lore.Quidsi) In turn, Walmart could start attracting top tech talent away from Amazon, eBay, and other online retailers, according to UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser. "Until now, Walmart probably faced some difficulty attracting the best & brightest engineers & [e-commerce] talent given its perception as a 'traditional retailer,'" Lasser wrote in a recent note to clients. "We think the addition of a rapidly growing and innovative retailer should enable Walmart to attract human capital and knowledge that it might not have otherwise been able to attain." In announcing the news of the acquisition, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Jet would help Walmart's website grow faster. "Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time," he said in a statement. "It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart.” But no one can be sure how it will all play out for Walmart and Jet. "Whether it's the right strategy, or even the right company to acquire, remains to be seen," said Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now A father whose 6-month-old baby died after being left in a car all day outside a San Antonio-area Wal-Mart on Friday said he forgot to drop off the boy at day care. The man, an employee at the Wal-Mart in Helotes, went to work about 6:15 a.m. and returned to the SUV about 3 p.m., where he found his son already dead.  A witness, who saw the baby in the car, called 911 about the same time, KENS5 reports.  Temperatures were around 100 degrees Friday.  Officers found the man banging on the SUV to try to get inside, CBS News reports. They said he was "visibly upset as he was leaning over the infant," the San Antonio Express-News reports.  The baby's grandmother is also an employee at the Wal-Mart and broke down crying in the parking lot, KENS5 reports. The man was cooperative, said Helotes Police Department Capt. Anthony Burgess, until he "locked up," possibly due to shock, the San Antonio paper reports. He was then transported to a hospital for chest pains.  It's unclear if the man will face charges. His name and the name of the baby have not been released.  The death brings 2016's toll of children dying in hot cars to 27, six of them in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia.  The toll started sharply rising in the 1990s as more laws were passed that required young children be put in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries. The change makes it easier for drivers to forget children since they're strapped in the back, Fennell said.  She said parents should get in the habit of opening the back doors after getting out of their vehicles and having their day care call if their child doesn't show up.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Weekly M&A Roundup M&A roundup - week ending 8/13/16 Palantir bought Silk; Randstad acquired Monster; Walmart purchased Jet Innovation series by Steven Loeb August 13, 2016 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/46bd Palantir, a provider of a suite of software applications for integrating and analyzing data, acquired data publishing platform Silk. No financial terms of the deal were disclosed.  The Silk team would be coming to work at Palantir in an unspecified capacity. Going forward, the Silk platform will continue to operate in its current capacity, but it will no longer be updated. It will not provide technical or customer support to new or existing Silk accounts any longer, nor will it be doing any further development work or adding new features to the hosted Silk.co product. Founded in 2009, Silk, which is based in Amsterdam and San Francisco, had raised $3.66 million in venture funding from Atomico Ventures and New Enterprise Associates. PlanetRisk, a data visualization and analysis company, acquired Analytic Strategies, a provider of enterprise analytics services to the federal government. No financial terms of the deal were disclosed.  Randy Wimmer, who founded Analytic Strategies and served as its CEO, will become a director on PlanetRisk’s board and a strategic adviser to Paul McQuillan, president and CEO of PlanetRisk. Wimmer will collaborate with company leaders to continue expanding PlanetRisk’s capabilities and solutions to meet the demands of its customers in the global private and U.S. government sectors. Denis Clements, president and chief operating officer of Analytic Strategies, will become COO of PlanetRisk. During acquisition negotiations, PlanetRisk was represented by Venable, while Analytic Strategies was represented by Odin Feldman & Pittleman P.C. Financing for the acquisition was provided by Frontier Capital, represented by Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice LLP, and by Petra Capital Partners, represented by Sherrard Roe Voigt & Harbison, PLC. Randstad Holding, a human resources services provider, acquired job recruitment website Monster.

(CBC) Sophia Harris Business reporter sophia.harris@cbc.ca Sophia Harris has worked as a CBC video journalist across the country, covering everything from the start of the annual lobster fishery in Yarmouth, N.S., to potash prices in Saskatchewan. She now has found a good home at the business unit in Toronto where she produces for national TV news and writes and shoots and edits video for CBC.ca.

She's loading up for a family road trip and chose to do it at Walmart. "Easier for me, one shot deal," she explains. Martins says she's at Walmart almost every week and always picks up some type of food item — from snacks to spicy Thai-flavoured tuna. "It's hard to find in some places. They always have it here and it's always a good price." Walmart is on a mission to become Canada's top grocer says a food policy expert. (CBC) More Canadians are turning to the big box giant for at least some of their food shopping. And that's helping U.S.-based Walmart take a big bite out of the traditional grocery store market. "It's comfortable, good prices," says Castor Sousa, who divides his grocery shopping between Walmart and the neighbourhood supermarket. High food prices driving some shoppers away from fruits, vegetables study says Food prices set to rise in 2016 as weak loonie takes a bigger bite Walmart's share of the grocery store pie could grow even bigger, predicts Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University specializing in food distribution and policy. He says the retail chain's mission is to become Canada's number 1 food retailer, a feat it has already achieved in the U.S. "Based on the pace that they currently have, it is an achievable goal." Walmart gains ground Walmart Canada's same-store sales have continually grown over the past eight quarters. And food sales at general merchandise stores — where Walmart and Costco dominate — continue to grow faster than sales at traditional supermarkets. Food-industry analyst Kevin Grier crunched the numbers from Statistics Canada. He found that the dollar value of food sales from grocery stores increased by two per cent in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. That's at a time when overall food price inflation rose by 4.5 per cent.   However, food sales from general merchants jumped by 11 per cent. Loblaws gears up for grocery price war in a low-inflation environment Shoppers Drug Mart enters grocery wars, armed with fresh fruit and fish Grier also found that those growth figures have remained fairly consistent over the previous five years. Grocery store sales are still higher than general merchant food sales, but that the gap keeps shrinking, he says. "It's astounding," says Grier, with Kevin Grier Market Analysis and Consulting in Guelph, Ont. "The data tells me Walmart and Costco are doing a fantastic job in terms of generating food sales." Walmart's traditional strategy is to compete on price, an approach it takes in grocery as well as in consumer and household goods. "Walmart Canada's mission is clear — we want to save Canadians money to help them live better," a Walmart spokeswoman said in response to a request for comment from CBC News. Can Walmart surpass Costco? According to CIBC Institutional Equity Research estimates, Costco has 10 per cent of the Canadian food market, and Walmart has seven per cent. But Charlebois predicts that Walmart will eventually come out ahead. He says U.S.-based Costco has done an impressive job enticing shoppers by offering them deals on buying in bulk. But the professor says a bulk-based retailer can only grow by so much. 'Ten to 15 years ago, the design of the store wasn't very appealing for food' - Sylvain Charlebois, food policy expert "You do eliminate a great deal of the market when you need a car, you also need space at home, and you need a large freezer." Charlebois also points to Walmart's efforts to woo grocery shoppers with more than just the promise of low prices. "Ten to 15 years ago, the design of the store wasn't very appealing for food," he says. "When you walked into a Walmart, you almost had to feel desperate to buy anything." He says that has changed now that the retailer's supercentres have adopted a layout similar to a traditional grocery store. "It is clearly deliberate. I think people want to buy food when they feel they're in a certain environment." At the Toronto Walmart CBC News visited, fresh fruits and vegetables are displayed on the periphery of the grocery section, just like in a traditional supermarket. Bunches of bananas and tubs full of oranges and apples greet shoppers as they enter the store. Walmart superstores have adopted a grocery layout similar to a traditional supermarket with fresh fruit and vegetables on the periphery. (CBC) Although Walmart's grocery section is typically not as large as a big-box supermarket, the offerings are varied — from Halal meats to pre-cut fruit platters. Consumers change shopping habits Megan Bell says she only started grocery shopping at Walmart a year ago. "I was a bit leery in the past. And I would just buy certain things there, but never groceries." However, that has changed. She has discovered she likes the retailer's Italian bread and finds the fruits and vegetables are fresh, especially the cherries she bought on a previous trip. "They're nice, fat. And, I'm telling you, almost every one in the bag was good." Walmart has expanded the number of supercentres that offer groceries, now making up about 300 of its more than 400 stores in Canada. It's also ramping up its efforts to sell groceries online. "Our e-commerce business [in Canada] ... continued to grow nicely with the expansion of online grocery in the Greater Toronto Area," Walmart chief financial officer Brett Biggs said during a conference call in May.     Walmart says it plans to ban Visa at its more than 400 stores across Canada. (CBC) Charlebois notes that traditional grocers are also upping their game to compete. Grocery price war Loblaw, Canada's largest grocer, is currently embroiled in a price war with its suppliers to lower costs and pledges to pass on lower prices to consumers. It is also expanding into urban markets with smaller stores and by selling fresh food at many of its Shoppers Drug Mart locations. Charlebois says Loblaw continues to innovate with its line of President's Choice products and Sobeys with its focus on fresh food. But the battle for your grocery dollar remains tight. Industry analyst Grier notes that, according to Statistics Canada, Canadians are not spending more on food. "We've been flat-lining," he says. And while Walmart's forte may not be innovative new products, says Charlebois, there is one thing it has excelled at: "stealing [market share] from other players."

To make sure she’s getting the best deal on her groceries for her and her husband, the New Westminster pensioner puts on her sturdy walking shoes and makes a day of it. “I go around and I check every little store, what they have for me and for what price,” she says. “If you don’t do that, your grocery bill, it will be a big one. This way, I save me quite a bit of money.” Bottarel’s weekly shopping trips got easier recently with the opening of a Walmart Supercentre, which sells groceries as well as general merchandise, at Royal City Centre, right above the Save On Foods. It’s this choice, and the proximity of retail grocery options, that has Bottarel and thousands of other Metro Vancouver consumers blessed with a bounty of outlets. “I check the meat upstairs (at Walmart) and I’m going to check it in there (Save On Foods) and then I check the Buy-Low. I check everything and then I go back and check the better price and I buy it,” says Bottarel, who also periodically looks in at Galloway’s, a specialty independent store across the street, Kin’s Farm Market in the mall and the Safeway several blocks away. “When I get tired, I sit down someplace and then I start again.” Save On may be her favourite, but Bottarel is grateful for Walmart when she’s on the hunt for the best price. “If we don’t have competition things are going to go up again and we don’t need that. Some people are a millionaire, but I’m not. I got to watch every penny where it goes. I was very thankful when Walmart came in.” ‘I check every little store, what they have for me and for what price,’ New Westminster pensioner Vera Bottarel says of her approach. ‘If you don’t do that, your grocery bill, it will be a big one. This way, I save me quite a bit of money.’ ‘WALMART EFFECT’ That an increasing share of the grocery market going to non-traditional retailers like Walmart Supercentres and Costco Wholesale is causing deflation in food prices after they spiked above inflation in 2014 and 2015. It’s particularly evident in B.C. and Quebec. Still, our smaller grocery bills may be a case of short-term gain but long-term pain if the industry further consolidates to increase margins, leaving consumers with fewer choices and eventually higher prices. Some analysts say Canadians should get ready for a grocery price war, thanks to oversaturation in the market, with the traditional stores beefing up their discount brands to head off the non-traditional discounters. Sylvain Charlebois calls it the “Walmart effect,” and says it’s most pronounced in B.C. and in Quebec. “Quebec and B.C. are where prices are dropping the most and that’s where Walmart and Costco have become more aggressive,” says the professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax. Food prices dropped in the Consumer Price Index in B.C. by 0.5 per cent from May to June this year, according to Statistics Canada. The overall inflation rate for consumer goods in B.C. in June was 1.5 per cent. Most significantly, the price of beef in Canada dropped 3.3 per cent in June over June 2015, the first year-over-year decrease since August 2010, and dairy products were 2.1 per cent less in the same period. In contrast, consumers were paying hikes of four to five per cent in grocery prices in 2014 and 2015, which outpaced inflation, says Charlebois. At the time Walmart was expanding and adding fresh products to its stores to compete against Target stores, a threat that never materialized when the U.S. chain pulled out of Canada. That left Walmart in a better position to compete against the traditional stores, says Charlebois. “To Loblaw, Walmart is clearly a threat,” he says. Eight of the 13 stores Walmart bought from Target last year were in B.C. and Quebec, and “Costco has opened quite a few new outlets,” he adds. Loblaw Cos. Ltd. this summer sent a letter to its suppliers, requesting they drop their prices by 1.45 per cent in their shipments beginning in September. And United Grocers, the buying group for a number of Loblaw’s competitors (including Overwaitea Food Group and the food division of London Drugs), sent a letter to the same suppliers, insisting the same price cut, if any, that they grant to Loblaw. “We should expect to be treated competitively,” says United Grocers president Denis Gendron. If the suppliers give cuts to Loblaw, he says, they would expect the same because “our goal is to give our customers the best prices available.” Suppliers have told Gendron the issue is “under review.” But, he adds, “we’re not expecting the suppliers to come to us and say we’ve decided to reduce our prices.” The industry is feeling the pressure from Walmart Supercentres and from Costco, says Gendron, but that’s not new. “And if it weren’t them, it would be someone else.” ‘MORE STORES THAN NECESSARY’ Food retailing is big business and players want as much of the pie as they can get. The average B.C. household spends about $8,200 a year, or almost $700 a month, on food, according to Statistics Canada. About $5,700 is food purchased from stores, and almost $2,500 from restaurants. Walmart and Costco are having a growing impact on the industry, once comfortably held by traditional grocers. In 2015, the traditional grocery retailers’ share of the Canadian food market had dropped to 78 per cent, down from 84 per cent five years earlier. And between 2004 and 2015, food sales at general merchandisers grew at a rate of almost 12 per cent a year, according to StatsCan, while the grocery stores grew at three per cent a year. Moreover, drug stores’ sales of food jumped in the first quarter of 2106, up 14 per cent over the same quarter last year. London Drugs (owned by the same family that owns IGA) and Shoppers Drug Mart (bought last year by Loblaw) sell food, including limited dairy, which adds to the competition. Walmart Canada has captured seven per cent of the food retail market and Costco has 10 per cent. Rob Gerlsbeck, editor of Canadian Grocer, says the expansion into groceries in 2014 and 2015 by Walmart, Costco and Target resulted in “more stores than was necessary for the population growth.” He says that oversaturation will likely continue to keep pressure on prices because the grocery square footage was growing at three to four per cent while Canada’s population grows at one per cent a year. “I don’t want to call it a price war, but you’ll see the stores try to convince shoppers to spend money at their stores over other stores for their weekly groceries,” he says. “Walmart’s operating procedures has been low prices — that’s what they hammer and they’re very good at it.” Such an approach has recent roots, he adds. Since the 2008 economic crash “consumers have been shopping more at discount stores and they have continued to be more price conscious.” ‘RELENTLESS PRESSURE’ The parent companies have responded by opening up more discount brands, Loblaw is expanding No Frills while Sobey’s has plans to convert remaining Price Choppers into FreshCo. discount outlets. “The choices we have as Canadians is incredible,” says food industry analyst Kevin Grier, who publishes the Grocery Trade Review. “We have lots of competition and huge choice and low-cost food because our grocers are good at what they do.” If Walmart’s approach proves successful, he says, “it’s because Canadians have chosen out of their own self-interest where they want to shop.” Like shopper Rebecca Kapsalis, who says recently outside New Westminster’s Walmart Supercentre: “I prefer Walmart because Walmart has the big savings. You get better quality food at a reasonable price, and I love Walmart. I am so happy that we finally got it here.” That’s not a unanimous sentiment. New Westminster resident Scott Pillsbury points out: “I’m not happy to see Walmart moving in, but if it lowers prices, it’s a good thing. “It’s better to support local products, so I would pay a price for that. I’m not saying I would pay any price for that, but I would pay a little bit more to support something local.” David Ian Gray, of Vancouver’s DIG360 Consulting, says demanding lower prices from suppliers isn’t new — “Walmart is known for grinding suppliers” — and he and others say only time will tell if it’s successful. Price wars in the short run are good for consumers, he says, “but in the long run it’s hard to maintain quality and choice in the face of this relentless pressure. The pressure could really squeeze those without scale,” which is why smaller chains like Choices Market need to differentiate with organics and specialty items. “Consumers do want to have some choice,” says Gray. “Over time you start seeing the big guys getting bigger and it starts to be a harder game to play.” slazaruk@postmedia.com Twitter.com/SusanLazaruk B.C.’s grocery shelf: Who owns what • Overwaitea Food Group is Canada’s largest western-based food store chain.

By: AP | Helotes | Published:August 13, 2016 1:10 pm Texas: The 7-month-old baby died after being left in a utility vehicle in Wal-Mart parking lot. (Representational image) A 7-month-old boy died after being left all day in a hot sport utility vehicle in a San Antonio-area Wal-Mart parking lot, authorities said. The baby’s father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 AM on Friday, said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the US this year to at least 27, six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. On August 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. Watch Video: What’s making news The toll began rising sharply in the 1990s with the passing of laws requiring that young children be placed in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998.

The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn’t show up, she said.

Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, launched packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” on Friday, marking its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or ­chocolate is the result of a yearlong ­collaboration between Hostess and Walmart, as the companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Walmart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice ­president of marketing. “It plays into the ­comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of ­Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger ­business now than even right before the ­company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, such as those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Walmart approached them last summer. For Walmart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, ­executive vice president of food at Walmart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine whether an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our ­customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At 9 grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s ­financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat ­Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain President Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested ­prototypes at its Kansas City, Mo., headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Walmart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Walmart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Walmart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Walmart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes, with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Walmart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, N.Y., who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said. More Business articles » A look at deep-fried Twinkies How it’s made: A regular Twinkie is coated with a cake funnel batter and then proceeds through an oil bath to ensure the batter adheres. The Twinkies are immediately frozen and packaged. Home preparation: Pull it out of the freezer and bake it for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for 21/2 to 3 minutes. The price: $4.76 per box of seven. For comparison, hot-dog joint Papaya King, based in New York, sells its own fresh deep-fried treats for $3 each, excluding tax. Distribution: The Deep Fried Twinkies went on sale Friday at Walmart, and will be sold by the retailer exclusively for three months. After that, the treats will be available at other stores. Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, says the frozen Twinkie could be marketed abroad. Nutrition: The vanilla cream version has 220 calories, 9 grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. A regular Twinkie has 130 calories, 4 grams of fat and 14 grams of sugar. In comparison, a Starbucks Carmel Frappuccino has 420 calories, 15 grams of fat and 66 grams of sugar. Working it off: A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to run for 20 minutes at 10 mph, take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride, says Amy Gorin, a registered dietitian-nutritionist based in Jersey City, N.J. Limited-time Twinkies: In December, Hostess teamed up with Walmart on a limited-time mint-chocolate flavored cake. In June, it worked with the retailer on a tie-in for the new “Ghostbusters” movie, creating Key Lime Slime Twinkies for a short-term sale.     RG Daily Digest Get our top headlines delivered to your inbox.         Today’s Business stories Business Harvesters round up cranberries from bogs for Thanksgiving tables Jobs Lane County jobless rate drops slightly in October Business Court blocks overtime rule Business Tired of travel fees?

Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” View Comments 0 Most Read White nationalist Richard Spencer to speak at Texas A&M next month | All Ablog Austin Burnet County judge's social media response to San Antonio cop slaying Travel alert: Austin airport's Lot A, long-term parking full Things To Do Add Event + See More Weather and Traffic 65 78702 44 Most Read White nationalist Richard Spencer to speak at Texas A&M next month | All Ablog Austin Burnet County judge's social media response to San Antonio cop slaying Travel alert: Austin airport's Lot A, long-term parking full Things To Do Add Event + See More More from statesman.com Topics News Sports Austin360 Ahora Si Neighborhoods Things To Do News Season for Caring: Where are they now?

News Entertainment Love & Sex Style Mind & Body Share < br />this article: It’s Too Ironic That Walmart Is Selling Prints Of Banksy’s Anti-Capitalism Art Karen Fratti @karenfratti | 8.12.16 | 7:43 pm Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Andrew Burton /Getty Images Oy vey. Those are the only two words I have for Walmart selling anti-capitalism Banksy prints in its stores. Because this is the kind of shit that’s not really dangerous, per se, but is just totally fucking ridiculous. It’s so American, like McDonald’s hamburgers that won’t get moldy, yet no one seems to give a flying fuck that everyone continues to eat them. Walmart corporate buyers are some crafty mofos. Because street art is cool, right? And Banksy is cool, right? And since art copyright laws are so totally cool (they are not, by the way) that the famous graffiti artist doesn’t hold any rights to his well-known images, Walmart can do whatever the fuck it wants with them. What’s particularly amazing about this scenario is that Walmart didn’t choose just any Banksy print — the giant company chose the “Destroy Capitalism” one and is selling it for $60 online. Free shipping, bitches. Of course, like any good economic market, one can also buy the very same print on Amazon for $40 bucks a pop. Decisions, people, decisions. Walmart has been doing this since 2013, but after news organizations started calling the franchise out for “counterfeit” prints, it stopped selling them from third parties. But it looks like Walmart’s back at it now that the dust has settled. Hey Walmart is selling Banksy Destroys Capitalism wall art for only $66.99! What a steal! https://t.co/aE53cCOKSZ pic.twitter.com/jyDPPmaT4z — Josh Cox (@j0shc0x) August 1, 2016 It’s ironic and funny in an “oh my god art is dead and so is my soul” sort of way. Sure, Banksy is always a little obvious, which is why it’s a good fit for Walmart. Soon, “hip” families can start putting up “edgy” street art in their homes, bought from Walmart, alongside those Pottery Barn wall hangings that say “Eat” and “Love.” It means nothing. Walmart exemplifies everything wrong with capitalism: it gets tax breaks, treats employees like shit, and sells shitty things at low costs. And now it sells anti-capitalism art, too. In 2013, Walmart was also selling a counterfeit piece by L.A. street artist Eddie Colla, who took action. He told LA Weekly at the time: “Things are just getting picked up and reproduced and the artists aren’t seeing any money out of that… Walmart has a long history of unfair business practices and employment policies. Last month employees were organizing food drives for other employees for Thanksgiving. If Walmart had contacted me for a licensing deal, there’s not a dollar amount that exists that I would have done it for.” There’s actually nothing left to be done about a major, pretty evil retailer selling anti-capitalist prints stolen from an artist except laugh. Or cry. Pick your poison.

Hostess is launching packaged "Deep Fried Twinkies" that mark its first foray into frozen foods. By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO, Associated Press Published: August 12, 2016, 3:59 PM A   A NEW YORK — The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, launched packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” on Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan.

The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Mo., headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, N.Y., who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said.

Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged "Deep Fried Twinkies" starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They'll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. ___ Tepid retail sales lower expectations for US economic growth WASHINGTON (AP) -- A sluggish month of retail spending has tempered expectations for the U.S. economy's growth in the coming months. Consumers pulled back on shopping and eating out in July after three straight solid monthly gains, the government said Friday. Those declines were offset by increases in auto sales and online and catalog sales. Many economists credited the surge in online and catalog spending, which rose 1.3 percent, mainly to deals offered during Amazon's "Prime Day" on July 12. Amazon said its sales rose 60 percent on Prime Day compared with a year earlier. ___ US stock indexes edge mostly lower; oil rises Wall Street capped a record-setting week with a day of mostly listless trading Friday that left the three major U.S. stock indexes essentially flat. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index closed slightly lower. The Nasdaq composite eked out a tiny gain, giving the tech-heavy index its fourth record-high close in a week. Investors mostly focused on the latest batch of company earnings from retailers and other companies, as well as new data indicating that U.S. retail sales in July were more sluggish than expected. ___ J.C. Penney reports smaller quarterly loss as sales improve NEW YORK (AP) -- After a tough start to the year, J.C. Penney's business enjoyed a bounce in the second quarter, fueled by efforts to bring back appliances and spruce up other sections of the store. The Plano, Texas-based department store chain reported a smaller loss for the second quarter compared to a year earlier as sales improved. CEO Marvin Ellison believes the company can maintain the momentum with a slew of new brands and other enticements coming in the next few months. In addition to its own efforts, Penney is benefiting from store closings by Macy's and Sears Holdings Inc. Ellison told analysts Friday the company has seen sales improve in malls where its rivals shuttered their stores. ___ 3 years into nation's hemp experiment, crop's future is hazy PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) -- Three years into the nation's hemp experiment, a 20-acre farm in southern Colorado exemplifies the crop's hazy potential. Hemp could be enormously profitable, but right now there are just as many questions as answers for Will and Ally Cabaniss, two Florida natives who moved to southern Colorado to embark on the hemp business. "Every day brings something new and different," said Will Cabaniss, holding up a red plastic cup containing a hemp seedling awaiting planting. "Right now we're just building data for the industry, seeing what works and what doesn't." ___ Fox News names Abernethy, Shine as co-presidents NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox News Channel founder Rupert Murdoch on Friday appointed two longtime Fox executives as the new co-presidents of the news network as it restructures after last month's departure of Roger Ailes following sexual harassment allegations. Both Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine were with Fox News when it started in 1996. Shine, who had been one of Ailes' top deputies, will run the editorial operations for Fox News and its sister Fox Business Network. Abernethy had left the news channel to run Fox's stable of 28 local stations and he'll keep that job, while overseeing the business operations of the two networks. Both will report to Murdoch, who will continue to oversee things as executive chairman. The moves sent a signal to Fox News viewers that despite a scandal that has widened since Ailes' resignation, they shouldn't worry that their favorite network is abandoning them. ___ Chinese auto sales accelerate in July BEIJING (AP) -- China's auto sales growth accelerated in July, an industry group said Friday, while General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. reported record demand for the month. Sales in the world's biggest auto market rose 26.3 percent to 1.6 million units, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 23 percent to 1.8 million units. Sales of SUVs, whose explosive popularity has helped to buoy demand as other categories sagged, soared 47.4 percent to 580,000 vehicles. ___ South Korea to review toxins data disclosure process SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea plans to review if there was any negligence in the government's handling of sick workers' inquiries about workplace toxins, after an Associated Press investigation found the government repeatedly withheld such information following requests from Samsung. Ko Dong-woo, a director at the Labor Ministry, said Friday that the ministry took the AP report seriously and would ensure officials properly evaluate information requests from workers seeking government compensation for work-related illnesses. ___ China reports weaker July activity but says economy stable BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese factory output and other economic activity weakened in July, data showed Friday, but an official tried to reassure companies and investors growth is stable. Growth in retail sales, factory output and investment all decelerated from June levels, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Private sector analysts have warned economic growth, which held steady at 6.7 percent for the three months ending in June, was showing signs of weakening heading into the current quarter. The data indicate "the third quarter has started off on a weak footing," said Brian Jackson of IHS Markit in a report. ___ Smiley faces at small company making popular emoji apps Mobile apps that allow users to create their own emojis or share the stylized images of NBA star Stephen Curry and other celebrities are paying off for a small upstate New York company. Moji Maker— with its mix-and-match menu of happy, angry or goofy faces — was the No. 2 paid app on the iTunes chart as of Friday morning. The company that made it, Moji, recently scored big with its Curry app and is following up with similarly styled apps for two Olympic athletes who won gold this week: swimmer Michael Phelps and gymnast Simone Biles. ___ Security experts: Remotes are hackable on many vehicles FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A group of computer security experts say they figured out how to hack the keyless entry systems used on millions of cars, meaning that thieves could in theory break and steal items without leaving a broken window. The experts say that remote entry systems on millions of cars made by Volkswagen since 1995 can be cloned to permit unauthorized access to the car's interior. The same experts say another system used by other brands including Ford, General Motor's Opel and Chevrolet and Renault can also be defeated. ___ The Dow fell 37.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,576.47.

Mary Altaffer/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of It used to be that you could regret eating deep-fried Twinkies just a few times a year, whenever you went to a fair. Now, you can regret eating them every day. On Friday, Hostess unveiled a pre-battered, partially fried version of the treat that can be frozen for baking at home with a few minutes in the toaster oven or frying pan, reported the Associated Press. The snack, which comes with vanilla or chocolate cream, is the product of a yearlong collaboration with Wal-Mart, and for the first three months, the latter will have exclusive rights to its distribution. Hostess has debuted a number of products for the health-conscious recently, in line with a growing trend among consumers. But with nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the deep-fried Twinkie – like the carnivals and boardwalks where they remain a staple – is being branded more as a throwback to an earlier time when Americans thought less about their waistlines than about the passions of their palettes.

Take our quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 The deep-fried Twinkie is part of a push by Wal-Mart to collaborate with food suppliers on new products themselves – or new twists on old products. In June, the company opened a new food-innovation laboratory at its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters for that purpose. Michael Hicks, a distinguished professor of economics at Ball State University, who has studied the impact of Wal-Mart on local economies, tells The Christian Science Monitor that the lab would likely try to appeal to customers already in Wal-Mart stores. “They are also worried about keeping costs low, which probably means that they are experimenting not only with taste, but packaging and presentation,” he says. In a June interview with Talk Business and Politics, Charles Redfield, the head of Wal-Mart’s US food division, suggested that the new lab was a way of keeping down promotional costs. “On our own turf, we can go deep down into the product ingredients and better control the process of dead net cost [when vendor rebates are subtracted from the price up front],” he said, “and the result of that is that we can become better food experts.... It’s an education facility for us and our suppliers.” The site is part kitchen, part market-research incubator , where the company surveys customers and employees on the qualities of a food or drink. And with Wal-Mart continuing its reign as the nation’s largest food retailer, what goes on in the lab may have significant implications for Americans’ health. Robert Lawrence, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and founding director of the Center for a Livable Future, says the lab is also one of several that trace their origin to universities and corporations. “There are a few university-based food labs looking at promoting nutritional quality, then there are a whole raft of food labs doing the opposite, trying to get us to succumb to even more highly processed food,” he tells the Monitor. “Wal-Mart falls, I think, in that last category.” Many of those labs are spending lots of time on the science of gratification. Dr. Lawrence recalls being amazed by a presentation at a Google food lab from one group of scientists who described fitting taste-testers with microphones attached to the outside of their cheeks as they sampled new varieties of chips, to measure how different levels of crunchiness corresponded to consumers’ satisfaction. Food retailers, he said, “all have well-trained food scientists that understand things about taste and gratification and so forth that make it a big challenge for public health community to steer people toward a better diet.” “From a public health perspective, it’s very worrisome if someone as powerful as Wal-Mart’s grocery business is making an even more appealing snack food.” Next up Test your knowledge Are you a real foodie?

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Aug 12, 2016 at 3:30PM Both the cable and retail industries have entered a state of massive upheaval. Retail has been struggling for years against Amazon, which has changed the rules of the game. It's no longer enough to be convenient with just an OK price. The bar has been raised. Cable faces a similar problem, even if it's earlier in the game. Consumers have begun to slowly reject the current distribution model, which involves paying cable companies for access to more content than they actually want. In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, host Vincent Shen is joined by Motley Fool contributor Daniel Kline to discuss Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) decision to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion, and Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX) reasons for paying $583 million for a 10% stake in Hulu. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Aug. 9, 2016. Vincent Shen: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market each day. I'm Vincent Shen, your host. It is Tuesday, August 9th. Joining via Skype from Connecticut this time around. Right, Dan? Daniel Kline: I believe it's the third state I've done this podcast from. Shen: Yes, and that's all within the past couple of weeks, too, not like over a few months. How goes it, Dan? Kline: It's crazy. This is actually the last thing I do in my house before getting in the car and driving to West Palm Beach for "a permanent move." Shen: I have to say thanks again for joining us, because I know you have this and then a nice long, long, long drive ahead of you. I've done that drive before. Kline: I'm pumped up on cold brew, and one of the other Fools in our Slack board told me about caffeinated gum, so I think I'm ready for the journey. Shen: Getting to our topics today for the listeners, we have some M&A, or merger and acquisitions related topics on tap. Before we dive into that first story Dan, and this is relevant, I promise to listeners, I want to ask you this, what is your preferred streaming video service? Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)? Amazon? Hulu? Maybe Sling TV? Kline: The funny thing is ... So, I use Netflix. I pay for all three. I have Hulu and I have Amazon Prime, but I'm one of those people that got Amazon Prime because I buy things from Amazon. I can't say I've used their video service at all. I got Hulu to watch The Mindy Project six months ago and still have never used it because I'm halfway through the second season of Daredevil. I've traditionally been a big regular television full cable subscriber. I'm actually, when we move, going to give Sony's PlayStation Vue a try. I've also tested Sling TV. What I don't like about Sling TV is it's limited. It's a skinny bundle. It's a great price, but the Sony package for -- I don't know, $49, it varies based on market -- you get about a hundred channels, and it hits most of the things I would want. I'm going to be losing out on some of the regional sports and other things I would have paid for on cable, but when it comes to the pure streaming, that seems a good bet. And Netflix, the originals, it just has so much more stuff than anybody else does. Shen: You are still a traditional cable subscriber? Kline: I am until tomorrow technically. Shen: Okay. I've wanted to ask this, and I find it was really interesting because with our first story, and here's the lead-in, this news came out last week: Time Warner taking over a minority stake in Hulu. We're kind of seeing these worlds blend together. In just the example you gave with your own personal experience, you are a traditional cable subscriber, but you had these other streaming services, and all of this is kind of coming together for your personal experience and personal consumption of all this content, too. Time Warner we've covered from several different angles over the past few episodes. They announced last week taking a 10% ownership position in Hulu for prices about, I think it was $580 million, so that values--- Kline: Yeah, $550, $580, somewhere around there. Shen: Hulu valuation coming in at about $6 billion. For anyone who isn't familiar with Hulu, just some quick backstory, the service started in 2008. It's a joint venture started by some media and entertainment heavy-hitters. Think Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast, NBCUniversal, and now of course Time Warner. At the moment, Hulu has three offerings, but even that will be changing -- we can touch on that later -- has basically a free streaming option where you get to watch a full slate of ads with that. You have a $7.99 per month subscription option with limited ads. Then if you want to pay full price, it's $11.99 completely ad-free. The thing is, the key development with this Time Warner buyout, it seems to me at least, is the live-streaming service that Hulu plans to offer in 2017. Dan, how are these two companies, the joint venture owners thinking about this deal and the new service? Kline: It's important to note that Time Warner is buying in only for the live-streaming service. Time Warner has a big issue with the way Hulu operates now, which is they make current episodes of recent shows from its partners, not all shows because of ownership on the individual shows, but most Fox shows, most ABC shows, most NBC shows, you get 24 hours after a show airs, you can watch it and the last three or four episodes, maybe four or five in some cases on the $7.99 service, and in some cases on the free service. Time Warner thinks that's undervaluing its programming, especially because the numbers are not big enough that it's a major advertising source. Time Warner will not be contributing to that part of the service. What they're paying for is distribution. They see the amount of homes that have cable slowly getting smaller. Cable is dying, but it's going to take a long time at the current pace. What you have happening is they're paying this money so five years from now, when these types of services, Sling and PlayStation Vue, and the various cable networks, cable services not offering boxes but actually having pure digital, I think what you're going to see is by owning a piece of this, they guarantee themselves a place at the table. They're not going to have the contentious negotiations they have with the satellite providers over Sling or with Comcast every time rights to TBS and TNT and CNN come up. This is really just buying them access to homes as the cable role changes. Shen: Hulu, next year -- just to clarify what exactly they're going to be offering and Time Warner is buying into -- is a live streaming service that will actually include live television, which is a little bit different from what it currently does, which is more similar to Netflix. Kline: Basically, they're copying Sling, except because some of their partners are networks, Sling does not have any traditional broadcast networks. It sort of the most popular cable channels for younger people. What's happening here with Hulu is they're going to have some of the Fox, NBC, ABC programming. Maybe my mom can get it, and she'll still get the Nightly News. I don't think my mom watches the Nightly News, but if her mom was still alive, she would watch the Nightly News and maybe would have to get this type of product. Shen: There's not as many details as I was hoping there would be otherwise for the Hulu services coming out next year, but I think it's helpful for listeners just to give some context in terms of how far Hulu has come since it started back in 2008. Compare just for some basic contexts, Netflix, the leader here, has about 40 or over 40 million domestic subscribers that generate about $6.8 billion of revenue in 2015. The most recent numbers I could find for Hulu, for example, over 10 million subscribers, so a smaller base for sure, generated revenue of $1 billion in 2013. That grew pretty quickly to about $1.6 or $1.7 billion last year. The thing is, both of these companies, and this includes Amazon, too, all these streaming services fighting for content, they've been spending a lot of money for not only their original programming that all three have become known for, but also $5-$6 billion spent by Netflix in 2016 expected. The most recent number I could find for Hulu is about $1.5 billion in 2015. Kline: A lot of that is going to Seinfeld. Shen: Yes, I think it was like $700,000 or $1 million per episode for that. Kline: I think that's the differentiator between the two. Netflix is a service aimed at people in their 20s and 30s who maybe never had cable. Whereas Hulu, the content is really the stuff you would watch if you had a cable subscription a couple of days later, 24 hours later plus a few originals that feel like network shows. It's not groundbreaking in the way that Netflix is. It's sort of a familiar angle. It's when an older generation says, "You know what? I'm not paying $150 to Comcast anymore, but I still want to watch Law & Order. Hulu is trying to keep that model, and the challenge is not pushing cable subscribers away -- that's the last thing Comcast would want -- but also keeping as many of them that were going to leave anyway on the one that they own. You'll do better as Time Warner being a partner in Hulu than licensing your content to DISH or to Sony or the 20 other services like this that are going to start in the next few months. Shen: There's an interesting dynamic here because, as we mentioned, the joint venture owners for Hulu are the really big companies like Disney, you mentioned Comcast, NBC, Universal. This news just came out yesterday, actually, where I mentioned that first service is free to access Hulu content or some of the Hulu library, but it's supported by ads. They're actually getting rid of that entirely. Kline: The interesting thing is they're actually just moving it to Yahoo!. They announced a partnership deal. They're "unconfusing" the Hulu brand. Basically, Hulu is going to have two products. It's going to have a subscription product where you get access to next-day content from the original partners and not Time Warner, and then it's going to have a live-streaming television service. Having the free product on top of it, which inflated their viewer numbers by another 40 million, but didn't really make them a lot of money because it's really difficult to sell ads on three people watching a Seinfeld from 15 years ago and 17 people watching Family Guy. It becomes a very tough model to prove to advertisers that there's value. They're sort of just shunting that off and taking it off the Hulu brand, which makes sense. It will make it a lot easier for them to sell their two services that make sense. Shen: Stepping back now and looking at this in terms of some of the changes that are obviously happening to the industry, big picture, what do you think is going to be happening maybe next year, or with these developments as deals like these between Time Warner, Hulu, and Hulu service coming out next year? What do you think that's going to mean? Kline: I think it's the wild west. It think you're going to see every major cable company start a service that doesn't require a cable box in order to keep broadband customers. What's going to happen is you're going to have two or three years where there's 15 choices, and then you'll see consolidation again. There's no need for there to be Sling and Vue and whatever they call super Hulu. If Amazon enters that space, if Apple enters that space -- a lot of players are going to come here. Eventually, you're going to see it's just going to be like cable, where it doesn't really matter if you have Frontier or you have Comcast, pretty much you're getting the same offer. Maybe it becomes priced in customer service, but there's going to be a lot of announcements and a lot of new companies, or existing companies going into the space because the cable box is slowly going away. Shen: All right. Thanks a lot, Dan! I want to move onto our second segment now, which is related at least in that this is another industry that's kind of going through a lot of transition, some growing pains. It has had, I guess, quite a bit of disruptive innovation -- people like to use that term -- and that's retail. This week, it was confirmed that Walmart is pivoting its e-commerce strategy once again by acquiring Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Let me stop right there and provide background again for Jet, because this is one where in my, I guess, unscientific sampling of friends and fellow Fools, not everyone is really familiar with this company, frankly. It makes sense considering how young it is. It's only just over a year old at this point, and it's been scooped up for a pretty hefty price, there, I think one of the biggest e-commerce start-up price tags in history. Kline: They have crazy multiple on sales. They do about $1 billion in sales and they sold for $3.3 billion. You don't see money-losing companies get that kind of deal very often. Shen: That billion dollars is gross merchandise volume. Basically, the value of everything they sell on the site, but their revenue is actually just a piece of that, too, so it's a bit crazier than that. Kline: To finish what you were saying, Jet.com was built as an Amazon competitor. What Walmart is buying is partly their CEO, a guy named Marc Lore, who also started the company that owned Diapers.com, which Amazon bought. Jet.com used sort of a different method than what Amazon does. As a customer on Jet, you would build your order, and the more things you bought, the cheaper your price would get because it would be cheaper for them to deliver it to you. It's worth noting that Amazon does that after a fashion with add-on items. I think even Target and Walmart do it a little bit. The idea is to get you to go on and not just impulsively buy something, but to really do your shopping and build up your orders. It's a fledgling company, but they have been adding, I think the number is 400,000 shoppers a month? Shen: Yes, that's the number. Kline: It's growing, but this has to be the biggest gap. Walmart is No. 2 when it comes to online retailers. I believe the numbers are about $100 billion for Amazon and about $13 billion for Walmart? This is Coke and Pepsi, except Pepsi is Royal Crown soda. It's a very small player in the space comparatively. Shen: I think this is an interesting deal, and we can get in more detail what Walmart is getting here with this acquisition. I think the CEO or the co-founder of Jet.com, Marc Lore, who you mentioned, he's a big part of the story, he's going to be joining Walmart following the acquisition. He's going to lead Walmart's e-commerce efforts going forward, and Jet.com and Walmart.com will still operate separately at that. Kline: We joked about this before, but one: I think Walmart is lighting money on fire, here. I don't think there's anything that they couldn't have duplicated in the six months for $0.5 billion. They're spending a huge amount of money to get a guy. I get it, Marc Lore has been successful, he's been one of the few that has been able to compete with Amazon, but I don't see why Walmart is buying it. I look at it, say, 18 months from now, there's going to be the inevitable press conference where Marc Lore stands up and says, "We've decided to eliminate the Jet.com brand and just focus on our core brand of Walmart.com, but of course we're going to be integrating the technology." It doesn't seem like these deals ever end up with one company operating two distinct products in the same space. Shen: I love the fact that if you see Amazon as the arch rival to Walmart, it's going to be as Lore, you mentioned the company that he started previously, Quidsi, which owned a portfolio of stores like Diapers.com and Soap.com, that guy got bought by Amazon for about $550 million in 2010. Lore was actually at Amazon for two years, then he left, kicked out Jet.com, and now lo and behold, he's going to be end up at Walmart. Kline: He's really good at raising money, but he hasn't shown that he's really good at building sales. That's what troubles me about this. Shen: To touch on that specifically from what I could find, Jet.com has raised about $800 million through various rounds of funding and financing from a lot of actually investors from his previous ventures. He obviously has a strong track record. Something just to keep in mind is the fact that they have their smart card where the more you buy, the cheaper it can be for shoppers. I think there have been quite a few analyses and studies from some industry followers and from shoppers themselves that have found it. A lot of Jet.com prices are competitive and better than Amazon, which is usually seen as the price leader. That was the strategy that base has used to claim so much market share and to develop such a leadership position. Basically, it comes down to the fulfillment in the logistics, and the way they tie the shipping, and how much you buy. You take Walmart, and they have this huge network of stores and warehouses. They can basically take that technology and leverage it to Walmart scale. Kline: The challenge for Walmart has always been that fulfilling what a store needs versus an individual order is a massive change. This probably speeds that up, but there's going to be huge growing pains. I don't see how they're buying enough customers to have this make sense. If they had paid Mark Lore's investors back at a 25% premium and then given him a huge deal to come in and run their digital, this would have made sense, but they're buying a brand most people haven't heard of. The second people realize  Jet.com is a Walmart brand, it loses some its cache. I think it's fair to say there's a Target and Amazon customer that looks at Walmart and goes, "Ugh, I don't want anything to do with Walmart." I think that's going to taint the sort of hip, millennial brand. It's very hard to stay cool when you're associated with Walmart. Shen: That's a very good point, because I think previously, with Lore's older venture with Quidsi, for example, I think a really loyal shopper following that he had was among younger urban shoppers. Then with Jet.com, they've been spending like $20 or $25 million a month advertising. A lot of that's targeting not only millennials, but they're trying to basically generate more repeat shoppers. I think I have some data from Slice and BI Intelligence dating back to February that indicated Jet.com was having a hard time generating repeat business -- over two-thirds of their sales were coming from new customers. You mentioned the 400,000 people signing up, or essentially shopping with them with each month. It's just interesting to kind of see that dynamic there. Kline: The problem they come up against is Amazon has, and I don't know the recent number, but it's roughly 225 million credit cards on file. However, [something like 63 million] Prime members, they don't share the numbers, so it's always a guess. They've made the process so easy, that I buy on Amazon from my phone, I can buy things verbally from my Echo. As an Amazon customer, why would I switch? Because diapers are $0.02 less, I don't need diapers. Any device I was going to buy, anything, if Amazon is within the ballpark, I'm not going to shop around. Maybe I'll jump on Jet.com and buy a TV because it's $100 cheaper, but I'm probably not going to switch. That's a very, very difficult behavior for any new company to win over. I would think that an awful lot of Amazon customers just find it a little bit cooler to buy from Amazon than to buy from Walmart. They can be No. 2. If they're trying to be No. 2, they can be a bigger No. 2, but this is like me challenging for the heavy weight championship -- it's not going to work out well. Shen: With all that in mind, I'm a little skeptical, as you are, just based on the price tag. $300 million in cash, $30 million in Walmart stock, and I think a lot of that is going to be dedicated, it's basically incentives for management. $300 million, sorry about that. Kline: In stock. Shen: Yeah, in stock. Kline: And three billion in cash. Shen: Exactly. For Walmart, their e-commerce efforts in their physical year 2015 they were seeing some pretty strong progress. Year over year, quarterly growth was anywhere from 21% to 27%. Then the following year, so last year, in their fiscal 2016, it kind of started to fall from the high teens to below 10%. In the most recent quarter, it came in at just 7% globally. That deceleration definitely has people concerned because it's lagging even the broad economy, where e-commerce is, I think, still growing double-digit rates every quarter. Kline: They need to catch up to Amazon in terms of fulfillment. If you buy anything from Amazon, it is going to show up in two days, including on Sunday. Walmart doesn't even promise that. I think they'll sell it to you for an extra price. The days when you place an order and it takes three to five shipping days, Amazon has created a new standard, and people have proven willing. I'll buy batteries from Amazon because I could wait 48 hours with my remote control not working. I'm not going to wait a week. That's really where Walmart has to catch up, and Jet can help with that. This will make the Walmart customer have a better experience on Walmart.com and on Jet.com after six months, a year of integration, but I don't see it winning over new business. This may help them as they lose sales in the store to their own website fulfill and keep those customers happy. That is an important step. Shen: Something else that I wanted to mention too is I'm curious to see how they blend, how it really impacts Walmart because I know they I think it's called their shipping pass where you basically pay a flat fee for the year and you get two-day shipping, and this is really just very similar to Prime to be more competitive with Amazon with those really incredible fulfillment speeds, and how they kind of blend that with the fact that Jet.com has some of this infrastructure, some of this technology in terms of optimizing and making as cheap as possible for their shoppers and the smart card and everything. Kline: That's why I say it ultimately has to be one brand. It seems crazy to me that you would make Jet.com the online version of Walmart, so that's not going to happen. Eventually, this will become a Walmart.com powered by Jet, and then Jet will be down in the corner, and then Jet won't exist anymore. Hopefully, they can integrate the technology because if they do, they have to get faster. Walmart has an incredible network. Amazon has its warehouses, but Walmart has a store in most of the country, something like every five miles. Their ability to ship to stores, to ship to you from a store, if they can figure that out, and obviously there's a lot of programming and algorithms, we've talked before about how Amazon knows what you're going to buy in a local warehouse before you order it, if Walmart can figure that out and Jet helps them, then maybe they bridge some of that shipping divide, and that will at least stop them from bleeding customers just because Amazon can get things faster. Shen: I have to say, I just have to admit that I'm a little curious, too, to see, you have this small upstart company just hitting about $1 billion in their gross merchandise volume in their first, they've launched July 2015, so just about a year of existence, has Amazon kind of been paying attention, at the very least. Walmart jumps in, huge resources. I'm really curious to see where things go, even if the price tag may be a little high. Maybe hopes are a little too high, but overall, definitely an interesting deal. Kline: It's definitely possible that this gets Walmart back on the growth path from ramping down to ramping up, but I think Amazon is watching this and laughing. This is not a competitor. This is my little league team challenging the Red Socks. It's not going to do that, but they can become a better No. 2. The other thing they can do is crowd out some of the other players. If I'm Amazon, I'm not worried. If I'm Target, I'm a little bit nervous. If I'm Kohl's, maybe I'm nervous. This is sort of Walmart saying, "We're in second place, let's consolidate." And almost any price is worth it to do that. Shen: Thanks a lot, Dan, for your input here, and good luck with your drive for today. Kline: I appreciate it, thank you. Shen: Yeah, no problem.

Tech Meetup, won the New Business of the Year award in it's hometown of Hoboken, N.J. During my speech accepting the award I talked about Hoboken as being uniquely positioned to be home to the next Google, Facebook or Amazon. We have a great standard of living, a lower cost of business than NYC, an excellent university (Stevens) in town, a vibrant tech community and obviously, a ridiculous proximity to NYC which makes recruitment and bizdev very attractive. I noticed that the mostly old-school room of business owners seemed dismissive to the reality and impact of what I was suggesting. Just a couple of years later, Jet.com set up shop in town and almost became that anchor tenant. Today it was announced that they were acquired for $3 billion by Walmart. While it seems this will provide a reasonable investor gain and some individual wealth, it’s not the outcome I was hoping for. I worry that in just a few years time Jet will be a blip on the tech radar that becomes a rounding error for Walmart with stalled innovation at that sleek three letter URL. Related: Jet.com's Founder Marc Lore: 3 Things You Need to Know About the Man Taking on Amazon Keep in mind -- in 2015, Amazon generated $107 billion in annual revenue and has a market cap of $363 billion. Facebook’s market cap is $360 billion. Google is $550 billion. GroupOn is $3.4 billion. WayFair is $4.1 billion. Walmart is, notably, $230 billion. The market Jet is attacking is still shockingly ripe for innovation. Ecommerce represents just 7.8 percent of retail sales. Think about that -- if you’re like me ecommerce is probably 90+ percent of your retail shopping. Yet, around the country 92.2 percent of retail still happens offline. That’s part of the market that Marc and team at Jet were aiming for. And, with the dynamic shopping engine Jet built around smart logistics, Marc was betting that the savings to customers would help expedite some of that offline to online growth and attract enough people away from the competition that growth would skyrocket. Jet.com Recruiting Bar & Lounge at Propeller Innovation Festival 2016, Pier A Hoboken, N.J. $3 billion isn’t the rocket they intended to build. While a $3 billion sale of a few year old company is a great headline, it’s hard to imagine that’s what Marc was gunning for when he raised over $600 million. Imagine if they instead grew to a $100 billion company, acquired other innovative companies over the years and grew into a long term leader in tech and ecommerce in the NYC region. That’s a very different story. Related: Why Wal-Mart Will Welcome 'Greeters' Back Into Its Stores I’ve had a chance to get to know Marc a bit and have enormous respect for him. Through the N.J. Tech Meetup and with Propeller I’ve had a chance to get to know many of the very fine employees who’ve joined the Jet mission. I’m thrilled they have had a chance to get to know NJ as something other than a turnpike and a TV show. However, for N.J. and the NYC region as a whole, I’m having a hard time deeming this acquisition as a big win. What this says to me is that Amazon rules. Armed with nearly unlimited resources establishing a massive new ecommerce business with long term viability is almost impossible.

We are lacking in solid press coverage and a strong investor ecosystem, areas where my friends across the Hudson shine. Had Jet grown into the $100+ billion company we all hoped it would, Hoboken and New Jersey at large would have a modern anchor tenant that could spawn dozens of other innovators. I hope that Walmart will allow Jet to continue to innovate and push the product much further along. I hope they will allow Jet’s entrepreneurial spirit to live and encourage free thinking and boundary breaking in the way that Marc and many at Jet embody. I hope they will allow this company to thrive in a way that it will still entice people who live in Brooklyn to come to Hoboken to work inspired for Walmart, as many do for Jet, now. In the meantime, Hoboken will look for it’s next anchor tech tenant. I’m sure that among our attendees at the NJ Tech Meetup and Propeller, another Jet.com will soon be born, and perhaps decide to make it’s HQ in town too.

Hostess says the Twinkie is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012.      For Wal-Mart, it's part of a strategy of working with suppliers to come up with twists on existing foods or developing new ones. The company, which gets more than half its sales from food, opened a food lab in June as it aims to get products to the shelves faster. (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)   HOW IT'S MADE: A regular Twinkie is coated with a cake funnel batter and then proceeds through an oil bath to ensure the batter adheres. The Twinkies are immediately frozen and packaged. HOME PREPARATION: Pull it out of the freezer and bake it for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for two-and-a-half to three minutes. THE PRICE: $4.76 per box of seven. For comparison, New York-based hot-dog joint Papaya King sells its own fresh deep-fried treats for $3 each, excluding tax. DISTRIBUTION: The Deep Fried Twinkies will be available starting Friday, Aug. 12, at Wal-Mart only for three months. After that, they will be available at other stores. Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, says the treat could be marketed abroad. NUTRITION: The vanilla-cream version has 220 calories, nine grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. A regular Twinkie has 130 calories, four grams of fat and 14 grams of sugar. In comparison, a Starbucks Carmel Frappuccino has 420 calories, 15 grams of fat and 66 grams of sugar. WORKING IT OFF: A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to run for 20 minutes at 10 mph, take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride, says Amy Gorin, a Jersey City, New Jersey-based registered dietitian-nutritionist. LIMITED-TIME TWINKIES: In December, Hostess teamed up with Wal-Mart on a limited-time mint-chocolate flavored cake. In June, it worked with the retailer on a tie-in for the new "Ghostbusters" movie, creating Key Lime Slime Twinkies for a short-term sale. ____ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio on Twitter at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio WTRF 96 16th Street Wheeling, WV 26003 Main (304) 232-7777 Fax (304) 233-5822 Can't Find Something?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 Mail News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Pollsters say ‘Walmart moms,’ wary of Trump and Clinton, are critical vote in 2016 Andrew Bahl August 12, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share View photos A shopper carries her purchases from a newly opened Walmart Neighborhood Market in Chicago. (Reuters/Jim Young)More Previous elections have given us “the silent majority,” “Reagan Democrats” and “NASCAR dads.” But pundits and pollsters have identified a new group to watch, and it is one you might not expect: “Walmart moms.” Political strategists are increasingly thinking about these voters, who make up an estimated 14 to 17 percent of the electorate in the 2016 presidential race. “Walmart moms” are defined by pollsters as the sort of voters who have children under the age of 18 and a household income hovering around the nationwide average. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake told Yahoo News that these parents are less concerned with the back and forth of the presidential race than the hard details about how candidates could help them support their family, keep their children safe and keep the prices of household staples low. A “Walmart mom” is “still struggling in the economy, she feels the political system failed her and believes the economic system caters to the well-off,” Lake said. “She is threatened by terrorism and [her] own economic insecurity. Even more so, they are worried they can’t offer a better life to their children.” To track the opinions of this burgeoning group, two polling firms, Republican-leaning Public Opinion Strategies and Democratic-leaning Momentum Analysis, conducted periodic focus groups with the mothers. The groups, which have been run since 2010, are commissioned by Walmart but have found a broader use in understanding the group’s political orientation. The focus groups have found that the 2016 election has caused concern among these voters, with the women particularly apprehensive about both Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. A new focus group conducted this week provided further evidence of the dissatisfaction that these voters are feeling in their own lives and toward the political arena. The panel was conducted with two dozen “Walmart moms” in Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix, Ariz., and remotely observed by a group of journalists and pollsters, including Yahoo News. “No matter which way you choose, we’re going to lose,” Gidget, a customer service manager from Columbus, said in the group. “You have to give up something. But no one is talking about the issues. … I feel like [the candidates] are so far extreme on both sides, we’re going to have to give up something either way.” Clinton is viewed as untrustworthy and lacking warmth, with one woman calling her a “stone-cold b****” for her demeanor in the face of controversy. “I think they are all liars, but I feel like she gets caught a lot,” Julie, a Columbus office worker, said. The overwhelming majority pegged the scandals surrounding Clinton, especially her use of a private email server while secretary of state, as their biggest reservation about her candidacy. But despite this discontent, the women viewed a potential Trump presidency with even more scorn. While there is some appeal in the business mogul’s financial experience and outsider credentials, most are shocked by his “big mouth” and volcanic temperament. “He acts like a 2-year-old,” Deanna, a Phoenix mother of four, said. “I have a 2-year-old. I see the similarities.” View photos Donald Trump applauds during a campaign rally in Wilmington, N.C. (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)More Lake said this sentiment fits with the women’s roles as leaders in their households. “Women want respect, they are the disciplinarians in their homes,” she said. “They hold things together in tough times. They don’t let their families behave like Donald Trump, and they don’t get to behave like Donald Trump.” While some of the women said they would vote for Trump in the hope that he would tone down some of his rhetoric, others called him “risky” and “dangerous.” Other women, who made up a slight majority of focus group members, said they would reluctantly vote for Clinton or Libertarian Gary Johnson. Many voters described being fearful about the fate of the country, however, a sentiment that has existed since the primaries. In an April focus group of suburban mothers from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, “Walmart moms” continually expressed a lack of enthusiasm for any of the candidates, according to the pollsters running the group. They were nervous about what the future had in store and put off by the “circus” atmosphere of the primary season. “Using words like ‘chaos,’ ‘horrific,’ ‘terrible’ and ‘vulnerable,’ these women are overwhelmingly pessimistic about the direction of the country,” the analysis of the April focus group read. “This time, however, the Presidential campaign’s tone is almost as worrying as the economy or their own financial situations.” But how did this subgroup become such an important target for political campaigns? Lake said the group has become much more pliable in the past 20 years as the women have taken on a different societal role. “Married women didn’t used to be a swing [demographic],” Lake said. “They used to just vote like their husbands. But over time they have gotten more and more independent.” Lake noted that the gap between how women and their spouses vote has been growing, and that we could see a record discrepancy in November. President Obama won “Walmart moms” in 2008 and 2012, according to polling conducted after the elections. Then, the key issues for these women revolved around the Great Recession, putting food on the table and national security, according to focus groups conducted at the time. Anger was widespread among these women about how America’s economic recovery did not reach their families. “These women are frustrated,” Neil Newhouse of Public Opinion Strategies said in 2011. “They see Wall Street getting bailed out. There’s a resentment there that they see a government activism that doesn’t impact them directly. They want their share.” But despite frustration at the slow recovery from the Great Recession, the “Walmart moms” were not wholly pessimistic — they trusted the candidates to lead them back. “These voters don’t seem like they have given up on Obama,” Newhouse said after a focus group conducted shortly before the 2012 election. “They are losing patience with Washington, but it seemed like Obama doesn’t come out that bad.” The women followed through, narrowly supporting Obama in his victory over Republican Mitt Romney. An election night poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and Momentum Analysis showed Obama pulled 50 percent of the “Walmart moms” surveyed, compared with 48 percent for Romney. This narrow edge played a part in Obama’s reelection. “As we talked with Walmart moms around the country this year, we heard loud and clear from them that they were torn over their vote decision,” Alex Bratty and Margie Omero wrote in an analysis of the 2012 poll. “They didn’t always blame Obama for the current economic crisis, but they felt very acutely that recovery was not reaching them quickly enough. And, while they thought Governor Romney might be better on the economy, they also had reservations about switching course. … These election night results demonstrate how tight the race was and how women, and these Walmart moms, helped determine Obama’s victory.” How can Trump or Clinton better orient themselves to the group to copy Obama’s success? Women were more positive when they felt they were getting a personal view of the candidates. Despite not placing much weight on either convention, focus group members cited speeches from both nominees’ children as moments that affected their views in a positive manner. View photos Hillary Clinton speaks during a rally in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo: Chris Keane/Reuters)More “One thing that is important is that the personal is political for these women,” Lake said. “They know the candidates well but also don’t. For Clinton, they may see her as a mother or grandmother but don’t know much about her in those roles. Finding out more about that goes a long way toward making her more likable and trustworthy.” Even though chaos has reigned during the unconventional 2016 election season, “Walmart moms” are still one of the most critical swing demographics, according to Lake and other pollsters. However, there was pessimism in the focus group as to whether the election would ultimately improve their lives. “My biggest issue is what is going on in my city and my community,” Dana, a food service worker from Columbus, said. “I obviously would like a candidate who is qualified to take us in the right direction.

(Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) NEW YORK — The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” today. It is the company's first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost around $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. Related: Did we ever really warm to Macy's? It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” Related: Williamston woman led a coffee creamer crusade The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said.

The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work.

Hostess is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” that mark its first foray into frozen foods.  (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Mo., headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said. 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2bnKsEo More Stories Rochester's Chapman House brings sophistication to the table Nov. 23, 2016, 12:42 a.m. Husband’s stalling on kids backs her into corner Nov. 22, 2016, 11:24 p.m. Demanding boss expects work mid-crisis Nov. 22, 2016, 11:24 p.m.

(File/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS) Anne D'Innocenzio, The Associated Press Published Friday, August 12, 2016 1:48PM EDT NEW YORK -- Walmart opened a 12,000-square-foot culinary and innovation centre at its headquarters in June as a place where the nation's largest food retailer can work with major suppliers to come up with new food ideas, and develop ideas on its own to bolster its store-brand selection. Here's a peek at the food lab: WHAT IT IS: The centre has 10 test kitchens including a studio-style chef's kitchen and replicas of the bakery and deli kitchens found in most of its stores. It has stoves, ovens and microwaves so the staff can cook the same ways customers do at home. There's also a sensory lab where Walmart can collect feedback from customers and employees, who answer questions about the texture, saltiness or sweetness of a food or beverage. The facility follows a similar lab at the company's Sam's Club headquarters, which opened a few years ago. WHY IT MATTERS: Walmart derives 56 per cent of its total sales from food and other grocery items. The company also accounts for about 25 per cent of the overall U.S. grocery business. Since customers might shop for food several times a week, it's critical to get food items right to build loyalty. In the past, Walmart had tested products at kitchens throughout its headquarters, but that effort was limited and the feedback it provided was fairly general. Now, Walmart gets specific feedback from customers that it can share with suppliers to help decide if an item is ready or needs changes. That collaboration saves money and cuts several months off a product launch, which can last a year from idea to an item landing on store shelves. WHAT'S NEXT: Walmart is testing frozen stuffed doughnut bites as well as new flavours for its Clear American Ice store brand sparkling water and Paleo meals that are vacuum-packed. The Clear American Ice pineapple-orange flavour arrives in stores in September. The Paleo meals and the doughnut bites will be in the stores in October.

"We are thrilled to provide the Springfield Rescue Mission with a $25,000 check and very happy to support the organization," Walmart's New England Director of Communications Chris Buchanan said. The contribution will fund the rescue center's clothing giveaway center, Operation Sunshine homelessness program and emergency shelter on Taylor Street, Springfield Rescue Mission Chairman Robert Blakeslee said. Blakeslee and Mayor Domenic Sarno thanked Walmart for the donation and posed for photographs with the oversized check at the press conference. The mission has operated for 124 years  typically spends about $2.3 million each year, in addition to receiving about $2 million worth of in-kind donations like clothing, shoes and toiletries. The donation will go exclusively to services, and not toward funding the unexpected tax bill that led the mission to take out a six-figure loan earlier this year, according to Blakeslee. The tax-exempt nonprofit, which provides services for the poor and homeless, was hit with a one-time tax bill after acquiring its new headquarters on Mill Street last year. Because the building was on the tax rolls last year before the Rescue Mission took possession of it the organization became responsible for a $150,000 share of its tax bill -- an amount which surprised the operators of the charity after they closed on the property in October. In April, the rescue mission paid off the bill, using a loan from Berkshire Bank. The charity had appealed for donors to help cover the unexpected costs, and donors responded with $110,000 in contributions, The Republican reported today. The Rescue Mission attempted to fight its new home's assessment, filing for an abatement after paying its first bill in February. But the city denied its request on April 28. The mission has appealed to the state, and the case is still pending. The mission moved from its old location on Bliss Street, within the footprint of the MGM Springfield casino project, to its new renovated site provided in exchange for the Bliss Street site by MGM for its $950 million casino project. The Rescue Mission took ownership of the Mill Street site, the former Orr Cadillac property, on Oct. 31, 2015, after MGM completed major renovations. Under state law, a nonprofit organization that acquires a property during a tax year does not have the right to tax exempt status during that fiscal year, Martin told The Republican in April. MGM had owned the property for the first four months of the fiscal year, and the Rescue Mission is the owner for the final eight months, with each owner responsible for its appropriate share, Martin said.

Source: Wikipedia Fans of the staple fair food can pick up a pack of seven Deep Fried Twinkies at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) locations across the United States. The product costs $4.76 and is available in both vanilla and chocolate variants. Walmart said that it will have Deep Fried Twinkies available at more than 4,000 of its stores by Aug. 16. The retail chain has an exclusive market on the frozen treat for the first three months it’s available. Walmart worked directly with Hostess to develop the Deep Fried Twinkies now found in the frozen section. Walmart buyer John Pearson said the company was interested in the frozen treats to help fill out its dessert offerings. He noted that it took several tests before the the new product was ready to be sold on store shelves. While Deep Fried Twinkies are sure to satisfy the indulgent individuals among us, they won’t likely draw in customers concerned about healthy eating. The new product from Hostess contains 9 grams of fat and 220 calories per Twinkie. This is roughly double the amount of fat that non-deep fried versions contain. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” Darren Seifer, one of NPD Group Inc’s food industry analysts, told the Associated Press. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Ellen Copaken, Hostess vice president of marketing, said that the company decided to start selling Deep Fried Twinkies in stores after seeing how popular the item was at fairs and in restaurants, USA Today notes.

Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said.

BUSINESS From the state fair to the Wal-Mart freezer: Hostess launches Deep Fried Twinkies Deep Fried Twinkies Mary Altaffer / Associated Press Hostess is launching packaged Deep Fried Twinkies, which mark its first foray into frozen foods. Hostess is launching packaged Deep Fried Twinkies, which mark its first foray into frozen foods. (Mary Altaffer / Associated Press) Associated Press The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats such as Ho Hos, is launching packaged Deep Fried Twinkies starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They'll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess' vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it's fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess' largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart.

Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don't taste good don't do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to four grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company's financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 12, 2016 11:39am   Comments Share: Related WMT Can't Wait For Black Friday? These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food (Investor's Business Daily) The ongoing trend towards healthy eating and fresh ingredients could be pushed aside and ignored for a special treat of deep-fried Twinkies. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) said in a blog post it has teamed up with Hostess Brands, the maker of Twinkies, to bring a frozen, ready-to-heat version of the deep fried treat to more than 4,000 stores nationwide by August 16. Wal-Mart's senior buyer of frozen foods John Pearson, the executive who penned the blog post, said there has always been a desire to "push the envelope on the products we offer." @Benzinga We choose both. #CatchEmAll — Hostess Snacks (@Hostess_Snacks) August 12, 2016 "So when I heard rumblings that Hostess was considering a deep-fried Twinkie, I was intrigued," Pearson said. "Not only was it something different for the frozen aisle – it filled a need, too, as we were looking to add more dessert choices to our mostly savory assortment." Pearson went on to detail the meetings with Hostess to discuss the potential of supplying the deep-fried snack. A first prototype was developed, which was a "far cry" from the final product but the "potential was evident." No one gave up and after much effort a final version is now arriving in Wal-Mart's stores. "Shopping isn't only about prices; it should also be a fun experience to try new things," Pearson concluded. "And what's more exciting than a product that was previously only available at state fairs once a year, now being up for enjoyment anytime from your freezer?"

Hot Topics: School Calendar Set 'Rumors' at LHS Kirk Cameron Event Fat Shack Opens Turkey Trot Remembring Hughes Stadium Premature Babies RH Line Police Calls Walmarts Loveland distribution center, which opened 20 years ago, remains major employer in the area By Shelley Widhalm,Loveland Reporter-Herald Posted:   12/18/2010 06:20:04 PM MST When the Walmart Distribution Center opened in Loveland 20 years ago, the 1 million-plus-square-foot facility was easily visible from I-25. Thats not the case anymore with The Ranch and several other businesses in the area of 1550 E. Crossroads Blvd. When we opened, it was us and a church and another business, said Loveland resident Bobbie Moyer, who has worked at the distribution center since it opened. Now, its hard to find us. The distribution center is one of two in Colorado and 147 nationwide. The state has 59 Supercenters, including two in Loveland, and nine discount stores, as well as 15 Sams Clubs. Moyer started and remained in the position of data processing systems operator, staying with the company because she liked the benefits and the companys stability, she said. Walmart trains you from the minute you walk in the door. You dont have to have any prior experience, Moyer said. Laura Bahlmann, also of Loveland, has been with the distribution center since its opening and, like Moyer, remained in the same position, that of distribution receiving. She works on the receiving dock, unloading, processing and labeling the freight that comes into the building. Ive always known where I stood with Walmart, Bahlmann said, adding that she likes the work she does. Its a nice stable job. ... Its nice to wake up in the morning knowing that a job is stable and there for you. Bahlmann and Moyer are among the more than 1,000 associates who work at Walmart Distribution Center 6019. Advertisement The center started with 350 associates, of which 65 still remain with the company. Why Loveland? Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which was founded in 1962, chose Loveland for the distribution center at a time when the company had no distribution centers and few stores in the western United States, said Dan Speed, general manager of the Loveland distribution center. The city stood out for its welcoming business environment and sense of community, along with its access to north-south and east-west highways for moving freight, Speed said. On its first day of business, Tuesday, Sept. 11, 1990, the Loveland distribution center shipped out 50,000 cases of products, Speed said, explaining that cases range from the size of a shoe box up to the size of a big-screen television set, he said. Today, the distribution center ships out an average of 150,000 cases a day, 24 hours a day, except for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Day. The Distribution Process Each day, the center receives truckloads of cases at the loading dock from vendors such as Tide and Proctor and Gamble. Employees scan the bar codes on the cases, 60 percent of which will be immediately shipped to the 85 stores the center serves, or shipped out the next day. The remaining 40 percent of the cases are put into inventory. The cases, which are labeled with where they are headed, are moved through the center by conveyer belt, which, if stretched out, would extend nine miles, Speed said. The cases that are shipped out fill orders the center received the night before to ensure there are no empty shelves in the Supercenters and discount centers that the distribution center serves. The Loveland center covers the general merchandise side of stores in most of Colorado and Montana, all of Wyoming and a few in Nebraska and South Dakota. It really is a competitive advantage for the company, said Dan Fogleman, spokesman for Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark. Part of the role of distribution centers is to get products to customers. We dont want merchandise in the warehouse. The distribution center conducts three operations, that of receiving and order filling, followed by shipping. Employees load the labeled products onto trucks to deliver to 21 or 22 stores at a time. The stores are organized into a batch, so that there are four batches of deliveries a day. The majority of products are in the boxes theyre received in. Some are broken down from the case, Speed said. There are certain products a store wouldnt sell a whole case of. Never Had a Layoff The distribution center has never had a layoff since it opened, has low turnover and has not had to run a help-wanted ad in more than five years, Speed said. Sixty to seventy percent of the management team came from the ranks of hourly associates, Fogleman said.

Kaiser Health News: Should Big Insurance Become Like Walmart To Lower Health Costs? Retail titan Walmart uses its market dominance to inflict “ruthless,” “brutal” and “relentless” pressure on prices charged by suppliers, business writers frequently report. What if huge health insurance companies could push down prices charged by hospitals and doctors in the same way? The idea is getting new attention as already painful health costs accelerate and major medical insurers seek to merge into three enormous firms. (Hancock, 8/11) Kaiser Health News: More Small, Midsized Firms Choose To Pay Workers’ Medical Costs Directly Instead of buying a health insurance policy to cover their workers, a growing number of small and midsized companies are opting to pay their employees’ medical claims directly, a potentially riskier practice financially called self-insuring, a recent study found. Between 2013 and 2015, the proportion of midsized companies with 100 to 499 employees that were self-insured increased 19 percent, to 30.1 percent, according to the analysis published in July by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The percentage of small firms with fewer than 100 employees that self-funded their health plans grew 7 percent, to 14.2 percent, the study found. Meanwhile, self-funding by large companies declined slightly, to 80.4 percent. (Andrews, 8/12) KQED: Fed Up With Insurance, Doctors Bolt The System To Get More Patient TimeKQED Future Of You KQED Science She’s one of a growing number of doctors who have cut loose from what she calls the “assembly-line, volume approach” and is now using a health care delivery model called direct primary care. She has scaled back the number of patients she sees and takes longer with the ones she does. She doesn’t take insurance and deals mostly in cash; she charges each time she sees a patient, but most direct primary care doctors charge a monthly fee for unlimited visits. In her previous practice, (Lorraine) Page says, the pressure to see more patients in less time wore her down, as did the need for an army of support staff to process the copious paperwork required by insurance companies. (Gorn, 8/11) Houston Chronicle: Tyler Hospital Fight With Blue Cross And Blue Shield Appears Resolved  The long and bitter fight between a struggling rural health care system and Texas' largest insurer appears over as the flagship hospital in Tyler will now be included in the carrier's in-network group plans, both parties confirmed Thursday. East Texas Medical Center captured national attention when it took the extraordinary step of suing Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas and its Chicago-based parent company last summer in state court alleging that the insurer had plunged it into financial ruin and put patients with specialized needs at risk by shutting the main hospital in Tyler out of the most common and popular group health insurance network.

Oreo makes a new flavor: Swedish Fish Oreo NEW YORK (AP)–The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Missouri, headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said.

News Opinion Commentary Column: No-brainer life lessons from the kindergarten election 2016 campaign Trump Michael Zamora / AP Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump supporter Shawn Behnken, left, and a protester confront one another outside of a rally for Trump, Friday, Aug. 5, 2016, in Des Moines, Iowa. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump supporter Shawn Behnken, left, and a protester confront one another outside of a rally for Trump, Friday, Aug. 5, 2016, in Des Moines, Iowa. (Michael Zamora / AP) Heather Wilhelm Are you depressed about the presidential election? Do Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton astound you with their weapons-grade yet quasi-comical awfulness? When you read the news of the day, do you fight an insistent urge to throw your computer out the window, chop off your hair, don some scary-looking face paint and disappear into the desert wilderness like the crabby late 19th-century writer Ambrose Bierce? Well, join the club. The Washington Post recently highlighted the despair of the nation's "Wal-Mart moms," as revealed in what may have been the most depressing focus groups in the history of mankind. Gathered in Ohio and Arizona, the participants — "most of them in their 30s and 40s, from diverse backgrounds and with household incomes mirroring the overall electorate" — compared this year's election to, among other things, "choosing which arm to cut off." The Wal-Mart moms are rightly despondent, along with the many fine Americans trying to figure out what to do in this nightmarish political year. Parents of small children, it turns out, are particularly peeved. "What can this election possibly teach our kids?" they ask. "What conclusions about the world can they possibly draw? How can I tell my children I voted for someone terrible?" Take heart: This is a hidden opportunity! Understood properly, the election of 2016 can impart some crucial life lessons to kids of all ages — and perhaps it will even deliver those same lessons to the adults who somehow missed them the first time around. (This is wildly optimistic, I know.) Read on: 10 things you might not know about Fox News Mark Jacob A sexual harassment lawsuit by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson has set off an outpouring of similar accusations against network founder Roger Ailes, leading to his ouster as CEO.

A sexual harassment lawsuit by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson has set off an outpouring of similar accusations against network founder Roger Ailes, leading to his ouster as CEO. Fox News has been the cable news viewership leader since 2002, but are its best days behind it? We report, you... (Mark Jacob) Truth can be stranger than fiction. I spent Tuesday afternoon unplugged from the news. When I logged back in at cocktail hour, I discovered that one presidential candidate had a rally featuring the grinning father of a terrorist sitting in the audience directly behind her podium, which was weird. This was quickly eclipsed, however, by the fact that another presidential candidate jokingly implied that maybe someone who likes the Second Amendment might assassinate the other presidential candidate. This is real life. It is not made up. Who says the world isn't full of mystery? It is not a good idea to joke about assassinations or people dying. "I heard about this Second Amendment joke," Paul Ryan told the press earlier this week. (Note to Ryan: Everyone has heard about Donald Trump's Second Amendment joke. EVERYONE. It was terrible, and Trump will probably ensure that it lives on for 16 more news cycles, but more on that later.) "You should never joke about something like that," Ryan continued. Well, yeah, no kidding. Most people learn this when they're around 4 years old, but it bears repeating, apparently. Meanwhile, recent footage of Ted Strickland, the Ohio Democratic Senate nominee, shows him joking that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's death "happened at a good time." Life lesson: Please don't do this. It's not that hard. Don't assume all women will cast a knee-jerk vote for Hillary Clinton Diana Sroka Rickert If you're going to vote for Hillary Clinton for president, don't do it because she's a woman. In fact, ask yourself: If a man had the same policy platform, track record and resume as Clinton, would you vote for him? There. I said it. Cue the onslaught of outrage from actress Lena Dunham, homemaking... If you're going to vote for Hillary Clinton for president, don't do it because she's a woman. In fact, ask yourself: If a man had the same policy platform, track record and resume as Clinton, would you vote for him? There. I said it. Cue the onslaught of outrage from actress Lena Dunham, homemaking... (Diana Sroka Rickert) Sometimes, it's best just to say "Sorry." Can we have a special dedication go out to all those exhausted, overworked news cycles that refused to die because Trump refused to say "sorry"? As Trump told "The Tonight Show" host Jimmy Fallon last September, "I fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong." For her part, Clinton seems to believe that merely pretending certain things didn't happen — like, say, sending classified emails from a vulnerable rogue server — substitutes for expressing regret. Attention, kids: Do not try this at home. In life, you will frequently be wrong. A little self-reflection — and an occasional, honest "I'm sorry" — will get you a long way. If you're an 11-year-old and you defend Trump's use of bad words, you'll get to appear on CNN with your mom! OK, nevermind. Please don't teach your kids this. But it did happen to young Matthew Schricker, a robust Trump supporter who also managed to heckle Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, at a North Carolina rally. If past trends regarding child political prognosticators hold true, a hemp-wearing Matthew will passionately lead the world's largest Bernie Sanders/Occupy Wall Street rally to date in downtown Seattle in the spring of 2021. There is no man — or woman! — behind the curtain. "Fortunately," as singer Willie Nelson once said, "we are not in control." Herein lies one of the weirdest discoveries a young person can make: The world may be run by grown-ups, but many of them are just as clueless as kids! There is no vastly competent "man behind the curtain." Most of us are winging it; some adults are just better at hiding that fact than others. If our hapless leading presidential candidates don't bring that point home — along with the importance of limiting the power of government and politicians — I don't know who will.

CLOUD, Fla. - An investigation is being conducted to determine why a uniformed police officer was denied service at a Walmart in Florida. >> Read more trending stories Authorities and Walmart confirmed that the officer walked into the St. Cloud Walmart on 13th Street, grabbed what he needed and then headed for the checkout. The officer told a friend the cashier pointed to her skin color and told him she wouldn't ring up his items. The officer also told that friend that a second employee laughed at the way the officer was treated. Uproar began brewing a week ago, when a man posted in a community Facebook group saying he wanted to know if the story he heard about the officer was a rumor. The responses to the man's post poured in, with some saying they saw it happen. Later, a friend of the officer joined the thread to say it was true. "This is an unfortunate situation, but we cannot comment on an active HR investigation," Walmart's corporate office told WFTV. © 2016 Cox Media Group.

Similar to the Scottish favorite the deep-fried Mars bar, this latest vanilla-cream offering has nine grams of fat and 220 calories compared to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie.  A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride to work off the snack, according to Amy Gorin, a New Jersey-based nutritionist. Hostess is launching Deep Fried Twinkies for the first time today at $4.76 for a box of seven. Pictured, chef Wayne Rosenbaum spreads chocolate sauce on a freshly deep-fried Twinkie he makes at his store in New York Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan.  It has a 'retro cool factor,' says Ellen Copaken, Hostess' vice president of marketing. 'It plays into the comfort food trend. And it's fun.' The Twinkie, long one of Hostess' largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next What a guy! Head chef at a $240-a-head fine dining... 'It's inhumane': Workers at Tyson Foods plants caught on... Share this article Share Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer.  The Wal-Mart food lab at the company's Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time.   'Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,' said Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart.  Similar to the Scottish favorite the deep-fried Mars bar, this latest vanilla-cream offering has nine grams of fat and 220 calories compared to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride to work off the snack, according to Amy Gorin, a New Jersey-based nutritionist 'But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don't taste good don't do well.'  Twinkies were invented in 1930 by Illinois baker James Alexander Dewar, but the Hostess brand has not always been secure.  Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. UK expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs.  Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells their own version for $3 each, excluding tax. EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW TWINKIE  NUTRITION: The vanilla-cream version has 220 calories, nine grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. A regular Twinkie has 130 calories, four grams of fat and 14 grams of sugar.   WORKING IT OFF: A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to run for 20 minutes at 10 mph, take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride, says Amy Gorin, a Jersey City, New Jersey-based registered dietitian-nutritionist. HOW IT IS MADE: A regular Twinkie is coated with a cake funnel batter and then proceeds through an oil bath to ensure the batter adheres. The Twinkies are immediately frozen and packaged. HOME PREPARATION: Pull it out of the freezer and bake it for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for two-and-a-half to three minutes.  THE PRICE: $4.76 per box of seven. For comparison, New York-based hot-dog joint Papaya King sells its own fresh deep-fried treats for $3 each, excluding tax. DISTRIBUTION: The Deep Fried Twinkies will be available starting Friday, August 12, at Wal-Mart only for three months. After that, they will be available at other stores. Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, says the treat could be marketed abroad. Twinkies were invented in 1930 by Illinois baker James Alexander Dewar, but the Hostess brand has not always been secure  Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million 'We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,' Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. 'The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.'  'The original samples were pretty good,' said John Pearson, Wal-Mart's senior buyer for frozen foods. 'But the batter was a little lumpy.'  'It's really good. It's delicious,' said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, was not excited after trying it.  'I like the original Twinkie,' she said. 'This is a step too far.'  Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells the snacks for $3 each, excluding tax, and they are faring better than the deep-fried Oreos Share or comment on this article e-mail 120 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

(Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP) 86 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK - The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos.  (Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP) “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Missouri, headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said. A look at Hostess’ new “Deep Fried Twinkies” NEW YORK - A look at Hostess’ “Deep Fried Twinkies”: HOW IT’S MADE: A regular Twinkie is coated with a cake funnel batter and then proceeds through an oil bath to ensure the batter adheres. The Twinkies are immediately frozen and packaged. HOME PREPARATION: Pull it out of the freezer and bake it for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for two-and-a-half to three minutes. THE PRICE: $4.76 per box of seven. For comparison, New York-based hot-dog joint Papaya King sells its own fresh deep-fried treats for $3 each, excluding tax. DISTRIBUTION: The Deep Fried Twinkies will be available starting Friday, Aug. 12, at Wal-Mart only for three months. After that, they will be available at other stores. Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, says the treat could be marketed abroad. NUTRITION: The vanilla-cream version has 220 calories, nine grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. A regular Twinkie has 130 calories, four grams of fat and 14 grams of sugar. In comparison, a Starbucks Carmel Frappuccino has 420 calories, 15 grams of fat and 66 grams of sugar. WORKING IT OFF: A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to run for 20 minutes at 10 mph, take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride, says Amy Gorin, a Jersey City, New Jersey-based registered dietitian-nutritionist. LIMITED-TIME TWINKIES: In December, Hostess teamed up with Wal-Mart on a limited-time mint-chocolate flavored cake.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) NEW YORK, N.Y. - Wal-Mart opened a 12,000-square-foot culinary and innovation centre at its headquarters in June as a place where the nation's largest food retailer can work with major suppliers to come up with new food ideas, and develop ideas on its own to bolster its store-brand selection. Here's a peek at the food lab: WHAT IT IS: The centre has 10 test kitchens including a studio-style chef's kitchen and replicas of the bakery and deli kitchens found in most of its stores. It has stoves, ovens and microwaves so the staff can cook the same ways customers do at home. There's also a sensory lab where Wal-Mart can collect feedback from customers and employees, who answer questions about the texture, saltiness or sweetness of a food or beverage. The facility follows a similar lab at the company's Sam's Club headquarters, which opened a few years ago. WHY IT MATTERS: Wal-Mart derives 56 per cent of its total sales from food and other grocery items. The company also accounts for about 25 per cent of the overall U.S. grocery business. Since customers might shop for food several times a week, it's critical to get food items right to build loyalty. In the past, Wal-Mart had tested products at kitchens throughout its headquarters, but that effort was limited and the feedback it provided was fairly general. Now, Wal-Mart gets specific feedback from customers that it can share with suppliers to help decide if an item is ready or needs changes. That collaboration saves money and cuts several months off a product launch, which can last a year from idea to an item landing on store shelves. WHAT'S NEXT: Wal-Mart is testing frozen stuffed doughnut bites as well as new flavours for its Clear American Ice store brand sparkling water and Paleo meals that are vacuum-packed. The Clear American Ice pineapple-orange flavour arrives in stores in September. The Paleo meals and the doughnut bites will be in the stores in October.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       In this Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2016, photo, Papaya King president Wayne Rosenbaum spreads chocolate sauce on a freshly deep-fried Twinkie at the flagship store in New York.

USA TODAY A sign hangs on the side of a Macy's at Upper Valley Mall in Springfield, OH on February 4, 2015. (Photo: Maddie McGarvey for USA TODAY) Retailers continue to face a challenging environment in 2016, with Macy's becoming only the latest top name to announce a wave of store closings this year. Macy's (M) said it will close 100 of its 675 full-line locations amid falling profitability. The department-store chain is only one in a list that ranges widely from specialty apparel to sporting goods. USA TODAY Macy's to close 100 stores as big-box retailer shrinks further Among the top retailers closing stores in 2016 so far: Sports Authority: 460 stores shutting down The struggling sporting goods store chain is in the process of closing all of its 460 stores. The retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March and originally planned to close about 140 stores, but is now completely folding after attempting to restructure debt. No offers were made at an auction from buyers willing to keep any stores open. Dick's Sporting Goods bought Sports Authority's intellectual property and some leases for $15 million. Sports Authority launched a massive going-out of business sale that is expected to be completed this month, according to documents. Sports Authority cited online competition as a key factor in its demise. USA TODAY Sports Authority shutting down with giant going-out-of-business sale Walmart: Closing 269 stores, including 154 U.S. locations  The world's largest retailer said in January that it was closing 269 stores around the world as it refocuses on its supercenters and e-commerce business. The closures include 154 U.S. locations and all of its Express format stores that are smaller and designed to compete against so called dollar stores. The closures were decided based on financial performance and how well the locations fit with Walmart's broader strategy, the company said. Walmart has nearly 11,600 stores worldwide and plans to open more than 300 stores in the fiscal year. Walmart (WMT) is attempting to aggressively grow its e-commerce business and compete with Amazon.com. The retailer announced this week that is was buying thee-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3 billion. USA TODAY List of the 154 U.S. stores Walmart is closing Aeropostale: 154 stores closing The apparel retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May and announced it was closing 113 of its 739 U.S. stores and all 41 of its stores in Canada. Aeropostale said 117 of the stores set to close are not profitable and were responsible for $17 million in losses in 2015, according to a court filing. The retailer was facing intense competition in the teen retail environment by the likes of fast-fashion brands H&M and Forever 21. USA TODAY Will your Aeropostale close? Here's the list Kmart/Sears: 78 stores closing Sears Holdings (SHLD) announced in April that it will close 68 Kmart stores and 10 Sears stores this summer as the struggling retailer continues to weed out unprofitable locations. The April announcement came after the company accelerated  the closure of 50 stores at the start of the year. The retailer faces multiple challenges from home-improvement chains like Lowe's and Home Depot continue to chip away at appliance sales and Target and other fast-fashion brands when it comes to apparel. And the closings come amid the backdrop of Amazon.com dominating online sales. Critics claim many Kmart and Sears stores are dated and uninspiring in this hyper-competitive retail environment. USA TODAY List: 78 Sears, Kmart stores closing Ralph Lauren: Closing at least 50 stores  The retailer founded by fashion icon Ralph Lauren said in June that is plans to close at least 50 stores and cut about 1,000 employees as it attempts to cut costs and create a leaner business. Ralph Lauren (RL) stores have been suffering from falling sales and profits as it struggles to keep up with fast-changing retail trends and new style preferences. 7196 CONNECTTWEET 889 LINKEDIN 47 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2b8w7rY

For the largest retailer on the planet, even this multi-billion dollar acquisition might not be enough to restore momentum to the company's e-commerce strategy. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Aug 11, 2016 at 5:32PM Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shocked the retail world when it announced that it had acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion. The deal gives the big box store access to new technology, as well as the upstart online retailer's CEO Marc Lore, who will take over the company's complete e-commerce operation. It's a move that makes the No. 1 physical retailer the clear No. 2 in the online space. That said, Wal-Mart was already second to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and this move may not actually bring it much closer to the top. On this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Vincent Shen is joined by Fool.com contributor Daniel Kline as they discuss whether Marc Lore and the innovative technology at Jet.com will be enough to tip the scales for a company with annual revenue approaching half a trillion dollars. They also cover the drivers behind the deal and the stalling momentum of Wal-Mart's previous e-commerce efforts. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Aug. 9, 2016. Vincent Shen: Previously, with Lore's older venture with Quidsi, for example, I think a really loyal shopper following that he had was among younger urban shoppers. Then with Jet.com, they've been spending, like, $20 or $25 million a month advertising. A lot of that's targeting not only millennials, but they're trying to basically generate more repeat shoppers. I think I have some data from Slice and BI Intelligence dating back to February that indicated Jet.com was having a hard time generating repeat business -- over two-thirds of their sales were coming from new customers. You mentioned the 400,000 people signing up, or essentially shopping with them, with each month. It's just interesting to kind of see that dynamic there. Daniel Kline: The problem they come up against is Amazon has -- and I don't know the recent number -- but it's roughly 225 million credit cards on file. However, many 63 -- something like that -- million Prime members, they don't share the numbers, so it's always a guess. They've made the process so easy that I buy on Amazon from my phone; I can buy things verbally from my Echo. As an Amazon customer, why would I switch? Because diapers are $0.02 less? I don't need diapers. Any device I was going to buy, anything, if Amazon is within the ballpark, I'm not going to shop around. Maybe I'll jump on Jet.com and buy a TV because it's $100 cheaper, but I'm probably not going to switch. That's a very, very difficult behavior for any new company to win over. I would think that an awful lot of Amazon customers just find it a little bit cooler to buy from Amazon than to buy from Walmart. They can be No. 2. If they're trying to be No. 2, they can be a bigger No. 2, but this is like me challenging for the heavyweight championship; it's not going to work out well. Shen: With all that in mind, I'm a little skeptical as you are just based on the price tag. Three hundred million dollars in cash, $30 million in Walmart stock, and I think a lot of that is going to be dedicated -- it's basically incentives for management. Three-hundred million; sorry about that. Kline: In stock. Shen: Yeah, in stock. Kline: And three billion in cash. Shen: Exactly. For Walmart, their e-commerce efforts in their physical year 2015, they were seeing some pretty strong progress. Year over year, quarterly growth was anywhere from 21% to 27%. Then the following year, so last year, in their fiscal 2016, it kind of started to fall from the high teens to below 10%. In the most-recent quarter, it came in at just 7% globally. That deceleration definitely has people concerned because it's lagging even the broad economy, where e-commerce is, I think, still growing double-digit rates every quarter. Kline: They need to catch up to Amazon in terms of fulfillment. If you buy anything from Amazon, it is going to show up in two days, including on Sunday. Walmart doesn't even promise that. I think they'll sell it to you for an extra price. The days when you place an order and it takes three-to-five shipping days, Amazon has created a new standard, and people have proven willing. I'll buy batteries from Amazon because I could wait 48 hours with my remote control not working. I'm not going to wait a week. That's really where Walmart has to catch up, and Jet can help with that. This will make the Walmart customer have a better experience on Walmart.com and on Jet.com after six months, a year of integration, but I don't see it winning over new business. This may help them as they lose sales in the store to their own website fulfill, and keep those customers happy. That is an important step. Shen: Something else that I wanted to mention, too, is I'm curious to see how they blend, how it really impacts Walmart, because I know they -- I think it's called their shipping pass where you basically pay a flat fee for the year and you get two-day shipping -- and this is really just very similar to Prime to be more competitive with Amazon with those really incredible fulfillment speeds, and how they kind of blend that with the fact that Jet.com has some of this infrastructure, some of this technology in terms of optimizing and making as cheap as possible for their shoppers and the smart cart and everything. Kline: That's why I say, it ultimately has to be one brand. It seems crazy to me that you would make Jet.com the online version of Walmart, so that's not going to happen. Eventually, this will become a Walmart.com powered by Jet, and then Jet will be down in the corner -- and then Jet won't exist anymore. Hopefully, they can integrate the technology because if they do, they have to get faster. Walmart has an incredible network. Amazon has its warehouses, but Walmart has a store in most of the country, something like every five miles. Their ability to ship to stores, to ship to you from a store, if they can figure that out, and obviously there's a lot of programming and algorithms, we've talked before about how Amazon knows what you're going to buy in a local warehouse before you order it. If Walmart can figure that out and Jet helps them, then maybe they bridge some of that shipping divide, and that will at least stop them from bleeding customers just because Amazon can get things faster. Shen: I have to say, I just have to admit that I'm a little curious, too, to see you have this small upstart company just hitting about $1 billion in their gross merchandise volume in their first, they've launched July 2015, so just about a year of existence, has Amazon kind of paying attention, at the very least. Walmart jumps in -- huge resources. I'm really curious to see where things go even if the price tag may be a little high. Maybe hopes are a little too high; but overall, definitely an interesting deal. Kline: It's definitely possible that this gets Walmart back on the growth path from ramping down to ramping up, but I think Amazon is watching this and laughing. This is not a competitor. This is my little league team challenging the Red Sox. It's not going to do that, but they can become a better No. 2. The other thing they can do is crowd out some of the other players. If I'm Amazon, I'm not worried. If I'm Target, I'm a little bit nervous. If I'm Kohl's, maybe I'm nervous. This is sort of Walmart saying, "We're in second place, let's consolidate." And almost any price is worth it to do that. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The baby’s father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday, said police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, including six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit in Philadelphia. On Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex in Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. The toll began rising in the 1990s with the passing of laws requiring that young children be placed in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries. With the children strapped into the backseat, drivers can forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars has fluctuated, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cell phone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn’t show up, she said. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Father arrested in deaths of twin girls found in hot car had been drinking: police Children's Aid Society says 'good parents in a hurry' tend to leave kids in hot cars The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday, said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. Temperatures in the area hovered around 38 C much of the afternoon. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed in the case. The name of the infant's father has not been released by authorities. The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office on Saturday identified the infant as six-month-old Dillon Martinez from San Antonio. Helotes police had initially said the infant was seven months old. Number of child hot car deaths continue to rise According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and data collected by San Jose State University, the number of children dying of heat stroke in automobiles began to rise following the widespread introduction of passenger-side airbags in the 1990s. An increase in airbag related fatalities of children in front seats prompted parents to buckle their children in rear seats, but while airbag-related fatalities began to decrease by 2000, the number of children dying of heat stroke rose due to children in back seats being less noticeable to parents and caregivers, according to researchers at San Jose State University. Baby found locked in hot car in Markham, Ont., parking lot With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, says founder of U.S. child safety non-profit. (Fred Beckham/Associated Press) This year, on Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex near Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. The temperature inside a parked car on a 32-degree day will reach 48 C in 20 minutes and 56 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said. © The Associated Press, 2016 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Latest Video Allied gets 3 out of 5 stars 4:11 Ellen DeGeneres pulls off mannequin challenge at White House 0:33 Moana gets 4 out of 5 stars 5:20 Ellen DeGeneres gets teary as Obama presents medal 0:56 Most Viewed Japan hit by earthquake considered an aftershock of 2011 Fukushima disaster Trump says he will pull U.S. out of TPP on 1st day in office read comments How Trump's son-in-law could skirt nepotism laws and find his way into the White House read comments Trump's strategy of bypassing the media raises 'danger signs' read comments 'Hail Trump' shout draws Nazi salutes at alt-right group meeting read comments Trump eyes Romney, Mattis for top cabinet jobs Rare thunderstorm asthma kills 4 in Australia Trump lukewarm about prosecuting Clinton, condemns alt-right group in Times interview read comments School bus driver charged after children killed in crash Mike Pence fights public release of Indiana emails Right Communications The National Canada's destination for original journalism and stories with added depth and context.

(KTRK) KTRK Saturday, August 13, 2016 SAN ANTONIO, TX (KTRK) -- A 7-month-old baby died in a hot car Friday in a San Antonio Walmart parking lot. The child's hot car death is the sixth one in Texas this year. It's also the 26th hot car death this year nationwide. RELATED: Mom of twins who died in hot car apologizes Police said the baby's father, who is a Walmart employee, told police he forgot to take the baby to day care before he got to work around 6:15 a.m. When the father went out to his car, he made the tragic discovery. RELATED: Child left in hot car while parents were in church dies Police say they arrived to find the father leaned over the baby. They said it was obvious nothing could be done and that the baby had died. TranStar launched a PSA this week encouraging drivers to create habits so they don't leave their children behind. In the PSA, you see a man take off his shoes before getting into the car. Once he arrives at his destination he puts the shoes back on. The idea is, once he arrives he had to put his shoes on to get out of the car, thus, triggering a reminder that there is also a child in the backseat. "How many times have we all been driving somewhere and habits kick in and we go our normal path and then suddenly we find ourselves going, oh I'm not supposed to be here. I'm supposed to be there, that's how the tragedy occurs. People get distracted," said Harris County Judge Ed Emmett. RELATED: Police break window to rescue child from hot car The father was taken to a hospital for observation after complaining of chest pain. No charges have been filed at this time.

This actually wasn’t my goal when I bought a $12 bookshelf from Wal-Mart. I only bought it because a) it was super cheap; b) it wasn’t that heavy, so I could pick it up myself; and c) I really just needed a bookshelf to support the giant stacks of books currently just sitting on the floor in my room. Racey Burden I’m addicted to buying books. It’s a problem. Anyway, so I brought the faux-oak finish, black bookshelf home and discovered that I didn’t feel motivated to put it together myself. I did the only thing to do in such a situation and recruited my brother, Ridge, to help. It immediately became clear that neither of us knew what we were doing. Also, this bookshelf was hideous, and clearly not made of real wood. I hated it but decided to proceed anyway because my books looked so sad on the floor. Neither Ridge nor I have an abundance of patience, apparent by the fact we soon gave up on the instructions (confusing, and solely in picture form) and began doing whatever we wanted. We didn’t like the plastic screws provided with the shelf. Ridge put real, metal screws in. It broke chunks of the “wood” off. We were getting impatient trying to fit the pieces together as described. I poured Gorilla Glue on and started sticking the shelves together that way. Didn’t feel like waiting on the Gorilla Glue to dry? We let it go and watched the whole shelf crumble apart. In the end, we only ever had two pieces of a seven-piece shelf together at once. I don’t think we touched half the little nails and screws that came with the piece of junk. I grew bored of the project before Ridge did, but I could tell he was only trying to fix the shelf because I’d asked him for his help. The Burden men have this thing about always fixing stuff for people. They’re stubborn like that. Eventually, I told him to give it up. The shelf was clearly a lost cause, chipped and covered in dried glue, plastic screws broken everywhere, now lost to the carpet. It wasn’t meant to be handled as viciously as we had. Fake wood is apparently not made to hold up under a real hammer. Who knew? Not us. We surveyed the wreckage in silence. Finally, I said, “Well, it was only $12, so …” “Do you want to burn it?” Ridge asked. Oh, absolutely I wanted to burn it. Another Burden hereditary trait – we all have a bit of pyromania. So we lugged the bookshelf outside to our utility vehicle and loaded it in the back. Then we drove out to Ridge’s bonfire pit in the back field (like I said, we like to burn stuff). But guilt soon overcame me, and I put a stop to the party. “We’d have to call the sheriff’s office to report it,” I told him. “You’re not supposed to burn without letting them know.” (I only know that thanks to this job and all the unreported fire calls I hear on scanner, and I did not want the Decatur Fire Department to come to our house.) “Are you serious?” he griped, but stopped before pouring the gasoline on the discarded shelves. In the end, we left it. It’s still out there, probably rotting away however faux-wood rots, waiting for us to actually burn it. I think Ridge has forgiven me for putting a stop to his fun, though I haven’t asked. It’s obviously a sign that Ridge loves me that he was willing to spend an hour-and-a-half attempting to put together a crappy bookshelf, only to not even be permitted to light it on fire at the end. Sorry, bud. Soon. Soon. Racey Burden is a Messenger reporter and the oldest of the three Burden siblings. Leave a Reply.

The Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office identified the child as 6-month-old Dillon Martinez, son of Trinidad Martinez, who is an employee of the Helotes store. The father was supposed to drop the child off at day care before he began work at 6:15 a.m. on Friday. RELATED: Baby found dead in vehicle at Helotes parking lot When the father returned to the car in the afternoon, when temperatures reached the low 100s, he found the infant dead. Helotes police continued interviewing store employees on Saturday. “This is a very active investigation,” said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burgess. “There are no charges filed, but that is not saying there will not be any. “We have to look at every angle — we don’t want to jump to any conclusions,” Burgess said.

(Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images) Chris Hondros Copyright Getty Images Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next HELOTES, Texas (AP) — A 7-month-old boy died after being left all day in a hot sport utility vehicle in a San Antonio-area Wal-Mart parking lot, authorities said. His death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, including six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. That's up from last year's total of 15. The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday, said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and data collected by San Jose State University, the number of children dying of heat stroke in automobiles began to rise following the widespread introduction of passenger-side air bags in the 1990s. An increase in air-bag related fatalities of children in front seats prompted parents to buckle their children in rear seats, but while air bag-related fatalities began to decrease by 2000, the number of children dying of heat stroke rose due to children in back seats being less noticeable to parents and caregivers, according to researchers at San Jose State University. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. This year, on Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office identified the child as 6-month-old Dillon Martinez, son of Trinidad Martinez, who is an employee of the Helotes store. The father was supposed to drop the child off at day care before he began work at 6:15 a.m. on Friday. RELATED: Baby found dead in vehicle at Helotes parking lot When the father returned to the car in the afternoon, when temperatures reached the low 100s, he found the infant dead. Helotes police continued interviewing store employees on Saturday. “This is a very active investigation,” said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burgess. “There are no charges filed, but that is not saying there will not be any. “We have to look at every angle — we don’t want to jump to any conclusions,” Burgess said.

The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6.15am Friday, said Helotes police Captain Anthony Burges.  The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3pm. Firefighters reported the father was visibly distraught while leaning over the child, who had been declared deceased. A seven-month-old boy died after being left all day in a hot SUV in the parking lot of a Helotes, Texas, Walmart (pictured), where his father worked The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. Officials said the father was cooperating with police until he 'locked up', which they said was likely due to shock, according to the Houston Chronicle.   No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Reality show mom, 62, appears in court after her... White mother whose daughter, 2, died in hot car will NOT... Share this article Share On August 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia.  When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. The toll began rising sharply in the 1990s with the passing of laws requiring that young children be placed in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries.  The death of the boy in Helotes brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27 (stock image of children who have died in hot cars) With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998.  The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell.  Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help.  Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Aug 13, 2016 at 11:27AM Target will once again sell Amazon.com gadgets on its website and at its stores. Image source: Courtney Boyd Myers via Flickr. In the staring contest between Target (NYSE:TGT) and Amazon.com, (NASDAQ:AMZN), it was Target that blinked first. Four years after dropping the internet retailer's gadgets from its stores, the brick-and-mortar retailer is restocking Amazon products. Shoppers can now buy Amazon Kindles, Fire sticks, and tablets on Target's website, and by October will be able to pick them up in stores. The enemy of your enemy is not your friend The move to drop Amazon made sense at the time. While Target wanted to give its customers access to a broad array of popular items, it belatedly realized the e-commerce leader was really a wolf in sheep's clothing. The products weren't providing the same kind of margin an iPad did, and gave consumers easier access to Amazon's own website where they could make purchases. Target decided that helping the enemy was not in its best interests. While Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) also woke to that realization and quickly followed Target's lead, the move to drop Amazon was part of a broader play by Target to separate itself from the one competitor that hurt it most. Not only was the retailer not going to carry Amazon's products, it also took away its e-commerce technology platform, order fulfillment network, and guest services operations from Amazon's web services, choosing instead to build out its own platform ahead of the 2011 Christmas holidays. Not that anyone thought the decision to dump Amazon was going to hurt the internet retailer, even if it made sense to not actively support the competition. But it's a tactic the internet retailer has used before to get its nose under a rival's tent and exploit the opportunity. Locking up customers everywhere they shop Amazon Lockers make it convenient for customers to purchase items and pick them up at a time and location that is convenient for them, and it installed hundreds of Click & Collect lockers in places like campus bookstores and convenience stores. Office supplies retailer Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and electronics shop Radio Shack also signed on, believing much like Target that they were providing their customers a service. If someone bought something on Amazon and picked it up at a local Staples, maybe they'd also buy a ream of paper while they were in the store. But what they quickly found was that they were simply giving Amazon more sales and weren't realizing much if any benefit from the increased foot traffic. Both Staples and Radio Shack dropped out of the experiment. Target's decision to restock Amazon gadgets is different though because customers can still buy a Kindle just about anywhere. Although Best Buy almost went out of business due to customers "show rooming" products in their stores before buying them on Amazon, it continued to carry the gadgets. And they're virtually available anywhere anyway, as you can even pick them up at a Bed Bath & Beyond store. Heck, even Staples carries them. Target customers will once again be able to fill their shopping carts with Amazon gadgets as the mass merchandiser realized it was only cutting its own nose off by not stocking them. Image source: Mike Mozart via Flickr. So Target wasn't so much hurting Amazon by not carrying them, but was cutting its own nose off to spite its face. By not having them in stock, it was forcing its customers to shop elsewhere for them, customers who might otherwise have shopped its stores. In the four years since Target and Wal-Mart dropped the gadgets, the ability with which consumers can switch their allegiance to a retailer has only gotten easier. If they can't find a product in one location they'll shop someplace else. And because Amazon's Prime membership has become so prevalent with some 45 million households, it's become immaterial whether Target carries it or not so the retailer likely believes it may as well make it as convenient as possible for its customers. It is the internet Of course, Amazon has grown exponentially over time and being cut off did nothing to staunch its growth. Net sales went from $48 billion in 2011 to $89 billion last year, a near-17% compounded annual growth rate, while Target's revenues, in comparison, went from $69 billion five years ago to $74 billion in 2015, or less than 2% compounded growth annually. Wal-Mart's sales also grew 2% a year. While being kicked out of Target stores obviously didn't hurt Amazon, reintroduction to the retailer's 1,800 stores can only help. And if Wal-Mart follows suit, it would net it even millions of more potential customers who would be exposed to its lineup of gadgets (though Wal-Mart's $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com suggests it only plans on competing harder against Amazon, not retreating). Target, though, was caught in a tough place, and as smart as the move may have been in 2011, Friday's decision is equally on point. As the saying goes, it pays to keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday, said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. On Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. The toll began rising sharply in the 1990s with the passing of laws requiring that young children be placed in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said. ←Older Newer→ Updated : 2016-11-24 03:18 GMT+08:00 MOST POPULAR Strasbourg's Christmas market at Taipei 101 20 Thanksgiving dining options in Taipei Thailand waives visa fee for Taiwan, 18 nations Taipei high school opens first gender-neutral restrooms in Taiwan Canadian man savagely beats Taiwanese girlfriend on Taipei street Meet Hualien's Famous British Barber Google Map of Taiwan's Demolished and Burned Cultural Assets Taiwanese woman opts for 'Stateless' over being branded 'Chinese' on Iceland ID Torrential rain warnings issued for northern Taiwan Current foreign workers program outdated and unreasonable: KMT lawmaker About Us Contact Us Taiwan News © 2016 All Rights Reserved.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen A south Okanagan RV park owner is speaking out about a tradition that has been taking a bite out of businesses like his for many years: free overnight parking at a local supercentre. Harvey Anweiler is part owner of South Beach Gardens RV Park and Campground in Penticton. Harvey Anweiler is the owner of the South Beach Gardens RV Park and Campground in Penticton. Story continues below He says for years, he’s faced tough competition, not from other campsites but from the Walmart parking lot.  Each day, RVs from all over pull in, to take advantage of the free overnight parking. The RV community has long known about an open door policy at Walmart parking lots. The company’s own website confirms that RV’ers are allowed to stay on Walmart properties overnight if they are given approval by store management and if it does not interfere with other ordinances. “It’s hard to compete against free parking,” Anweiler said. What the RV’ers in the Penticton Walmart parking lot might not realize is that overnight parking does interfere with the City of Penticton’s bylaws. “Well in terms of our zoning, we don’t allow overnight camping in commercial spaces,” Mayor of Penticton Andrew Jakubeit said. Jakubeit said the city has received numerous complaints, and plans to take action. Its going to help Walmart install bigger signs indicating the bylaw restrictions; then bylaw officers will start handing out warnings. “So it’s a little bit of an education process and I think that’s the first step,” Jakubeit said. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

HPD Capt. Anthony Burgess said the 6-month-old boy was discovered when the father, a Wal-Mart employee who reported to work at 6:15 a.m., went to his vehicle in the employee parking area. Temperatures in Helotes around the time of the discovery was in the low 100s. RELATED: 10 charged in synthetic marijuana ring in Austin Witnesses flagged down two officers in a cul-de-sac down the street at about the same time 911 calls began coming in from others at about 3:12 p.m, Burgess said. Officers saw the father was visibly upset as he was leaning over the infant, who firefighters confirmed was deceased. The father told investigators he was supposed to have taken his son to day care before work.

No more trips to the state fair, no more pots of hot oil on the stove. The company is partnering with Walmart to debut frozen Deep Fried Twinkies this Monday, August 15. Just grab one out of the freezer, throw it in the oven, and voila: a cream-filled, deep-fried gut bomb. We may be doomed as a society. Walmart has announced it will exclusively carry an "Original Golden" version of the sugar-packed snack for three to six months, and it will offer a chocolate version for a year. The Twinkies will be available at more than 4,000 of the company's stores across the country. What once was perhaps a rare treat is about to become an everyday snack for many Americans. When people are bored on the couch, they'll be able to mindlessly eat a Deep Fried Twinkie. Walmart boasts as much in a post on its official blog. "And what's more exciting than a product that was previously only available at state fairs once a year, now being up for enjoyment anytime from your freezer?" Yet another advancement in junk food technology. Hopefully the exercise and health care industries can keep up. • Sweet!

Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged "Deep Fried Twinkies" starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They'll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. ___ Tepid retail sales lower expectations for US economic growth WASHINGTON (AP) — A sluggish month of retail spending has tempered expectations for the U.S. economy's growth in the coming months. Consumers pulled back on shopping and eating out in July after three straight solid monthly gains, the government said Friday. Those declines were offset by increases in auto sales and online and catalogue sales. Many economists credited the surge in online and catalogue spending, which rose 1.3 per cent, mainly to deals offered during Amazon's "Prime Day" on July 12. Amazon said its sales rose 60 per cent on Prime Day compared with a year earlier. ___ US stock indexes edge mostly lower; oil rises Wall Street capped a record-setting week with a day of mostly listless trading Friday that left the three major U.S. stock indexes essentially flat. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index closed slightly lower. The Nasdaq composite eked out a tiny gain, giving the tech-heavy index its fourth record-high close in a week. Investors mostly focused on the latest batch of company earnings from retailers and other companies, as well as new data indicating that U.S. retail sales in July were more sluggish than expected. ___ J.C. Penney reports smaller quarterly loss as sales improve NEW YORK (AP) — After a tough start to the year, J.C. Penney's business enjoyed a bounce in the second quarter, fueled by efforts to bring back appliances and spruce up other sections of the store. The Plano, Texas-based department store chain reported a smaller loss for the second quarter compared to a year earlier as sales improved. CEO Marvin Ellison believes the company can maintain the momentum with a slew of new brands and other enticements coming in the next few months. In addition to its own efforts, Penney is benefiting from store closings by Macy's and Sears Holdings Inc. Ellison told analysts Friday the company has seen sales improve in malls where its rivals shuttered their stores. ___ 3 years into nation's hemp experiment, crop's future is hazy PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) — Three years into the nation's hemp experiment, a 20-acre farm in southern Colorado exemplifies the crop's hazy potential. Hemp could be enormously profitable, but right now there are just as many questions as answers for Will and Ally Cabaniss, two Florida natives who moved to southern Colorado to embark on the hemp business. "Every day brings something new and different," said Will Cabaniss, holding up a red plastic cup containing a hemp seedling awaiting planting. "Right now we're just building data for the industry, seeing what works and what doesn't." ___ Fox News names Abernethy, Shine as co-presidents NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News Channel founder Rupert Murdoch on Friday appointed two longtime Fox executives as the new co-presidents of the news network as it restructures after last month's departure of Roger Ailes following sexual harassment allegations. Both Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine were with Fox News when it started in 1996. Shine, who had been one of Ailes' top deputies, will run the editorial operations for Fox News and its sister Fox Business Network. Abernethy had left the news channel to run Fox's stable of 28 local stations and he'll keep that job, while overseeing the business operations of the two networks. Both will report to Murdoch, who will continue to oversee things as executive chairman. The moves sent a signal to Fox News viewers that despite a scandal that has widened since Ailes' resignation, they shouldn't worry that their favourite network is abandoning them. ___ Chinese auto sales accelerate in July BEIJING (AP) — China's auto sales growth accelerated in July, an industry group said Friday, while General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. reported record demand for the month. Sales in the world's biggest auto market rose 26.3 per cent to 1.6 million units, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 23 per cent to 1.8 million units. Sales of SUVs, whose explosive popularity has helped to buoy demand as other categories sagged, soared 47.4 per cent to 580,000 vehicles. ___ South Korea to review toxins data disclosure process SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea plans to review if there was any negligence in the government's handling of sick workers' inquiries about workplace toxins, after an Associated Press investigation found the government repeatedly withheld such information following requests from Samsung. Ko Dong-woo, a director at the Labor Ministry, said Friday that the ministry took the AP report seriously and would ensure officials properly evaluate information requests from workers seeking government compensation for work-related illnesses. ___ China reports weaker July activity but says economy stable BEIJING (AP) — Chinese factory output and other economic activity weakened in July, data showed Friday, but an official tried to reassure companies and investors growth is stable. Growth in retail sales, factory output and investment all decelerated from June levels, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Private sector analysts have warned economic growth, which held steady at 6.7 per cent for the three months ending in June, was showing signs of weakening heading into the current quarter. The data indicate "the third quarter has started off on a weak footing," said Brian Jackson of IHS Markit in a report. ___ Smiley faces at small company making popular emoji apps Mobile apps that allow users to create their own emojis or share the stylized images of NBA star Stephen Curry and other celebrities are paying off for a small upstate New York company. Moji Maker— with its mix-and-match menu of happy, angry or goofy faces — was the No. 2 paid app on the iTunes chart as of Friday morning. The company that made it, Moji, recently scored big with its Curry app and is following up with similarly styled apps for two Olympic athletes who won gold this week: swimmer Michael Phelps and gymnast Simone Biles. ___ Security experts: Remotes are hackable on many vehicles FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — A group of computer security experts say they figured out how to hack the keyless entry systems used on millions of cars, meaning that thieves could in theory break and steal items without leaving a broken window. The experts say that remote entry systems on millions of cars made by Volkswagen since 1995 can be cloned to permit unauthorized access to the car's interior. The same experts say another system used by other brands including Ford, General Motor's Opel and Chevrolet and Renault can also be defeated. ___ The Dow fell 37.05 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 18,576.47. The S&P 500 index lost 1.74 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,184.05. The Nasdaq bucked the trend, adding 4.50 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 5,232.89. Benchmark U.S. crude was rose $1, or 2.3 per cent, to close at $44.49 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 93 cents, or 2 per cent, to close at $46.97 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline added a penny to $1.37 a gallon, while heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.41 a gallon. Natural gas gained 3 cents to $2.58 per 1,000 cubic feet.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business FOX News Network LLC The Associated Press         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   PetSmart® Launches Holiday Philanthropic Collection That Gives Back to Pets and Children in Need Through December 25, and Even More on #GivingTuesday TRUSTECH 2016, The Most Innovative Companies of the Trust-Based Technology Industry Meet in Cannes Fort McMurray Nonprofits Accelerate Wildfire Recovery Efforts with Creative Help from Guelph Academic and Business Community           News Business Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Health Travel Technology Don't Miss: Happening Now Video Centre Live chats Blogs on canada.com canada.com on Facebook Most Popular Formats Sitemap / RSS Contests Blogs Photo Galleries Videos Canada.com About Us Contact Us Advertise with Us FAQs Tools Canada.com Search for a Job Buy / Sell a Car Infomart Place a Classified Ad Newsletters and Alerts My Account Flyercity.ca About canada.com | Privacy Statement | Terms | Copyright & Permissions © 2010-2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Battered and partially fried, the Twinkies need to be finished in an oven or frying pan. For the first three months, they’re available only at Walmart. 3 down, 47 to go Zenefits CEO David Sacks tweeted Friday that his company, which makes human resources software and sells insurance to businesses, had resolved its licensing problems with South Carolina and Delaware. It’s paying $29,500 to South Carolina and nothing in Delaware; last month, it paid $62,500 to Tennessee, the first state it settled with. Sacks said the San Francisco company is now fully compliant but is working through “historical violations.” Pharma Bro meets the press Martin Shkreli, the former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO arrested on securities fraud charges in December, held court with reporters at Guy Fieri’s American Kitchen & Bar in New York Friday. The impromptu meetup came after an email bearing Shkreli’s name was sent early in the morning to 450 journalists, Mashable reported, generating 100 reply-all responses. The original email was fake, Shkreli said — but he asked to be added to the thread, and eventually proposed the Midtown drinkfest, which several reporters broadcast live on Facebook and Periscope. Shkreli is known for sharing outrageous opinions on Twitter — including defending the high drug prices that got him labeled the “Pharma Bro.” The Daily Briefing is compiled from San Francisco Chronicle staff and news services.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us CVS Pay mobile payment service added to the CVS Pharmacy app By R Padla - August 12, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We already knew of the idea that the CVS Pharmacy would be launching its own mobile payment service. We heard it would utilize mainly Apple Pay but this week, the company finally unveiled CVS Pay and no, it won’t be related to anything from Apple or Google. Instead of integration with any existing payment service available, CVS is introducing its own. CVS Pay is yet another mobile payments platform that will be exclusive to payments for CVS Pharmacy transactions much like Walmart Pay is to Walmart. If you may remember not so long ago, CVS once dropped the idea of NFC mobile payments not because they cause problems but because they were part of the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX). Back then, the latter was once believed to be developing its own mobile payment system called CurrentC. CurrentC has been on beta for quite a while now but it has seen a number of issues. Meanwhile, the new CVS Pay won’t exactly launch as a standalone app but will be part of the already available CVS Pharmacy app. This payment feature adds up to the prescription pickup tools and loyalty program integrated into the app. CVS Pay works similarly with the same services from Android, Walmart, and Apple. Customers need to add their credit or debits cards to the system. A barcode will be shown and then be used to pay for the items and finally finish transaction after some verification measure which can be a signature or a passcode. The CVS Pharmacy app won’t be changed at all. It will only be updated with the addition of the CVS Pay feature. CVS Pay on the CVS Pharmacy app is now available in only a few markets like New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. More states are expected to receive the feature in the coming months or before 2016 ends. What’s good about CVS Pay is that it works on both Android and iOS versions of the CVS Pharmacy app. Credit and debit cards supported include Visa, Discover, MasterCard, and American Express.

Discount chain Giant Tiger is expanding its footprint and revamping its image Linda Nguyen, The Canadian Press || August 12, 2016 Topics Consumer Trends, Branding Print Email Comment Share: A newly-renovated Giant Tiger store in Ottawa. Photo: Fred Chartrand/CP For 55 years, Giant Tiger’s smiling feline mascot has beckoned shoppers in small towns and those driving up to the cottage. But after years of operating under the radar amid intense competition against rivals like Walmart and the now defunct Target Canada, the company is setting its sights on becoming a household name. The Ottawa-based retailer, with its trademark yellow branding, currently operates 220 stores and has a goal of opening 10 to 15 new stores every year for the next three to five years. The company also has plans to revamp the design of its locations and increase its product offerings in order to build a better shopping experience. Growing its e-commerce business has also been a top priority. MORE TARGET CANADA: 5 Things to Learn From The Last Days of Target » Selling everything from groceries to big-screen TVs, the national discount chain credits the key to its survival and more importantly, its success over the last half-century, to delivering value to shoppers in the know.  “Giant Tiger is Canada’s best-kept secret,” touts Thomas Haig, president and chief operating officer at the privately-owned company. But in growing its footprint, Haig says it will not lose sight of what has kept it sitting pretty: its local franchise owners who know their customers and knows what works for their specific community. “These store managers live in the area, (have) lived there for several years and understand the clientele and understand the needs and wants of the community,” he said. For instance, some locations carry hunting and cottage supplies if they’re serving rural areas, while others may sell medical uniforms if they’re close to a hospital. MORE AREA KNOWLEDGE: 3 Ways to Unlock the Lucrative “Local” Market »  As part of its expansion, the company says it’s looking for sites between 18,000 to 25,000 square feet in communities where there’s demand for Giant Tiger—including areas where there’s already a location. Recent openings have included stores in Bathurst, N.B., Sudbury, Ont., and Wetaskiwin, Alta. The company also recently announced a new store in Peterborough, Ont., scheduled to open next April. For the past few years, Giant Tiger has been working on transforming its sleepy image in order to stay relevant to customers who want one-stop shopping for household items and groceries. One of the biggest priorities the company has is the task of reorganizing store layouts so customers can navigate faster and easier as opposed to rivals who operate warehouse-sized locations that force customers to walk around aimlessly. “(Our customers) are looking for a simplified shopping experience,” says Karen Sterling, vice-president of marketing at Giant Tiger. MORE LAYOUTS: 3 Lessons from Real Estate Limbo » Their target customer continues to be women between 30 to 55 years old, with two kids, who are the “CFO (chief financial officer)” of their families and looking for value from their purchases. Sterling says their customers’ time constraints have also motivated the company to include more product selection, so a weekly shop for toilet paper, frozen pizza, workout clothes or back-to-school supplies can all be done under one roof. “The smaller store size is a competitive advantage,” she said. Along with updating its store look, the company has also been increasing its e-commerce presence. It currently has about 6,000 products online, with the option of shipping some of them to home or a local store for pickup. Retail analyst Sandy Silva, who is with market research firm NPD Group, says part of Giant Tiger’s success comes from customers who like the idea of supporting a Canadian business. But where the company can really make its mark is how it proceeds with online shopping.Silva noted that some challenges for the retailer will be meeting expectations when it comes to home delivery times and product availability because the majority of their customers live in rural areas. “E-commerce is going to be crucial to them,” she said.

Hostess has collaborated with Walmart to make the treat which will hit stores on Monday, August 15th. They come frozen and you can cook them yourself in the oven, according to the company’s website. This solves what was formerly the chief problem with a deep-fried Twinkie: you had to walk to get one. 4,000 Wal-Mart locations will carry an “Original Golden” version of the snack as well as a chocolate one, lest you get board of eating the same flavor of deep-fried Twinkie all the time. According to Walmart, they’re “so good, they’re worth the calories.” [H/T Eater] Follow Dana Eisenberg on Twitter.

The Glocal is part of the BDN Maine Network. Learn more. Politics| Business| Health| Outdoors| Homestead| Food| Events| Opinion The Glocal The Glocal Menu Skip to content Home Contact About Stefano Search for: Violence: A Cultural Problem August 12, 2016Home By Stefano Tijerina Tweet It is no surprise that the hot-button issue of gun control has unfortunately escalated into a nationwide pandemic given the events of the last few months. Gun violence and misuse has now been attributed to the loss of well over 60 Americans so far this summer.[1] Last month, Augusta residents experienced first-hand exactly how deep this problem runs when a dispute turned violent in a Walmart parking lot. A group of drug traffickers from New York allegedly became invested in a narcotic-related argument in which a firearm was shot off attempting to injure one of the people involved. Thankfully, the scene was de-escalated before any fatal injuries could have occurred. Unfortunately, this is not always how incidents involving gun violence end. Prior to the altercation in Augusta, the nation was still mourning the losses from the shootings of June and July which claimed over sixty innocent victims and is now gravely considered one of the bloodiest summers in modern U.S history. This is an issue we have seen repeated ten fold throughout the last decade. According to the Congressional Research Service, between 2000 and 2013, there was a total of 671 reported casualties due to mass public shootings. Further, there was an estimated 607 casualties attributed to gun violence from 1999 to 2013.[2] This year alone has presented us with some of the largest public body counts in our modern history. The Gun Violence Archive states that there has been 28,435 reported incidents involving a firearm this year alone. This is close to 150 firearm incidents per day. One hundred seventy five of these incidents resulted in the injury or death of a reporting officer and 984 resulted in instances in which a suspect was injured or killed at the hands of law enforcement. According to The Guardian, a total of 586 people have lost their lives due to police brutality or misconduct this year alone.[3] Through an international perspective, the U.S is the number one provider and exporter of firearms, controlling over fifty percent of the global weaponry market.[4] According to TIME Magazine, American arms sales jumped 35 percent, reaching a total of $36.2 billion in 2014 due in part to a high international weapons demand from South Korea, Iraq, and Brazil. Further, roughly 46 per cent of small arms sellers rely on some amount of American demand from the U.S-Mexico border.[5] As if this was not enough, the United States is the leader in the number of firearms per capita in the world, totaling 88 for every 100.[6] Jayman. “Guns & Violence…Again.” The UNZ Review. June 11, 2014. After a surge in favor of stricter background check policies and public campaigns against firearms, the demand for firearms in the United States has increased, peaking soon after the incidents of Sandyhook, Orlando, and the Dallas shootings.[7] One of the most interesting facts about this is that gun sales actually increased not only because of the shootings, but also because of the controversy that followed the attacks. The result has been quite lucrative and positive for firearms manufacturers. It seems that the more society attacks each other the better business gets. Ever since crime rates due to firearms began to rise in the nation, cases have been made searching for someone to fault. Non gun-owners blame weapons, the NRA blames perpetrators, and society chooses to blame the conscience, or lack thereof, of the person who commits these hateful crimes. Americans on the side of gun opposition and control look at all the devastations in Orlando, Dallas, and Sandy Hook as proof and justification for the implementation of stricter laws surrounding gun control. Some imagine that the blanket prohibition of gun sales could quickly diminish gun violence and crime in general. This has not worked in the past and will not work now. Prohibition in the 1920s did not diminish the consumption of alcoholic across our society; it made it even worse. The outcome then was an increase in alcoholism, drug use, and the strengthening and empowerment of organized crime. Just like it was as easy to make the argument that alcohol had caused crimes, it is just as easy to say that guns kill people. But, the truth is that the physical presence of alcohol was not responsible for alcoholism prior to prohibition, and the existence of firearms in and of themselves is not solely responsible for the tragedies as of late. That said, there are certain measures which have been shown to reduce gun deaths.  Giving into the nation’s gun-frenzied culture, lawmakers in Missouri ended a program which required background checks on private gun sales, which make up about 40% of the market.  Multiple studies have shown that the years following the repeal of universal background checks saw a rise in gun deaths in the state.  In contrast, Connecticut saw a reduction in gun deaths when they instituted broader background checks.[8]  In total, eighteen states have set into place laws which expand background checks.  In those states, 46% fewer women are shot to death by their intimate partners in domestic violence cases.  The prevalence of gun trafficking and gun suicides is also diminished.  This November, Maine has an opportunity to become the nineteenth state to pass expanded background check legislation with Question Three on the ballot.[9] Common sense gun measures would save lives, but they would only be a first step toward a more peaceful world. The recent public shootings have not only devastated our society, they have also succeeded in dividing our nation. The American public now faces a difficult decision regarding gun control that seems to make only slight progress after every national horror involving firearms. It’s irrational to believe that we can eradicate crime by abolishing guns. The truth is that these acts of violence stem from hate and prejudice, not because the person who committed the crimes had access to a weapon. Those who want to commit acts of evil, will do so by any means necessary. Instead of placing the blame on weapons, we should consider that the root of these atrocious crimes is social inequality. It is injudicious to reject the existence of social stratification in our culture. The U.S. is a democratic-republic whose foundation was tragically built upon racial stratification. The hard truth is that some people experience more privilege than others due to a variety of reasons, including race, gender, income or social class. Thus, birthed the institution that we now recognize as social inequality. This is the leading cause of hate and prejudice which is a major motive for crime in our culture. There is an infinite amount of documented hate crimes that can be traced to the root of social inequality; or instead, the feeling of resentment directed at social inequality and systemic privilege. Have we lost all sense of morality as a society? Has the U.S. lost touch with its value system? Popular culture may be the true culprit behind our violent tendencies. American culture has evolved to become centered on violence and intrigue, because as we know it, these topics are top of the market. For instance, television programs such as NCIS, Major Crimes, or even Dexter, have gained major popularity in the entertainment industry because these shows exhibit major “selling points” in the market. All of these shows include storylines of the most heinous crimes that are committed in our society. These shows take advantage of the greatest tragedies of our lives, and consequently, we can suppose they actually inspire more crime to occur. So, maybe the real person to blame isn’t a person but a collective culture. When we take a step back and analyze the development of our own society and culture, we are the ones at fault. We have created a culture focused on violence and hate and social inequality. As aforementioned, we are and have always been a democratic-republic, a nation that encourages individualism and guarantees prosperity for those who put in work. However, that reality simply doesn’t exist for everybody, it did not exist then and it does not exist today. All people are equal; this is a universal concept. But not all people are born into equal situations, and therefore, are not able to access like opportunities. This systemic inequality plays a large part in not only global crime, but also acts as a huge influencer of crime in general. This problem is not a frivolous debate about whether guns kill people, or if they should be banned in the U.S. The root of the issue at hand, is our society. Once we accept this truth, we will be able to find solutions to finally reduce violence due to systemic hate and injustice, and therefore find solace for the countless lives lost due to violence. “Violence: A Cultural Problem” was written by Nina Mahaleris, undergraduate student in journalism, communications and international affairs at the University of Maine and volunteer for the Peace and Justice Center of Eastern Maine.

These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue Elation Selling (Seeking Alpha) Related WMT Can't Wait For Black Friday? These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food (Investor's Business Daily) Jefferies sees Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT)'s second quarter same-store sales ahead of the Street and in-line on EPS, while maintaining its sales and EPS estimates for Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT). Wal-Mart Wal-Mart is expected to announce its second quarter results on August 18, while Target reports on August 17. Street expects EPS/revenue of $1.02/$120.34 billion for Wal-Mart and $1.12/$16.17 billion for Target. For Wal-Mart, Jefferies thinks the U.S. comp stores sales momentum was carried over from the first quarter to the second quarter. The brokerage maintained its estimate for a 1.5 percent increase, modestly ahead of guidance for +1.0 percent. The EPS is expected to be in line with the consensus. "Our local retail store checks continued to show strong execution with consistency across the market," analyst Daniel Binder wrote in a note. Meanwhile, the analyst expects a small increase in retail spending over the next few quarters due to the increase in the wages of lower income consumers. Binder has a Buy rating and $85 price target on Wal-Mart. Related Link: Despite Rumors Of Another Bidder, Wal-Mart Was Only Company Looking To Buy Jet.Com Target For Target, Binder projects EPS at $1.12, which is a penny below the Street, but in line with management's guidance of $1.00-$1.20. Target set a comp store sales plan of 1.5-2.5 percent for the year, but expected to be flat to down 2 percent in the second quarter, based on a slowdown at the time of the first quarter report in mid-May. "We are maintaining our -1% estimate as our field checks looked choppy. We think May was particularly soft with a nice rebound in June and then some deceleration in July. Stores generally looked good and we think there was a focus on expense management in the sluggish environment," Binder highlighted. Binder has a Hold rating and price target of $72 on Target shares. Comparison Answering why Target should be a bigger multiple discount to Wal-Mart, Binder said "we think the market is anticipating an upward revision cycle in WMT EPS and a downward revision cycle in TGT EPS, both of which already are underway." Further, the analyst noted that the market views the Wal-Mart's heavy online spending would better position the company versus Target over long-term. In fact, Target grew EPS by 22.1 percent over the last 5 years, while WMT EPS grew only 12.8 percent. "We aren't ready to say the scales will tip the other way over the next five years as dramatically as what we saw in the last five years. However, we think the market is starting to view WMT's earnings as temporarily depressed and with progress recently, is gaining confidence and awarding a higher multiple," Binder added.

Try the Deep Fried Twinkie. Hostess Brands, maker of the original 1930s treat, just released the packaged frozen product as part of a collaboration with Wal-Mart's food lab, an initiative that fast tracks "innovative products" to customers. A longtime staple of state fairs across America, the deep-fried Twinkie weighs in at nine grams of fat and 220 calories, according to the Associated Press — significantly less than other fair favorites such as a double bacon corn dog (around 500 calories), a sugar-coated funnel cake (750 calories), or a giant turkey leg (1,100 calories). By comparison, a non-deep-fried Twinkie has only 4 grams of fat and 130 calories. "It has a retro cool factor," Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, told AP. "And it's fun." So far, consumers seem to agree: Omg just tried the new deep fried Twinkie... Yum.— Paige Fadden (@PaigeFadden) August 2, 2016 Had my first deep fried Twinkie tonight. My life will never be the same. #twinkies #foodie— Steven Thomas (@Pigeonhunter85) August 1, 2016 Deep-Fried Twinkies are available exclusively at Wal-Mart for the next three months, but will be rolled out to other stores after that. And, at less than $5 for a box of seven, you'll still be able to afford that ticket to the state fair. Or a quick class at the gym.

Deandre A. Currie-Lamar and Daryl D. Larkin are charged with multiple offenses in Isabella County District Court. Deandre A. Currie-Lamar, left, and Daryl D. LarkinAndy Hoag | ahoag@mlive.com  Currie-Lamar, 20, of Detroit and Larkin, 22, of Ypsilanti were involved in a retail fraud at the Walmart near the south end of the Central Michigan University campus, according to a press release from the Isabella County Sheriff's Department. As sheriff's deputies arrived in the area of the store, they observed a vehicle that matched the description provided by Walmart employees, the release states. Deputies attempted to perform a traffic stop, but the driver of the gray Kia four-door sedan refused to stop, the release states. Deputies pursued the vehicle at high rates of speed along M-20 into Midland County and then into the city of Midland, the release states. Deputies ended their pursuit, and other agencies continued it through Midland County and then into Bay County and Saginaw County. As the chase continued on Dixie Highway in Birch Run, police used a precision immobilization technique maneuver to stop the vehicle, according to Michigan State Police 1st Lt. David Kaiser. The vehicle ended up on the front lawn of the Comfort Inn at 11911 Dixie, Kaiser said. K-9 takes down robbery suspect after 4-county chase in stolen vehicle One of the occupants of the vehicle fled on foot, but a state police K-9 took him down, Kaiser said. Medical personnel transported that man to a local hospital for treatment for bite wounds, while police transported the other man to the Saginaw County Jail. Police determined the gray Kia was stolen during a carjacking in the Detroit area that involved a gun and a knife, according to the Isabella County press release. The Detroit Police Department was investigating that incident, the press release states. Kaiser said police recovered a gun and the identification card of a victim of a strong-arm robbery at the Soaring Eagle Casino in Mount Pleasant. The Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Police are investigating that matter, according to the Isabella County press release. The Saginaw News could not immediately reach tribe officials for comment. Isabella County prosecutors on Thursday, Aug. 11, issued charges against Currie-Lamar and Larkin. They are charged with unarmed robbery, receiving and concealing stolen property, and third-degree retail fraud. Currie-Lamar also faces charges of acting as an accessory after the fact, fourth-degree fleeing from a police officer, and operating a motor vehicle on a suspended or revoked license. Magistrate Sandra Straus arraigned the two men on Thursday. Straus ordered Currie-Lamar jailed on a $120,000 bond and Larkin jailed on a $90,000 bond. They are scheduled for a Sept. 1 preliminary hearing before District Judge Eric Janes.

The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to an oven near you. Hostess is launching packaged ‚ÄúDeep Fried Twinkies‚Äù that mark its first foray into frozen foods. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) NEW YORK >> Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. HOW IT’S MADE: A regular Twinkie is coated with a cake funnel batter and then proceeds through an oil bath to ensure the batter adheres. The Twinkies are immediately frozen and packaged. HOME PREPARATION: Pull it out of the freezer and bake it for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for two-and-a-half to three minutes. THE PRICE: $4.76 per box of seven. For comparison, New York-based hot-dog joint Papaya King sells its own fresh deep-fried treats for $3 each, excluding tax. Advertisement DISTRIBUTION: The Deep Fried Twinkies will be available starting Friday, Aug. 12, at Wal-Mart only for three months. After that, they will be available at other stores. Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, says the treat could be marketed abroad. NUTRITION: The vanilla-cream version has 220 calories, nine grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. A regular Twinkie has 130 calories, four grams of fat and 14 grams of sugar. In comparison, a Starbucks Carmel Frappuccino has 420 calories, 15 grams of fat and 66 grams of sugar. WORKING IT OFF: A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to run for 20 minutes at 10 mph, take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride, says Amy Gorin, a Jersey City, New Jersey-based registered dietitian-nutritionist. LIMITED-TIME TWINKIES: In December, Hostess teamed up with Wal-Mart on a limited-time mint-chocolate flavored cake. In June, it worked with the retailer on a tie-in for the new “Ghostbusters” movie, creating Key Lime Slime Twinkies for a short-term sale. Subscribe to Home Delivery for only $2.50 per week!

Hostess Brands, the maker of several sweet treats, including Twinkies, is set to introduce the state-fair favorite as its first frozen food item for the retail market. The treat, which will come in chocolate and vanilla, was born out of a yearlong effort by Walmart and Hostess. Both companies are looking to boost sales with new products. The new frozen Twinkies are available at some Walmart stores, with a scheduled nationwide rollout by Aug. 16 and will be available only at Walmart for the first three months. To achieve that state-fair taste, you’ll need to finish off the treat in a frying pan or oven before digging in. The move to frozen goods comes as Hostess works to recover from financial trouble in recent years. The company filed for bankruptcy in early 2012 and shuttered plants later that year. It was bought and renamed in March 2013. The iconic Twinkies snack first appeared on the market in 1930. But it was an immigrant from the United Kingdom, Christopher Sell, who gave America the deep-fried version when he began offering the not-so-heart-healthy version at his restaurant in Brooklyn in the early 2000s. From there, the idea spread to state fairs across the country. The new frozen item will set you back $4.76 for a box of seven, and each fried Twinkie will set your diet back 220 calories.

At least that’s the claim of a video comparing the product to its store-brand brethren. The folks at AL.com did an unofficial ice retention test comparing Yeti, Ozark Trail and Orca stainless steel vacuum-sealed tumblers, and the results have been making the rounds. In this test, the Ozark Trail (which retails for $9.74 at Walmart) held its ice for 56 hours and 30 minutes, outlasting the Yeti tumbler (a $40 value) by 20 minutes. The ice in the midrange Orca melted at 44 hours and 30 minutes. Yeti claims to have produced the original tumbler of its kind. Whether there has been another brand hidden away or not, it certainly was the first to make the stainless steel vacuum-sealed tumbler a necessity item and gobble up the entire market share. There are plenty of even-less-official videos online featuring amateurs conducting their own ice retention tests, and the only real evidence is they all keep ice frozen longer than the normal amount of time required to consume 30 ounces of water (minus the ice offsetting its volume). No matter the winner, Ozark Trail has proven there is more than one tumbler that can keep ice cold for an unreasonable amount of time. I hope Yeti has made its money, because it is a lifestyle brand moving into the next stage of its life cycle. These niche markets are fun to watch and stressful to be in because a new brand will always surface in the face of success claiming to be either better or cheaper (or, in this case, both). Just ask ridesharing service Uber about its competitor Lyft. I have so many questions for Yeti. Did the company build in enough margin to stay in the market now that it is no longer the only game in town? Will it have to adjust quality to maintain its margin? At the same time, has Ozark Trail underpriced its product at an unsustainable rate? We don’t know. The facts have changed, but the product valuation hasn’t. Does Ozark Trail really make a better (or even equally good cup)? Then why is it so much cheaper? The real answer is that Ozark Trail is cheaper because it isn’t trying to sell you a lifestyle as well as a cup, but the perceived answer is that it’s cheaper because it’s cheaper. The low price forces the consumer to subconsciously make assumptions about the lifespan, durability and cooling power of the cup. Reality may be fact, but consumer perception is reality. Think of it this way: Do you want to be seen with a Yeti or an Ozark Trail tumbler in your hand? Be honest. Now each brand has to decide if it’s going to compete on value or price. Ozark Trail will likely continue to position itself as the better value based on low price while Yeti makes the opposite value argument. Orca is the brand with tough decisions to make — it’s not cheaper or better. Ozark Trail’s lower price will help the company flood the market by selling to people who don’t value 56 hours of ice at $40. Simultaneously, flooding the market with a product perceived as cheap will only help to elevate the “exclusive” status of the Yeti tumbler. Yeti may have fewer customers going forward, but the people who buy Yeti mugs will likely not complain about the price — because they have a cheaper option and understand they’re purchasing an image and a lifestyle. There is nothing wrong with Ozark Trail’s strategy, aside from the seemingly contradictory claim of cheaper and better. It may be true, but it’s difficult for the human brain to accept. How often do we do this in our own businesses, thinking of ourselves as the best but positioning our brand as the “cheap” option instead of the “valuable” choice? I’m as guilty of it as anyone, but I’m often reminded of my value by my staff’s incredible work. At the end of the day, however, I think Yeti is going to stay on top — as long as there is a stainless steel vacuum sealed tumbler market. Look at the prestige brands in each product category. Apple. Gibson. Mercedes. Zales. Oakley. Coca-Cola. Sure, you may see these products on sale from time to time, but they are consistently sold at a higher price point than their competitors and rarely engage in price wars. One of the moments that most impacted my future marketing career was when, as a child, I was in a store with my dad and noticed Coca-Cola was always priced higher than RC Cola. When I asked my dad why Coke was priced higher, he said, “Because people will pay more for it.” Are higher-priced products better products? Maybe. Sometimes, probably. But it doesn’t matter — as long as they are perceived to be better products. If only wealthy people drive Mercedes and the company makes fewer cars than Honda, it will always be an exclusive commodity. Make sure you value your brand in accordance with the competition. Make the cheapest product with the understanding that while you’re disrupting the marketplace, you’re not making the best product. Value your product as the best, but don’t expect to hold exclusivity and market saturation in the same hand. » Josh Mabus is president and CEO of The Mabus Agency Apple Business Coca-Cola column Gibson Josh Mabus Mercedes Mississippi NEWS Ozark Trail RC Cola Yeti 2016-08-12 Contributing Columnist tweet Tagged with: Apple Business Coca-Cola column Gibson Josh Mabus Mercedes Mississippi NEWS Ozark Trail RC Cola Yeti Previous: TODD SMITH — Google sprints to Olympic search gold Next: Q&A — Credit union feeling shifts in business About Contributing Columnist More Stories Like This Memorial psychiatric hospital losing millions; sale imminent November 23, 2016 Mississippi man among those getting sentence cut November 23, 2016 Court blocks federal plan to extend overtime pay to many November 23, 2016 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Register Now Advertise Macy's Says 100 Stores Are On The Chopping Block by Thom Forbes, Featured Columnist @tforbes, August 12, 2016, 7:55 AM Recommend (3) Macy’s decision to close another 100 stores because they are worth more as real estate than as retail outlets drew a crowd of interested buyers yesterday. Its shares rose as much 17%, its biggest intraday gain since December 2008. It had been down 2.8% on the year, Bloomberg reports.   “We believe there is too much retail square footage in the department store space,” Macy’s president Jeffrey Gennette, who will take over as CEO next year, tells the Wall Street Journal’s Suzanne Kapner in an interview.  “The retailer has been evaluating its real estate since it came under attack by activist investor Starboard Value LP last year. Macy’s executives said they haven’t completed which of the company’s 728 locations they will close; and they will continue to operate most of the stores through the end of the fiscal year,” Kapner reports. “The company said it was also ‘examining opportunities’ involving its real estate holdings at four of its downtown flagship stores in the United States,” writes Megan Woolhouse for the Boston Globe — Herald Square in New York, Union Square in San Francisco, State Street in Chicago, and a site in downtown Minneapolis. “Most of these stores are under-performers or in weak locations,” said CFO Karen M. Hoguet in an earnings call transcribed by Seeking Alpha. She maintained that Macy’s would be able to “retain some of the sales” of all the closed outlets in other nearby stores as well as on macys.com. Amazon and its .com brethren have a lot to do with rendering those locations “weak,” of course.  “The shift in e-commerce, and the increase in online spending, is definitely pushing this move,” Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, which offers a free shipping service for Macy’s and other retailers available to consumers who pay a subscription fee, tells Woolhouse. He also say shoppers who turned to bargain stores such as TJ Maxx and HomeGoods during the recession have never returned. In the New York Times, Rachel Abrams and Sapna Maheshwari couple Macy’s plans to shutter its underperforming stores with Wal-Mart’s announcement Monday that it had reached an agreement to purchase Jet.com for $3 billion. “The decisions by … two towering figures in the industry have sent a clear message: The pressure to keep up with customers is at a boiling point,” they write.  “These legacy players are having a terrible time navigating through that shift successfully,” Mark A. Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, tells them. “They’re finally moving in the right direction,” Poonam Goyal, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, tells Bloomberg’s Lindsey Rupp about Macy’s decision. “This just shows you online is taking over. It’s really about taking their destiny into their own hands.” CNNMoney’s Matt Egan reminds us that Wal-Mart announced plans in January to shut down 269 stores this year and that Sports Authority’s filing for bankruptcy will close 450 stores. Target, JC Penney, Kmart, Sears and Kohl's also shuttered hundreds of stores in recent months. “It's a grim picture for retail store workers — there have been around 44,000 retail layoffs announced so far this year alone, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas data. Wal-Mart's closures alone impacted 16,000 workers,” he writes. But, as the NYT’s Abrams and Maheshwari point out in their lede, “the great American consumer is very much alive,” with household spending rising at an annualized rate of 4.2% this spring. “But more and more, they now want bargains and convenience — in stores and online — and know how to find them.” The overabundance of options is certainly hiding in plain sight. “We have five and a half times the number of retail physical locations in America per capita than any other country in the world,” Macy’s retiring CEO Terry Lundgren tells CNBC in an interview. “So there has to be a rationalization and we’re not waiting any longer.” He also asserts that macys.com is “only behind Wal-Mart and Amazon” in the categories that it sells online.  As for Gennette’s comment about there being too much square footage in retail, one imagines Wells Fargo’s CEO saying something similar about horses in the stable circa 1900. It, and fellow legacy stagecoach company American Express, are doing just fine today. Others who didn’t adapt? Not so much. 24 SHARES Tags: department store, retail Recommend (3) Print RSS All content published by MediaPost is determined by our editors 100% in the interest of our readers ... independent of advertising, sponsorships or other considerations. 1 comment about " Macy's Says 100 Stores Are On The Chopping Block".

August 12, 2016 06:53 AM NEW YORK (AP) - The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands is launching packaged "Deep Fried Twinkies" starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. Advertisement – Content Continues Below The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Hostess says the Twinkie is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012. For Wal-Mart, it's part of a strategy of working with suppliers to come up with twists on existing foods or developing new ones. The company, which gets more than half its sales from food, opened a food lab in June as it aims to get products to the shelves faster. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They'll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart.

The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Veuer - on August 12, 2016< > Embed Hostess Selling Deep Fried Twinkies in the Frozen Food Aisle 00:38 Hostess is breaking into the frozen food market with new Deep Fried Twinkies.

Kaiser Health News: Should Big Insurance Become Like Walmart To Lower Health Costs? Retail titan Walmart uses its market dominance to inflict “ruthless,” “brutal” and “relentless” pressure on prices charged by suppliers, business writers frequently report. What if huge health insurance companies could push down prices charged by hospitals and doctors in the same way? The idea is getting new attention as already painful health costs accelerate and major medical insurers seek to merge into three enormous firms. (Hancock, 8/11) Kaiser Health News: Administration Paints Rosy Future For Obamacare Marketplaces Aviva Aron-Dine, senior counselor to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, said the data was encouraging when many insurers have announced double-digit rate increases for 2017 and others have pulled back in some states to curtail financial losses. “What we take from this is that the marketplace is on sound footing,” she said in a phone briefing with reporters. She also said the sharp 2017 rate increases could be intended to help insurers compensate for underpricing their premiums in 2014 and 2015 and not the first in a series of large annual rate hikes. (Galewitz, 8/11) Kaiser Health News: More Small, Midsized Firms Choose To Pay Workers’ Medical Costs Directly Instead of buying a health insurance policy to cover their workers, a growing number of small and midsized companies are opting to pay their employees’ medical claims directly, a potentially riskier practice financially called self-insuring, a recent study found. Between 2013 and 2015, the proportion of midsized companies with 100 to 499 employees that were self-insured increased 19 percent, to 30.1 percent, according to the analysis published in July by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The percentage of small firms with fewer than 100 employees that self-funded their health plans grew 7 percent, to 14.2 percent, the study found. Meanwhile, self-funding by large companies declined slightly, to 80.4 percent. (Andrews, 8/12) Kaiser Health News: Researchers Identify A Key Weapon Of Zika Virus Scientists at the University of Southern California discovered a key weapon used by the Zika virus to ravage the brains of infected fetuses: proteins. In an article published Thursday in the journal Cell Stem Cell, researchers identified two proteins in Zika potentially responsible for causing microcephaly. ... The proteins — called NS4A and NS4B — affect the brain by targeting a critical signaling pathway that controls cell growth and breaks down damaged cells and their elements. Initially, Zika slows cell development and reduces the variety of cells in the brain. Over time, this “rigged” system enables the virus to thrive and spread while healthy cells die. (Heredia Rodriguez, 8/11) California Healthline: Licensing Logjam For California Nurses Ivana Russo submitted her application for a California nursing license on April 22, nearly a month before she graduated from a nursing program at Brightwood College in San Diego. She expected it to take 10 to 12 weeks for the state to process her paperwork and authorize her to take the licensing exam. As of early August, 15 weeks later, the licensing board still had not reviewed her file and could not tell her when it would. Russo called the agency, often, to ask about the status of her application. It was hard to get a staff member on the phone. When she did, she said, “Every time I got a different story.” (Brown, 8/11) The Wall Street Journal: Obama Administration Counters Insurer View On Healthcare Law’s Costs The Obama administration on Thursday issued a data analysis saying insurers’ costs for people who buy health-care coverage on their own remained essentially the same between the first and second years of the Affordable Care Act, partly because of a healthier mix of customers on exchanges created by the law. The analysis is one way the administration is seeking to counter insurers seeking substantial premium increases for 2017. Health insurers already have filed proposed rates for the year ahead with state regulators, and big plans across the country are seeking hefty premium increases because of what they say are substantial losses in the first few years of the law’s implementation. (Radnofsky, 8/11) The Associated Press: Medicaid Estimate Renews Cost Concerns Over 'Obamacare' A government report says the cost of expanding Medicaid to millions more low-income people is increasing faster than expected. That's raising questions about a vital part of President Barack Obama's health care law. The law called for the federal government to pay the entire cost of the Medicaid expansion from 2014 through the end of this year. (8/12) The New York Times: With Congress Deadlocked, White House Diverts Funds To Fight Zika The Obama administration on Thursday said it was shifting $81 million away from biomedical research and antipoverty and health care programs to pay for the development of a Zika vaccine, resorting to extraordinary measures because Congress has failed to approve new funding to combat the virus. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, told members of Congress in a letter that without the diverted funds, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would run out of money to confront the mosquito-borne illness by the end of the month. (Davis, 8/11) The Washington Post: Obama Administration To Shift $81 Million To Fight Zika The money will supplement the $347 million HHS transferred away from an existing fund to fight the Ebola virus. The administration is seeking $1.9 billion to fight Zika, but Congress is deadlocked over the funding. “The failure to pass a Zika emergency supplemental has forced the Administration to choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid these delays,” Burwell wrote. (Snell and Dennis, 8/11) The Wall Street Journal: New Zika Funding To Come From Inside NIH Secretary Burwell, in her letter, said the administration now has to “choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid” delays in vaccine research on Zika. She estimated that, even with the $34 million, NIH will need another $196 million in fiscal 2017 for vaccine and other research related to Zika. (Burton and McWhirter, 8/11) Politico: Administration Shifts More Funds To Zika Fight NIAID Director Tony Fauci said at the National Press Club that funding Zika this way is not wise. "All of that is extremely damaging to the biomedical enterprise," he said. "We're taking money away from cancer, diabetes, all of those kinds of things." The new Zika funding is coming from other NIH accounts, as well as the Administration for Children and Families, CMS and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Burwell said that these moves will “exhaust” the ability to provide short-term financing help for ZIka and that more funding will be needed. (Haberkorn, 8/11) The Washington Post: Lobbyists Leading The Charge On Zika Funding: ‘We’re Making Stone Soup.’ Perhaps no one is more frustrated with Congress’s inaction on emergency Zika funding than Cindy Pellegrini. Pellegrini oversees lobbying at the March of Dimes, the nonprofit working to improve maternal and infant health. Since March, Pellegrini has been leading the charge on Capitol Hill to pass legislation funding research, vaccine development and other measures to combat the Zika virus, which causes severe brain defects in babies whose mothers are infected while pregnant. But her efforts have hit a wall. (Ho, 8/11) The Wall Street Journal: Biotech’s Resurgence May Cost Big Pharma There are signs that a new wave of deals is brewing in the biotech sector. That is juicing shares and pushing up valuations. Some likely buyers are Amgen, Gilead Sciences, and Merck, which are among the large drugmakers who have said this year that they are on the hunt for deals. Among possible sellers are Medivation, which signed confidentiality agreements with several potential acquirers earlier this summer, a precursor to a possible sale. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that the biotech giant Biogen has attracted preliminary interest from at least two potential suitors. (Grant, 8/11) The Washington Post: Do The New Merck HPV Ads Guilt-Trip Parents Or Tell Hard Truths? Both. Merck, which is running its first television commercials on human papillomavirus (HPV) in half a dozen years, has ignited a fierce debate over whether the pharmaceutical giant is trying to "shame" parents into getting their children vaccinated for the most common sexually transmitted infection. The ads, which first aired June 28, are running on major network and cable channels, in day time and prime time, including during the Olympics, when a lot of people are watching TV with their families. They don't mention Merck's Gardasil, the most widely used vaccine for HPV. Instead, they take aim at a tender spot: parents' worries about doing right by their kids. (McGinley, 8/11) Politico: Missouri PDMP: Quaint Outlier, Or Harbinger Of Privacy Backlash? When officials try to explain why Missouri, alone among 50 states, has failed to create a monitoring program that tells doctors when patients are abusing narcotics, they point to a right-wing state senator who has repeatedly filibustered the program. The effort to block the program is championed by Rob Schaaf, a Republican family doctor who has intense worries about privacy — even going so far as to suggest the Pentagon is using health care databases to find out who has guns. (Tahir, 8/11) The Associated Press: Studies Shine Light On Mysterious Placenta, How It Goes Awry Scientists carefully probe a placenta donated after birth, bluish umbilical cord still attached. This is the body's most mysterious organ, and inside lie clues about how it gives life — and how it can go awry, leading to stillbirth, preterm birth, even infections like the Zika virus, that somehow sneak past its protective barrier. In labs around the country, major research is underway to finally understand and monitor this floppy, bloody tissue that's often dismissed as the "afterbirth," the organ that lives about nine months and then gets thrown away. (Neergaard, 8/12) The New York Times: De Blasio Signs Bill Mandating Lactation Rooms In City Offices A new bill signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday will require certain city offices and service centers to provide a lactation room for nursing mothers to use at their choosing. In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. de Blasio — surrounded by several women holding babies — trumpeted New York as “one of the first cities in the country” to pass such a bill. Other cities with similar legislation include Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Madison, Wis. (Schmidt, 8/11) The Associated Press: Justice Department Sues Mississippi Over Mental Health Care The U.S. Justice Department sued Mississippi on Thursday, saying the state is violating the Americans With Disabilities Act by "unnecessarily and illegally" making mentally ill people go into state-run psychiatric hospitals. The state has failed to provide community-based services that would enable people with mental illnesses to have meaningful interaction with friends and family and to make decisions about work and daily life, says the suit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Jackson. It also says life in an institution leads to stigma, isolation and learned helplessness. (Pettus, 8/11) The Wall Street Journal: Training Rikers Island Staff To Defuse Conflicts With Mentally Ill Inmates Jenna banged her fists against a cinder-block wall at Rikers Island while two correction officers and a therapist hovered nearby. “I have the power, you do not!” screamed Jenna as she paced wildly in her cell. Jenna is actually Erin Shields, one of the actors who regularly come to the New York City jail complex, change into orange prison-uniform pants and play the role of inmate to teach correction and health staff how to defuse conflicts with the mentally ill. (Ramey, 8/11) The Associated Press: Terminally Ill Woman Holds Party Before Ending Her Life In early July, Betsy Davis emailed her closest friends and relatives to invite them to a two-day party, telling them: “These circumstances are unlike any party you have attended before, requiring emotional stamina, centeredness and openness.” And just one rule: No crying in front of her.The 41-year-old artist with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, held the gathering to say goodbye before becoming one of the first Californians to take a lethal dose of drugs under the state’s new doctor-assisted suicide law for the terminally ill. (Watson, 8/11) NPR: Where Lead Lurks And Why Even Small Amounts Matter Lead problems with the water in Flint, Mich., have prompted people across the country to ask whether they or their families have been exposed to the toxic metal in their drinking water, too. When it comes to assessing the risk, it's important to look in the right places.Even when municipal water systems' lead levels are considered perfectly fine by federal standards, the metal can leach into tap water from lead plumbing. (Pupovac, 8/12) NPR: Long-Term Therapy Appeared To Rebuild Damaged Spinal Connections Researchers in Brazil who are trying to help people with spine injuries gain mobility have made a surprising discovery: Injured people doing brain training while interacting with robot-like machines were able to regain some sensation and movement. The findings, published in Scientific Reports (one of the Nature journals), suggest that damaged spinal tissue in some people with paraplegia can be retrained to a certain extent — somewhat the way certain people can regain some brain function following stroke though repetition and practice. In fact, this isn't a new idea for treating injuries of the spinal cord. Even people with severe injuries can regain some sensation and function through physical therapy if some nerve fibers remain.

And analytics have always been the core tool for ensuring that those purchases remain consistently convenient and speedy. Now new strategies for engaging customers through Internet of Things (IoT) devices and virtual reality experiences are accelerating customer expectations. But before understanding advanced tactics, marketers must ask what takes to monitor customer activity. Consideration of analytic settings and a few basic reports can reveal how to monitor the frequency of online sales. How Speedy Online Retail Changed Analytics E-commerce has always been a game of speed. Consumer adoption of smartphones and tablets for e-commerce raised the profile for metrics associated with a rate of time. Studies have already shown that consumers accessing online retailers via mobile devices are usually ready to purchase, and can stimulate cross device retail as well. Thus the metrics should emphasize how long it takes customers to make purchase decisions in terms of time and in number of visitor sessions. Start With the Right Questions for Speedier Analysis You should start with basic questions nuanced for products and services and for timing when the purchases occur. Doing this allows you to know what reporting is needed, and to better planning of advanced e-commerce analytic features. This can speed up response to issues that may be impacting the customer experience. Here are a few example questions that can spot ecommerce details that an analytic report should provide: How long does it take for customers to decide to purchase? Are certain order combinations selected at certain times? Are customers ordering more from a tablet or browsing a potential purchase on a smartphone and finishing later on a home desktop? Vetting these questions against an analytics solution reveal needed metrics essential to understanding purchase behavior, such as product IDs and product category segments based on the site layout. Plan the Right Layout in the Reports The next step is to vet the analytic tag settings against the layout and the reporting based on the aforementioned needs. Doing so puts the right reports in place. Let’s say you have a site layout question — Is the e-commerce site hosted separately from your main website or is it hosted as a subdomain? Analytics solutions typically have a filter manager that can display reports for subdomain-only traffic. This is useful for setting reports for a subdirectory of site pages that are dedicated to e-commerce. Layout specific can also require tracking traffic across domains so that visitors are not double counted in the metrics. Fortunately, most analytics solutions offer cross device reporting, with a variation to setup details. Google Analytics, for example, has a User ID for this purpose. Initiating means setting the user admin, then adding a script in the analytic tracking code. Another setting consideration, this one specific to Google Analytics, is Enhanced Ecommerce. The feature, enabled in the main analytic tag, incorporates a data layer of information for product impression measurements. Those metrics are part of specific behaviors, such as purchases and refunds, viewing product details, responses to promotion, and adding/removing a product from a shopping cart. Enhanced analytics helps in highlighting multiple purchases in a session or a page hierarchy expected at each stage of a purchasing process, such as counting a visit when someone purchases a pair of shoes, then goes on to purchase a different pair. This differs a bit from the goals — which are still essential for conversion reporting and making general comparisons among data sources, such as comparing number of visits from referral traffic sources versus social media sources. Goals in an analytic solution are meant to count specific activity that occurs in a session (a site visit or app usage). Enhanced Ecommerce measures metrics for multiple activities in a visit. No matter what settings are added, it is important to maintain a master “rollup” analytics profile that tracks all the traffic associated with the domain. This arrangement is a set of unfiltered data that provides a comparison for diagnosing errors in traffic volume or metrics against a profile filtered for a subdomain. Check Metrics in Periods & Influence on the Sales Cycle With the right settings in place, your team can review sales conversions against a timeline or within a period. Planning periodic review, with simple trend comparisons examined at 30 day, 60 day, and 90 day intervals, can indicate if, for example, the top selling products appears to be an ongoing trend and a worth further investigation. Another consideration is examining how the sales cycle is occurring. This is done through a set of reports designed to analyze time to purchase; Top Conversion, Path Length, and Time Lag. Top Conversion is meant to display which combination of referral sources are leading to conversions. The Path Length report shows how many conversions resulted from conversion paths that contained single or multiple channel interactions.  The Time Lag report notes the days that lead up to purchase conversion. You can use these reports to examine other ideas on how well a site layout matches the sales cycle, such as reviewing page flow. Plan Periodic Reviews for Functional Diagnostics A more thorough review periodically can reveal technical issues or imply where content may be better positioned. If a review reveals content elements or wording concerns, use an A/B comparison test. The test can consider simple elements on a shopping cart page or on product page. Site speed reports highlight the added impact from page load concerns – reducing the time required to load a page can minimize poor site response that influence the customer experience. This is just the beginning in e-commerce – We will examine ways to improve shopping cart conversions and using alert notifications to monitor reports in a few upcoming posts. Ultimately analytics can reveal more than monitoring online sales. It is the essence behind understanding the drivers of e-commerce and ultimately your business model.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.72 +0.60 +0.85% This week, the United States' largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.(NYSE: WMT), confirmed earlier rumors by buying upstart e-commerce company Jet.com. The Wall Street Journal (subscription required) reports Wal-Mart acquired the company for a total of $3.3 billion -- $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Wal-Mart stock. Overall, this is a small sum for the Arkansas-based retailer; as a point of comparison, the $3.3 billion figure is approximately half of what the company paid in dividends last fiscal year. On the surface, it makes sense for Wal-Mart. Perhaps the biggest shift in the history of retailing, and certainly within the past decade or so, is the rapid growth of e-commerce. In that time, e-commerce sales have grown from a paltry 3.5% of total retail sales to 7.7% in preliminary estimates of Q1 2016. Overall, e-commerce has grown at a clip of 15% over the last two years, versus the overall real GDP growth of 2% to 3% during this period.© Provided by Fool DATA SOURCE: U.S. CENSUS BUREAU. RIGHT Y-AXIS DENOTES YEAR-ON-YEAR GROWTH; LEFT Y-AXIS IS PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL RETAIL SPENDING. Overall, Wal-Mart's purchase of Jet is a small bet on a growing market the company clumsily conceded to the likes of Amazon.com decades ago. The real risk to this deal is unlikely to show up in either company's balance sheet. The culture could not be more different between Jet and Wal-Mart A large-scale study from Big-Four accounting company KPMG found that 83% of all mergers failed to boost shareholder returns. There are many theories why shareholder value does not materialize: paying too much for the acquired company, synergies figures that fail to materialize, and poor due diligence. However, the biggest reason generally given is a mismatch in corporate culture. By all accounts, the cultural differences between Wal-Mart and Jet could not be more different. Wal-Mart, an established retailer, is mostly worried about their bottom-line results, paying billions for share buybacks in an attempt to boost their earnings-per-share figures. Jet has continued to act like an aggressive start-up, more concerned with transactions and user growth at the expense of profits. The Wall Street Journal article notes that the company has been adding 400,000 shoppers monthly and was on pace to sell $1 billion in merchandise annually. However, the company is unprofitable, and its goal of undercutting Amazon's prices would make it hard to grow margins. Last year, the company abandoned its goal of a $50 subscription fee, much like Amazon's Prime service, in an attempt to expand its shopper base. It appears Jet has sacrificed profit for growth. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart did the exact opposite, choosing higher profit margins over revenue by closing 269 worldwide stores, many of which were the company's smaller Walmart Express concept and underperforming stores in Brazil. For Wal-Mart, buying Jet was the easy part There are potential benefits to the merger. Jet now has the buying power of the world's largest retailer and will most likely increase its already enviable 12-million SKU figure. What Jet brings is an Internet-focused and growth-first mentality. The downsides are obvious: If Wal-Mart applies its ruthless cost-cutting culture, it's likely Jet's growth will slow as marketing is pared back in favor of profit. Although the two will remain separate brands, there's an additional risk Jet becomes defined by Wal-Mart, which is the exact opposite of what a high-flying technology-based company would want to happen. In addition to the obvious financial loss in the event the acquisition fails, which is negligible in Wal-Mart's case, the company faces additional costs to combine distribution and potentially falling margins in the event Jet's razor-thin margin operations become a larger part of Wal-Mart's revenue haul. Overall, this was an aggressive move for a company continuing to fall behind in e-commerce. However, paying for Jet was the easy part; successfully integrating both companies is where this battle will be won or lost.  -- SPONSORED: A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The Saline County Prosecutor was forced to drop charges against a man on the run from police. KSHB Surveillance video courtesy Marshall Police Department Courtesy Marshall Police Dept. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next MARSHALL, Mo. - Two Marshall police officers are accused of embellishing their witness accounts in a case last year, according to the Saline County prosecutor. On the evening of May 13, 2015, officers Tyler Newell and Josh O'Bryan pulled up to a Chrysler 300C parked at the Walmart on S. Cherokee Drive to arrest Carl Roettgen who was wanted on a warrant. In a statement filed in court, the officers said as they walked up, Roettgen began to back up the car. Officer Newell said he asked the man in the passenger seat to get out of the car, and the man complied. Officer Newell then stated in the probable cause statement he "entered the vehicle through the opened front passenger side door in an attempt to put the gear shift into park. Officer Newell stated he looked up at Mr. Roettgen and saw a black in color handgun barrel pointed approximately one inch away from his face. Officer Newell stated he heard a loud click, which he believed Mr. Roettgen was attempting to shoot him with the handgun. Officer Newell described the handgun, as a semi-automatic. Officer Newell stated he exited the vehicle, removed his service pistol, and discharged one round at the fleeing vehicle." "It's the story that the Marshall, Missouri police department stuck with; until this day they have not contradicted that story," John James, Roettgen's defense attorney, said. In a Walmart surveillance video, the car's passenger door is closed as Roettgen drives off as officers chase the car. As Saline County Prosecutor Donald Stouffer prepared for the trial set for August 23, he said he noticed the discrepancy between the video and the statement. It forced him to drop a majority of the charges filed against Roettgen, who was arrested in Alabama after a massive manhunt. "Mr. Roettgen made a very poor decision trying to run from officers when he was being arrested. The officer trying to arrest him made a poor decision by discharging his weapon inappropriately and then he made a terrible decision by lying to cover it up," James said. In a statement Stouffer said this is the first time in his 28 years as a prosecutor that he's dismissed charges because the testimony from an officer lacked credibility.   Click here to read Stouffer's statement "I don't mean this as an indictment of every officer there and that's the sad part -- it's hard to know which ones were complicit and which ones weren't," James said. Roettgen was sentenced Monday to four years in prison for fleeing the officers. Stouffer said he now plans to review other cases where the two officers were key witnesses. Besides telling 41 Action News the officers are on paid administrative leave, the police department declined to comment any further on the case. ------   Andres Gutierrez can be reached at andres.gutierrez@kshb.com Follow him on Twitter:  Follow @AFGutierrez Connect on Facebook:   Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.

Penney, Macy's, Nordstrom and others all made their investors very happy, but there were still reasons to be cautious. Brian Sozzi Aug 12, 2016 3:20 PM EDT Wall Street may have largely cheered the first round of second-quarter retail earnings this week (Target  (TGT) and Walmart  (WMT) report next week), but the underlying numbers suggest many players continue to struggle with the shift to online shopping and tepid U.S. consumer spending.   The struggles were front and center in the latest government retail sales data. Retail sales in July were unchanged following an upwardly revised 0.8% gain in June, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales were also unchanged last month after rising 0.5% in June. While sales at department stores fell 0.5% in the month, sales at non-store retailers -- which includes mostly online merchants such as Amazon (AMZN) but also catalogs -- increased 1.3%.  TheStreet takes a brief look at the second-quarter performances from the country's major bricks-and-mortar retailers and the bold steps some are taking to improve their financial fortunes. 1. J.C. Penney (JCP) Thanks to J.C. Penney emphasizing affordable apparel and shoe prices in its marketing, and stocking stores with cheap private-label goods such as St. John's Bay under CEO Marvin Ellison, it was able to crush most of its rivals during the quarter. J.C. Penney's second-quarter same-store sales rose 2.2%, relatively in line with Wall Street forecasts. Gains were achieved in all months of the quarter, Ellison told analysts on a call. Top-performing businesses included Sephora cosmetics, home goods, footwear and handbags, while online sales also rose. Customer traffic increased, bucking the continued declines being felt across the bricks-and-mortar retail space. The company expects its same-store sales to strengthen in the second half of the year compared to the first six months, as it benefits from the roll-out of appliances, flooring and new Sephora locations. Excluding one-time items, J.C. Penney's adjusted loss tallied 5 cents a share. Analysts expected a loss of 15 cents a share. The company reiterated its full-year same-store sales growth target of 3% to 4% and expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $1 billion. "We feel really good about the trajectory of our business. The onus is on the retailer to give people reasons to shop," said Ellison during an analyst conference call. Talk about putting down a challenge to its industry peers.

The incident was reported shortly after 3 p.m. Friday at a WalMart parking lot in Helotes (hel-OH’-tis), a San Antonio suburb. Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges says the child’s father is employed at the store and told officers that he forgot to drop the child off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. When he got off work about 3 p.m., he found his child dead. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains. No charges have been filed. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees in the area much of the afternoon.

Police and fire department crews responded, but couldn't save the boy. Burgess said the father is not currently facing charges. An infant was found dead inside a car in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart store in Helotes, Texas. News 4 San Antonio The father, who was hospitalized, was extremely shaken, but cooperative with police, according to NBC affiliate WOAI.

His death brings the number of children who have died in hot cars in the U.S. this year to at least 27, including six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. That's up from last year's total of 15. The baby's father, who works at the store in the suburb of Helotes, told officers that he forgot to drop his son off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. Friday, said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. The father found his child dead after finishing work and returning to the SUV about 3 p.m. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. No charges have been filed in the case. The name of the infant's father has not been released by authorities. The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office on Saturday identified the infant as 6-month-old Dillon Martinez from San Antonio. Helotes police had initially said the infant was 7 months old. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and data collected by San Jose State University, the number of children dying of heat stroke in automobiles began to rise following the widespread introduction of passenger-side air bags in the 1990s. An increase in air-bag related fatalities of children in front seats prompted parents to buckle their children in rear seats, but while air bag-related fatalities began to decrease by 2000, the number of children dying of heat stroke rose due to children in back seats being less noticeable to parents and caregivers, according to researchers at San Jose State University. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. This year, on Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show the infant was 6 months old, not 7 months.

The incident was reported shortly after 3 p.m. Friday at a WalMart parking lot in Helotes, a San Antonio suburb. Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges says the child’s father is employed at the store and told officers that he forgot to drop the child off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. When he got off work about 3 p.m., he found his child dead. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains. No charges have been filed. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees in the area much of the afternoon. The temperature inside the car was estimated to be well over 140 degrees.

The baby was apparently left in the car for nearly nine hours, as the boy's father worked inside the store in Helotes, a suburb of San Antonio, KENS5 reported. The father told police he was supposed to drop the child off at daycare before arriving to work at 6:15 a.m., but he forgot. A bystander didn't notice the baby in the car until about 3:09 p.m. The father was taken into custody for questioning. It's unclear if he will face criminal charges. According to the report, temperatures reached 100 degrees for much of Friday afternoon.  About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Market Shock: How Can Caterpillar Be the Best Performing Dow Stock of 2016? By Jon C. Ogg August 13, 2016 10:05 am EST Print Email Tweet Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) has had enough business problems of late to be monumental. China, Brazil, Russia and elsewhere are slow growth markets and have been for some time. The U.S. dollar strength also makes Caterpillar’s giant earth-moving and large transportation equipment more expensive outside of the United States. And then there is the slow capital spending climate and an environment in which there is excess used equipment that can be bought or leased. When you add all this up, it ought to be a situation in which the troubles linger on the stock. In reality, Caterpillar magically has been the best performing of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks so far in 2016. 24/7 Wall St. wanted to see what makes this possible. The first thing that needs to be noted is that Wall Street treats the stock market like a discounting mechanism. Investors are not just reacting to the news of today. They often have to try to be ahead of the curve, with an outlook that is six months out, or in some cases as long as 18 months out, in turnaround and value situations. Caterpillar’s year-to-date performance is 26%, almost three full points higher than Wal-Mart’s. The median gain on all Dow stocks is right at 6%, and the Dow itself is up 9.3% so far in 2016. Several big analyst calls have been made in 2016, some of which seem miniscule and some that are not: On July 27, Caterpillar was maintained as Sector Perform at RBC Capital Markets, but the price target was raised to $73 from $70, after having raised Caterpillar’s target to $70 from $68 back on April 25. On April 26, Argus raised Caterpillar to Buy from Hold with a $92 price target. On April 25, Goldman Sachs raised its rating to Neutral from Sell and put a $78 target on it, rather than the prior $62 target. That downgrade to Sell had been on January 25, with a $51 target, versus a then-current share price of $60.98. Caterpillar ended 2015 at $67.96, without adjusting for dividend payments made since then, and that was a total return of −23% in 2015, including its dividend adjustments. For 2016, the consensus price target from Thomson Reuters in the first week of January was $68.19, and now shares are right at $83.00. The consensus price target as of August 12, 2016, is $72.06. Another thing that makes Caterpillar’s top Dow stock position so surprising is that this was not expected at the start of 2016. When 24/7 Wall St. ran a 2016 bull-bear analysis for Caterpillar, the expected total return for Caterpillar was only 4.9% for the whole year (and that included its dividend yield of 4.53% at the time). It seems that the hoped for recovery in China is helping the situation here. The move in gold was entirely unexpected, and gold mining and extraction these days requires massive earth-moving equipment. A small recovery has been seen in some of the metals companies, after they have curbed supplies and slowed down or shuttered unprofitable operations. Lastly, Caterpillar’s earnings trends remain in decline. The issue is that analysts often lower targets and companies often give sand-bagged guidance. That makes the estimates easier to beat when the actual reporting comes around. In short, the bad numbers often do not look so bad when you compare them to estimates. If you think back to the start of the 2016, chances are high that you would not have foreseen Caterpillar as the top-performing Dow stock almost two-thirds of the way through the year. If you did expect that, it might have been because you thought the market was heading lower. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Before getting too excited about Caterpillar’s 2016 rise to $83.00, just keep in mind that this was a $115 stock back in April of 2011. It still has a long way to go before its return to new highs. Revenues were $47 billion in 2015, versus $55 billion in 2014 and in 2013. Analysts see revenues of $40.1 billion in 2016 and $39.6 billion in 2017. Stay tuned. By Jon C.

I'm, also, anxiously awaiting. Thank you. I'm still seeking a new church that's not geared toward younger members. I'm 55 years old. I'm looking for a church that is quiet. No screaming kids during service. Sunday school class geared toward older age group. A church that offers Bible study classes. A church where the members are respectful and don't show up for Sunday service in blue jeans. Any suggestions? To the person who asked about finding fresh, luscious peaches, for the past two years I have been purchasing then at the Costco warehouse on Jefferson Avenue in Newport News, and have been very pleased with them. If you decide to purchase them there, I would suggest you get a bib, as the juice will run down your front. I've been trying to find a frozen Boston cream pie in the Williamsburg area. I checked about every major grocery store and none of them carry them. If anybody knows where I can find one, please call me at 565-2469. Thank you. Photos in Williamsburg submitted by readers. Upload your photos at community.vagazette.com, community.dailypress.com or community.tidewaterreview.com. I am looking for someone who can transfer a VHS to a DVD. I would appreciate any recommendations. Thank you. Yes, does anybody have a kitchen table and chair to donate? If you do, could you give me a call at 566-1718? Thank you. Guns I was in a local sandwich/smoothie business having lunch today. A gentleman casually dressed wearing shorts entered the shop. I noticed he had a holstered gun around his waist. My first thought was - really, is that necessary? Then I decided it was. He didn't have to worry about the servers messing up his order. Lend a hand The Salvation Army has Back to School tags available at the main entrance to Walmart on Rochambeau. A new outfit and shoes would help a child get off to a good start to the school year. Thank you for helping make that possible by taking a tag. A better name? I believe it's time to rename Route 199 to a name that everybody knows and can pronounce. I have always heard it called Route 199 and never by its name. How about "History Way" or "Colonial Capital Boulevard"? It would be really be nice to name Route 199 something we all can remember, pronounce and need. What do you think? Great evening Kudos to all those responsible for bringing Lyle Lovett and his Large Band to the Lake Matoaka Amphitheater last Wednesday evening. Mr. Lovett has a warm and gracious stage presence and goes out of his way to highlight the talents of everyone on stage with him, which included a gospel choir from Richmond as well as the dozen musicians who travel with him. It was an outstanding and enjoyable evening of first-rate music in a beautiful setting, and drew two standing ovations from the large and appreciative audience. Please bring him back! Thank you Thank you to Sentara Emergency Room and to Riverside on Kings Way for follow up work when I had an urgent health issue. Everyone was very friendly. I felt very respected as a patient and not just treated simply a number in the system. Here's to good health for everyone! On Friday Aug. 5, we had a water geyser from an old underground pipe that had to be 6 feet tall. Virginia Service Authority did a great job of replacing the pipe within 10 - 12 hours. Great going, guys! Monday they were back and redid our driveway with crush and run stone. It looks better today than when we had the house built. Now I see where our taxes go and I won't complain next time. Thank you. Kudos to Luck Stone in Toano. They were extremely helpful recently when we needed an assist. Their service was above and beyond. You never know when you're going to run into good people like that. We need more of them! I accidentally dropped my wallet as I was leaving the grocery store and when I arrived home, my phone rang. A lovely woman was on the phone and she said, "I think we found your wallet outside the grocery store." Her husband, Martin, was such a gentleman. He met me at the police station and gave me my wallet back. Thank God! It's such a pleasure to live in this town. There are wonderful people in this world. Many thanks to the lovely ladies that helped me when I fell on Wed. What a wonderful community we live in. Health insurance The person asking about his/her $2,500 from the Affordable Care Act was posing a cheeky question (also a factually inaccurate one). I received something better: the life of my nephew. He was a strapping 20-something former athlete until the day he was found unconscious and close to death. Over a period of months, specialists worked to diagnose and treat the sudden illness. Fortunately, Obamacare had prodded him to buy health insurance just months before he fell ill. Now he's well on his way to recovery without facing a lifetime of debt. IRS scams When I get the IRS scam, like I said before, I politely thank the caller and tell them that I will deal with it at the IRS office in Hampton tomorrow. Usually the response is one word and not printable. Not my sacrifice We as parents make sacrifices to raise our children. Some have one child, others have nine, and many of us are somewhere in the middle. If our adult child chooses to go into the military and subsequently dies, it was their sacrifice, not mine. To say I have sacrificed because my child died at war is taking away from my child's love and respect of their fellow soldiers and country. They gave the ultimate gift to us all. Please, let's stop stealing our adult men's and women's sacrifice...as well as all parents' sacrifices. Rio Olympics 2016 Rio Olympics: Keep it going, USA! You're doing great! And could someone answer a question for me? In the past, I never saw anything on Michael Phelps' shoulder, where there are now circles on both shoulders and multiple circles. Are they some type of tattoo? I hope somebody knows the answer. Please put it in the paper for me. Thank you. Editor's note: those circles are from cupping, a treatment to increase blood circulation to fatigues muscles. Rules of the road Why does the speed limit on 199 begin at 55 miles per hour, then change to 45 miles per hour and then change again to 60 miles per hour? Free to you I used to do a lot of sewing and have sewing thread not being used. Most spools never used...all colors. Probably 100 spools of dual duty thread. Free.....email at susanstetler39@gmail.com. The Great Clothing Giveaway will be happening on Saturday, August 20, from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. at the Smith Memorial Baptist Church Family Life Center. This is free and open to anyone in need of clothing. We will have clothes for infants, children, teens and adult men and women. Donations are welcome! If you have clothing that is clean and gently used or new, we are taking donations at the SMBC Family Life Center Monday - Friday, August 15-19, from 9 a.m. - 2 p.m. Clothing that is left over will be donated to local shelters and outreach centers. Anyone know where I can get sewing scissors sharpened? I used to get them sharpened at Jo Ann's , but they don't have anyone at this store. Man at farmers' market only sharpens knives. Need your help. In the city of Williamsburg, free: one sofa sleeper couch, pretty green pattern, you pick up. Call 252-813-2642. Free: Clothes basket full of fabric remnants. Please call 565-1300. Get the scoreboard Before James City County does the interior demolition at James Blair High School, they should consider taking the scoreboard off from the basketball court because Jimmy Maloney donated the scoreboard many years ago. It has a Pottery rainbow on it. They should carefully take it by taking the scoreboard down and above the basketball goals and bringing them back to the Pottery because that is a collector's item. Syrian immigrants Yes, in regards to the caller in regards to Syrian immigrants: I would say when Jesus was on Earth, there was no ISIS. So, that's my comment. Thank you. A recent writer was mistaken concerning Trump's ban of Syrian refugees. Trump stated he would temporarily ban refugees from the Middle East until they can put into place a method of determining if they pose a threat to the US, an issue that even the FBI does not have a solution for at this time. When you look at the terrorist situation in Europe at this time, with the number of people being killed by terrorist activity, that does not seem to be an unreasonable stance. To the person who wrote concerning Syrian immigration: There needs to be some correction of their facts. The person implied Aramaic, the language of Jesus, was only spoken in Syria, but it is spoken throughout the area, including Turkey and other neighboring countries. It was also written that Syria was the birthplace of Christianity. I do not know how they came up with that unless Jerusalem, Nazareth and Capernaum have moved to a suburb of Damascus, Jesus never traveled beyond Judea, which is located in present day Israel, not Syria. Can't believe someone would compare Jesus Christ to the known Syrian terrorists that are responsible for murder around the world. You can't be a Christian. Foreign companies For those who like to shop U.S.-owned businesses, Martin's (Dutch), Food Lion (Belgian), A&P (German), 7-Eleven (Japan) and Aldi (German) are wholly owned by huge foreign corporations. If you shop there, your food dollars are going overseas. Smithfield (China), Purina (Switzerland), French's (England) and Nestle (Switzerland) products are also owned by foreign corporations. Veterans affairs I can't believe someone is claiming that the current administration is concerned about us veterans! Have you not read or heard on the TV about all the problems with the Veterans Administration? The Obama Administration gets a solid F from this veteran. Doctor visits To the reader who complained about being doubled billed for an office visit: Was your doctor owned by the insurance company or did they cross over to the other shore, sell their practice, and become a salesman for the hospital? For what it is worth, there are many who view insurance companies and hospitals today as nothing more than criminal organizations that front as insurance companies and hospitals. Safety in Baltimore Thank you, Justice Department, for making Baltimore the most dangerous city in the USA. Now the police will have no authority and criminals will rule the city. My family will not return to the city of Baltimore due to the dangerous environment. The so-called rights violations got real criminals off the street and in prison. Recommended We would like to commend Dr. Renee Welch at Anderson's Corner Animal Hospital for her veterinary skills and compassion in helping us to say goodbye to our beloved dog, a very difficult decision. A decision reached with the empathy and comfort of Dr. Welch and her staff. Thank you for your loving care. I just got my hair cut and styled by Mark Wilkerson at his new studio, Mark's Hair Studio on Ironbound Road. The color is magnificent. The pixie style is cute. The conversation was entertaining and I didn't have to compete over the noise to be heard, like in other larger salons. If anyone is looking for great hair care, I recommend Mark's Hair Studio 757-345-9810. Just save room for me, please. Recently we have had problems with the sump pump in our crawl space. I can't say enough about United Pest Control, with whom we also have a moisture control contract for many years. Jordan, one of the technicians, was able to locate and fix the problem quickly. He came back later to reinstall insulation on the A/C duct work that had started falling off from the extra water in the crawl space. He is efficient, courteous and a delight to work with. This senior gal enjoys her computer but has little knowledge of how it works. I recently had Quinton Blanchard load Windows 10, clean up problems and instruct me on various operational aspects. Quinton is knowledgeable, reasonable and very patient. He makes house calls. I highly recommend him for any computer problems. His email is qwblanchard@gmail.com and phone number is 757-504-6376. If you need a skilled electrician, I highly recommend Kevin O'Connell with K&K Electrical at 757-903-2565. I recently called him out to check our microwave and the electrical outlet going to it. He arrived on time, was very professional and handled our problem with ease. Very affordable, too! We will call him again with any electrical needs. My recommendation for your house cleaner is the girl I use. Her name is Kristen and she is a sweet girl who works very hard, pays attention to details, does not just clean down the middle. You can reach her at 757-903-1787. I know you will be happy with the results. I'm a very satisfied user of Paws and Claws Pet Sitting Service (757-814-6626) for over 5 years. They also pick up my mail, newspaper and put out the garbage and recycling bins! A note is left giving the highlights of their visits which I enjoy reading when I return home and my cats are very content! So, whether away for work, vacation or even once when I had an emergency stay the hospital, you can rely on their services to take care of your pets. Cemetery name? Does anybody know what's the name of the small cemetery on Rochambeau Road? Someone said it was a pet cemetery, but I'd like to know for sure. Fresh produce Can anyone tell us what has become of the wonderful farm stand that has been in the Williamsburg Shopping Center at the corner of Richmond Road and Monticello? Have they set up somewhere else? Every summer for over 30 years we have looked forward to their wonderful farm grown produce. Thank you. Direct complaints The reason to write the complaint in about a business is to have others do the same or tell the store manager, as I also did. The more complaints, the better the chance for a change. Maybe you might want to take back your statement. Presidential politics It's increasing obvious that Trump has never read the Constitution or he is a compulsive liar. His statement that Hillary would abolish the 2nd Amendment is evidence of both. Clinton has called for universal background checks, which is supported by a majority of NRA members. An amendment cannot not be abolished. Thirty-three states would have to vote to ratify to remove or add an amendment. Time for a history lesson for all my Republican friends: Ford pardoned Nixon. Reagan sold arms to Iran and funded a secret war that Congress knew nothing about and then lied to the American people about it. George Bush Sr. told us "no new taxes," and then we know what happened. His son lied about Iraq's role in 9/11, and led us into the costliest war in U.S. history. Cheney outed a covert CIA agent as political payback. And Hillary, in your opinion, is the worst of the worst for using a private server? Time for a little perspective, I think. Yes, I would encourage everybody in the community to go see the movie, "Hillary's America." Very informative. For one who would like to know about our candidates, I think this would be a good movie to see. Have a good day. Recently a Last Word reader suggested we all stop submitting comments about the presidential campaign. Good idea, and I would like to stop that, too. But, we continue to have readers submit nasty and outright wrong comments that can only have come from biased sources like Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter and their cohorts. Readers like me, who get news from many sources -- liberal and conservative -- know much of their stuff is wrong, and simply can't resist setting the record straight. I propose that people stop using Last Word to spread this right-wing blather. Then, I'll bet other folks like me will stop our comments as well. The first time the American government experimented with trickle-down economics, aka supply- side economics, the Reagan Administration jumped the national debt 468%, from $880 billion dollars to $5 trillion in eight years. Now we have a candidate who is proposing doing it again. We can't afford that. With the Russian hack of the DNC, the specter of their hacking electronic voting machines and throwing the election in the favor of their favored candidate, there is a cheap and easy solution which cannot be hacked. Paper ballots and number 2 pencils. And, there is no chance of "hanging chads" and other irregularities. With apologies to the Bard: Drop out, Drop out brief Trump! You are but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. Yours is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Dan Rather was quick to state that Trump's comment on those who believe in the Second Amendment would resort to violence if Hillary was to be elected President. Where was Dan Rather when Black Lives Matter condoned violence against law enforcement? I expected nothing less from the liberal biased news. Every time Trump gives a speech in public, the Democrats place hecklers in the audience. This is obviously well planned, as those hecklers do so in a spaced out manner. I think it's about time that the Republicans do the same. I would also suggest, in response to protests from Black Lives Matter, that all off duty law enforcement officers protest at Democratic events. Trump can't get a break. Last week he was hoping the economy would tank fast. Too bad for him the stock market hit new highs, the Obama economy created nearly 600,000 new jobs in two months and the unemployment rate is at 4.9 %. What kind of sick person would root for his fellow Americans to lose their job so they can find you another one?

 JD.com had a strong quarter — but it still faces one major problem BI Intelligence Aug. 13, 2016, 3:30 AM 1,146 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Digital is mitigating in-store losses at Target Google's latest acquisition should boost Google Shopping Amazon opens Prime shipping to all merchants This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. JD.com reported strong a Q2 2016 earnings performance, but the company's growth rates have been consistently decelerating since 2014. The e-commerce company's gross merchandise volume (GMV) is still dwarfed by that of competitor Alibaba. However, new efforts in fulfillment, coupled with its acquisition of Yihaodian, could help JD.com gain some ground. Total revenue for JD.com during Q2 2016 grew 42% YoY to reach nearly $10 billion. GMV totaled $24 billion, marking 47% YoY growth. Active customers reached 188 million, growing 65% YoY. Excluding virtual items, JD.com fulfilled over 373 million orders during Q2, 56% more than in the comparable 2015 quarter. Moving forward, a heavy focus will be placed on JD.com's grocery sales, which can be improved by leveraging its drone delivery. Yihaodian — which JD.com acquired from Walmart — is a strong performer in the grocery e-commerce market. In addition to this acquisition, the company plans to continually add new products to its grocery and consumer packaged goods (CPG) categories, reports CEO Haoyu Shen. This poses a challenge for JD.com, as transferring perishables costs more and can lead to damaged goods. To combat such issues, JD.com may combine its efforts in grocery with its drone delivery program. The program allows JD.com to reach consumers more quickly, while also providing access to consumers in rural villages that traditional delivery trucks cannot navigate. By utilizing drone delivery, while leveraging Yihaodian's existing inventory, JD.com may be able to glean a significant advantage in China's grocery e-commerce market. Competitor Alibaba recently invested in its own online grocery startup, but it pales in comparison to Yihaodian's existing user base and brand recognition.

It’s hard to not be impressed lately by Amazon.com. Shares are up 14% year-to-date, more than the broader market, and up about 60% from the lows of around $480 in February. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.37 -6.96 -0.89% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.72 +0.60 +0.85% Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▼ 151.91 -0.76 -0.50% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.38 -0.74 -1.21% And of course, Amazon was one of the top performers in the S&P 500 last year with a return of roughly 120%. For those waiting for this pick to cool off, that February dip was just about the only opportunity in almost two years of seemingly constant appreciation as the stock continues to set new all-time highs. The bears have the same old argument about Amazon’s forward price-to-earnings ratio being too high (it’s still north of 70), as well as some new ones now that the growth rate in the much-vaunted Amazon Web Services division is starting to cool. However Amazon on balance remains one of the best investments on Wall Street right now. Here are seven reasons why: 1. Serious profits: Amazon’s second-quarter numbers, out a few weeks back, were mighty impressive. Earnings of $1.78 per share showed it can indeed make a nice profit for shareholders, and as MarketWatch Tech Editor Jeremy Owens pointed out on the day of the report, second-quarter net income was “up more than 900% (!) from the same quarter a year ago, and more than 50% higher than analyst estimates.” This comes after a smash first-quarter report that also showed robust profitability, with net income of $1.07 per share that almost doubled Wall Street forecasts. 2. AWS power: A big reason for those profits is, of course, cloud-computing arm Amazon Web Services. This fast-growing division gets a lot of press for its revenue expansion, up 58% in the second quarter and running at about $10 billion over the past four quarters. However, the real appeal for investors should be the profit potential. Last quarter, AWS posted higher net income than the company’s entire e-commerce segment. Yes, the growth rate of this cloud-computing business has cooled off, but name another $10 billion business growing at this clip. Furthermore, AWS clearly is the dominant player in the space; a recent Goldman Sachs report puts AMZN cloud revenue at five times that of Microsoft Corp. and an amazing 15 times that of Alphabet Inc.   3. Everyone’s upgrading: After the strong performance of Amazon lately, it has been one big upgrade after another on Wall Street. MKM recently reiterated its buy rating and upped its target to $995 — about 30% higher from here. And in the wake of earnings, other firms from Wedbush to Goldman Sachs have all upgraded Amazon stock with a target north of $900 a share. 4. Primed With Prime: Wholesale club Costco Wholesale Corp. reported in its annual filing for 2015 that it has about 81.3 million members. Consider that Consumer Intelligence Research Partners recently estimated that Prime is hot on Costco’s heels with 69 million members — which, at $99 annually, adds up to more than $6.8 billion in baseline revenue for the tech company. Not only is this a great stream of cash, but it is also a pipeline of customers who can continue to support the Amazon ecosystem. 5. Don’t sweat Jet: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. just acquired e-commerce company Jet.com for $3.3 billion in a clear shot across Amazon’s bow. However, Amazon investors hardly have to worry anytime soon. According to the a recent eMarketer report, Amazon commands over $79 billion, or 74% of the total U.S. e-commerce market, while Wal-Mart does just $13 billion in sales, or slightly under 3%. The Jet buyout may juice that and provide some much-needed digital know-how at Wal-Mart, but it has a whole lot of ground to make up. 6. Kindle on fire: While CEO Jeff Bezos has admitted that the Kindle line of devices is sold at cost, investors shouldn’t discount the growing hardware might of Amazon. Research firm IDC pegged the Fire tablet as No. 3 in the world after a strong holiday quarter that saw a half-million of the devices shipped. Since then, however, sales have been even more impressive as Amazon saw over 5,400% year-over- year growth in first-quarter unit sales to tally 2.2 million Kindles sold, by IDC’s count … then a 1,200% year-over-year improvement in the second quarter to move 1.6 million units in those three months! Yes, the tablets don’t do much for Amazon’s financials right now. But the more people Amazon hooks on its hardware and ecosystem, the more potential it has for follow-on sales of content down the road. 7. What’s next? Lost in all the fireworks about profitability, Prime and Amazon Web Services may be the most bullish argument of all for Amazon — that the company is still growing aggressively. In the company’s second-quarter earnings release, Bezos pointed out a big push into India, “where we launched a new AWS Region, introduced Prime with unlimited free shipping, and announced that Prime Video is coming soon, offering Prime members in India exclusive access to Amazon Original Series and Movies.” More recently, maybe you’ve heard of Prime Air and Amazon’s aims to operate a fleet of cargo planes. This kind of vision and expansion means investors certainly haven’t see the last of what this disruptive tech company has to offer.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Bulls could keep the market rally going until the last of the kids go back to school — and the bears return from vacation. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.71 +0.59 +0.83% U.S. Dividend Growers Income Corp. US ▲ 8.96 +0.03 +0.34% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▼ 29.69 -0.21 -0.69% The Home Depot Inc HD ▲ 131.13 +0.15 +0.11% Stocks broke out to new highs this past week in the three key indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq — for the first time since 1999. That was seen as a positive, pointing to further gains if oil and other market concerns don't get in the way. "We're encouraged by the fact that all these indices made highs, but at the same time we think investors are way too complacent about the risks out there right now. Last August, our summer was cut short by two weeks because of China [currency devaluation]. This time, the volatility came meaningfully before the fourth of July, so I think people aggressively seized this vacation season," said Julian Emanuel, equity and derivatives strategist at UBS. "The true threat coming this fall is the political uncertainty." Emanuel said for that reason, stocks could continue to edge higher if August remains quiet. Oil has taken some of the pressure off of stocks, rallying after OPEC signaled it could talk about taking some action to steady the market if necessary when it meets in late September. In the week ahead, retailers dominate the earnings calendar with reports from Wal-Mart, Target, Gap, Urban Outfitters and Home Depot. There is CPI inflation data Tuesday and the minutes from the Fed's last meeting Wednesday. Stocks shrugged off surprisingly flat retail sales data Friday, after a strong showing in June, but Treasury yields fell with traders betting the Fed will be less likely to raise rates this year if the economy weakens. The 10-year (US10Y) was yielding 1.51 percent late Friday. The Nasdaq comp and the Nasdaq 100 ended the week at all-time highs. The Nasdaq comp gained 0.2 percent for the week to 5,232. The S&P 500 was at 2,184, up less than a tenth for the week and 4 points away from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.2 percent for the week at 18,576. Market volume was light, one of the three lightest weeks of the year. Meanwhile, the VIX (.VIX), the CBOE's volatility index, was at an extremely low 11.55 Friday, trading in a range last seen a year ago. The VIX represents the trading of puts and calls in the S&P 500. "When we look at VIX under 12, and out-of-the-money call options being priced historically high, reflecting this increased risk of missing out on a rally — after we already had a rally — we think people are being too complacent about risk," said Emanuel. "We're neither calling for a sell-off or an end to the 7-1/2 year bull market. We just think you have to step back and remember that this is a higher volatility environment." Emanuel said the rest of August could be a "blase drift" where investors are rotating into more cyclical stocks, like technology. But he said the market volatility could quickly return after Labor Day, and history shows that the market action picks up right away in September, often a weak month for stocks. This September there is an important Fed meeting, though the Fed is not widely expected to raise rates then. Analysts also believe markets may begin to focus on the U.S. presidential election after the summer. "The kids don't want to come home from the beach, why should the adults? You come home from the beach and the pricing of the risks are low. The risks themselves have not changed, but summertime complacency has driven the price of risk to near cycle lows. That's in an environment where the risks themselves have only marginally diminished over the last several months and are likely to intensify again as we get closer to the election," said Emanuel. Analysts are still looking for small caps to catch up to the other indexes and hit new highs. The Russell 2000 is about 5 percent below its all-time high. The last time the three indexes reached new highs together was at the end of the tech bubble, and a year later the Nasdaq was down 39 percent. But there had been 131 instances where all three hit highs between 1986 and 1999, and the market moved ahead afterward. "This is not the characteristic of a major top in the market," said Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer. "After two years of very little movement, and we haven't been in a very wide trading range, we think the bull is getting started again." Wald said his year-end target on the S&P is 2,250. "We think we're going higher. We want to own stocks," he said. "If you look at the differences between now and where we were last year, ahead of that volatility we had in August, and even in the beginning of the year, the internal breadth is much better, credit conditions are much better than they were, and commodities prices have stabilized. They were in freefall last year. That's the setup equities like."

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Deep-fried Twinkies are no longer just for state fairs and those with deep fryers at home.  Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.72 +0.60 +0.85% Hostess Brands, the makers of Twinkies and a slew of other packaged treats, is launching Deep Fried Twinkies on Friday, AP reports. The new Twinkies can be found in the frozen food section at Walmart for the next three months, and after that will be available at other stores, according to AP.  Ellen Copaken, Hostess vice president of marketing, told AP the treats were inspired by consumers who have been deep frying Twinkies at home and at fairs for years.  “We’ve seen the rise in popularity of deep fried Twinkies on dessert menus across the country as well,” Copaken told AP.  But while a deep-fried Twinkie may taste great, it’s not exactly a healthy snack. Coming in at 9 grams of fat and 220 calories, Deep Fried Twinkies have double the fat content of a regular Twinkie. © Mary Altaffer, AP In this Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2016, photo, Associated Press reporter Anne D'Innocenzio arranges frozen, deep-fried Twinkies on a tray before baking in New York. The treats, which come in chocolate and vanilla, are in with line the "caloric decadence," the brand is known for, but may be a turnoff for moms purchasing treats for their children, according to Eric Schiffer a brand expert and  Chairman and CEO of The Patriarch Organization, DigitalMarketing.com, and ReputationManagementConsultants.com. He notes that consumers are more interested in healthy and natural options than ever before, and fast-food chains and makers of sugary treats like Twinkies, have tried to renew interest in their products with wacky combinations and over-the-top options, like Deep Fried Twinkies.  "It's a problem not just for Hostess, but other brands -- the trend is going to plant-based foods," Schiffer said. "This is the last fight of the Stone Age, the survivors that are trying to hang on."  The product marks the first time Hostess Brands has developed a product for the frozen foods section; a move that Schiffer said is a smart extension of the brand into another section of the grocery store.  "They’ll find as many ways as they can monetize their brand," he said. "As long as the product is consistent with the brand, it can be frozen."  On social media, the reaction to the new treats was mixed.

For those still interested, there is a similar value Xbox One S deal available with extra free controller and one year's worth of Xbox Live Gold.   Gamers interested in the Xbox One S who didn't hop bandwagon when it first released earlier this month can get a better deal now with some extra incentives. Retailers are aiming to move the recently released 2TB Launch Edition ahead the upcoming and cheaper 500GB and 1TB models later this month. Newegg is the main culprit, with their eBay shop offering an Xbox One S 2TB Launch Edition with four free games as an added bonus for $399.99.     Given the 2TB Launch Edition is at list price everywhere else, this Newegg deal is significantly better than simply picking up a unit at Walmart or Best Buy - after all, the bundle comes with four free additional Xbox One titles vs. none for the same price.   The freebies games are:    Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain Dishonored: Definitive Edition Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Tom Clancy's The Division   Except for Dishonored, all titles are recent release within a year's timeframe.   There are additional perks if you opt to pick up this Xbox One S deal versus the local store. The big draw being sales tax savings, provided you don't reside in California, Indiana, New Jersey, or Tennessee. Newegg has warehouses in each of these locations, so you'll generally receive the console fairly quickly and within about 3 business days (with free shipping of course). The last added perk is an $8 in eBay bucks reward that you'll earn good towards anything on eBay.   Should you expect more Xbox One S deals in the coming months? We think so. At launch, we spotted two deals available (also on eBay), one of which was from Newegg offering three free games in lieu of the current four. Another deal is a simple $25 gift card as an extra bonus. Unsurprisingly, the three free game deal sold out much faster.   This current deal is selling at a decent pace, with more than 49% sold at the time of writing. While we don't think Xbox gamers will see any straight up discount anytime soon on the Xbox One S, more variety of bonuses/bundles will be offered - particularly when the 500GB and 1TB Xbox One S bundles arrive at the end of this month. If you're not in a hurry to pick up the new Xbox One S, waiting a few more weeks certainly won't be a bad idea. If however you're about to head out to the nearby GameStop - you may as well pick up this deal, snag four free games, and potentially save on sales tax.

From staff and wire reports PNC to shutter five branches PNC Financial Services Group will close five branch banks in the region Oct. 21. The affected branches include one in Pittsburgh on Brookline Boulevard, Brookline; three in Washington County: Main Street, Burgettstown; Wood Street, California; and Dunnings Highway, Claysburg; and one in Westmoreland County: Lincoln Heights branch, Lowery Avenue, Jeannette. Customers of the branches were notified last month. PNC said it is shuttering branches as more customers use digital devices for banking. Local shops arrive at Pittsburgh International Airport Some local favorites have arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport. With the latest addition to the airport's Airmall, travelers are able to sample offerings from the city's popular Strip District as well as other regional stalwarts. Among the venues featured in The Strip Market are Pennsylvania Macaroni, Enrico Biscotti, Sarris Candy, Mac's Donuts, Nicholas Coffee, and Snyder of Berlin. Other vendors include Anthony's Original Produce, The Bagel Factory, Janoski Farms and Soergel Orchards. "Bringing more of Pittsburgh into the airport is important and travelers will have a great opportunity to experience that with this market," airport spokesman Bob Kerlik said. The market, which has opened in the airport's boarding terminal, offers grab-and-go items as well as popular treats from the local vendors. Hostess launches "Deep Fried Twinkies" as first frozen treat Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. J.C. Penney reports sales increase, says it has contract to sell corporate campus J.C. Penney, in reporting its second-quarter financial results, said it had narrowed its loss and posted a 2.2 percent increase in same-store sales. Revenue fell slightly short of expectations. Customer traffic was up in July, and the company is confident it can continue to grow sales, Penney this summer has been opening kitchen and laundry appliance departments in its stores and testing partnerships with Ashley Furniture and flooring company Empire Today. About 200 stores now have the appliance departments. About 500 stores will have them before the end of the year. The national retailer has a contract to sell its 2 million-square-foot corporate campus outside Dallas but provided no further details on the deal. Coal lawsuit involving WV gubernatorial candidate delayed A federal judge in Delaware has indefinitely postponed a scheduled September trial in a lawsuit pitting billionaire coal magnate and West Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee James Justice Jr. against a leading U.S. coal exporter. Attorneys for the Virginia-based Justice companies and Pennsylvania-based Xcoal Energy and Resources told the judge Friday that floods that hit West Virginia in June, prompting Mr. Justice to open his Greenbrier Resort to victims, affected document production in the case and delayed completion of depositions. They also noted Xcoal owner Ernie Thrasher recently became ill and has not been deposed. The dispute involves a 2011 deal in which Xcoal agreed to buy almost 4 million tons of coal for $560 million. Each side claims the other has failed to live up to its obligations. U.S. business inventories rose modestly in June; sales climbed U.S. businesses increased their inventories modestly in June, as retailers continued to stock up. But factories reduced stockpiles for the 12th straight month. The Commerce Department said overall business inventories rose 0.2 percent in June, same as in May. Business sales shot up 1.2 percent in June, biggest jump since February 2013.

The latest retail giant hoping that shrinking will lead to bigger profits is Macy's. On Thursday, it announced it would close 100 of its full-line department stores next year. It hasn't released yet which Macy's will close, but said profitability at most of the targeted stores has been “declining steadily in recent years.” Even though the retailer saw second quarter sales and profits fall from a year ago, it's stock price jumped on the prospect of fewer stores leading to higher profits in the future. Gap, Sears, Staples and Walmart are among those retailers who have previously announced store closings. They also are among the store operators scheduled to release their latest quarterly results in the week ahead. It's too early to see any significant financial impact of fewer stores, but long-term investors should listen for clues as to progress on the strategy of going smaller for bigger profits. The retail reduction knows no bounds. It has cut across traditional categories. Sports Authority is no more. Coach is closing a quarter of its stores. And the oldest Sear's, open for 90 years on Chicago's north side, closes this month. It’s been a mixed year for retail stock shareholders. The biggest and best performing retail stock in the S&P 500 stock index is Amazon.com. While its margins put it line with other brick and mortar retailers, it need not worry about the performance of storefronts pinching profits.

Deborah Gomez, of Northlake, Ill., and her husband, Adolfo Gomez, were arrested in June that year after police found two of their children, ages 5 and 7 at the time, blindfolded and bound with duct tape outside of a vehicle in a Lawrence Wal-Mart parking lot. The couple were located inside the store with a shopping cart that contained two more rolls of duct tape, two tarps and a softball bat. The couple said at the time that they were traveling from Illinois to Arizona because they believed the world was coming to an end and their family home in Illinois was possessed by demons. Douglas County Sheriff's Office Adolfo and Deborah Gomez, of Northlake, Ill., were arrested June 13, 2012, after two of their children were found bound by their hands and feet in a Lawrence Wal-Mart parking lot. The children were later found to be "Children in Need of Care" and taken into state custody. Both parents later pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges of endangering a child. Adolfo Gomez also was convicted and sentenced on two felony counts of child abuse. Deborah Gomez served approximately six months in jail before she was released. Two years later, in October 2014, the state filed a motion to terminate the couple's parental rights with all four of their children, including three daughters and a son. Among other factors, prosecutors noted that they had convictions in Kansas for endangering children, and both had prior convictions on similar charges in another state. After a trial in 2015, Douglas County District Judge Peggy Kittel granted the motion. Both parents appealed that decision, but Adolfo Gomez's appeal was thrown out on procedural grounds. Deborah Gomez claimed that the evidence was insufficient to prove she was an unfit mother, and that she had ineffective counsel. While her appeal was pending, the oldest of the four children reached the age of majority. The youngest child is now 9 or 10, based on the year of birth listed in the opinion. One of the children eventually moved to Arizona to live with other family there, but the other children remained in Kansas. During trial on the state's motion, Christina Maki, the family's initial case manager, testified that Deborah Gomez had moved back to Arizona after her release and that she had family and a support system there. Sagan Smith, a subsequent case manager, testified that Deborah Gomez had successfully completed many of the case plan's expectations, and that she returned to Kansas for monthly supervised visits with two of the children here. Other case managers testified that Deborah Gomez had moved back to Kansas in the spring of 2014. But the foster mother of two of the children and other social service officials testified that they did not believe Gomez was ready to resume her role as a parent. In a 20-page unpublished opinion, which only refers to the parties by their initials, or as "Mother" and "Father," a three-judge panel of the Kansas Court of Appeals rejected Gomez's arguments and upheld the District Court's decision. "There is clear and convincing evidence Mother was not presently fit and able to care for the Children and would not be able to care for the Children in the foreseeable future," the panel said.
