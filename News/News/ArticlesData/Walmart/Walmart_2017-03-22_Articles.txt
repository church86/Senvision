(Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images) Chinese supermarkets pull Brazil meat from shelves as food safety fears grow Add to ... DOMINIQUE PATTON BEIJING¬†‚Äî¬†Reuters Published Wednesday, Mar. 22, 2017 4:48PM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Mar. 22, 2017 4:48PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Some of China‚Äôs largest food suppliers have pulled Brazilian beef and poultry from their shelves in the first concrete sign that a deepening scandal over Brazil‚Äôs meat processing industry is hitting business in its top export market. The moves by Sun Art Retail Group, China‚Äôs biggest hypermarket chain, and the Chinese arms of global retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Metro AG come days after China temporarily suspended Brazilian meat imports. Safety fears over Brazilian meat have grown since police accused inspectors in the world‚Äôs biggest exporter of beef and poultry of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats. Brazil‚Äôs meatpacking industry lose upward of 10 per cent of its global market share, Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said on Wednesday. Mr. Maggi told a Senate Committee that the main concern was with the China and Hong Kong not having taken a definitive stand on their bans of meat from Brazil, the world‚Äôs biggest producer of beef and poultry. The minister added that unless quick action is taken by the government, it could take Brazil up to five years to recoup its market share. A spokeswoman for Sun Art Retail, which operates 400 Chinese hypermarkets, said on Wednesday the chain had removed beef supplied by top Brazilian exporters BRF SA and JBS SA from its shelves from Monday. Brazilian beef accounts for less than 10 per cent of Sun Art‚Äôs beef supply, she said. Wal-Mart has also removed Brazilian meat products from its stores, a person familiar with the matter said. He declined to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the matter. Germany‚Äôs Metro has withdrawn Brazilian chicken legs and wings from its Chinese stores, said a manager, who declined to be named as he was not allowed to speak to media. The retailer, with 84 stores in China, does not sell Brazilian beef. JD.com, one of China‚Äôs biggest online retailers, said in an e-mailed statement it had also removed all listings for imported Brazilian meat and is reviewing orders in process. While Brazilian officials sought late on Tuesday to reassure consumers that the investigation had revealed only isolated incidents of sanitary problems, the reaction by Chinese retailers suggests that the probe could have far-reaching repercussions for the world‚Äôs top meat exporter. Chinese consumers appeared largely unconcerned or unaware of the scandal in Brazil, with few people commenting on the issue on the country‚Äôs vibrant social media networks. But the country has been hit by its own safety scandals in the past, making retailers sensitive to any potential risks. ‚ÄúWe removed the product already on March 20,‚Äù said Sun Art‚Äôs spokeswoman, noting it was ahead of the Chinese government‚Äôs first official comment on the issue. Brazil is the top supplier of beef to China, accounting for about 31 per cent of its imports in the first half of last year. Much of it is used in canteens and food service and branded Brazilian beef is less prominent in supermarkets than Australian beef. Importers are expected to wait a few more days before seeking out alternative supplies, which will likely be more costly than Brazil‚Äôs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a 45-day lead-time to get any product here. What if they lift the ban by the end of the week?‚Äù said an industry source who declined to be identified. Hong Kong, the second-biggest buyer of Brazilian meat last year, has also issued a ban on imports, following similar steps by Japan, Canada, Mexico and Switzerland. Major Hong Kong supermarket chain PARKnSHOP said it had removed Brazilian pork, beef and chicken from shelves. ‚ÄúTo cater for the needs of customers, we will increase the supply of meat and poultry products from other countries,‚Äù it said in a statement, without elaborating.

The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Credit: Pinkypills/iStock E-commerce is big in beauty, but not so much yet in personal care, according to research by Tabs Analytics. While e-commerce is now 9% of the beauty market, per Tabs, it's still only 3.1% of personal care, which they define as haircare, deodorant, personal wash, toothpaste, mouthwash, feminine care and adult incontinence. Amazon, Walmart and Target combine to control a massive 82% of online personal-care sales. That's a lot more concentrated than offline, where Walmart still leads the much bigger market substantially with a 19.4% share, followed by Target at 12.1%. All food stores combined had a 16.6% share. Drug and dollar stores combine for a 24.7% share. Leave it to the Advertising Research Foundation to experiment with a radical new viewer-engagement strategy during lunch at its own annual conference. Marketers who've been to conferences are familiar with sponsored lunches unless they entirely missed the sponsored part because they were eating and chatting too much to notice. Of course, the speakers don't appreciate the din. The ARF and serving crew at the New York Midtown Hilton had a clever solution during a March 20 lunch session involving the Alliance for Family Entertainment on its #SeeHer gender-equality program: Serve salads first, remove the plates before the presentation, and serve nothing else until it's over. Lowdown hesitates to share this dastardly strategy, because we were hungry. But it did work. Credit: AT&T Then again, it was probably unnecessary, because this wasn't really a sponsored lunch, and the panelists said interesting stuff. Case in point was AT&T Chief Brand Officer Fiona Carter, who said her company is testing all its marketing content using #SeeHer's Gender Equality Measure from ABX, including past ads just to create a baseline database. This is necessary because she can't be everywhere to police things. She recounted the story of a b-to-b ad whose casting originally included all white men in positions of authority, all women as secretaries and all African-Americans as blue-collar workers. "When I looked at that, we completely recast," she said. As a result, the ad got "some of the highest GEM scores we've ever had at AT&T" as well as strong results on things like purchase intent. GEM helps her detect problems because, she said, "I can't be at every meeting." AT&T is also strengthening gender-equality standards for staffing agencies and writing those requirements into requests for proposal. "We can't make advertising the right way," she said, "if we don't have the right people doing it." Likewise, she said AT&T will take GEM programming scores into account in media buys. Credit: McDonald's Canada McDonald's fans will soon be able to buy the chain's sauces at grocery stores ... in Canada. In a move that might sound familiar, Big Mac sauce will be available nationwide in Canada, after the famous condiment was given away (in different packaging) in the United States in January. Canadians will also be able to buy sauces from the Filet-O-Fish and McChicken sandwiches. Details such as pricing were not immediately available. The third installment of the FX series "Fargo" is weeks away, but fans can get an early taste of the show's Midwestern vibe in a unique deal with Home Chef. The meal kit delivery company is selling Fargo-inspired dinners for three weeks leading up to the April 19 premiere. Old School Baked Ziti is on the menu for next week, followed by Juicy Lucy burgers and Three Cheese Brown Butter Mac. People who order any of those meals from Home Chef's broader menu might also receive a free Fargo-branded apron or oven mitt. FX and Home Chef are promoting the partnership on social media and FX plans to run a commercial created in-house. "Our chefs were inspired by Fargo's premiere to develop hearty meals that tie in with the show's setting," Home Chef CEO Pat Vihtelic said in a statement. The company says it delivers nearly 2.5 million meals per month. Before the all new chapter begins, get a taste of #Fargo with fresh takes on hometown favorites from @realhomechef https://t.co/XvMMBLRWLR ‚Äî Fargo (@FargoFX) March 21, 2017 In other meal kit industry news, Blue Apron is buying BN Ranch, which sells responsibly raised beef, lamb, and poultry. Blue Apron, which already had BN Ranch grass-fed beef in some meals, will own the BN Ranch brand and Bill Niman will join the Blue Apron team as president and founder, BN Ranch. Along with providing meat for Blue Apron meals, BN Ranch will keep supplying its other customers. Another bank is positioning itself as having a human touch. Lakewood, Colo.-based FirstBank recently debuted its new "Banking for Good" campaign, which it created with TDA Boulder. The new push includes a 30-second TV spot in which a town houses only mannequins. "If this is how your bank sees the world, how do they see you," asks the commercial, which is designed to demonstrate how FirstBank treats its customers. Other banks, such as SunTrust and Fifth Third Bank, have recently also tried to inject their marketing with a more human touch in contrast to the cold, robotic corporation that many consumers have come to associate with financial institutions. Finally, a pair of executive moves to report this week ‚Ä¶ Jeremy Basset, who once ran Unilever's Foundry program for vetting marketing tech startups, has left to form his own company, Co:Cubed, which does largely the same thing for the rest of the business world. The Ad Age 40 Under 40 alum, who vetted more than 3,000 startups for Unilever, has joined with former executives from Diageo, Tesco and the British military for the project to help businesses sort through more than 500,000 startups of all sorts. Leslie Gillin is joining Chase as president of co-brand credit cards. She had been chief marketing officer at Citi's global consumer bank, where she helped further digital acquisitions and branding.

This look behind the curtain of the largest company in the world takes place in the Delkor booth (#2415) on Wednesday, April 5 from 11:00‚Äì11:30 a.m. and 3:00‚Äì3:30 p.m. During their discussion ‚ÄúWalmart‚Äôs Labeling and Retail Ready Packaging (RRP) Guidelines Demystified,‚Äù Chet Rutledge, former senior director, Private Brands Packaging, and Ron Sasine, former director, Private Brands Packaging, aim to keep producers ahead of the curve as retail giants continue to raise packaging expectations. The panel will also address major Walmart efforts to standardize case coding and labeling to maximize efficiency through distribution and store stocking. In Sept. 2016, Walmart selected the Delkor Cabrio Case as its preferred shipper style in its Approved RRP Guide for pouches, bags, cartons and flat packs. First introduced at Walmart for pouches of shredded cheese, today 75 percent of all shredded cheese pouches sold at Walmart stores in the U.S. are shipped to market in a Delkor Cabrio Case. ‚ÄúAs attendees will see at ProFood Tech, the Delkor Cabrio Case is having a major impact on Retail Ready Packaging,‚Äù says Dale Anderson, president and CEO of Delkor. ‚ÄúBecause of the success of Cabrio in the cheese category, Walmart significantly expanded the use of Cabrio to include numerous product categories, such as snacks & nuts, frozen vegetables, sauces, candy, non-food products, and more to come in 2017.‚Äù Powered by three of the world‚Äôs trade show leaders ‚Äì PACK EXPO, Anuga and the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) ‚Äì ProFood Tech will welcome more than 6,000 key decision makers to convene with 400-plus of the world‚Äôs top suppliers over 150,000 net square feet of exhibit floor. The education offerings expand beyond the show floor as the ProFood Tech Conference Program, produced by IDFA, will offer a wide range of educational experiences covering issues such as: regulations and food safety, consumer trends and marketing, food processing advances and technology, business and leadership development and health and lifestyle. The conference will kick-off with a keynote address by five-time National Football League (NFL) MVP Peyton Manning on Tuesday, April 4 at 8 a.m. In addition, ProFood Tech Learning Hub will feature free, 30-minute educational sessions at the Innovation Stage and the all-new Regulatory Matters stage. The Innovation Stage offers attendees the opportunity to learn from industry experts on topics ranging from hygienic operations and improving sustainability, to advanced spray technologies and using robotic automation. ProFood Tech‚Äôs Regulatory Matters stage features presentations by industry experts on topics such as communicating during a food safety crisis, deconstructing Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) rules, combustible dust mitigation in food manufacturing, and constructing a FSMA food safety plan. A roundtable discussion will follow each session, giving attendees the opportunity to share ideas and best practices on these critical topics with peers. The ProFood Tech Learning Hub will also serve as host to both the Manufacturing Innovation Awards (Tuesday, April 4 at 3:00 p.m.), and the Sustainability Excellence in Manufacturing Awards (Wednesday, April 5 at 3:00 p.m.).

Novio - @inquirerdotnet INQUIRER.net US Bureau / 02:13 AM March 23, 2017 Arlene Gamboa (center) with daughters Janille and Naneng. CONTRIBUTED Arlene Gamboa recalls arriving at around 2:00 a.m. in their modest home in California. She was working night shift at Walmart. Her two young daughters, Janille and Naneng were already sleeping, still in their school uniforms. Afraid to wake them up she just kissed them and lay down to sleep. She was too tired to even cry. In her heart, she knew that the image of her daughters crying themselves to sleep would forever be a symbol of their struggles as immigrants. Arlene Gamboa, 45 years old, single-mother, now living in Los Angeles with her daughter, arrived in the United Stated States on November 28, 2014. Her parents petitioned her in 2002, and it was approved in 2003. However, it took another ten years before she was asked for an interview at the US Embassy in Manila. ADVERTISEMENT When Arlene gave birth to her eldest daughter, Janille, in 2004, her mother filed the birth certificate before the US consulate and to US immigration to add a dependent and traveling minor. The same process was done upon Naneng‚Äôs birth. Land of promises and hard-work Arlene and her kids live now with her family in San Francisco. Upon arrival, she looked for work, preferably related to her previous job in the Philippines. She found out that her qualifications in the Philippines did not fit in America. ‚ÄúI left my job as a Legal Officer of the Department of Agrarian Reform. I am thinking of lots of opportunities for my daughters if they become citizens,‚Äù Arlene says. She applied for any available positions even if it meant working from morning until early in the morning the next day. ‚ÄúI have to start again from zero. I‚Äôve worked as a cashier at Walmart until one in the morning,‚Äù she recalls. To attend to the needs of her daughters, she left Walmart and started working at Los Angeles School District as a senior worker in a cafeteria. Still she has to leave home early in the morning. Her daughters are driven off to school by family members or friends whose children are also attending the same public school. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one of the challenges we have to face in as immigrants in America. We don‚Äôt have nannies. No helpers. I have to do everything even if I‚Äôm dead tired,‚Äù Arlene narrates. Oftentimes the children are already sleeping when she arrives. ‚ÄúThey just fall asleep without brushing their teeth or sometimes missing their meals. Now, I see to it that I already cooked their dinner before I leave in the morning,‚Äù Arlene says. It is illegal to leave small children at home without adult supervision. Arlene has to work part-time and she makes sure that a family member is at home whenever the kids arrive from school. Overcoming culture shock If Arlene was struggling, Janille and Naneng were not spared of the culture shock, especially the way English is spoken. ‚ÄúNaneng cried on her first week in school because she could not play. All the kids speak English and she could not understand them well. She met a Filipino kid speaking Tagalog, then she enjoys school since then,‚Äù Arlene laughs. Now, Naneng, 8, speaks English with an American accent but still fluently speaks and understands Tagalog. Janille struggled the most because she was already in the middle school, which is the transition period of the students in the United States. Arlene oftentimes met with the counselor to discuss Janille‚Äôs performance. Janille will graduate from the middle school in June. She is now 13 years old. Proud mom: Naneng shows Outstanding Citizen of the Month Award from her school for her diligence, academic achievements and positive attitude towards others. CONTRIBUTED Despite these, Naneng, a third grade, twice got an Academic Achievement award and an Outstanding Citizen of the month award in 2015 and 2016. Outstanding Citizen of the Month Award is given to a student who shows diligence, academic achievements and positive attitude towards others despite challenges in school and in the community. ‚ÄúActually, I feel like giving up. But I have to work doubly hard for my kids. We will get our citizenship in a couple of years. Yet, I am still thinking if I really want to be an American citizen. Only time will tell,‚Äù Arlene sighs. Arlene still imposes the Filipino culture on her daughters. They still eat rice and Filipino food like adobo. ‚ÄúPo and opo‚Äù and ‚Äúpagmamano‚Äù (kissing of hands of the elders) are just one of the traditions that she wants her daughters to keep on practicing. Professional advancement Arlene is a typical Filipino immigrant who does not want to be stuck in a blue-collar job until her retirement. A law graduate in the Philippines, she wants to have a job related to her course. Thus, she enrolled at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) in a Paralegal Training Certificate Program last year. If she finishes the program, she can work as legal assistant or paralegal. She will finish the program in May. Arlene attends school on Mondays and Wednesdays, leaving early and arriving home at around 10 p.m. She uses public transportation because she is still afraid to drive in the freeway. She sometimes brings Naneng to UCLA during her exams and when she submits assignments. California is a multicultural and diverse state. Arlene does not experience discrimination directed at her but she says that at the university, she feels that some of her classmates have their questioning look as if she were ‚Äúan illegal.‚Äù While waiting for her program in UCLA to finish, Arlene took a supervisor‚Äôs exam to get promoted in her current job. She is waiting for an interview. She explains that an employee seeking promotion must take an examination given by the State. On Sunday night, Arlene tells a story to her daughters about her girlhood in an idyllic small town in the Philippines near the sea and the mountains. She wants them to remember their land of birth, not just as a fading memory but a part of their growing up in their adopted nation.

A message from ModCloth co-founder Susan Gregg Koger said¬†that this change would allow the company to expand their message and reach more people. She wrote: ‚ÄúThis will give us the necessary resources and support that we need as a business to grow. Growth allows us to reach more women, grow our community, and amplify our message.‚Äù To say many of ModCloth‚Äôs customers are not happy would be putting it lightly. The e-retailer had long been hailed as a promoter of inclusivity, self care, and indie design. By agreeing to a partnership with Walmart, the company essentially stomped all over the beliefs they had always appeared to prioritize. A quick look at #modcloth on Saturday revealed just how unhappy people are. Former fans have begun sharing lists of retailers that shoppers can frequent instead, including buying direct from the independent designers that the site carries. For years I have been a ModCloth fanatic. I was dedicated to the brand far more than any other clothing company or site that I had shopped at in my life. When I graduated college and entered the working world, I struggled to find office clothes that didn‚Äôt feel boring or too old for me. It felt like there wasn‚Äôt anyone marketing clothes to me‚Äîa 20-30 something who needed clothes more professional than stores I shopped at in high school and college, but didn‚Äôt want to feel like a stuffy corporate drone either. I had gained weight after college and just didn‚Äôt know how to dress myself for my first jobs in the professional world. That‚Äôs when I found ModCloth. It sounds cheesy, but finding a site that offered clothes that felt made for someone like me really increased my confidence in the way I looked. I traded in my plain black dress pants and basic sweaters for colorful dresses and brightly printed tops. With silhouettes that were complementary and office approved, but style that still felt young and trendy, I became a ModCloth super fan. Beyond 9-5 clothes, I bought dresses to wear to weddings, swimsuits that I felt confident in, and everything else from tights and boots to scarves and jewelery. I even considered some of their dresses for my wedding, and did end up wearing a ModCloth dress to our rehearsal dinner. I don‚Äôt even want to think about the amount of money I‚Äôve spent at their site over the years. But ModCloth wasn‚Äôt just about the clothes. Their site offered a comments section, where customers would post reviews of the clothing but also had the option to include information about their size, height, and any other specifics as well as photos. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù with short legs, so the ability to scroll through and find other people my height who had commented on the length of things was something completely new that I hadn‚Äôt been able to do before. Building on their reviews and online groups, the company fostered a community that embraced and celebrated women. They were the first retailer to sign an anti-photoshop pledge, they strived to represent women of all sizes in their inventory and in their advertising, and spotlighted a trans customer on their blog who became the namesake of one of their dresses. As someone who works in the marketing world, I always admired the way ModCloth built a dedicated and engaged customer base. They organically developed a brand with a clear and defined personality. And that, in fact, is a part of what makes this news even worse. The people at ModCloth have a very strong sense of their customer base, which is why their marketing and promotions are so effective. There is no way that ModCloth didn‚Äôt realize that a large section of their base would be hurt and upset about this move. Clearly, they did the math, and were willing to alienate and lose a large number of their long term customers. Over 15 years this company wrote a narrative that celebrated and supported women, only to sell out to a company with a long history of devaluing and mistreating women. Not to mention that Walmart damages local communities, employs child labor, and just basically does a bunch of really terrible things. I‚Äôm sad to say that I will no longer be shopping at ModCloth, and judging from the response, it seems like a lot of their long term customers will be doing the same.

Retail-giant Walmart has recently filed a patent which details the use of drones designed to move products inside stores. According to the patent, an airborne drone will be dispatched to fetch an item located within a retail shopping facility and bring it back to the delivery area within the store. Walmart says that the modern retail environment has significant scope to improve customer experience. Customers often need assistance and employees might not always be around to help. Delay in responding to customers can create dissatisfaction, resulting in bad experiences. READ MORE: 5 most expensive drones in the world This is where drones could fill the gap. When customers find it difficult to locate a particular item in the store, an intelligent drone could help the customer in locating it, or it could even bring the item to the customer. It also stated that ‚Äòbrick and mortar‚Äô stores are facing fierce competition from online retail companies and in order to be competitive, there is a need to improve the overall customer experience and convenience. However, introducing drones indoors also poses safety concerns. For the safety of customers, the patent stated that the flying path of the drones will be separate from that of the customers and employees. The drones will be equipped with sensors and 3D map technology to ensure that they stay on their designated space. The drones are expected to fly above shelves rather than on aisles to avoid accidents with customers. There will also be a central computer which will oversee how the drones are going around in a store. Walmart said in its patent application: ‚ÄúSo configured, one or more items of inventory can be relatively quickly and efficiently moved from one part of the retail shopping facility to other part of the retail shopping facility.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis can include moving items of inventory between non-public and public areas of retail shopping facility.‚Äù Tags Drones Previous ArticleProductivity and profit: Is your mobility strategy mature enough?

You‚Äôre Not Getting A $250 Walmart Gift Card From That Facebook¬†Link Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Surprise! You‚Äôre Not Getting A $250 Walmart Gift Card From That Facebook¬†Link Image courtesy of (Mike Mozart) March 22, 2017 12:52 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler don't click facebook gift cards it's a trap nothing ever free scam scamalamadingdong too good to be true walmart The offer of free money is hard to pass up, but, as we‚Äôve warned before, those promises of hundreds of dollars worth of gift cards, a free car or trip, and other too-good-to-be-true offers are just that. The latest version of this scheme involves a $250 Walmart gift card. The Cleveland Plain Dealer‚Äôs Teresa Dixon Murray reminded consumers of the always evolving social media-gift card offer scheme this week after a reader questioned whether the offer of a $250 Walmart gift card was real. ‚ÄúNo, Walmart is not really offering free gift cards through Facebook links, or anything else,‚Äù Dixon Murray warned. Instead, the Walmart offer is just another in a long line of scams that exist in order to get something else from users: access to their computers and any stored personal information, such as bank accounts and credit cards. This particular Walmart post asked users to click on a link in order to receive their own $250 gift card. The post, which is often shared from¬†friends‚Äô or family member accounts, reads: ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe I receive this offer on my Facebook account from a friend and I like to share it with you. I really enjoy going and shopping at Walmart they have great savings and everything that I need. If you want free $250 walmart gift card go on the link below an get the free card.‚Äù Dixon Murray notes that by clicking on the link, Facebook users could be inviting a hacker into their account to send direct messages, post false information, or otherwise wreak havoc on their social media profile. As for Walmart, the company has a dedicated Fraud Alert page warning customers about scams that might involve its name, but have nothing to do with the retailer. For example, Walmart advises people not to open or respond to unsolicited emails, pop-up ads, or text messages. It also explicitly tells customers not to click on or respond to online ads or websites offering free gift cards. The Walmart post serves as a good reminder that fraudsters like to take advantage of consumers‚Äô desire for free things, whether it be free products, trips, airline tickets, or big-ticket coupons.

The moves by Sun Art Retail Group, China‚Äôs biggest hypermarket chain, and the Chinese arms of global retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Metro AG come days after China temporarily suspended Brazilian meat imports. Safety fears over Brazilian meat have grown since police accused inspectors in the world‚Äôs biggest exporter of beef and poultry of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats. A spokeswoman for Sun Art Retail, which operates 400 Chinese hypermarkets, said yesterday that the chain removed beef supplied by top Brazilian exporters BRF SA and JBS SA from its shelves on Monday. Brazilian beef accounts for less than 10 percent of Sun Art‚Äôs beef supply, she said. Wal-Mart has also removed Brazilian meat products from its stores, a person familiar with the matter said. He declined to be quoted. Germany‚Äôs Metro has withdrawn Brazilian chicken legs and wings from its Chinese stores, said a manager, who declined to be named. The retailer, with 84 stores in China‚Äôs mainland, does not sell Brazilian beef. JD.com, one of China‚Äôs biggest online retailers, said in an e-mailed statement that it had removed all listings for imported Brazilian meat and is reviewing orders in process. While Brazilian officials sought to reassure consumers that the investigation had revealed only isolated incidents of sanitary problems, the reaction by Chinese retailers suggests that the probe could have far-reaching repercussions. Chinese consumers appeared largely unconcerned or unaware of the scandal in Brazil, with few people commenting on the issue on social media networks. But the country has been hit by its own safety scandals in the past, making retailers sensitive to any potential risks. ‚ÄúWe removed the product already on March 20,‚Äù said Sun Art‚Äôs spokeswoman, noting that this was ahead of the Chinese government‚Äôs first official comment on the issue. Brazil is the top supplier of beef to China‚Äôs mainland, accounting for about 31 percent of imports in the first half of last year. Much of it is used in canteens, while branded Brazilian beef is less prominent in supermarkets than Australian beef. Importers are expected to wait a few more days before seeking out alternative supplies, which will likely be more costly than Brazil‚Äôs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a 45-day lead-time to get any product here. What if they lift the ban by the end of the week?‚Äù said an industry source who declined to be identified. Macau has suspended imports from Brazil, the special administrative region‚Äôs civil affairs authorities said, as has the Hong Kong SAR. Major Hong Kong supermarket chain PARKnSHOP said it had removed Brazilian pork, beef and chicken from shelves. ‚ÄúTo cater for the needs of customers, we will increase the supply of meat and poultry products from other countries,‚Äù it said in a statement. Bans are also in place in Japan, Canada, Mexico and Switzerland.

Brazil, the world's biggest beef and poultry exporter, has been hit by stomach-churning allegations of corrupt practices in its meat industry. Photo - AFP ¬† Sharelines Chinese supermarkets pull Brazil meat from shelves #Chinese supermarkets pull #Brazil meat from shelves Beijing: Some of China's largest food suppliers have pulled Brazilian beef and poultry from their shelves in the first concrete sign that a deepening scandal over Brazil's meat processing industry is hitting business in its top export market. The moves by Sun Art Retail Group, China's biggest hypermarket chain, and the Chinese arms of global retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Metro AG come days after China temporarily suspended Brazilian meat imports. Safety fears over Brazilian meat have grown since police accused inspectors in the world's biggest exporter of beef and poultry of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats. A spokeswoman for Sun Art Retail, which operates 400 Chinese hypermarkets, said on Wednesday the chain had removed beef supplied by top Brazilian exporters BRF SA and JBS SA from its shelves from Monday. Brazilian beef accounts for less than 10 per cent of Sun Art's beef supply, she said. Wal-Mart has also removed Brazilian meat products from its stores, a person familiar with the matter said. He declined to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the matter. Germany's Metro has withdrawn Brazilian chicken legs and wings from its Chinese stores, said a manager, who declined to be named as he was not allowed to speak to media. The retailer, with 84 stores in China, does not sell Brazilian beef. JD.com, one of China's biggest online retailers, said in an emailed statement it had also removed all listings for imported Brazilian meat and is reviewing orders in process. While Brazilian officials sought late on Tuesday to reassure consumers that the investigation had revealed only isolated incidents of sanitary problems, the reaction by Chinese retailers suggests that the probe could have far-reaching repercussions for the world's top meat exporter. Chinese consumers appeared largely unconcerned or unaware of the scandal in Brazil, with few people commenting on the issue on the country's vibrant social media networks. But the country has been hit by its own safety scandals in the past, making retailers sensitive to any potential risks. "We removed the product already on March 20," said Sun Art's spokeswoman, noting it was ahead of the Chinese government's first official comment on the issue. Brazil is the top supplier of beef to China, accounting for about 31 per cent of its imports in the first half of last year. Much of it is used in canteens and food service and branded Brazilian beef is less prominent in supermarkets than Australian beef. Importers are expected to wait a few more days before seeking out alternative supplies, which will likely be more costly than Brazil's. "It's a 45-day lead-time to get any product here. What if they lift the ban by the end of the week?" said an industry source who declined to be identified. Hong Kong, the second-biggest buyer of Brazilian meat last year, has also issued a ban on imports, following similar steps by Japan, Canada, Mexico and Switzerland. Major Hong Kong supermarket chain PARKnSHOP said it had removed Brazilian pork, beef and chicken from shelves. "To cater for the needs of customers, we will increase the supply of meat and poultry products from other countries," it said in a statement, without elaborating. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

(file photo)¬† A Walmart distribution center, expected to add more than 500 jobs in coastal Alabama, is set to be under construction soon after county officials approved building and land disturbance permits to move the project forward. "We're excited about reaching this step in the process," said Phillip Keene, a Walmart spokesman. "We'll continue to work with state, county, city and port officials closely and we thank them for their support so far." The estimated $126.9 million project is expected to be under construction soon after county officials awarded the project manager a land disturbance permit on March 1, followed up with the building permit on March 7. The permits were issued to Ryan Midwest Construction Company Inc., to pursue the project on 400 acres of rural property west of Mobile off Interstate 10. The buildings include 2.6 million square feet of warehouse space, as well as 6,628 square feet of accessory structures. A groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled to take place next week. "It will show the next big step in the project and it truly is a significant project for the region and for Mobile," said Britton Bonner, a lawyer for the city who focuses on economic development and governmental relations. "We're on the map for ship building and airplane construction. We have a long history with the port and this puts us at a high level." The distribution center is expected to be an import hub that, when fully operational, will draw more than 600 truckloads of goods a day from the Port of Mobile. It's also expected to provide 550 full-time jobs. Agreements hatched out by Mobile city and county officials requires that residents within the county be given preferential treatment for employment. Also, vendors within south Alabama are supposed to be given consideration on business with the company at the new facility. Full-time wages are expected to average around $16.83 per hour. The project¬†is laced with public incentives that include $2.3 million each from the city and county in obtaining the land. In addition, the county is adding a property tax and sales tax abatements, and the state is also providing incentives and abatements. It's unclear on what the total dollar figures are on the incentives Walmart is receiving. According to a county document from July 2016, the city, county and state tax abatements totaled $15.3 million. The company, in order to receive the full tax credit with the state, needs to maintain a certain level of employees from Alabama. Semoon Chang, a local economist who has performed economic analysis on projects in the region, said he sees no problem in offering Walmart - the nation's No. 1 retailer - the $2.3 million in incentives from city and county taxpayers. He said Walmart, most likely, used the incentive as "a bargaining chip." "Exemption of the property tax, which should amount to over a million dollars a year, can be a very expensive incentive, although it depends on how many years," said Chang. "The point is that the location will no longer be available to other developments." The July 2016 document shows total county and state property and sales tax abatements totaling $3.5 million during the first year. But the biggest portion of the property tax, which goes toward the public school system, is not included in the abatement. Bonner said the project could also provide economic synergy to the rural area near Grand Bay, which is where the project is located. "(Walmart) went through an extensive site selection process and chose this site for a reason and for Walmart to make this type of investment in this location, they feel it's an advantageous site," he said. "We hope to see continued growth." Must-see concerts in Alabama this year ...

Grocery Shopping From The Car By Braden March 21, 2017 11:47 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter One of the hottest new trends in grocery shopping is doing it online. Whether from an app or right from your browser, you just point, click, buy, and get your products curbside at the store. Locally, we have a few stores that are participating in such programs: United Supermarket @ 3552 S. Soncy Rd. Walmart @¬†3700 E Interstate 40 Walmart @¬†4215 Canyon Dr. Walmart @¬†4610 S Coulter St. Walmart Market @¬†7251 Arden Rd Credit: Walmart I tried it out for the first time just the other night using the Walmart on Canyon Drive. Let me tell you‚Ä¶ it was awesome! I did my shopping the night before on Walmart‚Äôs Grocery website. I chose the items I wanted, either by searching for them or looking in categories. I added the items to my ‚Äúcart,‚Äù then when I had chosen what I needed, just clicked to check out. If you don‚Äôt have a free Walmart account, you will have to set one up since you are going to pay online. This will also help in locating the store closest to you. It will ask you to choose a pickup window, I chose 6-7pm since I was looking to pickup after work. Not all hours are available throughout the day, so know that you might have to adjust a little around what the store can accommodate (although the store on Canyon had slots all day). The next step was for substitutions. Since you are picking up the next day and they are grabbing items for you off the shelf just like a customer, there is a ¬†chance that the specific item you are asking for might not be available. You have the option to let the store automatically substitute a similar brand or product, or chose to get a refund at pickup if said item is out of stock. For me, I had a container of cream cheese spread that was substituted, however I did not want my banana pudding substituted, so I got a refund for it being out of stock. After you checkout and pay, there will be a confirmation email sent to you. Fast forward to 6:45pm the next day. As I left the radio station, I loaded up the Walmart Grocery app and ‚Äúchecked in.‚Äù This lets the store know I am on my way, and using GPS, it could also let them know what my expected arrival time would be. I drove to the store, looked for the orange covered parking spaces to the right of the store, and parked. Since the app was tracking me, the store had already sent an associate out to start shopping for me (if you don‚Äôt want to use the app, there is a phone number you can call to check in). I waited about 10 minutes, and was greeted at my car by a Walmart associate with a cart full of my items. She let me know about the substitution and the refund on my pudding. She helped me load up, and I was on my way! Talk about easy! Both Walmart and United offer curbside¬†service for free¬†and allow you to shop on a computer or through their grocery apps. To take it a step further, United will deliver within city limits to your location for $9.99. I believe Walmart is also looking into delivery as well. Next time you don‚Äôt feel like fighting the crowds, waiting in lines, or having to tell the kids no 25 times, try this!

How it may stay that way for a while D-Mart‚Äôs dream listing on Tuesday has prompted many enthusiasts to take its name in the same breath as Walmart. Madhuchanda Dey Moneycontrol Research D-Mart‚Äôs dream listing on Tuesday has prompted many enthusiasts to take its name in the same breath as Walmart. Walmart is largest organised retailer globally with sales exceeding USD 485bn and 11,528 stores. Walmart, founded by Sam Walton, has set the benchmarks to run a successful retail model. Our home grown D-Mart has imbibed quite a few qualities of its global peer in its business model. Like Walmart, its Indian follower has an overwhelming value-for-money proposition. D-Mart has figured out early in life that creating its own niche is important. Hence, it has ventured into select geographies with its value retailing model. A majority of its stores are owned properties thereby limiting lease rental ‚Äì a model which has a striking similarity with Walmart. D-Mart has a diversified sales mix ‚Äì 53 percent food, 20 percent FMCG and 27 percent apparel. The sales mix of Walmart is extremely diversified, with only a handful of categories namely electronics, personal care and apparel touching double-digit share. But where Walmart has been dwarfed by the aspiring Indian competitor is in the valuation stakes. At 77X price/earning, 40x EV/EBIDTA and 3.4X Market cap/Sales, D-Mart it is manifold times costlier than its global peers including the company that might well be its idol, Walmart. But that‚Äôs not without a reason. As the exhibit suggests, while much smaller than its competitors, D-Mart is way ahead in profitability. While a diversified (predominantly non-food) basket ensures relatively decent operating profit margin for Walmart, Walgreens Boots and Carrefour SA, D-Mart, with food accounting for a lion‚Äôs share of sales, has much higher profitability. That‚Äôs not all. The global giants are like lumbering elephants ‚Äì in the past three years the compound annual growth in sales of the top three global retailers, Walmart, Costco and Kroger were 0.7 percent, 4.1 percent and 4.4 percent respectively. In contrast, D-Mart grew at CAGR of 35.6 percent. The moot question is: How long will this fancy valuation sustain? Simply put, as long as the company grows at this scorching pace without compromising on profitability. Investors should thus focus on two parameters ‚Äì topline growth and EBIDTA margin.It is important to remember that returns in equities are a function of earnings as well as multiple re-rating. For Avenue Supermarts, the post-listing price factors in healthy earnings and the multiple has already re-rated. Going forward, even if earnings grow at the previous trajectory, further multiple re-rating is unlikely and returns on the stock will solely be a function of earnings growth. On the flip side, if earnings fail to grow at the anticipated pace, multiples might de-rate. Hence, investors should keep a hawk eye on earnings before catching the highs on this stock. tags #Avenue Supermarts #Business #business model #Carrefour SA #D-Mart #valuable retailer #Walgreens Boots #Walmart Related news Business 5 large-cap stocks with the rare combo of good fundamentals & decent valuations Mar 23, 2017 06:01 PM Business 4G contributed 60% of incremental data traffic in 2016: Survey Mar 23, 2017 05:31 PM Business Bharti AXA Life launches 'Income Protection Plan' Mar 23, 2017 04:53 PM Business Tata Capital launches mobile app to offer personal loans Mar 23, 2017 04:37 PM Business Yes Bank to launch QIP Thursday, looks to raise $600 mn, say sources Mar 23, 2017 04:17 PM Business TFS Corp eyeing¬†to make India biggest business partner Mar 23, 2017 04:15 PM Business USFDA issues warning letter to USV Pvt over Daman plant Mar 23, 2017 04:15 PM Business EPFO sets up district offices to widen PF net, implement housing scheme Mar 23, 2017 04:13 PM Business Power Grid: The Technology Frontier!

Ralph Stout, 52, has been charged with retail theft for allegedly stealing the toys from the Rantoul Wal-Mart on at least two occasions. He is scheduled to appear in Champaign County Circuit Court on April 5. Rantoul police Sgt. Justin Bouse said Stout is also a suspect in the theft of toys from the Urbana Wal-Mart. Bouse said Rantoul police were contacted on March 1 by Wal-Mart officials, who said on two occasions in February, a man came into the store and stole 147 Lego miniature figures. "Through the video, we were able to identify his particulars" but didn't know the man's identity, Bouse said. "A few days later, (Wal-Mart officials) said this same person had stolen some items at the Rantoul Wal-Mart but had also gotten his car serviced and used his name and identified himself as Ralph Stout." Stout was allegedly stealing the toys by putting them in his pockets. Bouse said police were able to contact Stout, and on March 14, he traveled to Rantoul, where he was charged. He would not give a statement about the alleged theft, Bouse said. The toys have not been recovered. "It sounds like these Lego miniatures might have some after-market value, depending on which figure it is," Bouse said. "They might sell for as high as $40 apiece for each." Retail theft is a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to 364 days in the county jail. Dave Hinton is editor of the Rantoul Press, a News-Gazette community newspaper.

The moves by Sun Art Retail Group, China's biggest hypermarket chain, and the Chinese arms of global retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Metro AG come days after China temporarily suspended Brazilian meat imports. Safety fears over Brazilian meat have grown since police accused inspectors in the world's biggest exporter of beef and poultry of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats. A spokeswoman for Sun Art Retail, which operates 400 Chinese hypermarkets, said on Wednesday the chain had removed beef supplied by top Brazilian exporters BRF SA and JBS SA from its shelves from Monday. Brazilian beef accounts for less than 10 percent of Sun Art's beef supply, she said. Wal-Mart has also removed Brazilian meat products from its stores, a person familiar with the matter said. He declined to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the matter. Germany's Metro has withdrawn Brazilian chicken legs and wings from its Chinese stores, said a manager, who declined to be named as he was not allowed to speak to media. The retailer, with 84 stores in China, does not sell Brazilian beef. JD.com, one of China's biggest online retailers, said in an emailed statement it had also removed all listings for imported Brazilian meat and is reviewing orders in process. While Brazilian officials sought late on Tuesday to reassure consumers that the investigation had revealed only isolated incidents of sanitary problems, the reaction by Chinese retailers suggests that the probe could have far-reaching repercussions for the world's top meat exporter. Chinese consumers appeared largely unconcerned or unaware of the scandal in Brazil, with few people commenting on the issue on the country's vibrant social media networks. But the country has been hit by its own safety scandals in the past, making retailers sensitive to any potential risks. "We removed the product already on March 20," said Sun Art's spokeswoman, noting it was ahead of the Chinese government's first official comment on the issue. Brazil is the top supplier of beef to China, accounting for about 31 percent of its imports in the first half of last year. Much of it is used in canteens and foodservice and branded Brazilian beef is less prominent in supermarkets than Australian beef. Importers are expected to wait a few more days before seeking out alternative supplies, which will likely be more costly than Brazil's. "It's a 45-day lead-time to get any product here. What if they lift the ban by the end of the week?" said an industry source who declined to be identified. Hong Kong, the second-biggest buyer of Brazilian meat last year, has also issued a ban on imports, following similar steps by Japan, Canada, Mexico and Switzerland. Major Hong Kong supermarket chain PARKnSHOP said it had removed Brazilian pork, beef and chicken from shelves. "To cater for the needs of customers, we will increase the supply of meat and poultry products from other countries," it said in a statement, without elaborating.

The moves by Sun Art Retail Group, China‚Äôs biggest hypermarket chain, and the Chinese arms of global retail giants Wal-Mart Stores ¬†and Metro AG come days after China temporarily suspended Brazilian meat imports. Safety fears over Brazilian meat have grown since police accused inspectors in the world‚Äôs biggest exporter of beef and poultry of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats. A spokeswoman for Sun Art Retail, which operates 400 Chinese hypermarkets, said on Wednesday (March 22) ¬†the chain had removed beef supplied by top Brazilian exporters BRF SA and JBS SA from its shelves from Monday. Brazilian beef accounts for less than 10 per cent of Sun Art‚Äôs beef supply, she said. Wal-Mart has also removed Brazilian meat products from its stores, a person familiar with the matter said. He declined to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the matter. Germany‚Äôs Metro has withdrawn Brazilian chicken legs and wings from its Chinese stores, said a manager, who declined to be named as he was not allowed to speak to media. The retailer, with 84 stores in China, does not sell Brazilian beef. ¬† ST_20170320_VNMEAT_3016852.jpg Related Story Brazil hit by massive tainted meat scandal JD.com, one of China‚Äôs biggest online retailers, said in an emailed statement it had also removed all listings for imported Brazilian meat and is reviewing orders in process. While Brazilian officials sought late on Tuesday to reassure consumers that the investigation had revealed only isolated incidents of sanitary problems, the reaction by Chinese retailers suggests that the probe could have far-reaching repercussions for the world‚Äôs top meat exporter. Chinese consumers appeared largely unconcerned or unaware of the scandal in Brazil, with few people commenting on the issue on the country‚Äôs vibrant social media networks. But the country has been hit by its own safety scandals in the past, making retailers sensitive to any potential risks.¬† ‚ÄúWe removed the product already on March 20,‚Äù said Sun Art‚Äôs spokeswoman, noting it was ahead of the Chinese government‚Äôs first official comment on the issue. Brazil is the top supplier of beef to China, accounting for about 31 per cent of its imports in the first half of last year. Much of it is used in canteens and foodservice and branded Brazilian beef is less prominent in supermarkets than Australian beef. Importers are expected to wait a few more days before seeking out alternative supplies, which will likely be more costly than Brazil‚Äôs.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a 45-day lead-time to get any product here. What if they lift the ban by the end of the week?‚Äù said an industry source who declined to be identified. Hong Kong, the second-biggest buyer of Brazilian meat last year, has also issued a ban on imports, following similar steps by Japan, Canada, Mexico and Switzerland. Major Hong Kong supermarket chain PARKnSHOP said it had removed Brazilian pork, beef and chicken from shelves.¬† ‚ÄúTo cater for the needs of customers, we will increase the supply of meat and poultry products from other countries,‚Äù it said in a statement, without elaborating.¬† Topics:¬† CHINA BRAZIL FOOD HYGIENE/SAFETY More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/47Lx Copy BrandInsider Sponsored Content sponsorednative.jpg What you need to know about Tanah Merah‚Äôs newest condominium st-web-special.jpg Fun with Mathematics.

The moves by Sun Art Retail Group <6808.HK>, China's biggest hypermarket chain, and the Chinese arms of global retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> and Metro AG <MEOG.DE> come days after China temporarily suspended Brazilian meat imports. Safety fears over Brazilian meat have grown since police accused inspectors in the world's biggest exporter of beef and poultry of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats. A spokeswoman for Sun Art Retail, which operates 400 Chinese hypermarkets, said on Wednesday the chain had removed beef supplied by top Brazilian exporters BRF SA <BRFS3.SA> and JBS SA <JBSS3.SA> from its shelves from Monday. Brazilian beef accounts for less than 10 percent of Sun Art's beef supply, she said. Wal-Mart has also removed Brazilian meat products from its stores, a person familiar with the matter said. He declined to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the matter. Germany's Metro has withdrawn Brazilian chicken legs and wings from its Chinese stores, said a manager, who declined to be named as he was not allowed to speak to media. The retailer, with 84 stores in China, does not sell Brazilian beef. JD.com<JD.O>, one of China's biggest online retailers, said in an emailed statement it had also removed all listings for imported Brazilian meat and is reviewing orders in process. While Brazilian officials sought late on Tuesday to reassure consumers that the investigation had revealed only isolated incidents of sanitary problems, the reaction by Chinese retailers suggests that the probe could have far-reaching repercussions for the world's top meat exporter. Chinese consumers appeared largely unconcerned or unaware of the scandal in Brazil, with few people commenting on the issue on the country's vibrant social media networks. But the country has been hit by its own safety scandals in the past, making retailers sensitive to any potential risks. "We removed the product already on March 20," said Sun Art's spokeswoman, noting it was ahead of the Chinese government's first official comment on the issue. Brazil is the top supplier of beef to China, accounting for about 31 percent of its imports in the first half of last year. Much of it is used in canteens and foodservice and branded Brazilian beef is less prominent in supermarkets than Australian beef. Importers are expected to wait a few more days before seeking out alternative supplies, which will likely be more costly than Brazil's. "It's a 45-day lead-time to get any product here. What if they lift the ban by the end of the week?" said an industry source who declined to be identified. Hong Kong, the second-biggest buyer of Brazilian meat last year, has also issued a ban on imports, following similar steps by Japan, Canada, Mexico and Switzerland. Major Hong Kong supermarket chain PARKnSHOP said it had removed Brazilian pork, beef and chicken from shelves. "To cater for the needs of customers, we will increase the supply of meat and poultry products from other countries," it said in a statement, without elaborating.

She posted something on Facebook that sounds too good to be true, but I'm sure she wouldn't have posted it if it weren't real. She said she received a $250 gift card to Walmart at no charge, and her Facebook friends could get a free gift card too by clicking on a link she shared. Have you heard of this? Is Walmart really offering free gift cards as part of some kind of promotion? G.C., Olmsted Falls A: I have heard of scams like this. Yes, it's a scam. No, Walmart is not really offering free gift cards through Facebook links, or anything else. These types of "offers" are created by thieves who are hoping they can lure people to go on websites that are harmful and will lead to computer viruses or identity theft or something else nasty. In some cases, clicking on the link can allow a bad guy to hijack your Facebook profile so they can send out direct messages to your friends or post false information like an offer to get a $250 Walmart gift card. Walmart itself has information¬†on its website that says this: Don't open or respond to unsolicited e-mails, Internet pop-up ads, or text messages indicating you've won a gift card or asking that you complete a survey. Don't click on or respond to online ads or websites offering free gift cards. Remember, if it sounds too good to believe, it is! Walmart does not offer gift cards via email or text messages, or for "likes" or sharing on social media sites. Walmart will only call or text you with offers if you opt-in to receive such messages. Walmart will never ask you to email personal information such as: Passwords, Social Security number, bank account details, credit card numbers, other financial information. Walmart will not make unsolicited calls or send emails asking for such information.¬† You hit on the key in your second sentence: "if something sounds too good to be true." I would add to that filter. If something sounds odd, if something seems not quite right, we should question it, no matter the source. It's unfortunate today that, with technology, we can get emails that look like they're coming from a friend, but they're not. We can get phone calls that seem to be from our bank or our grandson or the IRS, but they're not. We can get text messages that seem like they're from our credit card company or email provider, but they're not. The goal with these scams is always about stealing personal information or money or both. Help yourself by not clicking on links you weren't expecting, even from people you know. Help yourself by not providing information to people who may not be who you think they are. Help yourself by doing a little homework -- type "$250 Walmart gift card scam" into an internet search engine like Google or Yahoo and you'll quickly learn what I did. You have to be proactive in taking care of yourself. Always be vigilant. Always be suspicious. Don't be afraid of appearing to be rude or leery.

The incubator will be called Store No 8, a reference to a Wal-Mart location where the company experimented with new store layouts. Marc Lore, chief executive of Wal-Mart‚Äôs e-commerce operations, announced the incubator on Monday at the ShopTalk conference in Las Vegas. Share this story AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File The world‚Äôs biggest retailer has been overhauling its online team to better challenge Amazon.com with greater selection and lower prices. Lore founded Jet.com, which Wal-Mart purchased in September for about $3.3 billion (R41.8 billion) in pursuit of Amazon in the e-commerce race. Lore said Wal-Mart has an advantage over ‚Äúpure play‚Äù e-commerce companies because of its large network of stores that attract shoppers for such items as fresh food.

Store No 8 is the latest example of Lore‚Äôs influence on Wal-Mart. In January, Lore announced management changes and a new incubation and strategic-partnerships division. Lore gave more details about the division, including its name and areas of focus, at the conference on Monday. The incubator will partner with start-ups, venture capitalists and academics to promote innovation in robotics, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence.¬† Bloomberg Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Disgraced former SABC executive in line for top job 2 Black woman, you're on your own 3 Former Miss SA forces couple to apologise for 'monkey' slur 4 #ORTamboHeist: Lambo owner is no thief, says lawyer 5 PICS: London attack death toll rises to 5 Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

This is hardly a surprise: last year they bought the nascent Jet.com¬†marketplace for $3.3bn. And with that acquisition came Marc Lore who had founded Jet and has a rich heritage in ecommerce. He‚Äôs now CEO of Walmart eCommerce U.S. And this week Lore and others have been talking about future plans at the Shoptalk conference in Las Vegas.

It will focus on enterprises that employ all the latest futurist buzzwords and technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence and augmented reality.

Marc Lore, who oversees Walmart‚Äôs e-commerce division, announced Store No. 8 during the recent ShopTalk conference in Las Vegas. As The New York Times highlights, the incubator is named after a retail location the company used to experiment with new store layouts. Store No. 8 will work with startups, academics and venture capitalists to identify and promote innovations in robotics, augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning that can be used within the company (presumably both in retail and behind the scenes to assist with e-commerce). Lore came to Walmart through its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com last summer after co-founding the e-commerce startup in 2014. Store No. 8 will be led by Seth Beal, formerly a senior vice president for global marketplace and digital store operations with Walmart, and Katie Finnegan, who was in charge of Jet‚Äôs corporate development. The incubator is yet another step in Walmart‚Äôs efforts to revamp its strategy and better position itself to do battle against e-commerce titan Amazon. In theory, it stands a solid chance to succeed as any worthwhile venture that hatches will have the financial backing of Walmart which has a current market cap of around $215 billion.

Watch LIVE | Video library | Vote in our daily poll | Learn more about today's segments How To Find A Nintendo¬†Switch March 21, 2017 9:23 PM 31-year-old Nao Imoto poses with her newly purchased Nintendo Switch game console at a shop in Tokyo on March 3, 2017. Nintendo\'s new game console, Switch is put on the Japanese market from March 3, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA (Photo credit should read TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA/AFP/Getty Images) SACRAMENTO (CBS13) ‚Äî¬†It‚Äôs been nearly three weeks since the Nintendo Switch was released, and it has become very difficult to find in stores or online. That scarcity has people paying up to $500 on eBay just to get their hands on Nintendo‚Äôs new system that‚Äôs a portable and console hybrid. That‚Äôs¬†$200 more than the actual price, but there are a few ways to track one down. Searching store websites directly won‚Äôt get you too far. Most have it listed as sold out, while some like Target simply aren‚Äôt bothering with online sales at all, instead directing customers to their stores. I LIKE TEXT MESSAGE ALERTS If you‚Äôre the kind of person with¬†a free monitor, or who likes text message alerts, Zoolert is a good resource. It tracks the online stock of retailers such as GameStop, Best Buy and Amazon and alerts people the moment items come back in stock. I found the text alerts to be reliable, but the best way to keep track is to have the browser window open and have audio alerts enabled. It was faster to try and jump on and buy an item after hearing a rooster crow than it was to follow a text alert to the store. I‚Äôll pause a moment to say when the Switch comes back in stock online, it will disappear quickly. In most cases, the item is up for two minutes before it‚Äôs sold out, and that‚Äôs being generous. Some sites like Best Buy won‚Äôt hold it in your cart through the checkout process, so you have to act fast. I‚ÄôD RATHER TAP F5 FURIOUSLY When it comes to in-store stock, I‚Äôve found iStockNow to be the most reliable, though there‚Äôs a catch. First the good: The site features a live map that can be rounded down to just¬†stores that have product in stock and new arrivals. It also features a listing of which stores have recently added more stock. Now for the caveat‚Äîit has issues tracking Walmart‚Äôs stock.¬†That‚Äôs not iStockNow‚Äôs problem, that‚Äôs just how Walmart handles its inventory system. You‚Äôll notice plenty of Walmart locations¬†with product listed in stock, but when you call there will be none. That‚Äôs because those inventory numbers also include pre-orders that customers have up to 30 days to pick up. Part of that comes from people being forgetful, but unfortunately, the Walmart system also enables scalpers with a risk-free way to move consoles. They can list a Nintendo Switch on eBay at a premium and if it doesn‚Äôt sell, they can just not pick up the Switch and get a refund when Walmart releases their preorder. CHANGE IS IN THE AIR The good news is¬†after the past week of difficulty finding Switches, there is hope on the way. Gamestop¬†has said it will be stocking its stores this week with console-only units (previously, the company tried to add $200 of accessories it otherwise might not sell to the purchase of a Switch), and Nintendo announced last week it will be doubling its production starting in April. Both of these factors bode well for people on the hunt for the portable home console. The exact arrival date of those units is unclear.¬†While Gamestop has announced they will be in stock on Wednesday, some stores reported getting theirs and selling out on Tuesday, while others in the Sacramento area have told me they aren‚Äôt expecting the shipment until Thursday. SO HOW DID YOU GET ONE? I‚Äôll be honest, none of the above solutions were the only reason I ended up finding one. I had attempted to track down a couple that were listed on iStockNow at a couple of local Target locations, but those had sold by the time I arrived. In most cases, those will disappear sometime around when the store opens, and the stock listings may not update that quickly. I followed a few text alerts and rooster crows from Zoolert, but the blinding speed of which some of these items disappeared¬†proved too much for me. Sadly, I can‚Äôt keep up with bots like I used to, and the scripts people are using are just getting better and better. Occasionally, there‚Äôs a listing on eBay that can drop below $400, or where someone will take¬†a Best Offer at around that price, but I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to pay that much over the listing price. It was fun to poke and prod some of the scalpers a few times trying to convince them they were pricing their items too high. In the end,¬†I had to hustle to get one. No, I didn‚Äôt run some shady scheme or pay off an employee somewhere to hold one. I literally hustled. The Best Buy in Elk Grove has shown the Switch ‚Äúon display‚Äù for a couple of days. It‚Äôs a vague stocking term that supposedly means there‚Äôs a demo unit there for people to try, but when I got there it was the same display I‚Äôd seen at other stores. This is the part where I share my most helpful tip: Try talking to someone. I know, it seems so crazy! Odds are by now you will not be the first person who has asked, nor will you be the last. Being a jackass and demanding things won‚Äôt get you anywhere, but a smile and an understanding tone might be able to help grease things along. In this case, I lucked out with someone who really wanted to help me find one and was able to search their system. While there wasn‚Äôt one in stock in their store, they found one nearby that they could reserve and set aside as long as I drove there to get it. SOME HELPFUL HINTS¬† If you‚Äôre planning on finding one, first look at the date when this was posted‚Äîif it‚Äôs August, you really need to try something different. But if it‚Äôs within the next few days, try calling your local Gamestop‚Äôs to see if a shipment has come in, or when they might be expecting one. This may require you to wait outside for the store to open, which really doesn‚Äôt work for anyone working a 9 to 5. And make sure when you call that you‚Äôre not being a jackass. If you‚Äôre worried about how you‚Äôll come across, try smiling as you talk on the phone. If that doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôd recommend against the eBay route. With¬†Switches going for roughly 25 percent above the asking price right now, it‚Äôs just not worth it, especially for a console without a pack-in game. That 25 percent could cover The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild instead. Instead, keep an eye on Zoolert and iStockNow for possible new stock and be ready to act quickly. The prime time I‚Äôve noticed Zoolert updates has been between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. PDT. And remember, it‚Äôs not the end of the world if you don‚Äôt end up with one today or tomorrow or next week. The stock will improve in the next month, and the unclaimed Walmart preorders should be released around April 1. Comments Comments are closed.

Sears Holdings, the holding company for the two iconic retail brands, warned investors late Tuesday that it can‚Äôt promise it will stay in business. It included the language in its annual report while insisting it might still turn things around. ‚ÄúOur historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern,‚Äù said the statement. While its recent history has been written in red ink, Sears was once one of the nation‚Äôs most powerful companies, both the Walmart and Amazon of its time. But its once-proud brands have mostly been forgotten by the modern American shopper. Now Sears Holdings is not even sure it can raise enough cash through loans and debt financing to survive. The company owes $4.2 billion, up from about $3 billion a year ago. It lost $2.2 billion in the fiscal year ending in January and has not turned an annual profit since 2010. Its losses since then total $10.4 billion. Sears Holdings said its ability to sell assets, such as stores and store leases, could be limited because it needs those assets to pay for pension plans. In January, Sears sold its Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker. It is looking to sell Kenmore appliances and Diehard auto parts. The company issued a statement later Wednesday stressing that despite the cautionary language in the annual report, it believes it is on course to turn around its struggling business. ‚ÄúIt is very important to reiterate that Sears Holdings remains focused on executing our transformation plan,‚Äù said Chief Financial Officer Jason Hollar. ‚ÄúThis is evident in the decisive actions we have taken in recent months. Despite the risks outlined we remain confident in our financial position.‚Äù Still, Sears Holdings has been in trouble almost since the 2005 merger that joined the two department store brands. At the start of 2006, it had 3,400 U.S. stores and 370 more in Canada that it has since sold. By the end of this January, it had only 1,400 stores left, all in the United States. The company still has 140,000 employees, but that too is down sharply from the 355,000 it had in 2006. Even that doesn‚Äôt tell the full picture of the decline. Sears was once the nation‚Äôs largest retailer and business employer. Long before the ascendance of Walmart, and decades before Amazon was even born, the Sears catalog was how many Americans learned to shop from home for a large variety of items they wanted. It developed an extensive store network, helping furnish homes as Americans moved to the suburbs after World War II ‚Äî and causing trouble for small, locally owned shops. The company at one time grew to include not just the retail business but a bank, a brokerage, a real estate company and what was then the world‚Äôs tallest building, the Sears Tower, for its Chicago headquarters. Kmart had a proud tradition of its own as one of the first major discount chains. Its history, like that of Sears, stretches to the late 19th century. It became known for its ‚Äúblue light specials,‚Äù short-lived sales signaled by a flashing light and a public address announcement. Kmart also bought many other retail chains that have since gone out of business, including Borders Books and Sports Authority. It filed for bankruptcy in 2002 shortly before Sears merged with its remains. The retail landscape is littered with storied brands that have closed in recent years as brick-and-mortar stores became an albatross in the face of growing competition online. Just in the last year, Sports Authority and The Limited have closed, and RadioShack and American Apparel are both in their second bankruptcies and in danger of shutting down. Macy‚Äôs, JCPenney and Staples have announced widespread store closing plans. The problems for Sears started well before the growth of online shopping. More than 20 years ago, it began to suffer from competition from low-price competitors such as Walmart, and big-box stores such as Home Depot. It lost its place in the Dow Jones index of the nation‚Äôs most important companies in 1999. Then came growing competition from Amazon and other online retailers. Analysts said Sears Holdings did little to invest in either the Sears or Kmart brand, instead trying to cut its way back to profitability by trimming advertising and closing stores. It announced plans to close 150 more stores in January, and its stock hit a post-merger low in February. Then the stock rebounded when the company announced a deal with creditors to borrow $140 million more and cut at least $1 billion in operating costs a year, along with reducing its debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion. The ‚Äúgoing concern‚Äù warning sent shares down about 15% in midday trading Wednesday.

By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO and HANNAH WEIKEL Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) - Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids, has said that after years of losing money that there is "substantial doubt" it will be able to keep its doors open. But it also insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. It was still a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. "I bought my tools from Sears and I've still got them," Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. "It's a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. "But it's been underinvested and bled dry." Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors' fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on "executing our transformation plan" and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it's highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with "regulatory standards." Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it's selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. "They're past the tipping point," Perkins said. "This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be." For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. "When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears," said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. "We still have some of those." Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. "They've been delusional about their ability to turn around the business," said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. "It has a lot of good memories," he said. "It stands for being dependable and reliable." ___ Weikel reported from St. Paul, Minnesota. AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report from Newark, New Jersey.

The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. ‚ÄúWhen I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears,‚Äù said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe still have some of those.‚Äù Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogues as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe‚Äôs and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,‚Äù said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalogue. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. ‚ÄúIt has a lot of good memories,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt stands for being dependable and reliable.‚Äù Like Us Follow @cdnbiz Subscribe with Texture Get our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy.

See Offers Business Posted Yesterday at 6:51 PM increase font size Storied retailer Sears could see the end Losses are piling by the billions for the venerable chain that so many Americans grew up with. By and HANNAH WEIKELAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK ‚Äî Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids, has said that after years of losing money that there is ‚Äúsubstantial doubt‚Äù it will be able to keep its doors open. But it also insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. It was still a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Former Sears employee Cal Brown stands in front of the Augusta Sears that, like so many others of its kind, will soon close as modern shopping trends online and elsewhere. Staff photo by Joe Phelan Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store ‚Üí Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. In Maine, Sears operates regular department stores in Augusta, Bangor, Brunswick and South Portland and its smaller ‚ÄúHometown‚Äù stores in Belfast, Biddeford, Caribou, Ellsworth, Farmington, Fort Kent, Houlton, Newport and Windham. The Augusta store is closing this month. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. ‚ÄúI bought my tools from Sears and I‚Äôve still got them,‚Äù Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape,‚Äù said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs been underinvested and bled dry.‚Äù Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors‚Äô fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on ‚Äúexecuting our transformation plan‚Äù and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it‚Äôs highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with ‚Äúregulatory standards.‚Äù Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it‚Äôs selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre past the tipping point,‚Äù Perkins said. ‚ÄúThis is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.‚Äù For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape.

It was still a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalogue business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. ‚ÄúI bought my tools from Sears and I‚Äôve still got them,‚Äù Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape,‚Äù said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs been underinvested and bled dry.‚Äù Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 per cent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors‚Äô fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on ‚Äúexecuting our transformation plan‚Äù and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it‚Äôs highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with ‚Äúregulatory standards.‚Äù Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it‚Äôs selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre past the tipping point,‚Äù Perkins said. ‚ÄúThis is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.‚Äù For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.‚Äôs storied catalogue featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. ‚ÄúWhen I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears,‚Äù said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe still have some of those.‚Äù Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogues as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe‚Äôs and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,‚Äù said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalogue. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. ‚ÄúIt has a lot of good memories,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt stands for being dependable and reliable.‚Äù ___ Weikel reported from St. Paul, Minnesota.

Tad Cummins, a former health sciences teacher at Culleoka High School, has been charged with aggravated kidnapping of Elizabeth Thomas. The girl has not been seen or heard from since March 13. 'He convinced her that he had been a secret agent and ... that he had all kinds of money,' Anthony Thomas told HLN. 'It was clear that he had really put a lot of notions into her head.' Liar, liar: The father of missing Tennessee girl Elizabeth Thomas, 15, left, says her teacher and alleged kidnapper Tad Cummins, 50, convinced her he was a former CIa and FBI agent flush with cash¬† The¬†Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has released this picture, taken in January, showing¬†Elizabeth Thomas at school with her former teacher and the man who allegedly abducted her,¬†Tad Cummins But according to authorities, Cummins, who is married and has children and grandchildren, was not a secret agent of any kind and has very limited resources. Mr Thomas also said that Cummins had spun stories to other students in his forensics class about his past as an undercover agent. 'They were all convinced that he had been with the FBI and CIA and that he had been with Special Forces,' Thomas said. He had been suspended from his teaching job and eventually fired after another allegedly student caught a glimpse of Cummins and Thomas exchanging a kiss in class just weeks before the pair took off.¬†¬† The teen's father said when he learned of the allegations and confronted his daughter about her relationship with Cummins, Elizabeth insisted that he was just her teacher and a 'mentor,' and that the student who claimed to have seen them kiss had lied.¬† Elizabeth's sister told ABC News that the teen was being bullied in school by both classmates and teachers over the alleged kissing episode and told her, 'I just have to get away, we have to get away.' Amber Alerts for Thomas remained in effect in Tennessee and in neighboring Alabama but police say Thomas and Cummins could be 'anywhere'. Law enforcement sources told ABC News on Wednesday that Cummins is believed to have watched a TV show about living off the grid before the pair went on the run. And it was revealed earlier this week that Cummins did a number of online searches for the topic of teen marriage on March 5.¬† The 50-year-old also researched whether his car could be tracked by law enforcement, News Channel 5 reports.¬† The disturbing new information was announced after a shocking picture taken of the teenager at school with Cummins was published. The photograph, released by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, shows Thomas sat at a desk with the teacher, her elbow resting on the table as she listens to him talk.¬† The TBI said it was taken in January - just days before Cummins allegedly had sexual contact with Thomas on school property.¬† The agency said it is still hopeful of: 'reuniting the young girl with her family, friends, and community.' The picture was released hours after the 15-year-old's family said she she warned them to call police if she did not return home by 6pm on the day she vanished.¬† Authorities however say it is 'entirely likely' she does not yet consider herself a victim and chose to go with him willingly. Speaking after the picture was published, Thomas' father, Anthony, told People Magazine¬†Cummins preyed on his daughter.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2017, file photo, shoppers walk into a Sears store in Pittsburgh. Sears said that there is √¢‚Ç¨≈°√É‚Äû√É¬∫substantial doubt√¢‚Ç¨≈°√É‚Äû√É¬π that it will be able to remain in business. The company, which runs Kmart and its namesake stores, has struggled for years with weak sales. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) NEW YORK ‚Äì Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids, has said that after years of losing money that there is ‚Äúsubstantial doubt‚Äù it will be able to keep its doors open. But it also insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. It was still a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalogue business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. ‚ÄúI bought my tools from Sears and I‚Äôve still got them,‚Äù Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape,‚Äù said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs been underinvested and bled dry.‚Äù Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 per cent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors‚Äô fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on ‚Äúexecuting our transformation plan‚Äù and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it‚Äôs highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with ‚Äúregulatory standards.‚Äù Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it‚Äôs selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre past the tipping point,‚Äù Perkins said. ‚ÄúThis is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.‚Äù For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.‚Äôs storied catalogue featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. ‚ÄúWhen I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears,‚Äù said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe still have some of those.‚Äù Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogues as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe‚Äôs and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,‚Äù said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalogue. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. ‚ÄúIt has a lot of good memories,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt stands for being dependable and reliable.‚Äù ___ Weikel reported from St. Paul, Minnesota.

Sears said that there is "substantial doubt" that it will be able to remain in business. The company, which runs Kmart and its namesake stores, has struggled for years with weak sales. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on March 22, 2017 at 3:31 PM comments NEW YORK -- Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids and the place newlyweds went to choose appliances, has said that after years of losing money that there is "substantial doubt" it will be able to keep its doors open. It's a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday (March 21) it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. "I bought my tools from Sears and I've still got them," Jack Walsh said. Corrects spelling of J.C.

Penney, MacyaEUs and Kmart; 3c x 4 3/4 inches; 146 mm x 120 mm; AP graphic¬† The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. "It's a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. "But it's been underinvested and bled dry." Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors' fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on "executing our transformation plan" and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it's highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with "regulatory standards." Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it's selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. "They're past the tipping point," Perkins said. "This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be." For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. "When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears," said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. "We still have some of those." Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. "They've been delusional about their ability to turn around the business," said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. "It has a lot of good memories," he said. "It stands for being dependable and reliable." - Anne D'Innocenzio and Hannah Weikel, Associated Press; AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Business Names in the News Does your company have a recent hire, promotion, appointment or honoree to announce?

But it also insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. It was still a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. "I bought my tools from Sears and I've still got them," Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. "It's a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. "But it's been underinvested and bled dry." Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors' fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on "executing our transformation plan" and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it's highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with "regulatory standards." Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it's selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. "They're past the tipping point," Perkins said. "This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be." For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. "When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears," said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. "We still have some of those." Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. "They've been delusional about their ability to turn around the business," said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. "It has a lot of good memories," he said. "It stands for being dependable and reliable." ___ Weikel reported from St. Paul, Minnesota. AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report from Newark, New Jersey.

(Gene J. Puskar | AP Photo) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press Follow on Twitter on March 22, 2017 at 3:03 PM comments NEW YORK (AP) -- Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids and the place newlyweds went to choose appliances, has said that after years of losing money that there is "substantial doubt" it will be able to keep its doors open. It's a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. "I bought my tools from Sears and I've still got them," Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. "It's a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. "But it's been underinvested and bled dry." Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors' fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on "executing our transformation plan" and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it's highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with "regulatory standards." Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it's selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. "They're past the tipping point," Perkins said. "This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be." For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. "When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears," said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. "We still have some of those." Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. "They've been delusional about their ability to turn around the business," said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. "It has a lot of good memories," he said. "It stands for being dependable and reliable."

Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. "They're past the tipping point," Perkins said. "This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be." For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. "When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears," said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. "We still have some of those." Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. "They've been delusional about their ability to turn around the business," said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. "It has a lot of good memories," he said. "It stands for being dependable and reliable." ___ Weikel reported from St. Paul, Minnesota. AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report from Newark, New Jersey.

As part of the plan, the retail and supermarket chain will also remodel over 50 stores, add more than 5,000 jobs, and further develop a large distribution center near the capital city of Santiago. "We are confident in the future potential of the country, and we are convinced that spaces exist to continue expanding our low-cost model," Walmart Chile general manager Horacio Barbeito said in a statement. "Both in the high and low moments of the economic cycle, consumers are always interested in using their budget efficiently, and this will continue being our focus." Chile's economy has struggled in recent years amid low prices for key export copper and lagging business confidence. Gross domestic product in the fourth quarter contracted 0.4 percent from the prior quarter, worse than forecast, and first-quarter 2017 figures will be affected by a work stoppage at Chile's largest mine. In its statement, Wal-Mart said the expansion plan will focus on medium-sized stores, such as the company's Express de Lider and Super Bodega aCuenta formats. The distribution center is already under construction and will require 2,000 employees and $180 million in investment, the company added. The company said it will also seek to improve its online department. Online retail has been on the rise in parts of Latin America in recent years, and other Chilean retailers such as Falabella <FAL.SN> and Cencosud <CEN.SN> have invested significant sums in this area.

Because Texas. It was just a spur-of-the moment thing, but probably not the greatest idea ‚Äì since floors are slick, horses are shod, and they can spook. It‚Äôs the video everyone is talking about, although the original clip features language that‚Äôs a bit on the strong side. No one was charged in the incident, and the riders were simply asked to leave by store security. Back in the early days of Billy Bob‚Äôs Texas one of the pickup riders from the bull arena would often ride his horse into the VIP room, and I imagine a beer or two was involved in this story too.

Bryan Gildenberg, chief knowledge officer of Kantar Retail, argued that a myriad of changes ‚Äî sparked by a variety of developments ranging from new store formats to technology ‚Äî is radically changing the way consumers decide what they buy, where they buy it, and how much they will spend. ‚ÄúGrowth is going to be harder to come by,‚Äù he predicted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have to get good at more stuff.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just e-commerce, it‚Äôs not just Aldi and Lidl, but the variety of footprints through which food is sold are all changing,‚Äù Gildenberg added. ‚ÄúThose changes are going to put an enormous amount of pressure not just on the formats themselves, but on the core formats that have always sold food. Those formats are going to have to retool, re-engineer and figure out what they‚Äôre going to do.‚Äù Consumer decisions about where they shop are increasingly influenced by convenience and targeted by specialty banners designed around such trips, often blunting the advantages of so-called ‚Äúone-stop shops.‚Äù Stores should focus on providing solutions to learn to accommodate such shoppers, he said. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs 6:30 and you‚Äôre hungry, and looking for something to bring home for your family, a deeply immersive center store experience is not what you‚Äôre looking for,‚Äù Gildenberg remarked. ‚ÄúThe other challenge is that boxes are going up specifically designed for these occasions more distinctly and discretely. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really in the business of selling shoppers solutions, and the solution is something that saves them time,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúSometimes that‚Äôs about creating a really great, wonderful experience and sometimes that‚Äôs about getting them out the door as quickly as humanly possible.‚Äù Club stores, discount stores and online retailers will grow about twice as fast as supermarkets, mass retailers and drugstores (excluding prescriptions) through 2020, while divisions will deepen between stores that serve dense urban areas and those serving suburban and rural communities. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll increasingly see that retail in densely populated areas will look really different from retail in non-densely populated ones, so you‚Äôll need to get good at both,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe ability to connect through the independent stores in urban areas may become as important as the ability to sell at Kroger, Safeway and Albertsons.‚Äù Projected growth is even less kind to supercenters, which should grow even more slowly than the rest of food retail through 2020. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a consumer packaged goods company this should fundamentally change how you plan the world,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor most of the 21st century and the last part of the 20th, I could make my growth plan as a company if I got Walmart right and hoped everything else broke even.‚Äù Today‚Äôs shoppers are also increasingly shifting spending toward services over goods, and by 2020, are expected to spend $2 on service for every $1 on goods. This favors experiences like restaurants and reflects a shopper putting a premium on purchases that they feel support and reflect their lifestyle. Technology in the meantime is radically changing how retailers and marketers need to approach interacting with shoppers. Gildenberg said brands should consider a customer-relationship management approach as demonstrated by Internet-assisted subscription services like Dollar Shave Club. Marketers need to think over the implications of things like search and how it has evolved, he added. Voice-controlled search ‚Äî now the origin of about 50% of all Google searches, he noted¬† ‚Äî tends to limit results when results are returned by voice. Search results are already redefining categories, Gildenberg added, by shifting them from product or retail defined groups. ‚ÄúAlmost every marketing touchpoint is going to need to be blended with what I‚Äôll call activation opportunities ‚Äî how do I take an interested customer and make sure they buy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if in 10 years from now you don‚Äôt have a VP of sales and a VP of marketing, but have a VP of converting.‚Äù How much shoppers spend is also being upended by technology, Gildenberg said, citing a decline in the effectiveness of traditional promotions, a struggle among marketers to make effective use of mobile marketing, and the beginnings of a potential revolution in online basket algorithms such as those used by Jet.com. ‚ÄúCompanies are desperate to figure out mobile promotions,‚Äù he asserted, and need to ‚Äútake promotional messaging and activation and get them behind the consumer firewall. In order to do that they need to be blended with content, conventional media and brand.‚Äù TAGS: Produce & Floral 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Beef Products Inc., the infamous manufacturer of ‚Äúlean, finely textured beef,‚Äù a.k.a. ‚Äúpink slime,‚Äù just got the green light from South Dakota‚Äôs Union County Circuit Judge Cheryle Gering to move forward with a bogus lawsuit against ABC News, simply for its 2012 coverage of the disgusting animal byproduct that‚Äôs hiding in some meat products. Back in September 2012, ABC News‚Äò Diane Sawyer and Jim Avila blew the lid on the pink slime scandal, revealing images of the soft serve-like pink substance that was being pumped into the ground beef sold at stores like Walmart and served at restaurants like McDonald‚Äôs. Pink slime is essentially the leftover trimmings of a cow‚Äôs carcass that are treated with ammonia and served to consumers in the U.S. ‚Äî mmmm, mmmm, good! As the public learned about the disgusting nature of pink slime, and how it was being hidden in meat products as a way to increase corporate profits, many people naturally gravitated away from it. Both Walmart and McDonald‚Äôs stopped serving it, and Beef Products Inc. had to close three production plants, which in the process cost the company some $1.2 billion in sales. If Beef Products Inc. didn‚Äôt want to risk losing major market share, maybe it should have been upfront from the start about the presence of its product in meat. Or better yet, maybe Beef Products Inc. should have been producing actual meat that people want to eat rather than meat-like byproducts treated with toxic chemicals. Instead, though, Beef Products Inc. is lashing out at the messenger, ABC News, which still, on occasion, tells the truth about some things. In this case, ABC News did the American public a great servic by exposing a food-like product in use in this country that has previously been banned in Canada, Europe, and elsewhere due to its toxicity. Big Ag states like South Dakota protect their own at all costs, even when it means deceiving the public It‚Äôs hardly surprising that the state of South Dakota is coming to bat for Beef Products Inc., considering that much of its landscape is occupied by corporate, chemical agriculture. Free speech apparently goes right out the window if you cross this major industrial powerhouse, which largely relies on hiding things like pink slime, GMOs, and other poisons in their food because consumers wouldn‚Äôt willingly purchase them otherwise. One would think that an honest judge in middle America might consider the ramifications of poisoning the public with additives that aren‚Äôt properly labeled or indicated at the time of purchase. But to the contrary, Judge Gering thinks that Beef Products Inc.‚Äôs whining and boo-hoo moments over much-deserved profit losses are somehow a crime. According to Courthouse News Service, the case as Beef Products Inc. has presented it will move forward, with the exception of Diane Sawyer being one of the defendants. A trial date has been set for June 5 in Elk Point, South Dakota, and could run for as long as eight weeks, depending on the proceedings. ‚ÄúWe are pleased that the Court dismissed all claims against Diane Sawyer,‚Äù ABC News said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Court has not ruled on the merits of the case against the other defendants, and we welcome the opportunity to defend the ABC News reports at trial and are confident that we will ultimately prevail.‚Äù Read more news about the food supply at FoodSupply.news.

"Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company's ability to continue as a going concern," Sears said in the annual report for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. (http://bit.ly/2mRUcce) The company said an inability to generate additional liquidity might limit its access to new merchandise or its ability to procure services. Continued operating losses also could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement, according to the filing. The warning comes less than six weeks after the company announced what it called the "next phase of its strategic transformation," in which it hoped this year to reduce costs by $1 billion and cut its debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion. Sears also is considering selling some of its businesses, such as the Kenmore appliances and DieHard car battery brands. The Sears catalog was an emblem of the post-World War II consumer boom in the United States but the company was unable to adjust the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart Stores , Target Corp. and others. The company lost $2.22 billion in the year ended Jan. 28.Since 2013 it has accumulated $7.4 billion in losses and seen revenue fall 44 percent to $22.1 billion. During that time, Sears cut the number of its U.S. stores by nearly a third, reduced holdings in Sears Canada, and spun off the Lands' End clothing chain. Its total liabilities stand at $13.19 billion. In recent years, Sears has placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, sold its Craftsman line of tools, and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire Chief Executive Edward Lampert's hedge fund. Lampert owned nearly 10 percent of the real-estate investment trust that paid Sears $2.6 billion in 2015 for stores that it purchased, many of which were then leased back to the retailer. The announcement of Sears' potential demise is a blow to Lampert, a hedge fund investor who took control of Sears after merging it with Kmart, which he controlled, in 2004. He soon published a 15-page manifesto, in which he stated that conventional measures of retail success, such as same-store sales, were no longer relevant. Sears would regain its health by closing struggling stores and focusing instead on profitable sales, he wrote. Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011. The company said last month it would cut costs by $1 billion and reduce debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Sears said on Tuesday actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900 million sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year. But the filing also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic. As part of the Craftsman sale, Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. That puts a claim on some Sears' assets in an effort to protect pensions of retired employees. The agreement "contains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets, which could impact our ability to complete asset sale transactions or our ability to use proceeds from those sales to fund our operations," the company said. Already, the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a $250 million cash payment to its pension plan by March of 2020, and the pension board has a 15-year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products.Sears Holdings Corp , once the largest U.S. retailer, warned on Tuesday about its ability to continue as a going concern after years of losses and declining sales.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive A helping lift: Community comes together to help stranded homeless couple Tuesday Mar¬†21,¬†2017¬†at¬†8:01¬†PM Mar¬†22,¬†2017¬†at¬†9:17¬†AM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker HESPERIA ‚Äî Despite the odds against them, Billy Peace was determined to get his wife Jennifer to the beach this summer. The couple, along with their dogs, had departed from Wyoming and were headed to Ventura to get in touch with a doctor for Jennifer, who‚Äôs battling stage 2 brain cancer. Her husband said she may only have six months to live, prompting the cross-country trip in their RV, the couple's home. But mechanical issues left the Pearces and their RV stranded at the Wal-Mart on Main Street in Hesperia a little over a week ago. As funds quickly diminished, the couple found their situation growing more and more desperate. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs horrible having to put your family through this,‚Äù Billy Pearce said, through tears, describing their recent struggles. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs nothing I wouldn‚Äôt do for this woman.‚Äù As the couple scrambled to gather resources to continue their trip, a Wal-Mart manager informed them they would have to leave the premises within 2 days ‚Äî or get the RV towed at the owners‚Äô expense. ‚ÄúThe manager said we‚Äôd been there a week and we had to move,‚Äù Billy Pearce told the Daily Press on Tuesday. ‚ÄúI literally got behind the RV and tried to move it myself, but wasn‚Äôt able to.‚Äù Desperate for help, Billy Pearce reached out to social media ‚Äî and was blindsided by the support the couple received from the local community. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had so many people offer help before,‚Äù Billy Pearce said, wiping tears away. ‚ÄúJust from that one post, I‚Äôve been getting so many calls and texts.‚Äù Billy Pearce‚Äôs Facebook post was shared to several local Facebook groups, including the ‚ÄúHigh Desert 4 by 4 Recovery‚Äù group, where several residents decided to come together to get the couple the help they needed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll help anyone that‚Äôs stranded, free of charge,‚Äù John Allgood, a Hesperia resident and ‚Äú4 by 4‚Äù group member, told the Daily Press. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get out 40-foot trailers and if it takes 25 people to get a vehicle out, then that‚Äôs what it takes.‚Äù Eugene Mariscal, another local group member, said he also saw the post and was inspired to help. His 30-foot trailer was on hand at the parking lot on Tuesday, where Mariscal and three other men got the RV loaded up and towed to the Pilot Travel Center on Highway 395 and Joshua Street. The couple are now attempting to get the resources needed to finish their trip to Ventura, and are in need of donations. With their RV still having transmission issues, Billy Pearce said he‚Äôs looking to trade it for another vehicle to get through that last stretch and finally arrive at their destination. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping we can see this doctor and get me the help I need,‚Äù Jennifer Pearce said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so grateful for what we‚Äôve received so far. Anything helps get our home back.‚Äù A man of faith, Billy Pearce said he turned to God to get the couple out of the tough spot they‚Äôre in ‚Äî and God delivered, through the community‚Äôs support. ‚ÄúDespite everything, I‚Äôm blessed,‚Äù Billy Pearce said. ‚ÄúGod provided us with a helping hand here.‚Äù To contact the Pearces, send a text message to Billy at 702-743-8877 or Jennifer at 702-680-5614.

Albertsons Cos., the second-largest U.S. supermarket chain, is in preliminary merger talks with Sprouts Farmers Market Inc., whose 250-odd stores are known for fresh produce and organic offerings. (REED SAXON / Associated Press) Bloomberg Twitter Facebook ¬†Email ¬†Reddit ¬†SMS Every grocery chain seeking to thrive in the modern world must provide organic kale alongside the Hot Pockets and Fritos. That point was driven home by merger talks in recent weeks between Albertsons Cos., the second-largest U.S. supermarket chain, and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc., whose 250-odd stores are known for fresh produce and organic offerings. The preliminary discussions may not lead to a deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter. For Albertsons, which may be beefing up ahead of an initial public offering, taking Sprouts private and adding it to the portfolio would mean a deeper push into foods that appeal to a growing segment of shoppers. Longtime staples like cereal and canned soup have struggled as health-conscious consumers pursue less-processed options. That‚Äôs pushed organics into the mainstream, with the likes of Wal-Mart Stores and Kroger expanding into a market long dominated by Whole Foods Market Inc. and other niche stores. Albertsons seems ready to jump deeper into the lettuce patch. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre looking to add some sex appeal,‚Äù said Roger Davidson, an industry consultant. ‚ÄúA lot of their stores tend to be boring, standard supermarkets. If they don‚Äôt do something, they‚Äôre going to continue to struggle.‚Äù Fresh produce is a draw to brick-and-mortar stores, even as online ordering has devoured swathes of the retail landscape. With Amazon intent on pushing into the business, despite its struggles with delivering fresh food, grocers are increasingly focused on the quality of fruits and vegetables. An Albertsons takeover of Sprouts could help persuade investors that there‚Äôs demand for shares of a giant U.S. grocery chain this year, Davidson said. The company, backed by Cerberus Capital Management, operates about 2,300 U.S. stores, including the Shaw‚Äôs, Safeway and Acme chains. The company almost went public in 2015 before pulling the IPO because of turbulence in the stock market. The offering has been on hold almost 18 months. Cerberus, which manages more than $30 billion in private equity holdings, distressed debt, credit assets and real estate, first invested in Albertsons in 2006 and then bought stores in 2013 from Supervalu. Albertsons more than doubled in size in 2014 when it acquired Safeway Inc. in a deal valued at about $9.2 billion. The company has a presence on the East Coast, but its stores are mainly west of the Mississippi River. Sprouts has more than half of its outlets in California and Texas, two of the most competitive U.S. markets. Sprouts is ‚Äúone of the few high-quality growth platforms remaining in grocery and a concept we believe will continue to take market share,‚Äù Chris Mandeville, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a research note. Winnie Lerner, a spokeswoman for Albertsons, declined to comment. With the IPO in limbo, Albertsons has struggled to find growth. Food deflation has battered the industry over the past year, weighing down sales and prompting price wars that have eroded profit margins. Kroger, the largest U.S. grocery chain, in the fourth quarter posted negative same-store sales for the first time in more than a decade. Its shares have plunged 15 percent this year. Albertsons faces pressure from both ends. It needs organics to appeal to more affluent customers concerned with health. But its current stores aren‚Äôt quite cheap enough to draw low-end customers who shop at dollar-store chains or Wal-Mart. The price war has gotten even more intense with the German chain Aldi expanding rapidly in the U.S., not to mention the planned arrival of European competitor Lidl this year. Organic food isn‚Äôt a panacea. Whole Foods has struggled because of the perception that it‚Äôs overpriced. Same-store sales have dropped for six straight quarters, pulled down by conventional retailers encroaching on its turf with lower prices. Sprouts has taken a hit from food deflation as well, but posted a 2.7 percent same-store sales gain in 2016. And while Albertsons has experimented with smaller outlets heavy on produce, Sprouts would provide a strong foothold in a fast-growing market, said Jim Hertel, a grocery analyst at Willard Bishop, a consumer research firm in Chicago. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre looking for growth, and they don‚Äôt see it as much with the traditional supermarket,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe growth is happening with peripheral formats ‚Äì that‚Äôs where the consumer is.‚Äù Published: March 21, 2017, 6:05 p.m.¬† Tags: albertsons, grocery stores, sprouts, supermarkets Click here to comment on this story ¬ª ‚Äã Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) Jack Walsh, 85, and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, visit with a reporter at a Sears store, Wednesday, March 22, 2017, in St. Paul, Minn. They said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. (AP Photo/Jim Mone) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (11) New York ‚Ä¢ Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids, has said that after years of losing money that there is "substantial doubt" it will be able to keep its doors open. But it also insisted that its actions to turn around its business should help reduce that risk. It was still a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minn., where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. "I bought my tools from Sears and I've still got them," Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. "It's a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. "But it's been underinvested and bled dry." Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors' fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on "executing our transformation plan" and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it's highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with "regulatory standards." Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it's selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. ¬ª Next page...

Many others¬†have abandoned theirs, too: Microsoft‚Äôs Silicon Valley Research Lab (shut down¬†in 2014), Disney‚Äôs research lab (shut down¬†in 2016), Turner‚Äôs Media Camp (shut down¬†in 2014), Coca-Cola‚Äôs Founders Initiative (shut down¬†in 2016), The New York Times‚Äô R&D Ventures (shut down¬†in 2013), and Adecco‚Äôs Ignite Lab (shut down¬†in 2016). Why? Let‚Äôs start with the name. A lab is a place where you invent things within your four walls. Picture Thomas Edison trying 5,000 light bulb filaments before settling on tungsten. But innovation labs take a guy like Edison out of the equation. The reality is, most profit-focused companies would stop after 500 tries. Edison would then go start his own company. Question: If such labs work, why do Google, Walmart, and others spend billions on startups? Because innovation is hard to recreate in house. It‚Äôs alchemy, not science. Obsession plus the magic of constraints You can‚Äôt reduce innovation to a formula, but one necessary ingredient is obsession. The leader needs to be so obsessive that others question his or her sanity. The other ingredient is constraints. Within a corporation there are internal constraints that everyone knows are artificial. Startups grapple with actual constraints. Their limited cash puts them on a strict timeline to show traction. If they fail, they miss their next funding round. Most startups don‚Äôt make it to this second phase. The stench of failure Corporations don‚Äôt face this existential void. Corporate innovation lab workers know if their launch fails, they still have a job. More to the point, the stench of failure won‚Äôt dog them the way it would if their startup failed. It‚Äôs like playing Wiffle Ball rather than baseball. Innovation thrives where there‚Äôs a clear problem statement and a constrained environment. Such problems might include ‚ÄúHow can we drive more foot traffic to our stores?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do we engage our millions of loyalty members?‚Äù Merely placing bets can‚Äôt replicate this scenario. Look at Google parent company Alphabet, for example. Last year, Google had to take a hard look at the billions invested into the next big thing(s) when its collective losses widened to $802 million. It continues to invest but now in a ‚Äúmore disciplined way.‚Äù Luckily, Google has billions to spare. Most companies don‚Äôt. 3 innovation models ‚Äî 1 doesn‚Äôt work There are three innovation models: Buy, partner, and build. One of these three doesn‚Äôt belong. Despite having its own innovation lab, Walmart recently paid $3.3 billion to buy Jet.com. This move effectively outsourced innovation to a then two-year-old company started by a former Amazon exec. The deal included a very long earnout. So Walmart was in effect paying for expertise and an obsessive founder rather than technology. Another option is to partner. For instance, a few years ago, Target contracted with Tech Stars to drive its innovation. Instead of launching its own ride-sharing service, GM partnered with Lyft. Whole Foods inked a deal with Instacart rather than create its own delivery service. The final option is to build in-house. As we‚Äôve seen, the world‚Äôs top companies have failed in their attempts to do this. Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook can afford to keep innovating through acquisitions. For most companies, though, there‚Äôs only one option. But they need to stop kidding themselves about innovation labs to see it. Innovation isn‚Äôt a box that neatly fits within existing org charts. Executives need to wake up to the fact that real innovation comes from outside your company. Companies have a choice: Ride that innovation or let it run you over.

It was believed the email account had been hacked and an unknown person requested the transfer, which was sent under the guise of a payment for consultants. The transfer was attempted to be recalled but the funds had already been withdrawn. The church's bank is investigating the incident. Disturbance, Warrensville Center Road: Officers responded to Rally's at 12:30 a.m. March 10 for a report of a hit-skip crash by a vehicle that ran into patio furniture. They were able to locate a vehicle in the Walmart parking lot that had a flat tire and heavy front end damage. A man was changing a tire on it and there was a woman present, who was later identified by a witness, as the person driving the vehicle that struck the furniture. The Ashtabula woman, 24, claimed she was never at Rally's and the damage to her vehicle was old. She was charged with obstructing official business. Breaking and entering, Mayfield Road: Officers responded to CVS around 4 a.m. March 9 for a report of an attempted smash and grab of an ATM machine from inside the store. There were two vehicles involved in the incident and they were able to obtain the license plate number for the vehicle the suspects used to leave the area. It returned as registered to a Lakewood resident. The second vehicle, which had been driven through the front of the store, appeared to have been stolen but not yet reported as such. The ATM had been drug from the store by the six suspected males, but left in the parking lot with its vault in place. The incident is under investigation. Violation of a temporary protection order, Avondale Road: Officers responded to a report of gunshots fired at 3:48 a.m. March 13 and subsequently learned a woman had fired a gun into the air to try to get her estranged husband to leave her property. The East Cleveland man, 36, was no longer in the area but a warrant was issued for his arrest for violating a protection order against the woman. She said the man came to her house and began arguing after she had allowed him to borrow her vehicle the previous day. She said he refused to leave and knocked a side-view mirror off her vehicle. Possible charges could be filed against the woman, 35, for discharging a firearm in city limits. Theft, Clinton Avenue: A Euclid woman reported March 14 she and her husband decided to keep a handgun at the house of a mutual friend as a safety precaution because there were children in their home. She brought it to the home and left it with a 19-year-old man, who had been staying with the friend. The following day, the man called her and told her he was jumped by their friend's 18-year-old son and he took the gun. She called the friend and he told her he had nothing to do with the incident and hung up on her. She said he was since making threatening calls and sending harassing text messages. She was referred to Euclid police to report the harassment. Disturbance, Princeton Boulevard: A woman reported March 7 her ex-boyfriend was refusing to leave her home and put a nail in her car tire. Officers found the man, 39, at a neighbor's home, where he tried to explain he lived with the woman. He was on crutches and said it was because he had suffered a gunshot wound. While they were speaking with the woman, they learned the man had an arrest warrant out of Lorain. When they went back to speak with him, they found he had run off through the backyard, leaving his crutches at the home. The woman was satisfied that he had left, but later reported he returned and had thrown garden mulch in her face and into her home. Officers arrested the man for criminal damaging. Violation of a temporary protection order, Warrensville Center Road: A woman reported March 10 she was approached by her ex-husband, whom she has a protection order against, while she was shopping at Walmart. Officers did not locate the Maple Heights man, 45, but surveillance video revealed he followed her through the store and attempted to approach her. A warrant was issued for his arrest. Animal complaint, Grosvenor Road: A woman said March 11 she has ongoing problems with a neighbor allowing her dog onto her property and her surveillance cameras captured the dog on her property again the previous day. Officers spoke to the neighbor's husband, who explained his nieces and nephews had been over and let the dog outside without it being restrained. A citation was prepared for the man's 36-year-old wife for dogs running at large. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland boy, 14, and girl, 17, were arrested at Walmart March 10 for the suspected theft of Roku streaming devices and earphones. They will be charged in juvenile court for theft without consent. Animal complaint, Stilmore Road: A postal carrier reported March 13 he tripped and fell into landscape vines when attempting to back away from an attacking dog. He said the dog retreated when he used pepper spray. Officers spoke to a resident at the home where the dog is kept and learned he had previously been the subject of an animal complaint. The man, 21, was cited for dogs running at large. Suspicion, Telhurst Road: A woman reported March 9 a boy had walked into her attached garage through a closed man door and was looking inside her home when her father saw him. She said he asked what he was doing and he told him, "my friend used to live here, thanks." She said the unknown boy then walked away. Nothing appeared to be missing from the home of broken.

St. Catharines Aaron Lynett,The Canadian Press Niagara Regional Police Services Chief Jeff McGuire speaks during a press conference, Wednesday, in Niagara Falls, updating media on the arrest of Justin Kuijer who is facing charges of first-degree murder as well as attempted murder for allegedly killing his 7-year-old step-son Nathan Dumas, and stabbing an RBC bank employee. next play/pause pre Hamilton Spectator By Paola Loriggio ST. CATHARINES ‚Äî An Ontario man accused of killing his seven-year-old stepson and badly injuring a banker with whom he'd once had professional dealings managed to flee 2,000 kilometres over four days before being arrested. Niagara regional police Chief Jeff McGuire said Wednesday that the nationwide manhunt for 43-year-old Justin Kuijer, which began in St. Catharines, Ont., came to a peaceful end in the parking lot of a Walmart in Kenora, Ont., around 5 p.m. on Tuesday. A member of the public who had heard of the search for Kuijer recognized the van in which the man allegedly fled. Six provincial police officers responded to the tip and arrested the former roofing company owner without incident, McGuire said. Kuijer had been the subject of a Canada-wide warrant on a charge of second-degree murder in the death of his stepson, Nathan Dumas, but McGuire said the man will in fact be charged with first-degree murder in the boy's death, as well as attempted murder in the attack on the bank employee. "I was shocked myself to learn in the last five days, we had over 600,0000 hits in social media on Facebook and Twitter in relation to this case," McGuire said, adding it had a positive impact on their ability to have Kuijer brought into custody. McGuire credited steady media exposure and public vigilance for Kuijer's arrest, saying the end of the manhunt can help a devastated community begin to heal. "It's because of those efforts that Kuijer is in custody today, and the community is safer than it was before his arrest yesterday," he said at a press conference. Niagara police Insp. Jim Prinsen said throughout the manhunt, they received 65 tips relating to sightings of both Kuijer and the van. "Those tips came from the east coast and west coast and many, many places in between," he said. Outside a St. Catharines sandwich shop owned by Nathan's grandparents, flowers and stuffed animals continued to form a makeshift memorial for the slain boy. RELATED St. Catharines homicide suspect Justin Kuijer arrested Canada-wide warrant issued for St. Catharines man wanted in death of stepson Bank employee seriously injured by weapon-wielding attacker Residents walking by expressed rage at the attacks and relief that a suspect had been caught. Ken Chipman, who was walking his dog near the school Nathan attended a short drive away, said news of the attacks had left him "really upset." Nathan was in Grade 2 in Harriet Tubman Public School. "I thought it was horrible," Chipman said, adding he was glad the search for Kuijer was over. McGuire provided few new details on Kuijer's alleged crimes or on the massive manhunt, citing the need to keep certain details confidential. But he did provide insight on how police began their investigation. Police were first summoned to a RBC branch in St. Catharines on Friday morning after reports of an assault. Officers found an employee suffering from stab wounds, he said. McGuire confirmed that the woman, who has not been named, had worked with Kuijer on financial matters in the past. Witnesses reported seeing Kuijer fleeing the scene in a dark grey van, which enabled police to connect the attack at the bank to another call they were fielding at essentially the same time, he said. Across town, in a home above the family's sandwich shop, police said a relative discovered that Nathan had been critically injured. The boy was rushed to hospital with undisclosed injuries and died the next morning. Police learned that the van in which Kuijer allegedly fled the bank was registered to the address where Nathan was found. McGuire said the dual attacks had a wide-ranging impact across St. Catharines. He read a note from a staff member at Nathan's school that outlined the grief experienced by staff, parents and fellow students. Another anecdote from McGuire highlighted the national scope of the hunt for Kuijer. "One of the detectives answered the phone, and it was two officers sitting on the side of the Trans-Canada Highway in Alberta to say they that they're out looking for our man," he said. McGuire said Nathan's mother and the RBC victim were "elated" at news of Kuijer's arrest, but were asking to have their privacy respected in the wake of the attacks. The bank employee remains in hospital but is expected to make a full recovery, he added. McGuire spoke about the impact an incident like this has on the community. He said, while everyone knows who the primary victims are, there are others who are affected by it as well. "I've often thought of it as a windshield cracking where the lines, the spider webs go out and impact every segment of the community," he said, "I'm talking about the school kids and teachers, neighbours, friends and relatives, who are all impacted by this." The impact, he said, was large and there was a spirit of fear when Kuijer was not in custody. However, now that he's been captured McGuire said there will be a lot of "exhales" in the community. Kuijer will be returned to the Niagara region on Wednesday in advance of a bail hearing scheduled for Thursday. The next day, Nathan's family plans to lay the boy to rest at a funeral in Thorold. "Nathan was truly a kind, loving boy with a big heart, full of compassion for everyone and everything. He was always quick to help anyone who may have been in need," reads an obituary for the boy. "As the polite young gentleman he was, he never missed an opportunity to open a door, give a gift or come to the defence of a good friend. Nathan truly felt the joy of giving, never looking for anything in return. There are no words to express the unbearable heartbreak we feel in his loss." Nathan is survived by his mother and younger siblings, the obituary states, adding that his little brother looked up to him as a "best buddy" while his baby sister will be told growing up "what an amazing big brother she had" The Canadian Press With files from Niagara This Week | Most Read SEE MORE Student dies in residence at University of Waterloo 14-year-old girl put into prostitution at Kitchener hotel, court told Kitchener moves ahead with shopping cart bylaw St. Catharines homicide suspect Justin Kuijer arrested ‚ÄòSkyscraper curse‚Äô claims new victim in Lotte‚Äôs $4-billion tower In Your Neighbourhood Today The pool: Your secret weapon for getting in shape The W.G.

Stopping to drop someone off, the car she was riding in was besieged by a hail of bullets. She lay on top of a toddler who was also in the car to protect the child. Hobson now walks with a limp. A gang initiation is believed to be the motive. Miami Gardens, Florida, 2012.¬†Photos: Kathy Shorr Brooklyn BookBeat By Ellyn Gaydos Brooklyn Daily Eagle ‚ÄúThis is what surviving gun violence looks like,‚Äù Megan Hobson, a survivor pictured in Kathy Shorr‚Äôs forthcoming photography book ‚ÄúSHOT‚Äù writes. The idea for the project began when photographer Kathy Shorr came face-to-face with a gun during a home invasion and later as a high school teacher when she encountered numerous memorials to victims of gun violence. But, her ‚Äúthoughts focused on the others ‚Äî the survivors of gun violence. Where were their tributes?‚Äù she writes in the introduction. The 101 survivors photographed in ‚ÄúSHOT‚Äù range from a third-grade student to a bus driver and an ex-gang member to a rock musician of different ethnicities and ages. The project is meant to pay homage to survivors and advocate Shorr‚Äôs support of ‚Äúsensible gun laws that do not infringe upon the rights of responsible individuals to own a gun.‚Äù One image shows a woman‚Äôs dental plate resting in her hand, a result of injuries sustained from a gunshot wound. People are predominantly pictured where the shooting took place: from the rearview mirror in their cars, outside a McDonalds, in a bar, in an open field, at home. ¬† ‚ÄúOne of the reasons that I wanted to photograph at the location, was that most locations are ordinary and banal places ‚Äî not scary or threatening ‚Äî¬†places like a shopping center, Wal-Mart parking lot, church, the gym, neighborhood streets, a party, etc.,‚Äù Shorr said in an email to the Brooklyn Eagle. ‚ÄúIf someone could not identify with one of the 101 survivors, then perhaps they would be able to identify with the places where they were shot, as most people do frequent these normal places.‚Äù Shorr continued, ‚ÄúReturning to the scene of their shooting was cathartic for most people, a reclaiming of the space ‚Ä¶ There were others in the project that were shot in their own home and continued to live there. As most shootings occur in places that we frequently visit in our daily lives, some had been back before.‚Äù But it wasn‚Äôt easy for all participants even if they wanted to do the portrait. ‚ÄúOne Miami survivor who was shot by her boyfriend called me the night before our appointment and said that she had gone to the location earlier that day and could not go through with it. A year later, I returned to Miami and sent her an email asking her if she wanted to try again. She immediately responded ‚ÄòYes‚Äô and she and her young son met me at the apartment house complex where her fianc√© had shot her. ¬†She too felt empowered after going back now that she was ready for it,‚Äù Shorr recounted. Some survivors were left with scars ripped into their bodies while others came away with no visible trauma. Some were random victims, others were targets. Aniyah Halsey of Brooklyn was accidentally shot in the leg when a group open fired on the street her family‚Äôs car was driving down. Kenny McLaughlin is pictured by a pool table inside the Brooklyn bar. After leaving the bar one night, which he was mugged and eventually shot while trying to get back inside for help. Shorr‚Äôs intimate portraiture is an argument against the numbing affect of innumerable reports of gun violence. More than a simple treaty against gun violence, Shorr‚Äôs book is a lyric essay about what happens long after the crime is committed. Her empathic curiosity about the changed lives of these 101 survivors is apparent. The lingering camera probes, how does one continue to live after surviving the improbable? The subjects are quoted intermittently throughout photo spreads, describing the events of their shooting and its effect on their lives afterwards. Suburban, rural, cityscape ‚Äî it is all there. But all too often people of color are faced with disproportionate proximity to gun violence and that too comes across in the back pages of ‚ÄúSHOT,‚Äù which summarize how the shootings happened. Stories of escalated domestic abuse also abound throughout the pages of the book. People were hit in hate crimes, acts of domestic violence, robberies, by stray bullets or by accident, in gang related fights, family arguments, by mentally ill strangers and in the middle of police busts. No one is exempt from gun violence and this fact turns this book about near-death experience into a meditation on mortality itself. ¬†2015 marks the first time that the number of Americans injured by gun violence surpassed injuries caused by motor vehicle collisions. In 2014, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control reported 81,034 nonfatal gunshot wounds. It took Shorr two years, from 2013-2015 to complete her book. Initially, Shorr reached out to survivors, often in the form of a personal letter, to see if they would be willing to participate. As the project gained traction, people began contacting her. ‚ÄúThe book is for all people including gun owners,‚Äù Shorr told the Eagle. ‚ÄúMany of the survivors are in fact gun owners and there is even an NRA member in the project ‚Ä¶ Gun violence is not a black and white issue, there are many shades of gray. We all need to talk about it to each other and not at each other, to come up with ideas that will have us address this realistically.‚Äù In past projects, Shorr has photographed people riding in a limousine she drove as well as residents of shelters and she told the Eagle she has started work on a project ‚Äúabout big oil and pipelines in America including the issue of eminent domain.‚Äù A Bushwick native, Shorr worked as a public school teacher in New York City and continues to teach photography classes. She has exhibited her photographs in America and abroad. ¬† ‚ÄúSHOT,‚Äù published by powerHouse Books, comes out in April. Shorr will be promoting her book in a host of upcoming events and panels. She will appear in Brooklyn on April 13 at Powerhouse Arena for a discussion with Brooklyn photography writer Lyle Rexer. ¬† March 22, 2017 - 1:56pm Related Articles New photography book to accompany blockbuster Brooklyn Museum exhibition ‚ÄòWho Shot Sports‚Äô As the first week of the Rio 2016 Summer Games concludes and baseball‚Äôs pennant races heat up, there‚Äôs no better time to visit the Brooklyn Museum's ‚ÄúWho Shot Sports‚Äù exhibition ‚Äî and no better time to stock up on the perfect Hanukkah, Christmas or Kwanza gift for the sports fan in your lif¬†‚Ä¶¬†Full Article View the discussion thread.

Niagara regional police Chief Jeff McGuire said the nationwide manhunt for 43-year-old Justin Kuijer, which began in St. Catharines, Ont., came to a peaceful end in the parking lot of a Walmart in Kenora, Ont., around 5 p.m. on Tuesday. A member of the public who had heard of the search for Kuijer recognized the van in which the man allegedly fled. Six provincial police officers responded to the tip and arrested the former roofing company owner without incident, McGuire said. Kuijer had been the subject of a Canada-wide warrant on a charge of second-degree murder in the death of his stepson, Nathan Dumas, but McGuire said the man will in fact be charged with first-degree murder in the boy's death, as well as attempted murder in the attack on the bank employee. McGuire credited steady media exposure and public vigilance for Kuijer's arrest, saying the end of the manhunt can help a devastated community begin to heal. "It's because of those efforts that Kuijer is in custody today, and the community is safer than it was before his arrest yesterday," he said at a press conference. Outside a St. Catharines sandwich shop owned by Nathan's grandparents, flowers and stuffed animals formed a makeshift memorial for the slain boy. Residents walking by expressed rage at the attacks and relief that a suspect had been caught. Ken Chipman, who was walking his dog near the school Nathan attended a short drive away, said news of the attacks had left him "really upset." "I thought it was horrible," he said, adding he was glad the search for Kuijer was over. McGuire provided few new details on Kuijer's alleged crimes or on the massive manhunt, citing the need to keep certain details confidential. But he did provide insight on how police began their investigation.

Grand champion was Fairview Food Market¬†in Fairview. Jerome Country Market¬†in Jerome was named reserve champion. ¬† ¬† The beef and pork frankfurters, also known as hot dogs, are made with high quality ingredients and spices, a natural casing¬†and no fillers, said Craig¬†Hindes, Scott Meats owner.¬† The recipe that makes these franks better than most is a secret, he said. It was developed through trial and error over many years.¬† An "array of spices" is used, said Dave¬†Pruim, smokehouse/sausage manager¬†at Scott Meats.¬† These franks have "more spices than most," said James¬†Hindes, plant manager and Craig¬†Hindes' son.¬† "They're full-flavored," Craig¬†Hindes¬†said. "We go all out and make them the best we can."¬† They don't skimp to keep costs down, he said.¬† Scott Meats frankfurters sell for¬†$4.99¬†per pound. For comparison, Walmart sells 15-ounce¬†Ball Park Brand Beef Franks eight packs¬†for $3.48.¬† At the competition, judges evaluate each entry for internal and external appearance and edibility.¬† "You have to learn how to win these things," Craig¬†Hindes¬†said.¬† Scott Meats had four entries: whole turkey, frankfurter, snack stick and beef jerky.¬†¬† The¬†philly¬†cheese steak snack stick came in fourth. It's lower placement was likely because the white cheese inside looks like fat, and took away from the internal appearance score, Craig¬†Hindes¬†said.¬† They entered the¬†philly¬†cheese steak rather than barbecue,¬†teriyaki¬†or another flavor, because it's a customer favorite and something different compared to other entrants.¬† "If you're selling it, and customers love it, don't change anything," James¬†Hindes¬†said, quoting judges at the competition.¬† Even on a Wednesday morning, the store was busy.¬† "I care about the judges with money in their pockets," Craig¬†Hindes¬†said.¬† Customers come from all over Michigan, including Detroit, Grand Rapids and Holland, he said.¬† The business recently moved to 260 E. Broadway, but it's still easy for longtime customers to find - it's across the street from the previous location.¬† People have asked why the business hasn't moved out of Muskegon Heights, Craig¬†Hindes¬†said.¬† His response?¬† "If people want to buy my stuff, they can come to me," he said. "The city needs it. The people here are great. They're all really friendly."¬† Craig¬†Hindes¬†purchased K.J. Scott Meat Company¬†in 1983. He had worked for the previous owner since 1975. At the time, the business was located in a rented building at the corner of Broadway and Hoyt.¬† In 1985, a new 4,000-square-foot location was built on East Broadway Avenue.¬†¬† The current location opened on Nov. 25, 2016. The former warehouse for C.J. Wholesale Toy Company is 13,000 square feet.¬† A family operation, all the¬†Hindes¬†children have been involved in the business since they were teens.¬†James¬†Hindes, 28,¬†started working at the store when he was 14. Kailey¬†Hindes, the youngest,¬†works on Saturdays - what would be her day off.¬†¬†Sydney¬†Hindes¬†is the office administrator. Madison¬†Kartes¬†is moving back to the area with her husband, and will get back into the family business soon.¬†¬† Matriarch Ann¬†Hindes¬†also chips in when she's not working as a registered nurse at¬†the intensive care unit at Gerber Memorial Hospital in Fremont.¬† There are 26 employees in all.

Man wanted in stepson's death fled 2,000 km before arrest: police by Paola Loriggio, The Canadian Press Posted Mar 22, 2017 2:58 pm EDT Local Nathan Dumas, 7, died in hospital on March 18, 2017 after police say he was attacked by his stepfather Justin Kuijer in St. Catharines. GOFUNDME Courtesy of GoFundMe page created for Nathan Dumas' family. An Ontario man accused of killing his seven-year-old stepson and badly injuring a banker with whom he‚Äôd once had professional dealings managed to flee 2,000 kilometres over four days before being arrested, police said Wednesday. Niagara regional police Chief Jeff McGuire said the nation-wide manhunt for 43-year-old Justin Kuijer, which began in St. Catharines, came to a peaceful end in the parking lot of a Walmart in Kenora, around 5 p.m. on Tuesday. A member of the public who had heard of the search for Kuijer recognized the van in which the man allegedly fled. Six provincial police officers responded to the tip and arrested the former roofing company owner without incident, McGuire said. Kuijer had been the subject of a Canada-wide warrant on a charge of second-degree murder in the death of his stepson, Nathan Dumas, but McGuire said the man will in fact be charged with first-degree murder in the boy‚Äôs death, as well as attempted murder in the attack on the RBC employee. McGuire credited steady media exposure and public vigilance for Kuijer‚Äôs arrest, saying the end of the manhunt can help a devastated community begin to heal. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of those efforts that Kuijer is in custody today, and the community is safer than it was before his arrest yesterday,‚Äù he said at a press conference. Related stories: Police arrest Ontario man accused of killing stepson, 7 Funeral for slain St. Catharines boy set for Friday, hunt for stepfather continues Canada-wide warrant issued for St. Catharines man wanted for second-degree murder McGuire provided few new details on Kuijer‚Äôs alleged crimes or on the massive manhunt, citing the need to keep certain details confidential. But he did provide insight on how police began their investigation. Police were first summoned to a RBC branch in St. Catharines on Friday morning after reports of an assault. Officers found an employee suffering from stab wounds, he said. McGuire confirmed that the woman, who has not been named, had worked with Kuijer on financial matters in the past. Witnesses reported seeing Kuijer fleeing the scene in a dark grey van, which enabled police to connect the attack at the bank to another call they were fielding at essentially the same time, he said. Across town, above a sandwich shop owned by Nathan‚Äôs grandparents, police said a family member discovered that Nathan had been critically injured. The boy was rushed to hospital with undisclosed injuries and died the next morning. Police learned that the van in which Kuijer allegedly fled the bank was registered to the address where Nathan was found. McGuire said the dual attacks had a wide-ranging impact across St. Catharines, a small city in the heart of Ontario‚Äôs wine country. He read a note from a staff member at the school Nathan attended which outlined the grief experienced by staff, parents and fellow students. Another anecdote from McGuire highlighted the national scope of the hunt for Kuijer. ‚ÄúOne of the detectives answered the phone, and it was two officers sitting on the side of the TransCanada Highway in Alberta to say they that they‚Äôre out looking for our man,‚Äù he said. McGuire said Nathan‚Äôs mother and the RBC victim were ‚Äúelated‚Äù at news of Kuijer‚Äôs arrest, but were asking to have their privacy respected in the wake of the attacks. The bank employee remains in hospital but is expected to make a full recovery, he added. Kuijer will be returned to the Niagara region on Wednesday in advance of a bail hearing scheduled for Thursday. The next day, Nathan‚Äôs family plans to lay the boy to rest at a funeral in neighbouring Thorold, Ont. ‚ÄúNathan was truly a kind, loving boy with a big heart, full of compassion for everyone and everything. He was always quick to help anyone who may have been in need,‚Äù reads an obituary for the boy. ‚ÄúAs the polite young gentleman he was, he never missed an opportunity to open a door, give a gift or come to the defence of a good friend. Nathan truly felt the joy of giving, never looking for anything in return. There are no words to express the unbearable heartbreak we feel in his loss.‚Äù Nathan is survived by his mother and younger siblings, the obituary states, adding that his little brother looked up to him as a ‚Äúbest buddy‚Äù while his baby sister will be told growing up ‚Äúwhat an amazing big brother she had.‚Äù With files from Michelle McQuigge in Toronto Join the conversation Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

The umpire later changed his call as Smoak was out at second base. CHRIS URSO | Times By Marc Topkin, Times Staff Writer Published: March 18, 2017 PORT CHARLOTTE ‚Äî Is there anything wrong with thinking about saying goodbye when you're not 100 percent sure you're leaving? Alex Cobb is no dumb blond. He's savvy enough to know the history ‚Äî that as a frontline starting pitcher headed to free agency, he most likely will be traded by the Rays during the summer. "It's just the way things unfold here," he said. "If you were a betting man, that probably would be the way to go." Cobb, 29, would like to think there are other options. The one he fancies is that he is pitching so well, and the Rays are winning so much, that they have no choice but to keep him for a march deep into the postseason, and then he heads out. Or the Rays could preempt free agency and re-sign him during the season at market price, extending what has been a 12-year stay in the organization. Or his first full season back from Tommy John surgery could go bad, and due to injury or ineffectiveness, he could find himself without a better offer and sign on for another year. But for now, it's hard for Cobb to not think this is the beginning of a long goodbye. And it starts in Port Charlotte, his spring, and summer rehab, home since the team's 2009 move south. "It's a difficult thought, and it's one that I've had a lot this spring," Cobb said. "I've found myself driving around, whether it's to Wal-Mart or to Publix, or going by the Chili's where we'd hang out because it was near the (minor-leaguers') hotel, and I'm thinking about the first year I was here in Port Charlotte and all the different things that have happened here. Life-changing stuff. "Then you go into the clubhouse and you see all the faces, people that I've seen since I was 18, that really have been your family since then. It's part of spring training ‚Äî you give that guy a hug, you ask how their family is doing, they ask about yours, you reminisce about the times you had in the past. ‚Ä¶ "You think about it, and it's sad. It's sad that it's a possibility I could no longer be around here." Sure, you can say if Cobb felt that badly about leaving, he shouldn't. That ‚Äî especially after making $4 million each of the past two seasons (for 22 innings and one win in the majors), and another $4.2 million this year ‚Äî he should just take whatever the Rays offer and stay. But that's not how this works. A player toils for the chance to reach free agency after six years in the majors, and he has the right to get paid. (Also, consider that Cobb already missed on cashing in once already as he was negotiating a long-term deal worth nearly $50 million when he hurt his elbow two springs ago. And, that former teammate Jeremy Hellickson is making $17.2 million ‚Äî SEVENTEEN-POINT-TWO-MILLION ‚Äî this season from the Phillies.) Nor should you pin this on the Rays, as they have the right to maximize their assets, and with all the young ‚Äî and inexpensive ‚Äî pitching they have in the system to replace Cobb (such as Jose De Leon), getting something for him in July is only logical. There are already whispers of potential interest elsewhere, including two teams with intimate connections ‚Äî the Cubs, managed by ex-Ray Joe Maddon; and the Dodgers, presidented by ex-Ray Andrew Friedman. That is no surprise, because as good as a healthy Cobb can be on the mound ‚Äî "top 10 in all of baseball," teammate Chris Archer opines ‚Äî he may have even more value for his leadership and bulldog attitude. "We know what he brings to our pitching staff and our clubhouse," Rays manager Kevin Cash said. "We all understand how important Alex is to us." First, Cobb has to show that he is indeed back to being Alex Cobb. That it's more than just braggadocio and wishful thinking for him to say there is "zero doubt" he can return to 2013-14 form, when, despite a concussion (from being hit by a line drive) and an oblique strain, he was 21-12, 2.82 in 49 starts. "It's the smaller pixels I'm looking for," Cobb said. "The larger picture of it is there." Then there will be the question of where the path leads. If elsewhere, the memories will be well-cataloged: The thrill of working out with the big-league Devil Rays at the Trop after being a fourth-round pick in 2006. The smell of the locker room the day he arrived in Princeton, W.Va., as a pro, and the nerves ‚Äî "my heart was beating out of my chest, everything was going a million miles an hour" ‚Äî of his first game. The unbridled joy of his promotion to the majors, and the best-day-ever feel of his on May 1, 2011, big-league debut, with his dad and brother in the stands. The fear of a career- or even life-threatening injury when struck in the head by an Eric Hosmer line drive in June 2013, then the satisfaction of returning for his thus far career-highlight moment, starting and winning the AL wild-card game. And the frustration of the pain he felt during the 2015 St. Patrick's Day start in Clearwater leading to Tommy John surgery, and this two-year odyssey back. Cobb has been through so much in his life, most jarringly the sudden death of his mother during his senior year in high school, and he has seen so many good friends traded (James Shields, David Price, Hellickson, Matt Moore, etc.), that he is certain he won't be fazed no matter what happens or where he ends up. But that doesn't mean he won't be thinking about saying goodbye. "There will definitely be moments throughout the season when it will hit me," he said. "It won't be every day where I wake up and say, 'Hey, this could be my last day here.' ‚Ä¶ But it will be like mindless driving down the highway thinking about it. And it'll be a little sad."

In an interview with GQ, the former 49ers coach waxed poetic about his famous pleated khakis, his ultimate "all-purpose" essential. Harbaugh praised the ability of his sweet $8 Walmart khakis to transition from game day to church, workouts to dinner. "That's the best part about them," he said. "You can go anywhere and be dressed appropriately." Yes, Harbaugh can and does work out in his khakis. Does he keep them belted while he runs? Inquiring minds want to know. He was also thrilled to be informed by GQ that pleated khakis are back in style. "Could you tell my wife that? Sarah Harbaugh," Harbaugh asked the reporter. "If you could just let her know that, that would be huge." What do the Michigan Wolverines need to do to compete for the College Football Playoff championship? SI's Andy Staples says Jim Harbaugh should focus on the Offensive Line. Media: Brandpoint MORE:¬†Harbaugh jokes he's due a 'courage medal' for coaching Jed York's 49ers As Harbaugh has mentioned before, he loves khakis because they eliminate the time-consuming process of picking out an outfit each day. And he can pretend like he's a retail employee who happens to coach Division I football. "They make me feel good, too. Like I have a uniform. I always liked having a uniform," Harbaugh said. "Growing up, when I was playing baseball, or hockey, or football. Always nice to have a uniform. Felt like part of the team." #TeamKhaki at least.¬† Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

The new layout was unveiled by CEO Brian Cornell in Las Vegas on Monday. It will feature a separate entrance and 10-minute parking for shoppers looking to pick up an online order or some essentials. New center aisles will be curved rather than squared off, to inspire people to explore, says Mark Schindele, senior vice president of Target Properties. LED track lighting will replace fluorescent fixtures, and brand boutiques meant to replicate a specialty-store feel will showcase rotating looks. The first of the redesigned stores will open in suburban Houston this fall. About 40 more stores will get the remodel treatment by October, using the Houston prototype as a template. More than 600 of Target's 1,800 total locations are scheduled for updates over the next three years. It expects the remodeled stores to see a 2 percent to 4 percent sales bump. "We wanted the design to be flexible because that is what shopping is all about," Schindele told The Associated Press. The remodeling is a key part of Target Corp.'s strategy to win back shoppers and rev up sales. Unlike rival Wal-Mart, which has drawn more customers and notched higher sales at established stores, Target has seen three straight quarters of declines for that sales measure and fewer shoppers in its stores. Investing in stores is an acknowledgement that the in-person experience remains important, even as Amazon and other online retailers draw shoppers away from traditional retailers. At an investor meeting last month Target executives spoke bluntly about the shabbiness of many of the chain's stores. It pledged to spend $7 billion on the remodeling plan and to accelerate its expansion of small-format stores, bolster its online operations, and launch new brands. "We've got to reimagine that store experience," Cornell said then. "Today's millennial shopper doesn't enjoy shopping one of our tired stores that hasn't been touched in 10 years." Target has also tested new store designs in Dallas and Los Angeles, but Houston's is the most ambitious store redesign to date. Last fall, Target launched an initiative in 25 stores in Los Angeles where it tested an updated grocery presentation with new lighting and foods to prepare single meal displayed together. The new grocery presentation was later rolled out in 16 Dallas stores. Cornell said shopper feedback in Dallas and Los Angeles has been good. The Houston prototype's separate entrances for shoppers in a hurry and those who aren't is among its biggest novelties. The entrance on the right will have a dedicated pickup counter for online orders. Shoppers will also have the option of having their order brought to their car. Groceries, wine and liquor will be located here, rather than in the back where they're usually found. Seasonal essentials, like school supplies in the fall, will also be found nearby. Shoppers using the "inspiration" entrance on the left will see the brand name displays and a section highlighting seasonal fashion. Beauty, jewelry and accessories departments will be nearby. There will also be seating outside of Starbucks. An area to hold store events will be located between the two entrances. Target will tweak the format based on shoppers' responses. "This represents our current thinking," Schindele said, "but we are going to learn a lot."

Police are expected to provide more details today on the end of a four-day manhunt for a stepfather accused of killing his seven-year-old stepson. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Niagara Regional Police Service MANDATORY CREDIT next play/pause pre ST. CATHARINES, Ont. ‚Äî An Ontario man accused of killing his seven-year-old stepson and badly injuring a banker with whom he'd once had professional dealings managed to flee 2,000 kilometres over four days before being arrested, police said Wednesday. Niagara regional police Chief Jeff McGuire said the nationwide manhunt for 43-year-old Justin Kuijer, which began in St. Catharines, Ont., came to a peaceful end in the parking lot of a Walmart in Kenora, Ont., around 5 p.m. on Tuesday. A member of the public who had heard of the search for Kuijer recognized the van in which the man allegedly fled. Six provincial police officers responded to the tip and arrested the former roofing company owner without incident, McGuire said. Kuijer had been the subject of a Canada-wide warrant on a charge of second-degree murder in the death of his stepson, Nathan Dumas, but McGuire said the man will in fact be charged with first-degree murder in the boy's death, as well as attempted murder in the attack on the bank employee. McGuire credited steady media exposure and public vigilance for Kuijer's arrest, saying the end of the manhunt can help a devastated community begin to heal. "It's because of those efforts that Kuijer is in custody today, and the community is safer than it was before his arrest yesterday," he said at a press conference. Outside a St. Catharines sandwich shop owned by Nathan's grandparents, flowers and stuffed animals formed a makeshift memorial for the slain boy. Residents walking by expressed rage at the attacks and relief that a suspect had been caught. Ken Chipman, who was walking his dog near the school Nathan attended a short drive away, said news of the attacks had left him "really upset." "I thought it was horrible," he said, adding he was glad the search for Kuijer was over. McGuire provided few new details on Kuijer's alleged crimes or on the massive manhunt, citing the need to keep certain details confidential. But he did provide insight on how police began their investigation. Police were first summoned to a RBC branch in St. Catharines on Friday morning after reports of an assault. Officers found an employee suffering from stab wounds, he said. McGuire confirmed that the woman, who has not been named, had worked with Kuijer on financial matters in the past. Witnesses reported seeing Kuijer fleeing the scene in a dark grey van, which enabled police to connect the attack at the bank to another call they were fielding at essentially the same time, he said. Across town, in a home above the family's sandwich shop, police said a relative discovered that Nathan had been critically injured. The boy was rushed to hospital with undisclosed injuries and died the next morning. Police learned that the van in which Kuijer allegedly fled the bank was registered to the address where Nathan was found. McGuire said the dual attacks had a wide-ranging impact across St. Catharines, a small city in the heart of Ontario's wine country. He read a note from a staff member at the school Nathan attended which outlined the grief experienced by staff, parents and fellow students. Another anecdote from McGuire highlighted the national scope of the hunt for Kuijer. "One of the detectives answered the phone, and it was two officers sitting on the side of the TransCanada Highway in Alberta to say they that they're out looking for our man," he said. McGuire said Nathan's mother and the RBC victim were "elated" at news of Kuijer's arrest, but were asking to have their privacy respected in the wake of the attacks. The bank employee remains in hospital but is expected to make a full recovery, he added. Kuijer will be returned to the Niagara region on Wednesday in advance of a bail hearing scheduled for Thursday. The next day, Nathan's family plans to lay the boy to rest at a funeral in neighbouring Thorold, Ont. "Nathan was truly a kind, loving boy with a big heart, full of compassion for everyone and everything. He was always quick to help anyone who may have been in need," reads an obituary for the boy. "As the polite young gentleman he was, he never missed an opportunity to open a door, give a gift or come to the defence of a good friend. Nathan truly felt the joy of giving, never looking for anything in return. There are no words to express the unbearable heartbreak we feel in his loss." Nathan is survived by his mother and younger siblings, the obituary states, adding that his little brother looked up to him as a "best buddy" while his baby sister will be told growing up "what an amazing big brother she had" ‚Äî with files from Michelle McQuigge in Toronto.

Richardson told the Escambia County Sheriff's Office his ex-girlfriend, Sevina Fatu, has told him, "If I can't have you, no one can," according to a police report. It was the second recent alleged domestic violence incident involving the former Alabama star running back and Fatu. In February, Richardson was arrested and charged with third-degree domestic violence¬†in a separate incident with the same woman at a Hoover hotel. Speaking publicly for the first time since he was charged in February, Richardson emphatically denied that he attacked Fatu in an exclusive interview with AL.com. "What's out there isn't the truth," Richardson said. "I swear I didn't hit her." The 26-year old Richardson, who is trying to resurrect an NFL career, was arrested Feb. 16 at Hyatt Place Hotel in Hoover following an altercation with Fatu. Police said an argument began at a local Walmart, continued when the two returned to Richardson's hotel room and eventually turned physical. According to Richardson, Fatu jumped on him, started punching him and ripped out at least two of his dreadlocks. Multiple attempts by AL.com to reach Fatu were unsuccessful. Police said they observed scratches and bruises on Fatu's face, which led to Richardson being arrested. Fatu was treated on the scene by Hoover Fire Department paramedics and required no further medical attention, according to Hoover police Capt. Gregg Rector. Those scratches and bruises, Richardson said, were a result of him trying to push Fatu away as she punched him and ripped at his hair. "I was trying to walk away from the situation," Richardson said. "I would never hit a female. I look down on people that hit females. I grew up seeing stuff like that in my house. I've had family members go through that, and that's something I would never do. There are certain things I can't get into because it's an ongoing case, but it's very important to me that people know my side of the story and at least know that I would never hit a female no matter what the situation is." Additionally, Richardson said their 10-year old daughter, who was in the room, told officers that her father never hit her mother. ¬†Rector told AL.com in February Richardson was "cooperative" and "arrested without incident." Richardson is set to appear in court April 12 for the Hoover incident. There has been no court date scheduled yet for Monday's incident in Richardson's hometown of Pensacola, Fla. Fatu had tried to call Richardson several times Monday before eventually driving to his home, according to the police report. When she arrived, Richardson and the other victim were sitting inside of Richardson's car. They¬†tried to leave, but were blocked in by Fatu. The other victim told police that Fatu eventually backed up the car, put it in drive and rammed into the passenger side of the car occupied by her and Richardson. She told police that she and Richardson then fled the car and called police after Fatu backed up and attempted to ram the vehicle again. Fatu left the car and returned home, where she was later arrested, according to the police report. Richardson told police that he owns the Mercedes-Benz SUV used by Fatu and lets her use it for their children. Fatu was still in jail as of Wednesday afternoon, according to online arrest records. She was held on $6,000 bonds. Richardson, the No. 3 overall selection in the 2012 NFL draft, has been out of football since he was released by the Baltimore Ravens in August. The 2011 Heisman Trophy finalist said he is currently back in school at Alabama, taking online classes to complete his bachelor's degree.

While it's playing in its seventh Sweet 16 since 2004, it has only advanced past the round twice in school history. But this year, the No. 11 seed has something special on its side. The team is carrying a jar filled with ashes, according to an ESPN report. Those ashes aren't from a human being, but from Xavier's month of February woes. The Musketeers had a six-game losing streak that didn't end until March 1. After that victory, the Musketeers lost just once, before heading into the NCAA Tournament. Assistant coach Mike Pegues had the idea of burning a calendar during the Musketeers' skid, to put the month of February in the past. ESPN's Jeff Borzello reported the story of the makeshift 'urn.' "The coaches went onto Walmart's website looking for urns, something none of them had ever done," Borzello wrote. "They sent graduate assistant Allen Payne out to the store to pick one up, but the one they wanted wasn't available anymore. So they settled on a jar that wasn't technically an urn, but it was glass, and you can see inside of it. It would suffice." Xavier lost its first game after burning the calendar. It's only loss after that was against Creighton in the Big East tournament title game. "We had a big aluminum trash can in the middle of the locker room," Mack told Borzello. "We made sure all the smoke detectors and alarms were off. Everybody burned it." Coach Mack talks about the similarities between the last two XU squads to reach the second weekend. #LetsMarch #Sweet16 pic.twitter.com/F8Fr52HAI9‚Äî Xavier Basketball (@XavierMBB) March 21, 2017 The Musketeers look to extend its March Madness magic with a win Thursday night against No. 2 Arizona in San Jose, Calif. "I don't even know where to start," Mack told reporters after the Musketeers' win against Florida State. "I'm so excited for the guys next to me and the guys in the locker room. They earned it. Our team's gone through a lot of adversity this year, and we stayed the course. We had a meeting at the beginning of the year, and we talked about how tough of a feeling it was in St. Louis in that locker room when we lost to Wisconsin. Instead of just saying "attack", when we broke huddles, we wanted to talk about attacking and finishing. Man, we finished today." "I'm really proud of this group. The biggest thing for us going into this game today was to be able to take care of the ball, not get Florida State out in transition where they're phenomenal, and try to keep them off the glass. We've been a pretty good rebounding team all year, but we never faced the size and athleticism we saw today. We really passed the test in those two areas, and it gave us a chance to win. I thought guys played really loose on offense, and I'm really happy for these guys."

Are you having beef for dinner? Do you know where it came from? No, not the grocery store down the street, but where the cow was raised? Most of us probably can‚Äôt answer those questions, and that‚Äôs a growing concern for health advocates, retailers, and lawmakers amid reports that some meatpackers in Brazil ‚Äî one of the world‚Äôs largest exporters of beef ‚Äî are shipping out rotten, salmonella-tainted beef. The TL;DR Version 1. Scandal: Brazilian authorities recently accused some meat packers of allowing the sale of rotten or tainted meat. 2. Bans: A number of countries have either severely restricted or banned the import of meat from Brazil, one of the world‚Äôs largest providers of beef. 3. Stores Say No: Some international supermarket chains have pulled existing stock of Brazilian meat from their shelves. 4. No U.S. Ban Yet: While some lawmakers have called for a temporary ban, Brazilian meat is still allowed to be imported into the U.S. 5. Increased USDA Inspection:The USDA says it has stepped up its inspection of meat coming from Brazil. However, the agency also repealed its Country of Origin labeling requirement in 2015, so consumers may have no idea or control over where their beef comes from. Worries surrounding the safety of beef and poultry coming from Brazil came to a head this week with federal food regulators stepping up inspections, retailers pulling the items, and lawmakers introducing legislation to ban the products. But why? Here are 5 reasons why you might be hearing more about Brazilian meat than you ever thought possible this week. 1. A Growing Scandal Reuters reports that concerns over the safety of meat from Brazil ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest producer of beef ‚Äî has grown over the last week. The issue was pushed into the spotlight after authorities accused inspectors at a Brazilian exporter of allowing spoiled or tainted meats to be sold. In all, police issued 38 arrest warrants on Friday, the Associated Press reports, related to an investigation into two¬†Brazilian meatpacking companies,¬†JBS and BRF. Investigators claim that health inspectors at the plants were bribed in an attempt to continue the sale of expired meat. The AP reports that police also allege the questionable meat was altered with chemicals such as water and manioc flour to mask the appearance and smell. 2. Banning Products This week, in the wake of these arrests and allegations, several countries announced temporary bans on imports of Brazilian meat. The AP reports that the European Union, China, and Chile have all put at least partial restrictions on meat coming from Brazil. European Union spokesman Enrico Brivio said that it ‚Äúwill guarantee that any of the establishments involved in the fraud will be suspended.‚Äù Later Monday, China Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi announced that the country had suspended imports of Brazilian meats into China‚Äôs ports. While the AP reports that Blairo didn‚Äôt describe the issue as an embargo, he noted that the containers would not be allowed to leave for local markets. The AP reports that Chile also announced the temporary suspension of meats from Brazil. Additionally, Reuters reports that Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Switzerland have also enacted temporary bans on imported Brazilian meat. 3. Pulling Products What about the beef that‚Äôs already been imported? Reuters reports that several retailers around the globe have decided to pull Brazilian meat from their shelves. Chinese grocery retailer Sun Art Retail, along with the Chinese arms of Walmart and Metro AG, removed Brazilian beef and poultry items from shelves. A rep for Sun Art Retail tells Reuters that the removed products account for just 10% of its beef supply, while a rep for Metro AG said it had pulled chicken legs and wings from its Chinese stores. Online retailer JD.com also tells Reuters that it removed all listings for imported Brazilian meat. In Hong Kong, Reuters reports, retailer PARKnSHOP has removed Brazilian pork, beef, and chicken from shelves, and plans¬†to¬†increase the supply of meat and poultry products from other countries. 4. No U.S. Ban ‚Äî Yet So far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture hasn‚Äôt announced a temporary ban on Brazilian products, despite calls to do so by lawmakers. Montana Rep. Jon Tester announced legislation Tuesday that would temporarily ban the importation of Brazilian beef to protect American consumers from consuming rotten meat. Tester‚Äôs legislation calls for a 120-day ban on the products in order to give the USDA time to ‚Äúcomprehensively investigate food safety threats and to determine which Brazilian beef sources put American consumers at risk.‚Äù The U.S. has a complicated history with Brazilian meat producers. The USDA only began allowing the import of Brazilian beef in Aug. 2016 after a 13-year ban. The agency said at the time that it had worked since 2003 to ensure that Brazil‚Äôs regulations aligned with the World Organization for Animal Health‚Äôs scientific international animal health guidelines. In a separate decision in August, the USDA‚Äôs Food Safety and Inspection Service determined that Brazil‚Äôs food safety system governing meat products remains equivalent to that of the United States and that fresh ‚Äî chilled or frozen ‚Äî beef can be safely imported from Brazil. That determination was seemingly thrown into question following the recent bribery scandal. 5. Stepping Up Inspections On Monday, the USDA announced it would step up inspections of Brazilian meat following accusations the country may have exported tainted beef, Politico reports. ‚ÄúThe USDA‚Äôs Food Safety and Inspection Service is in contact with USDA embassy officials and Brazil‚Äôs ministry about their investigation,‚Äù a USDA spokesperson said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt is our mission to keep the food supply safe for American families and FSIS has instituted pathogen testing of all shipments of raw beef and ready-to-eat products from Brazil as well as increased the examination of all these products. We will continue to monitor the events as they unfold.‚Äù Under the increased screening, Politico reports, 100% of Brazilian meat imports will be re-inspected. While the increased inspections could prevent some tainted meat products from making their way to U.S. retailers‚Äô shelves, it does little to address meat products that might already be there, waiting for shoppers to scoop them up. Retailers could try to pull the products, but that would likely be a complicated process as the U.S. no longer requires mandatory Country of Origin Labeling for beef and pork muscle cuts, ground beef, and ground pork. The USDA removed the mandatory COOL requirement in late 2015 as an amendment [PDF] to the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016 in order to bring the U.S. into compliance with intentional trade obligations. Prior to the amendment, retailers were required to notify their customers of the country of origin of the products. Now, retailers are no longer required by the rule to provide country of origin information for the beef and pork that they sell, and firms that supply beef and pork to these retailers no longer must provide them with this information. Additionally, firms in the supply chain for beef and pork are also relieved from the requirements associated with mandatory COOL. Our colleague Jean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives for Consumers Union, says the news out of Brazil is alarming, and that the lack of origin labeling leaves American meat buyers in the dark. ‚ÄúSome consumers might want to choose U.S. meat or another country‚Äôs meat, but they have no way of knowing the country of origin,‚Äù explains Halloran. While origin labeling is no longer required, there‚Äôs nothing stopping a meat supplier or retailer from being transparent about the source of their beef. Which is why CU is calling on the various companies that are part of the supply chain to provide consumers with this information, and allow them to make an informed decision about the meat they purchase. Update: The USDA‚Äôs FSIS said¬†Wednesday afternoon that ‚Äúwhile none of the slaughter or processing facilities implicated in the Brazilian scandal have shipped meat products to the United States,‚Äù the agency is taking extra steps in testing all shipments of raw beef and ready-to-eat products from Brazil. ‚ÄúKeeping food safe for American families is our top priority,‚Äù Mike Young, Acting Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said in a statement. ‚ÄúFSIS has strengthened the existing safeguards that protect the American food supply as a precaution and is monitoring the Brazilian government‚Äôs investigation closely.‚Äù March 22, 2017 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler bans beef beef ban brazil bribery cool country of origin labels exports fsis imports poultry scandal tainted beef US Department of Agriculture usda what's the beef?

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Niagara Regional Police say the public was instrumental in helping to locate and capture a 43-year-old Ontario man wanted on a Canada-wide arrest warrant for first-degree murder in the death of his seven-year-old stepson. ‚ÄúThe power of social media in this case ‚Äî I was shocked myself to learn in the last five days we had over 600,000 hits on social media including Facebook and Twitter in relation to this case,‚Äù¬†Niagara Regional Police Chief¬†Jeff McGuire¬†told reporters at a press conference in Niagara Falls, Ont. on Wednesday. WATCH: Justin Kuijer, accused of killing stepson, returned to Niagara Region after arrest Story continues below Police said Justin Kuijer was located by Ontario Provincial Police in Kenora, Ont. Tuesday afternoon following a tip from a member of the public. Authorities said officers found him inside a 2009 Pontiac Montana van in a Walmart parking lot and was arrested without incident just before 5 p.m. ET. ‚ÄúThere were six OPP officers from the Kenora detachment on scene,‚Äù McGuire said. ‚ÄúIt sounds to me that they executed a very good arrest.‚Äù The arrest comes five days after Nathan Dumas was found critically injured in a home in St. Catharines, Ont., Friday morning. He was rushed to hospital, but died early Saturday. Kuijer, who is Dumas‚Äô stepfather, is facing a first-degree murder charge in connection to the child‚Äôs death.

Throughout the month of March, and during Xavier‚Äôs journey through the tournament, the Musketeers‚Äô locker room has contained a jar of ashes filled with ashes from the month of February. According to ESPN.com, Musketeers head coach Chris Mack wanted to come up with a way for his team to move on from the troublesome month, which featured a 3-5 record that included a five-game losing streak, and losing starting Xavier guard Edmond Sumner for the season to an ACL tear. So what did they come up with? Burning the calendar‚Äôs month of February, and putting the ashes from it in an urn. They had to compromise slightly on that last part. "Let's not just burn it. Let's keep the ashes, buy an urn," Mack told his staff. The coaches went onto Walmart's website looking for urns, something none of them had ever done. They sent graduate assistant Allen Payne out to the store to pick one up, but the one they wanted wasn't available anymore. So they settled on a jar that wasn't technically an urn, but it was glass, and you can see inside of it. It would suffice. Mack then called a meeting with his players and gave them all a calendar of the month of February, that included the games and the scores from the month, including three losses back-to-back-to-back to bubble teams on the road. He then told them to write something private on the back of it ‚Äî one thing each player was willing to sacrifice in the coming weeks for the greater good of the team. Then, the burning of the calendars began. "We had a big aluminum trash can in the middle of the locker room," Mack said. "We made sure all the smoke detectors and alarms were off. Everybody burned it." Photo via Jeff Borzello/ESPN Ironically, Xavier lost to Marquette at home the very next day, but since that loss the team has gone 5-1, with a 75-73 loss to Creighton in the Big East tournament championship game. But the last two wins for the Musketeers were over higher seeds in the NCAA tournament, including a blowout 91-66 win over No. 3 FSU. It looks like for now, the jar of ashes is working for Xavier.

(REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton) Sears Holdings Corp, once the largest U.S. retailer, warned on Tuesday about its ability to continue as a ‚Äúgoing concern‚Äù after years of losses and declining sales. ‚ÄúOur historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern,‚Äù Sears said in its annual report for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. The company said an inability to generate additional liquidity might limit its access to new merchandise or its ability to procure services. Continued operating losses also could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement, according to the filing. The warning comes less than six weeks after the company announced what it called the ‚Äúnext phase of its strategic transformation,‚Äù in which it hoped this year to reduce costs by $1 billion and cut its debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion. Sears shares were down 17.6 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday. Related Coverage Wal-Mart Plans to Slow New Store Openings, Invest in Online The company is also considering selling some of its businesses, such as the Kenmore appliances and DieHard car battery brands. The Sears catalog was an emblem of the post-World War II consumer boom in the United States but the company was unable to adjust to the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart Stores, Target Corp and others. The company lost $2.22 billion in the year ended Jan. 28. Since 2013 it has accumulated $7.4 billion in losses and seen revenue fall 44 percent to $22.1 billion. During that time, Sears cut the number of its U.S. stores by nearly a third, reduced holdings in Sears Canada, and spun off the Lands‚Äô End clothing chain. Its total liabilities stand at $13.19 billion. A Sears logo is seen inside a department store in Garden City, New York on May 23, 2016. (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo) In recent years, Sears has placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust (REIT), sold its Craftsman line of tools, and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire Chief Executive Edward Lampert‚Äôs hedge fund. Lampert owned nearly 10 percent of the REIT that paid Sears $2.6 billion in 2015 for stores that it purchased, many of which were then leased back to the retailer. The announcement of Sears‚Äô potential demise is a blow to Lampert, a hedge fund investor who took control of Sears after merging it with Kmart, which he controlled, in 2004. He soon published a 15-page manifesto, in which he stated that conventional measures of retail success, such as same-store sales, were no longer relevant. Sears would regain its health by closing struggling stores and focusing instead on profitable sales, he wrote. Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011. Related Coverage Sears Reaches Profit Through Property Sales Sears said on Tuesday actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900 million sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year. But the filing also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic. As part of the Craftsman sale, Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. That puts a claim on some Sears‚Äô assets in an effort to protect pensions of retired employees. The agreement ‚Äúcontains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets, which could impact our ability to complete asset sale transactions or our ability to use proceeds from those sales to fund our operations,‚Äù the company said. Already, the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a $250 million cash payment to its pension plan by March of 2020, and the pension board has a 15-year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products.

By Josh¬†Kolm 22 hours ago The Children‚Äôs Miracle Network has long heard the stories of the kids that have persevered during treatment in its hospital network. So this year, it is conducting the ‚ÄúLimitless Support‚Äù campaign to bring those stories to the rest of Canada. During a live stream held over the weekend, visitors to a ‚ÄúLimitless Support‚Äù microsite could watch an automated machine in Ottawa inflate thousands of helium balloons. Visitors to the site inflated the balloons by inputting their name, which would then float through the screen as a ‚Äúpuff of air.‚Äù Once fully inflated, the balloon was released and floated to the ceiling of the room. J. Walter Thompson Canada led the campaign, which was also supported by Children‚Äôs Miracle Network‚Äôs corporate partners, Walmart and Air Canada. The broader fundraising campaign will continue into the late spring and early summer. Every year, Children‚Äôs Miracle Network 12 member hospitals in Canada select a patient as a ‚Äúchampion‚Äù to represent the hospital, the work it is doing and the community it is based in. The champions have typically told their story to those within the organization, first at a Canadian event and then at one for member hospitals across North America. Adam Starkman, chief development officer for the Children‚Äôs Miracle Network, says¬†the ‚ÄúLimitless Support‚Äù campaign was an effort to bring the champions and their stories to the public. ‚ÄúWe really wanted to focus on these kids as incredible people,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe were looking for something that was interactive and shareable because we haven‚Äôt had a platform to amplify their story beyond the group gathered at these events. Doing something socially and in digital gave us that opportunity.‚Äù More than 5,000 balloons were inflated between March 18 and 20, after which this year‚Äôs group of Children‚Äôs Miracle Network ‚Äúchampions‚Äù entered the room to see and play with the balloons. Balloons have been a feature of the organization‚Äôs past fundraising campaigns, with donors signing their name to a balloon to show their support. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs part of why the idea resonated for us when we saw that come back from JWT,‚Äù Starkman says. ‚ÄúIt was new but still tied back into our past work, which used the balloon because it is a great symbol of childhood. And within seconds of the kids walking into the room, they instinctively started to kick them around and play with them. Childhood and balloons go well together.‚Äù After someone contributed their name to the live stream, they were encouraged to share the experience through social and bring others to the site. Beyond watching thousands of balloons automatically inflate, the site featured profiles for each of this year‚Äôs champions so people could learn more about their stories and how the work at someone‚Äôs local children‚Äôs hospital has contributed to their lives. It also has downloadable images and social assets featuring each of the champions for people to share through social. ‚ÄúAll the funds we raise stay in the community that raised them,‚Äù Starkman says. ‚ÄúSo having one person that everyone in that community can focus on felt right for us. The activation allowed us to provide customized content and assets, which¬†were then able to be shared more authentically in communities across the country.‚Äù Tags: Adam Starkman, Children's Miracle Network, j walter thompson, J Walter Thompson Canada, JWT, JWT Canada Related Articles Fisherman‚Äôs Friend buddies up to millennials CAA drives home its other benefits Quebec government focuses on French DentsuBos Montreal tapped for aloe yogurt launch Lucky Charms continues its millennial strategy Popular Recent Featured Breaking down Freshii‚Äôs not-so-modest proposal to Subway Tim Hortons bucks the brand value trend Lucky Charms continues its millennial strategy KFC keeps schooling consumers Lg2 names new leadership positions Careers ¬ª Screening Room ¬ª Dairy Farmers gets cheesy to sell milk KFC keeps schooling consumers Reel Canada draws support for homegrown films Koodo goes deeper into ‚ÄòChoose Happy‚Äô Twitter Tweets about "from:StrategyOnline OR @StrategyOnline OR strategyonline.ca" Follow @StrategyOnline Facebook About Strategy strategy‚Ñ¢ uncovers and shares the "bold vision, brand new ideas" of Canada‚Äôs national marketing community.

 Target's brick-and-mortar stores are key to its digital growth BI Intelligence Mar. 22, 2017, 11:44 AM 608 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Target‚Äôs sales sink in Q4 Walmart ramps up e-commerce with two new initiatives Amazon has brought Prime to Mexico This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. While speaking at the Shoptalk 2017 conference, Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer's brick-and-mortar locations have been a major driver of digital growth. He also disclosed that Target has repurposed its stores as fulfillment centers for e-commerce, and they now fulfill close to 55% of all online orders. Cornell's remarks point to Target's broader intent to optimize the in-store experience for the increasingly digital shopper. Cornell also shared plans to redesign 40 Target stores to better serve omnichannel customers and those looking to run errands. The redesigned stores will be tested in Houston this October, and will have two entrances: one for shoppers looking to browse casually, and another for convenience shopping. The ‚Äúspeed‚Äù entrance will house grocery items closer to the front and include grab-and-go food items, self-checkout lanes, and an area for Target's click-and-collect orders to be picked up or returned. The entrance will also have 10-minute parking to make it easier for rushed shoppers to get in and out. Target is trying to reverse its three-quarter decline in comparable store sales by providing a better in-store experience. The company is looking to capitalize on the majority of the population that still purchases in-store by offering a more seamless experience for different types of customers. The store design will be able to better serve both casual shoppers wanting to browse slowly and people looking to run errands quickly by providing each with a designated area ‚Äî eliminating the frustrations that occur when these two types of shoppers cross paths. In addition, the stores will be optimized for omnichannel shoppers due to the built-in click-and-collect counter. The company is mirroring Walmart‚Äôs omnichannel approach and turning its brick-and-mortar presence into an advantage. Target also announced plans to invest $7 billion in both digital and in-store improvements over the next few years. The improvements include lowering prices on grocery and household goods to build loyalty among shoppers, and upgrading its logistics network to keep costs low as online sales continue to grow. The retailer said 50% of Americans live within four miles of a Target store, and it plans to continue to use stores to assist with distribution for this reason. With this pledged investment, it is likely Target will roll out more innovations as it tries to compete with Walmart and Amazon, both of which are working to compete across digital and physical channels. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on new e-commerce strategies that looks at some of the top trends affecting retailers at each stage of the purchase funnel and how they're responding to those shifts. Here are some of the key takeaways: Within digital, consumers are spreading out their retail purchasing across channels, forcing retailers to spread out their online marketing budgets. Paid search, affiliate marketing, and email all increased their share of e-commerce referrals last year, according to Custora. Paid search especially stood out as a major source of spending by retailers. Search ad spending grew 18% YoY in Q4 2015, according to IgnitionOne. Mobile continues to drive the most sales growth for retailers, but sales still aren't keeping up with retail traffic. IBM found that smartphone traffic beat both tablet and desktop, making up 53% of all online traffic. But mobile still only accounted for 29% of all online sales. Retailers only have themselves to blame for underperformance on mobile, as many still aren't using best practices for mobile websites and apps. Only 60% of the top 100 global retailers currently have a dedicated mobile website, according to The Search Agency. The increase in online shopping has put stress on the shipping and logistics industry. The number of UPS ground packages delivered on time during the holidays fell from 97% in 2014 to 91% in 2015, according to ShipMatrix. Retailers are beginning to explore alternative shipping options. Earlier this year Gilt Groupe switched its primary ground shipper from UPS to Newgistics. Retailers that can't afford to invest in alternative shipping options are offering consumers more fulfillment options using what many of them do have ‚Äî brick-and-mortar stores. Buying online and picking up in-store, also called click and collect, made up about 30% of e-commerce sales at Sam's Club in 2015.

Follow on Twitter Facebook Twitter Facebook Messenger Pinterest Email print comment ORLANDO, Fla. -- A jar filled with ashes is an unnerving sight, especially when it's in the corner of a locker room. The Musketeers tried to erase their memories of the month of February while still hanging onto them.¬†Jeff Borzello/ESPN But it's not as morose as it sounds. The ashes in Xavier's locker room represent the Musketeers' month of February. On Feb. 28, Xavier was in the midst of a five-game losing streak. The Musketeers had just lost a tough game at home to Butler in which they turned it over four times in a two-minute span late in the second half. After starting point guard Edmond Sumner was lost for the season because of a torn ACL, Xavier was just 3-5 for the month. The Musketeers needed a spark, something to change the momentum. "We sat in one of those infamous staff meetings and tried to figure out how to turn the page," coach Chris Mack said. And so assistant coach Mike Pegues threw out the idea of burning a calendar. Putting the entire month of February in the past. Mack wanted to take it a step further. 2017 NCAA Tournament ‚Ä¢ Tournament bracket | PDF | GIF ‚Ä¢ Tournament Challenge Second Chance ‚Ä¢ Tournament Challenge: Check brackets ‚Ä¢ 16 things to expect in the Sweet 16 ‚Ä¢ Re-seeding the Sweet 16 teams ‚Ä¢ Breaking down each Sweet 16 team ‚Ä¢ Full NCAA tournament coverage ‚Ä¢ NCAA tournament schedule ‚Ä¢ FiveThirtyEight: Win probabilities ‚Ä¢ 2017-18 outlook for eliminated teams ‚Ä¢ College basketball PickCenter ‚Ä¢ College basketball scoreboard "Let's not just burn it. Let's keep the ashes, buy an urn," Mack told his staff. The coaches went onto Walmart's website looking for urns, something none of them had ever done. They sent graduate assistant Allen Payne out to the store to pick one up, but the one they wanted wasn't available anymore. So they settled on a jar that wasn't technically an urn, but it was glass, and you can see inside of it. It would suffice. Mack called the players in for a meeting before practice that day, emphasizing the difficult schedule they just navigated through during the losing streak. He told them they were still an NCAA tournament team, with most bracketologists having them in the No. 8- or 9-seed range. Then he showed the players a video set to "One Shining Moment," a collection of all of the best Xavier moments in the NCAA tournament over the years. "That's why you guys came here," he told his players. Mario Mercurio, the team's director of basketball administration, made a calendar of the month of February for every player. It was a stock card with the games, the scores -- and showed how three of the losses came back-to-back-to-back to bubble teams (Providence, Marquette and Seton Hall) on the road. Xaiver coach Chris Mack has been to the NCAA tournament in seven of his eight seasons with the Musketeers.¬†Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports Mack then asked each of the players to write one thing on the back of the calendar: something each player was willing to sacrifice over the next couple of weeks for the betterment of the team. It was private; no player had to share. "We had a big aluminum trash can in the middle of the locker room," Mack said. "We made sure all the smoke detectors and alarms were off. Everybody burned it." Anticlimactically, Marquette came to town the next day and shot 57 percent from 3-point range to send Xavier to its sixth straight defeat. But the message was already sent. The team was moving forward and not dwelling on what happened over the previous three weeks. Since that Marquette loss, Xavier is 5-1, with the lone loss coming on a last-second shot from Creighton's Marcus Foster in the Big East semifinals. The Musketeers received an 11-seed in the NCAA tournament, then beat Maryland in the first round and routed 3-seed Florida State in the second round by 25. Playing Tournament Challenge? Don't forget to check your brackets! Bracket busted? We have you covered with a Second Chance Bracket! And they have carried the ash-filled jar with them each step of the way. It will be with them in San Jose on Thursday, when they face Arizona in the Sweet 16 (10:09 p.m. ET, TBS). "We just wanted our guys to constantly have a reminder, no matter where we went," Mack said. "During practice, managers put it out on the scorers table. We wanted our urn to go with us. So our players were forward-thinking and not worried about what happened. "We wanted our players to understand that February was over. It's played out well for us." And the six-game losing streak has been forgotten. The memories are gone. Literally.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Here's what a few once-loyal frequenters of Sears Holding's retail locations had to say about the company's future. Shoppers walk into Sears in Peabody, Mass. (Photo: Elise Amendola, AP) 14 CONNECTTWEET 53 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE It has been 12 long years since¬†Sears Holdings¬†(SHLD)¬†CEO¬†Eddie Lampert merged what was once the world's largest retailer with Kmart in an attempt to build a mega-retailer. The idea being that the new enterprise would be capable of competing not just with Wal-Mart, but also the likes of Macy's and J.C. Penney. While at first hailed as a stroke of genius, the combination has been a disaster. Store traffic and total sales, which have been halved since that fateful day in the spring of 2005, have slid year after year.¬† Despite this pledge, losses continue to mount, and there are whispers of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the future. But Sears Holdings shareholders have cause for hope, for here to save the day and offer some free advice is an army of savvy consumers, shrewd bargain-hunters, and espousers of all that is rooted in good-old fashioned common sense. I speak not of myself but of a recent conversation I had at a small family reunion. In what amounted to a harmless, unscripted, and unexpected conversation about what Sears just doesn't get, multiple members of my family had some fantastic business insights for Eddie Lampert -- an obviously smart guy who was probably out of his depth when it came to operating a retailer. Here's what they had to say: Pick a brand! The value of combining what is arguably America's most storied department-store brand with a tried-and-true, but struggling, discount retailer never quite made sense to many on Wall Street. My conversation drove home the fact that Main Street feels the same way. As I explained, the rationale for the Sears-Kmart combination was largely based on both companies' extensive real estate holdings, as well as the reasonable idea that they could at least match the pricing structures of their competitors. And that's why we all agreed that focusing on a single brand was just the ticket. By putting all its attention on a single brand -- perhaps Sears, as it's arguably the more valuable brand of the two -- the company could leverage the distribution network, real estate, and negotiating power of the combined entities. Sears locations could have remained the same, while Kmart locations could have been converted to "Sears Everyday" or "Sears Home." A hitch in this plan is that of the two brands, Kmart was the stronger-performing retailer in recent years, perhaps proof that the company simply needs to pick a cohesive, value-focused strategy and stick to it. To many present, the fact that there was never a cohesive strategy when the two companies merged told them that the company was simply confused about its identity. More on Sears:¬† Sears and Kmart might not have enough money to stock their shelves Is your local Sears or Kmart among 150 stores to be axed? See the list What happens when Sears' Kmart, Macy's close a store? Why we loved Sears: The Sears catalog You don't have to stay anchored to America's malls Both brands have experienced a decreasing store count, particularly since fiscal 2012, when the company's overall total store count topped out at 4,010. Now, following wave after wave of mass closures, the spin off of Sears Canada, and asset sales, that number stood at just 1,430 as of Jan. 28, 2017. True, closing unprofitable stores has been the name of the game for retail in recent years, but the company does have more leeway with consumers when it comes to its presence as an anchor store in practically every major mall in the United States. Many at the table noted that they don't mind driving for a bargain on desirable wares. What's more, many noted that other comparable retailers, including¬†J.C. Penney, have standalone locations that often have fantastic deals just down the street from the local mall. Sears' management team is probably aware of that fact. It is, after all, seeking to monetize as many unprofitable locations as possible through the company's¬†Sears Holdings Real Estate subsidiary. The message to management, then, is clear: Focus on giving your customers a reason to come to your store, and less on the old rules (such as convenient locations), and you might just win back a few customers. Which brings us to the most valuable lesson for Lampert and company. Give the people what they want Throughout the conversation at my reunion, I repeatedly heard complaints about the merchandise offerings at both Kmart and Sears. Here's a sample: "One of the only reasons people had to go to Sears was for Craftsman tools; now that's been sold off." "The clothing at both these places is beyond unattractive." "I like their silver-toed socks, though." "Why can't they at least offer the same type of clothing that you find at Target?" "Oh, I love going to Kmart for winter gloves on clearance. I get $40 worth of gloves for $8." "I still can't believe they spun off Lands' End." "If I need a new outfit, I immediately go to T.J. Maxx¬†or Dillard's." The key point for Sears Holdings to draw from this debate is to look around at what its competitors are doing, because consumers sure are. It needs to ignore the real estate deals, rewards programs, and spin-offs for a second and ask why a shopper would go to Sears or Kmart over any number of other offerings. In a world dominated by constant discounts, rewards programs, and Amazon.com, consumers simply have too many choices for you to not offer at least something of equal value. Foolish takeaway I walked away from the evening with not only a full belly (there truly is nothing like a home-cooked meal) but also a full brain, grateful for what I'd learned. It's easy to reduce the operations of a business to just income statements and balance sheets, an endless array of ones and zeros, dollars and cents.¬†But those numbers are the product of something, not the inputs. They're the end result of a million decisions American shoppers make every day. And they tell a tale of once-loyal Sears and Kmart shoppers choosing to go elsewhere, which is why the accounting statements continue to show a sea of red ink. Is the sainted advice of my Midwestern relatives the magic elixir that saves Sears? Maybe, maybe not. But I do feel one thing is for sure: Giving the customers value for what they want and putting yourself in their shoes is probably a step in the right direction. ¬† Sean O'Reilly has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Sears said that there is 'substantial doubt' that it will be able to remain in business. The company, which runs Kmart and its namesake stores, has struggled for years with weak sales. Gene J. Puskar/AP/File | Caption Loading... Mengqi Sun Staff | @mitchiesun March 22, 2017 ‚ÄîSears, once the largest US retailer, indicated on Tuesday that it might be difficult for the chain to keep its doors open after years of declining sales and losses, as the company identifies various risks and uncertainties in its annual report for the fiscal year ended on Jan. 28.¬† Sears Holdings Corp.,¬†the parent of Kmart and Sears, said an inability to generate more liquidity ‚Äì because of its accumulated losses and the restrictions from a domestic pensions plan ‚Äì will limit its access to new merchandise and new funds and restrain its ability to offer services needed, the company said. "Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company's ability to continue as a going concern," Sears said in the regulatory filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.¬† The 131-year-old department store chain¬†has not reported a profit since 2011 and has accumulated $7.4 billion in losses since 2013, as its revenue dropped 44 percent to $22.1 billion. It lost $2.22 billion in the past fiscal year and now has total liabilities of $13.19 billion.¬† The company in February outlined its ‚Äúnext phase of strategic transformation,‚Äù hoping to reduce costs by $1 billion and cut its debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion.¬† Which company used the slogan 'Where's the beef?' Take our 'business slogan' quiz. In its heyday, Sears, which started as a mail-order company, was once emblematic of the post-World War II consumer boom in the Untied States. Facing headwinds churned up by a changing retail landscape and increasing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart and Target,¬†the store merged with Kmart in 2004 to become Sears Holdings Corp. Shortly after the acquisition, its chief executive officer Edward Lampert said only by closing struggling stores and focusing on profitable sales, instead of seeking conventional measures of retail success, could Sears regain its health. The chain has cut its retail stores in the United States by nearly a third since 2013 to 670 and has placed some of its stores in a real estate investment trust. It has also been taking significant steps to reduce costs and liabilities by selling some of its businesses. The company reached a deal on Jan. 5 to sell its Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker for an upfront price of $900 million. Sears received $525 million upon closing the deal, and is scheduled to receive a further $250 million in cash in the next three years, as well as payments on future sales of the Craftsman products in the next 15 years. The earnings from the deal, Sears said, could meet its capital needs for the current fiscal year.¬† In 2014, Sears also spun off its Lands‚Äô End clothing chain and reduced its holdings of Sears Canada by up to 40 million shares to consolidate its operation. According to Reuters, the company is also considering selling some other businesses, including the Kenmore appliance and DieHard car battery brands.¬† Yet, any additional asset sales might be difficult for the company. Sears, which employs 140,000 people, in March entered into a five-year pension plan protection and forbearance agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The agreement requires Sears to turn over $250 million garnered from Stanley to its pension plan by March 2020 while granting the pension board a 15-year lien on additional revenue owed to Sears.

"We're short retail," Marc Lasry said, declining to answer a direct question about whether he's short Sears. "I don't know if my compliance department will allow me to" say either way. Shares of Sears were tanking about 13 percent Wednesday morning, a day after the troubled retailer warned about its ability to stay afloat. The Sears catalog was an emblem of the post-World War II consumer boom in the United States, but the company has been unable to adjust the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart and Target, not to mention Amazon. "The issues you're having on the retail side [overall] are just too big," Lasry said. "You're going to see a lot of equity value go down." "You'll have value to these companies, but it's going to be a lot less than people think. So therefore you want to be in that debt," argued the chairman and CEO of Avenue Capital, which has about $10.7 billion in assets under management. Major investment companies can make a lot of money betting on the debt of companies that have filed for bankruptcy or are likely to file. If the once-troubled company were able to emerge from bankruptcy, then the holder of the debt could see value soar. In Wednesday's "Squawk Box" appearance, Lasry also talked about the overall stock market. While standing by his January prediction on CNBC for a 10 percent gain in the S&P 500 this year, he warned that the Trump rally could falter in 2018 as hopes for 3 percent GDP fail to turn into reality. ‚Äî Reuters contributed to this report.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Mar 22nd 2017 10:23AM March 21 (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp, once the largest U.S. retailer, warned on Tuesday about its ability to continue as a going concern after years of losses and declining sales. "Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company's ability to continue as a going concern," Sears said in its annual report for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. (http://bit.ly/2mRUcce) The company said an inability to generate additional liquidity might limit its access to new merchandise or its ability to procure services. Continued operating losses also could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement, according to the filing. The warning comes less than six weeks after the company announced what it called the "next phase of its strategic transformation," in which it hoped this year to reduce costs by $1 billion and cut its debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion.

The company is also considering selling some of its businesses, such as the Kenmore appliances and DieHard car battery brands. The Sears catalog was an emblem of the post-World War II consumer boom in the United States but the company was unable to adjust to the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart Stores, Target Corp and others. The company lost $2.22 billion in the year ended Jan. 28. Since 2013 it has accumulated $7.4 billion in losses and seen revenue fall 44 percent to $22.1 billion. During that time, Sears cut the number of its U.S. stores by nearly a third, reduced holdings in Sears Canada, and spun off the Lands' End clothing chain. Its total liabilities stand at $13.19 billion. In recent years, Sears has placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust (REIT), sold its Craftsman line of tools, and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire Chief Executive Edward Lampert's hedge fund. Lampert owned nearly 10 percent of the REIT that paid Sears $2.6 billion in 2015 for stores that it purchased, many of which were then leased back to the retailer. The announcement of Sears' potential demise is a blow to Lampert, a hedge fund investor who took control of Sears after merging it with Kmart, which he controlled, in 2004. He soon published a 15-page manifesto, in which he stated that conventional measures of retail success, such as same-store sales, were no longer relevant. Sears would regain its health by closing struggling stores and focusing instead on profitable sales, he wrote. Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011. Sears said on Tuesday actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900 million sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year. But the filing also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic. As part of the Craftsman sale, Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. That puts a claim on some Sears' assets in an effort to protect pensions of retired employees. The agreement "contains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets, which could impact our ability to complete asset sale transactions or our ability to use proceeds from those sales to fund our operations," the company said. Already, the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a $250 million cash payment to its pension plan by March of 2020, and the pension board has a 15-year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products.

REUTERS/Pablo Sanhueza 2/2 SANTIAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N) Chilean unit will invest $800 million in the country over the next three years and open 55 to 60 new supermarkets, the company said on Wednesday, a significant outlay at a time of slow economic growth. As part of the plan, the retail and supermarket chain will also remodel over 50 stores, add more than 5,000 jobs, and further develop a large distribution center near the capital city of Santiago. "We are confident in the future potential of the country, and we are convinced that spaces exist to continue expanding our low-cost model," Walmart Chile general manager Horacio Barbeito said in a statement. "Both in the high and low moments of the economic cycle, consumers are always interested in using their budget efficiently, and this will continue being our focus." Chile's economy has struggled in recent years amid low prices for key export copper and lagging business confidence. Gross domestic product in the fourth quarter contracted 0.4 percent from the prior quarter, worse than forecast, and first-quarter 2017 figures will be affected by a work stoppage at Chile's largest mine. In its statement, Wal-Mart said the expansion plan will focus on medium-sized stores, such as the company's Express de Lider and Super Bodega aCuenta formats. The distribution center is already under construction and will require 2,000 employees and $180 million in investment, the company added. The company said it will also seek to improve its online department. Online retail has been on the rise in parts of Latin America in recent years, and other Chilean retailers such as Falabella FAL.SN and Cencosud CEN.SN have invested significant sums in this area.

Here's what you need to know. Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest MAURO FERMARIELLO/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY While experts agree that multivitamins aren't needed for most Americans, there‚Äôs been a lot of talk about vitamins lately. Enough to make one wonder: Is taking vitamins good for you, ever? Gwyneth Paltrow‚Äôs doctor Alejandro Junger, M.D., for example, recently said supplements helped the actress and Goop founder rebound from adrenal fatigue, a nonmedically recognized condition that some say is marked by fatigue, issues with concentrating, and difficulty handling stress. Last week, TV personality Lo Bosworth claimed on her blog that vitamins improved her depression, which was brought on by ‚Äúsevere deficiencies‚Äù of vitamin B12 and vitamin D. And Khloe Kardashian recently posted a photo of her vitamin regimen on Instagram‚Äîand based on the photo, it appears that she takes 23 vitamins a day. These celebrities are just a small sample of a larger trend. Americans spend $30 billion a year on supplements, according to The Journal of Nutrition. But is everyone wasting their money, or is there a time when taking vitamins is actually good for you? Recent research on vitamins hasn‚Äôt exactly supported the prevailing idea that everyone should be taking multivitamins. A 2013 large-scale scientific review published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that there was ‚Äúno clear evidence‚Äù that vitamins helped increase a person‚Äôs life span or decrease their odds of developing heart disease or cancer. That same year, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, a group of doctors who give out medical advice based on scientific evidence, chose not to recommend the use of multivitamins to prevent heart disease or cancer in people who aren‚Äôt deficient in certain nutrients. ‚ÄúThe current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the use of multivitamins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer,‚Äù the organization said. It's not just lack of effectiveness that should determine whether you shell out for supplements. Some vitamins might not even contain the ingredients that they claim on the bottle. In 2015, the New York State attorney general‚Äôs office conducted a study on supplements sold at Target, Walmart, Walgreens, and GNC, and found that about four out of five of those tested didn‚Äôt contain the herbs they were supposed to. Instead, they included filler ingredients like rice, beans, pine, citrus, asparagus, wheat, and wild carrots. Also, important to note: Vitamin and supplement claims do not have to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and the amount of studies done on any particular type of supplement varies widely. Many health benefit claims made by supplement manufacturers haven't been evaluated through peer research, while others‚Äîespecially non-vitamin, non-mineral supplements like those containing herbs‚Äîhaven't been proven to be effective in clinical trials. With all of this in mind‚Äîplus the fact that you can get all the nutrients you need from a balanced, plant-filled diet‚Äîyou may be wondering: Is it ever a good idea to invest in vitamin supplements? Here's what you need to know. Vitamin supplements are useful for people with certain vitamin deficiencies and for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. You‚Äôve probably heard at some point that it‚Äôs important to take folic acid before you become pregnant and during pregnancy, and there‚Äôs research to back that up. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) points to evidence that finds that taking folic acid before getting pregnant and in early pregnancy lowers the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects (i.e., birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord). That's why the CDC recommends that all women who can get pregnant should take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Women are encouraged to take prenatal vitamins (which contain folic acid) when they‚Äôre pregnant, and that recommendation extends to breastfeeding moms‚Äîwith good reason, Rebekah L., Huppert, R.N., I.B.C.L.C., a lactation consultant at the Mayo Clinic, tells SELF. ‚ÄúMost of the vitamins and minerals we need are in food, and a healthy diet will likely get you close, but while you‚Äôre breastfeeding, taking a multivitamin can be your insurance policy,‚Äù she says. Most of the vitamins that a growing baby needs will be in the mother‚Äôs breast milk, but breastfeeding can deplete the mom‚Äôs own vitamin stores, Huppert explains. Iron may also be important for a woman to take after she delivers, since blood loss is common during the birthing process (the mineral can boost hemoglobin, which helps transport oxygen in the blood). If you suffer from a vitamin deficiency, it can be helpful to take a supplement of that particular vitamin, Dana Simpler, M.D., a primary care practitioner at Baltimore‚Äôs Mercy Medical Center, tells SELF. For example, ‚ÄúMany adults can develop a B12 deficiency‚Äîespecially if they follow a plant-based diet‚Äîthat can be detected in a blood test,‚Äù she says. Vitamin D is a vitamin that can be ‚Äúnotoriously difficult‚Äù to find in a healthful diet, Gina Keatley, a C.D.N. practicing in New York City, tells SELF. While she points out that people can get more vitamin D from eating tuna, salmon, nuts, and seeds, some may need to take a supplement to get the right amount. This is especially true if you don't get enough sun exposure throughout the day as well, since the UV rays in sunlight helps our bodies produce this vitamin. Some studies suggest a link between low vitamin D levels in the blood and mood disorders like depression and seasonal affective disorder (SAD), the Mayo Clinic says, but more research is needed before a conclusion can be made. If you suffer from a medical condition like anemia, a red blood cell deficiency that causes fatigue, taking an iron supplement may be necessary, women‚Äôs health expert Jennifer Wider, M.D., tells SELF. Other medical conditions and medications can impact a person‚Äôs absorption of particular nutrients, and supplementation might be needed to keep you healthy, Sonya Angelone, R.D., a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, tells SELF. However, you should never take vitamin supplements without first determining with your doctor if you have a deficiency. If you do have a vitamin deficiency, taking a supplement will help get you back on track. But experts agree that it‚Äôs generally a bad idea to start taking a new supplement based on a self-diagnosis. ‚ÄúTake a supplement only if you need it,‚Äù Angelone says. ‚ÄúThe dose depends on several factors, including the levels in your own body.‚Äù And, while it seems like a good idea to take a multivitamin just in case, Dr. Simpler points out that recent evidence really doesn‚Äôt imply that it‚Äôs necessary or good for you. ‚ÄúI used to recommend them and take them myself, but it‚Äôs now quite clear that there‚Äôs no need for multivitamins in an otherwise healthy person with a good diet,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for somebody that has normal access to food.‚Äù While taking too many vitamin supplements may seem harmless, it actually can be dangerous. Fat-soluble vitamins‚ÄîA, D, E, and K‚Äîbuild up in your body for long periods of time, Angelone says, so you want to make sure you actually need them before you take them. Having too much vitamin A in your body can be bad for your bones, Dr. Wider points out, and too much vitamin E may potentially increase the risk of heart problems in certain people. ‚ÄúIf a person takes too much of these, the consequences can be serious,‚Äù she says. Water-soluble vitamins‚Äîi.e., those that dissolve in water‚Äîlike the B vitamins (folate, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12) and vitamin C can all be flushed out of your body with water, Dr. Wider says, so your body can‚Äôt store excess amounts of them. ‚ÄúBut there are some potential dangers with these, too,‚Äù she says. For example, taking too much vitamin C and not drinking enough water can cause diarrhea and nausea. Those prone to kidney stones should also pass on vitamin C, because it can increase stones in people predisposed to them. And there's a limit to how much B6, a vitamin considered good for pregnant and nursing moms that appears in many prenatal vitamins, women should take. ‚ÄúLevels higher than 80 mg can cause neurological, GI, and skin problems,‚Äù Huppert says. (Since B6 also shows up in energy drinks, nursing moms on prenatal vitamins are discouraged from drinking energy drinks, she points out.) And, while some people can benefit from a vitamin D supplement, you shouldn't just start taking high levels of the vitamin in hopes of warding off depression. ‚ÄúExcess vitamin D can be just as harmful as a deficiency,‚Äù says certified dietitian-nutritionist Lisa Moskovitz, R.D., CEO of NY Nutrition Group. She says that's why it‚Äôs best to have tests run by your doctor and see what your D levels are before jumping on any new supplement. ‚ÄúToo much of a good thing is not a good thing at all,‚Äù she adds. Moskovitz tells SELF that it‚Äôs also important to be wary of drug interactions. ‚ÄúTaking too many of certain vitamins can be dangerous as they interfere with medications and medical conditions, and can cause toxicity,‚Äù she says. For example, calcium supplements can interfere with thyroid medications, says Moskovitz. Keatley also points out that vitamin K could be deadly if you‚Äôre taking certain medications, such as the blood thinner Warfarin. Here's the bottom line. If you suspect that you have a vitamin deficiency, talk to your doctor about getting blood work done to see if you‚Äôre low in any particular nutrient. From there, your doctor may recommend eating more of particular foods or taking a supplement‚Äîbut it‚Äôs important to have that conversation before popping a new pill. And always be sure to let your doctor know about any other kinds of supplements you're taking, in case of drug interactions. ‚ÄúAlways speak with your health care provider,‚Äù Dr. Wider says. ‚ÄúIt's a safer way to go.‚Äù Related: How to Take Vitamins Correctly Please, Please Stop Juicing Your Vegetables 12 Mindful Eating Tips to Know You May Also Like: 8 Things Everyone Should Keep in Their Pantry Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Keywords vitamins, supplements, news, nutrition Trending 1 Culture This Woman‚Äôs Story of Being Fat-Shamed at Dairy Queen Will Break Your Heart 2 Food 5 Foods That Reduce Stress 3 Beauty Whoa, Jennifer Lopez Cut Her Hair Into a Shoulder-Length Lob Wellness, Meet Inbox Sign up for our Newsletter and join us on the path to wellness.

The company said an inability to generate additional liquidity might limit its access to new merchandise or its ability to procure services. Continued operating losses also could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement, according to the filing. The warning comes less than six weeks after the company announced what it called the ‚Äúnext phase of its strategic transformation,‚Äù in which it hoped this year to reduce costs by $1 billion and cut its debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion. Sears also is considering selling some of its businesses, such as the Kenmore appliances and DieHard car battery brands. The Sears catalog was an emblem of the post-World War II consumer boom in the US but the company was unable to adjust to the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Walmart, Target and others. The retailer‚Äôs fate was sealed roughly 10 years ago when owner Eddie Lampert, the hedge fund billionaire, bought the chain, merged it with Kmart and then decided to all but stop investing in the chains‚Äô upkeep and capital spending. The strategy has been questioned many times but Lampert, who eventually took over as CEO of the chains despite no retail experience, refused to budge from it. In fact, his 15-page manifesto in 2005 stated that conventional measures of retail success, such as same-store sales, were no longer relevant. Sears would regain its health by closing struggling stores and focusing instead on profitable sales, he wrote. It is not known if any other retailer followed Lampert‚Äôs advice. The company lost $2.22 billion in the year ended Jan. 28. Since 2013, it has accumulated $7.4 billion in losses and seen revenue fall 44 percent to $22.1 billion. During that time, Sears cut the number of its US stores by nearly a third, reduced holdings in Sears Canada, and spun off the Lands‚Äô End clothing chain. Its total liabilities stand at $13.19 billion. In recent years, Sears has placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, sold its Craftsman line of tools, and repeatedly raised debt from Lampert‚Äôs hedge fund. Lampert owned nearly 10 percent of the real estate investment trust that paid Sears $2.6 billion in 2015 for stores that it purchased, many of which were then leased back to the retailer. Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011. The company said last month it would cut costs by $1 billion and reduce debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Sears said Tuesday that actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900 million sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year. But the filing also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic. As part of the Craftsman sale, Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. That puts a claim on some Sears assets in an effort to protect pensions of retired employees. The agreement ‚Äúcontains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets, which could impact our ability to complete asset sale transactions or our ability to use proceeds from those sales to fund our operations,‚Äù the company said. Already, the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a $250 million cash payment to its pension plan by March 2020, and the pension board has a 15-year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products.

(http://bit.ly/2mRUcce) The company said an inability to generate additional liquidity might limit its access to new merchandise or its ability to procure services. Continued operating losses also could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement, according to the filing. The warning comes less than six weeks after the company announced what it called the "next phase of its strategic transformation," in which it hoped this year to reduce costs by $1 billion and cut its debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion. Sears also is considering selling some of its businesses, such as the Kenmore appliances and DieHard car battery brands. The Sears catalog was an emblem of the post-World War II consumer boom in the United States but the company was unable to adjust the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart Stores , Target Corp. and others. The company lost $2.22 billion in the year ended Jan. 28.Since 2013 it has accumulated $7.4 billion in losses and seen revenue fall 44 percent to $22.1 billion. During that time, Sears cut the number of its U.S. stores by nearly a third, reduced holdings in Sears Canada, and spun off the Lands' End clothing chain. Its total liabilities stand at $13.19 billion. In recent years, Sears has placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, sold its Craftsman line of tools, and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire Chief Executive Edward Lampert's hedge fund. Lampert owned nearly 10 percent of the real-estate investment trust that paid Sears $2.6 billion in 2015 for stores that it purchased, many of which were then leased back to the retailer. The announcement of Sears' potential demise is a blow to Lampert, a hedge fund investor who took control of Sears after merging it with Kmart, which he controlled, in 2004. He soon published a 15-page manifesto, in which he stated that conventional measures of retail success, such as same-store sales, were no longer relevant. Sears would regain its health by closing struggling stores and focusing instead on profitable sales, he wrote. Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011. The company said on Tuesday actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900 million sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year. But the filing also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic. As part of the Craftsman sale, Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. That puts a claim on some Sears' assets in an effort to protect pensions of retired employees. The agreement "contains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets, which could impact our ability to complete asset sale transactions or our ability to use proceeds from those sales to fund our operations," the company said. Already, the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a $250 million cash payment to its pension plan by March of 2020, and the pension board has a 15-year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products.

Does anybody eat cereal for breakfast anymore? 1 in 3 investors fear stocks are overvalued NEW YORK (CNNMoney) - After years of huge losses and store closings, the future is officially in doubt for Sears and Kmart. Sears Holdings, the holding company for the two iconic retail brands, warned investors late Tuesday that it can't promise it will stay in business. It included the language in its annual report while insisting it might still turn things around. "Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company's ability to continue as a going concern," said the statement. While its recent history has been written in red ink, Sears was once one of the nation's most powerful companies, both the Walmart and Amazon of its time. But its once-proud brands have mostly been forgotten by the modern American shopper. Now Sears Holdings is not even sure it can raise enough cash through loans and debt financing to survive. The company owes $4.2 billion, up from about $3 billion a year ago. It lost $2.2 billion in the fiscal year ending in January and has not turned an annual profit since 2010. Its losses since then total $10.4 billion. Sears Holdings said its ability to sell assets, such as stores and store leases, could be limited because it needs those assets to pay for pension plans. In January, Sears sold its Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker. It is looking to sell Kenmore appliances and Diehard auto parts. The company issued a statement later Wednesday stressing that despite the cautionary language in the annual report, it believes it is on course to turn around its struggling business. "It is very important to reiterate that Sears Holdings remains focused on executing our transformation plan," said Chief Financial Officer Jason Hollar. "This is evident in the decisive actions we have taken in recent months. Despite the risks outlined we remain confident in our financial position." Still, Sears Holdings has been in trouble almost since the 2005 merger that joined the two department store brands. At the start of 2006, it had 3,400 U.S. stores and 370 more in Canada that it has since sold. By the end of this January, it had only 1,400 stores left, all in the United States. The company still has 140,000 employees, but that too is down sharply from the 355,000 it had in 2006. Even that doesn't tell the full picture of the decline. Sears was once the nation's largest retailer and business employer. Long before the ascendance of Walmart, and decades before Amazon was even born, the Sears catalog was how many Americans learned to shop from home for a large variety of items they wanted. It developed an extensive store network, helping furnish homes as Americans moved to the suburbs after World War II -- and causing trouble for small, locally owned shops. The company at one time grew to include not just the retail business but a bank, a brokerage, a real estate company and what was then the world's tallest building, the Sears Tower, for its Chicago headquarters. Kmart had a proud tradition of its own as one of the first major discount chains. Its history, like that of Sears, stretches to the late 19th century. It became known for its "blue light specials," short-lived sales signaled by a flashing light and a public address announcement. Kmart also bought many other retail chains that have since gone out of business, including Borders Books and Sports Authority. It filed for bankruptcy in 2002 shortly before Sears merged with its remains. The retail landscape is littered with storied brands that have closed in recent years as brick-and-mortar stores became an albatross in the face of growing competition online. Just in the last year, Sports Authority and The Limited have closed, and RadioShack and American Apparel are both in their second bankruptcies and in danger of shutting down. Macy's, JCPenney and Staples have announced widespread store closing plans. The problems for Sears started well before the growth of online shopping. More than 20 years ago, it began to suffer from competition from low-price competitors such as Walmart, and big-box stores such as Home Depot. It lost its place in the Dow Jones index of the nation's most important companies in 1999. Then came growing competition from Amazon and other online retailers. Analysts said Sears Holdings did little to invest in either the Sears or Kmart brand, instead trying to cut its way back to profitability by trimming advertising and closing stores. It announced plans to close 150 more stores in January, and its stock hit a post-merger low in February. Then the stock rebounded when the company announced a deal with creditors to borrow $140 million more and cut at least $1 billion in operating costs a year, along with reducing its debt and pension obligations by $1.5 billion. The "going concern" warning sent shares down about 15% in midday trading Wednesday. Copyright 2017 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

The Sears catalog was an emblem of the post-World War II consumer boom in the United States but the company was unable to adjust the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart Stores , Target Corp. and others. The company lost $2.22 billion in the year ended Jan. 28.Since 2013 it has accumulated $7.4 billion in losses and seen revenue fall 44 percent to $22.1 billion. During that time, Sears cut the number of its U.S. stores by nearly a third, reduced holdings in Sears Canada, and spun off the Lands' End clothing chain. Its total liabilities stand at $13.19 billion. In recent years, Sears has placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, sold its Craftsman line of tools, and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire Chief Executive Edward Lampert's hedge fund. Lampert owned nearly 10 percent of the real-estate investment trust that paid Sears $2.6 billion in 2015 for stores that it purchased, many of which were then leased back to the retailer. The announcement of Sears' potential demise is a blow to Lampert, a hedge fund investor who took control of Sears after merging it with Kmart, which he controlled, in 2004. He soon published a 15-page manifesto, in which he stated that conventional measures of retail success, such as same-store sales, were no longer relevant. Sears would regain its health by closing struggling stores and focusing instead on profitable sales, he wrote. Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011. The company said on Tuesday actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900 million sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year. But the filing also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic. As part of the Craftsman sale, Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. That puts a claim on some Sears' assets in an effort to protect pensions of retired employees. The agreement "contains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets, which could impact our ability to complete asset sale transactions or our ability to use proceeds from those sales to fund our operations," the company said. Already, the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a $250 million cash payment to its pension plan by March of 2020, and the pension board has a 15-year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products.

The spokesman said he could not get into specifics. Family of teen believed to have been kidnapped by teacher speaks¬†out Officials also are trying to authenticate a statement made by the student‚Äôs family, DeVine said. Elizabeth Thomas had said she was going away for the day but that someone should call police if she wasn‚Äôt home by evening, a relative told HLN earlier. Thomas, 15, has been missing since March 13, weeks after another student reported seeing her and Cummins kissing, police say. Cummins, who had taught Elizabeth in a forensics class at a high school in Culleoka, some 50 miles southwest of Nashville, is charged with kidnapping her. An Amber Alert was issued for Elizabeth on March 14, the day after a sheriff‚Äôs department had declared her missing. Tad Cummins Thomas‚Äô brother, James Thomas, told HLN she told one of their siblings she was going somewhere on March 13, but that someone should call police if she hadn‚Äôt returned by 6 p.m. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt think she was going to be gone that long, I guess, because she did expect to be home by dinner that night,‚Äù James Thomas said. Advertisement Authorities have received about 650 tips relating to the case, but none has produced ‚Äúany credible sighting of this young girl,‚Äù DeVine said. Authorities also are looking into any possible connections the teacher had outside the continental United States. ‚ÄúYou can get a lot of places in a span of eight days, and we realize that,‚Äù DeVine said. Advertisement Police: They could be anywhere Elizabeth Thomas disappeared after a friend dropped her off at a restaurant in Columbia, near Culleoka, on the morning of March 13. Around the same time, Cummins was captured on surveillance footage pumping gas nearby, according to authorities. By that afternoon, investigators determined the teen may have been about 80 miles to the south, in Decatur, Alabama, the TBI says. ‚ÄúAs for what we have seen since then, we have got nothing,‚Äù DeVine said. That leads investigators to believe one of two things: ‚ÄúEither they‚Äôre off the grid in a very rural area, or they are outside the Southeast, where this has been getting an awful lot of attention in the public,‚Äù DeVine said. Advertisement The TBI this week released three new sets of images in the case. One, showing Thomas in a plaid shirt on March 13 in Columbia, is the last known photograph of Elizabeth before her alleged kidnapping, the bureau said. The other two sets are surveillance videos of Cummins. They show him at a Walmart in Columbia, pushing a shopping cart, on March 7, the TBI says. The TBI has not elaborated on when or where the videos were recorded. Police are asking residents living in rural areas across the country to check their properties for any suspicious activity, people or vehicles. What happened before disappearance The teen‚Äôs disappearance came after a chain of events that began January 23, when a Culleoka high school student allegedly saw Elizabeth and Cummins kissing in a classroom, according to Jason Whatley, an attorney for the girl‚Äôs father. The student described the kiss as ‚Äúa peck.‚Äù Tad Cummins The incident was reported to the school the next day, he said. It was another week, Whatley said, before a Maury County sheriff‚Äôs detective notified her father of the allegations. Elizabeth and Cummins made statements denying they had kissed, according to a January 30 investigative report. The teacher called Elizabeth ‚Äúa really good friend‚Äù and said she came to see him when she needed someone to calm her down. Elizabeth said that, like many students, she looked to Cummins as a counselor. Advertisement A faculty member identified in the report as ‚ÄúTeacher 1‚Äù said she had seen Elizabeth in Cummins‚Äô classroom a great deal and felt Cummins ‚Äúshould have a better boundary between his role as the student‚Äôs teacher and the student‚Äôs friend.‚Äù However, Teacher 1 said she never witnessed anything inappropriate, and Cummins‚Äô door was always open when students were in his classroom, according to the report. The report concluded the allegation the two had kissed could not be confirmed but recommended Elizabeth be taken out of Cummins‚Äô class and that she should be told to bring anxiety issues to counselors and administration in the future. Four days later, an official reprimand issued to Cummins on February 4, indicated that Elizabeth had been in his classroom for a half-hour earlier that day. Whatley wrote a letter to the school on February 6, expressing concern that the school wasn‚Äôt doing enough to protect Elizabeth from Cummins. Cummins was suspended from his job that same day. Advertisement ‚ÄúIf it is true that contact between this student and Mr. Cummins has continued in light of these allegations, I can tell you that my client will use whatever legal means are at his disposal, including filing suit, to assist Maury County Schools in protecting (Elizabeth) from Mr. Cummins,‚Äù the attorney wrote. Whatley told HLN on Monday: ‚ÄúOur focus is absolutely on getting Elizabeth back. Yes, there are legal issues. Yes, there are questions ‚Äî a lot of unanswered questions, a lot of outrage, quite frankly. But that‚Äôs really not our focus right now.‚Äù School Superintendent Dr. Christopher J. Marczak issued a statement on Tuesday, saying: ‚ÄúOn behalf of the Maury County Public School system, we hope and pray for the safe return of Elizabeth Thomas. We continue to cooperate with law enforcement in the sharing of all pertinent information while the search continues.‚Äù Police: Man took out $4,500 loan Police said they believe Cummins has two handguns and that he‚Äôs driving a silver Nissan Rogue. Cummins allegedly also did online research about his SUV to see if certain features could be tracked by law enforcement, police said. Advertisement Authorities are trying to evaluate how much cash he may have. Cummins took out a $4,500 loan days before he disappeared, police said. Cummins has been placed on Tennessee‚Äôs most-wanted list. He is charged with aggravated kidnapping and sexual misconduct with a minor. He was fired on March 14, the day after his disappearance, for unprofessional conduct and insubordination, according to his personnel files, which were published by CNN affiliate WZTV.

Costco will now be delivered right to your door Zlati Meyer, USA TODAY Tuesday, 21-Mar-17 11:34:53 PDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest A delivery service announced Tuesday that it will start¬†making runs to Costco to pick up orders for customers, another move toward a world in which traditional retailers compete side-by-side with online sellers to move goods directly to homes. The service, Shipt, says it is launching its Costco service in Tampa and plans to expand to¬†50 markets and more than¬†30 million households by the end of the year. Grocery delivery is the latest way retailers in a thin-margin industry compete for customers.¬†Kroger has teamed with Uber. Wal-Mart has been conducting¬†test runs with Uber and Lyft since last June. Instacart got a huge infusion of funding earlier this month. Other delivery services include Instacart, Amazon Fresh, Google Express and¬†FreshDirect. Shipt says it is already working with¬†Whole Foods Market and regional grocery chains like¬†H-E-B and Harris Teeter. Earlier this month, another supermarket chain, Meijer, announced that due to a successful trial run in southeastern Michigan, it'll start offering Shipt delivery across¬†six Midwestern states. More on food costs:¬† Supermarkets are losing the grocery price war Want to cut your grocery bill in half? Take these 3 steps Shipt members pay a $99 annual fee for unlimited grocery deliveries. Customers have a one-hour window when the merchandise is dropped off. By 2025, as much as 20% of grocery shopping -- or $100 billion in annual consumer sales --¬†could be online, according to the Food Marketing Institute, which calls the shift "seismic." More than 70% of¬†shoppers believe they'll shop for groceries online within the next decade, if not sooner. "Everyone‚Äôs looking to save time and get more out of less time. With Shipt in particular, people love the service and the quality of the experience," said Shipt CEO Bill Smith. While consumers have long since become used to the idea of ordering everything from books to furniture to clothing online, perishables requiring refrigeration offers a unique logistical¬†challenge. Shipt says it is looking to deliver mostly three to four miles from stores, not from far-flung warehouses. "If you order ice cream from us, we‚Äôll deliver it directly to you," Smith explained. Personal-care items, like toiletries, have a higher potential for online delivery than perishables like groceries, but as consumers get more comfortable buying online, they'll move into more categories, said¬†Rupesh Parikh. Oppenheimer¬†senior analyst for food, grocery and consumer products "Consumers are demanding the convenience of home delivery," he said. "Right now, there‚Äôs no easy answer to how to be able¬†to meet the rapidly evolving consumer demands. I don‚Äôt think right now there's a magic bullet. Consumers win with all this innovation out¬†there." Stacy Miletti of Troy, Mich., started using Shipt at Meijer about a year ago and spends about $90 every two weeks on items like breakfast cereal, milk and laundry detergent. "The big motivation for me is it saves time. I don't have to walk up and down the aisles. I can log in at 2 or 3¬†in the morning and do the shopping¬†when it works for me," the 48-year-old realtor estate broker said. "I love it, but it‚Äôs not perfect. The only thing I don't like about it¬†is you¬†have to be home when it‚Äôs delivered." She has yet to buy fruits and vegetables online out of concerns about quality, but by buying her staples online, it still makes her in-person shopping easier. "I don't want to buy a bad apple. I'd rather¬†spend the time and pick out my own produce. It¬†saves me time. I can get my bananas, apples and pears at the fruit stand up the street and I‚Äôm in and¬†out in two seconds," she said.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Enlarge Caption¬† Email More A A REUTERS: Sears Holdings Corp, once the largest U.S. retailer, warned on Tuesday about its ability to continue as a going concern after years of losses and declining sales. "Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company's ability to continue as a going concern," Sears said in its annual report for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. (http://bit.ly/2mRUcce) The company said an inability to generate additional liquidity might limit its access to new merchandise or its ability to procure services. Continued operating losses also could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement, according to the filing. The warning comes less than six weeks after the company announced what it called the "next phase of its strategic transformation," in which it hoped this year to reduce costs by US$1 billion and cut its debt and pension obligations by at least US$1.5 billion.

The woman went to Walmart on Sunday and attempted to return some batteries. After store officials did not allow her to make the return, she went screaming into the parking lot and ultimately tried to run over people with her car. Police say the woman intentionally struck two people with her car and nearly hit both a family and a 3-year-old girl and her mother. Victims of the vehicular attack were treated for minor cuts and bruises at the scene. Police are asking for the public‚Äôs help identifying the woman. ¬† ¬† Tags: woman, people, police, Other stories from today: Fleet of robots added to Redwood City‚Äôs DoorDash: Autonomous bots becoming part of downtown streetscape Domestic dispute turns deadly: Man shoots himself, struck once by police outside Redwood City office complex LAPD: Latinos report fewer sex crimes amid fears ¬† ¬† Print this Page ¬†|¬† << Back ¬† Return To Archives ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Daily Journal Quick Poll ¬† Does the federal government provide sufficient support for the middle class?

Legislature 56,000 sign petition organized by the B.C. Federation of Labour and tabled by NDP Leader John Horgan By¬†Jon Hernandez, CBC News Posted: Mar 15, 2017 4:29 PM PT Last Updated: Mar 16, 2017 10:12 AM PT A petition to raise B.C.'s minimum wage organized by the B.C. Federation of Labour was filled by 56,000 signatures from across the province. (Karin Larsen/CBC) Petition for $15 per hour minimum wage delivered to B.C. legislature 25:20 Related Stories $15 minimum wage will hurt local economy, young workers, says Surrey Board of Trade B.C. raising minimum wage today to $10.85 Western Hockey League exempt from paying players minimum wage as CHL lawsuit looms B.C. to look into legislation allowing women to refuse wearing high heels at work Over 56,000 British Columbians¬†have signed off on a petition to raise province's¬†minimum wage to $15 per hour. The petition, spearheaded by the B.C. Federation of Labour, was brought to the B.C. Legislature on Wednesday in hopes of making minimum wage an election issue. According to the organization's president¬†Irene Lanzinger, over 500,000 workers in B.C. earn¬†minimum wage. "Even if¬†they work full time, they live below¬†the poverty line," she told host Angela Sterrit on CBC's¬†B.C. Almanac. "[Their¬†income is]¬†$4,000 below the poverty line." Of the half million minimum wage earners, 60 per cent are women, and over 70,000 are above the age of 55, said the president. Lanzinger says the bulk of employees work for large companies like Walmart and McDonalds, that "are earning big profits on the backs of low wage workers." The petition was tabled by NDP Leader John¬†Horgan. He¬†maintains that his party would increase the minimum wage should they be voted into office. B.C. NDP promises $15 per hour minimum wage if elected in 2017 Minimum wage in the province is currently $10.85 per hour, up 40 cents as of September, 2016. Prior to the increase, B.C.'s minimum wage was the lowest in the country. Impacts on small business But there are concerns on the effect a potential increase could have on the livelihood of small business. According to¬†Val Litwin, president and CEO for¬†the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, a sharp increase in minimum wage could have a damaging effect on businesses that employ low wage workers. "[We're]¬†not against seeing that¬†minimum¬†wage go up," he said.¬†"It's about doing it with certainty and with¬†predictability." "If¬†that minimum wage goes up in massive or quick increments, it can challenge the viability of a business model." Litwin¬†says a gradual increase in minimum wage, such as current increases put in place by the B.C. Liberals that are based on the Consumer Price Index, are more viable in the long-term. "This is about making sure the economy is thriving. We all want a thriving economy where¬†there's¬†great paying job for¬†people, but we also have to support business to make¬†sure¬†they can keep hiring people and growing." The province plans on increasing B.C.'s minimum wage to $11.35 by the end of the year. B.C. minimum wage to hit $11.25 by 2017 With files from CBC's¬†B.C.

However, Steven Riznyk's law firm, San Diego Biz Law, has been receiving calls from clients nationwide and worldwide who are affected by this section. They are afraid to travel, are denied entry at the border, and lose their airfares as well as vacation times. People don't realize, states Steven Riznyk, how Presidential Order 13768 is affecting their family members and employees. Regrettably, and what is more surprising, states Mr Riznyk, is that a lot of visa and Green Card holders have no idea this Order is in effect, and are blindly traveling outside our borders, never to return. Green Card and Visa Holders are unaware that if they have a criminal record of any kind they require an approved waiver from the CIS (=immigration department) or Governor's Pardon (for more serious offences); otherwise, they are leaving the United States, possibly never to return. Although people think that they only have a 5 or 10-year bar with certain offences, the reality is that they are not automatically allowed in after the time has elapsed; they often have to present a case. People without a valid waiver will find themselves unable to visit sick or dying relatives or otherwise travel outside the United States. Basically, three categories of people are listed as priorities for removal (previously called deportation) that will wipe out a substantial proportion of our foreign population. First, anyone with a criminal record of any kind (even $5.00 shoplifting), anyone who has been convicted of 'any' crime, even if they have not been convicted, and people who have committed the essential elements of a crime, even if they have not been charged. People do not know what this means. For example, if Joe Smith notices that his co-worker, Maria Jones, has been driving while intoxicated after a staff party, he or she can have this person removed from the United States. It's that simple. The problem with this Order is that not everyone who has been charged is guilty. Not everyone who has committed the elements of a crime meant to commit a crime. Why is it that this order has not been in the news a lot? Simple. A lot of people think that something that deals with criminal issues is negative and people may believe they side with offender. As a result, they don't want to touch the topic. However, part of the reason our criminal laws have so many sections and regulations is because there are many instances where an exception should be granted. For example, a lawyer called me, states Steven Riznyk, and stated that a person who was here illegally (and we do not support that) was driving by and saw someone attacking a police officer and the police officer was in threat for his life. The person, being a good human, got out of his car and overtook the criminal, saving the police officer's life. He is now in removal (previously called deportation) proceedings. Is that fair? Should he have left the police officer die? Another situation that sticks with Mr Riznyk's memory is a lady who was at Walmart, picking up pictures, when her child started screaming out of control. She took the kids out of the front door ( a few feet from the photo counter of Walmart) when the employee called security. The woman had every intention of paying the $5.00 but forgot about the risk when she took her kids out for a moment. The person at the counter of Walmart called security and she is in removal proceedings. In San Diego, and particularly in a part of it called Pacific Beach, the local police are conducting traffic stops, checking for DUIs, while the CIS agents are asking for peoples' identification and right to remain in the United States, even following people to their homes if they don't have it handy. Although federal agents are unable to stop people randomly, they are using DUI stops as a way to remove immigrants and visa holders. The problem we have here, is that we have granted high-level powers to people untrained and unequipped to make such decisions. Where lives of parents and children are involved, experience and training can make a world of difference in the exercise of discretionary power. Where stories of people who have made a contribution to the United States and have now been removed will not help our country, states Mr Riznyk. These stories will be shared in the person's country and will spread, creating a reputation we do not deserve. People will have a negative viewpoint of the United States. The many decades we have spent developing an image of a country that does right by others will be wiped out in a microsecond, only to be replaced by thoughts of a country that is ungrateful. On the one hand, it is true that in some cases the foreign person would not be in this predicament had they not committed a criminal offence. The people who have been convicted and not charged or those who have a justification (ie Walmart example above) on the other, should not have to spend 8 months abroad while a waiver is decided, or even a lifetime if it is denied. One aspect of this situation that people do not seem to take into account is the disruption it causes in the lives of schoolchildren, American businesses, and personal lives; especially for people who have a justification.

Mike Mullin held a town hall Wednesday.¬† Practice time Can someone please help me understand how it is OK for high school athletic coaches to have their own middle school children practice with the varsity and JV teams? We, as parents of high school athletes, had to pay an athletic fee. These middle school children did not have to pay that same athletic fee to get the benefits of the coaching and the practice time. How is this fair? Parents have a real problem with this, but our players don't want to say anything to the coaches because they're afraid of reprisals. Health insurance This is about the ACA. People wanted to know who is supporting it. Evidently, these people who bought in who hate it have no one in their family who is needy and dependent on the ACA. If they did, they would realize what a lifesaver it is. Of course, there are refinements that need to be made, but no need to throw out the baby with the bath water. I have several members who, for various reasons, have been heavily dependent on the ACA and its been a lifesaver. Thank you. Rep. Rob Wittman, vote no for the up-coming TrumpCare bill! I am on a fixed income and can barely afford my insurance premiums now, but if I have to pay higher premiums and then wait for tax credits, I will not be able to feed my family and pay rent. You are in Congress to represent your voters first, then your party. If you vote for TrumpCare, I will vote no to your re-election, even if I have to cross party lines.

Road litter From Highway 60 onto Route 199 both ways there is trash that has been accumulating forever on the on and off ramps. An old tire has been there for at least a month. This important area is part of the "Welcome to Colonial Williamsburg" area and "Come to Busch Gardens" traffic arteries that see a lot of tourists and nonresidents. The rest of the area around it is so-so, but why is there no regular maintenance done on these parts of the highway system? Cars are moving slowly so everyone can clearly see each and every unsightly piece of trash. If these are interlocking maintenance responsibilities, someone needs to sort it out. July Fourth music Many of us loved having the Virginia Symphony perform at Palace Green as part of our July Fourth celebration. We were very disappointed at learning they would not be part of future festivities, so reading of the great success and popularity of our Williamsburg Symphony in today's Gazette was inspiring. Could you all be persuaded to do a bang up Fourth of July concert at Palace Green this year? WS, meet CW; CW, meet WS. A closer read Recent "Harmful and Helpful" insects story: You're kidding, right? The list included "many caterpillars" under "Harmful Insects" (and gives one example, the tobacco hornworm). And then, the "Helpful Insects" list includes "Bees and Butterflies." Did it occur to anyone that caterpillars are baby butterflies? Movie choices Have you noticed that both the Movie Tavern on High Street and Regal Cinemas in New Town show the same exact movies. There have been beautiful movies that have been brought out into the market and advertised quite heavily on TV, namely "Silence," "Bitter Harvest," and "The Audubon Lieutenant." None of the three movies that I've just mentioned have yet to appear at these two theaters. Thank you. Looking for ... This is for the person looking for a recommendation for a physician for cataract surgery. I recommend Dr. Anthony DeRosa. He's with Tidewater Physicians Multispecialty Group. He's excellent. He has a good bedside manner. An excellent surgeon. He put the intraocular lenses in once the cataract is taken out. He did both of my eyes and I was delighted. The town will take old heavy TVs if you bring them there, but how can senior citizens get them out of the house and into their car? Need a couple of strong young men to help and I'm happy to pay for this service. Please call 592-7770. I lost a small camera on March 11 near the Williamsburg Library or Farmers Market.

Town halls A round of applause for Monty Mason for holding a town hall meeting. A round of cat calls to Rob Wittman for being a coward and not holding a town hall meeting. Rep. Wittman, you work for the people in the 1st District. Have the guts to face them. Rules of the road It seems to be an ever increasing problem to get on or off the interstate, especially around the Lightfoot exit. When someone is coming down the ramp to get on the interstate and accelerating, you see people getting off I-64 and cutting in front of them. Why don't you slow down since you are getting off and fall behind the car accelerating to get on? Also, you may be in the driver's blind spot, so that they can't see you getting off. A good read I really enjoy "My Greener Future" by Bill Kaufmann. It is very informative. With people losing their jobs or older employees getting pushed out of the work place, the articles are very educational and helpful for these times. Right word Please stop printing letters from people who clearly do not know what the word "fascist" means. We need more public education for those who did not pay attention in their ninth grade civics classes, not more disinformation. Thank you Thanks to the very special person who found my bracelet watch and turned it into customer service at our Neighborhood Walmart. May God richly bless you and the employees at Walmart for your honesty and kindness. Sincere thanks to the caring staff of the Norge Food Lion for their care of me when I fell ill in their store on a recent Saturday. Assistant Manager Barbara Napier was "Mother Hen," never leaving my side. Stephen Opp, an engaging young man with a talent for talk, kept me focused but distracted from my situation. Renee Silver called the paramedics, from Toano/Bruton, who were thorough, clear and very kind. I thank all of them and a staff that cares. Thank you to the wonderful group of people who cleaned up all the trash along News Road. You did a great job and we really appreciate your efforts. Bike races It breaks my heart to hear that someone was horribly inconvenienced by the annual collegiate bike race in Croaker. However, I offer the following in way of consolation: (1) Most bicyclists also own motor vehicles and thus pay the taxes associated with their use. However, they are not obligated to use them, rather than bicycles, on public roads. (2) The Virginia Capital Trail is not a "bike lane" but a paved byway intended for strictly recreational use by bicyclists of all ages and skill levels, as well as walkers, joggers and families pushing strollers. It cannot be used for bicycle racing. (3) While we expect bicyclists to obey traffic laws, including observing stop signs, they do not do so while racing. That's why organized events, such as the Croaker race, post marshals at intersections and are supported by police vehicles. Budget cuts The president's new budget plans on gutting the Coast Guard, among other agencies of the Federal Government. If you gut the Coast Guard, who's going to patrol the Caribbean to keep illegal aliens from coming to the United States from Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean? Strange behavior Who would pull up to my house and park their car in the road followed by jumping out to take flowers from my garden? No request for taking them or anything. Recommended There's a good landscaping company in Williamsburg called Cupp Cuts. Their phone number's 757-784-3627. They've cut my grass and it looks excellent, so I just wanted to pass the word. The phone number for Tyler Cupp is 757-784-3637 and he is the owner. Thank you. I used a company called Duct Hunters for cleaning out my air vent and they did an excellent, excellent job. I wanted to let you know. Their phone number is 757-604-1450. They're very courteous, very professional and efficient. Everything worked out great and the air quality in my house is so much better. Jamestown Window Cleaning recently pressure washed our home, cleaned our windows inside and out and pressure washed our driveway for a great price with wonderful results. The dust and mold have been removed and our home sparkles as we prepare to usher in spring. This is a great local business that is standing by their positive reputation. Give them a call at 757-753-3482. I'd like to thank Ms. Brown from our local C&F bank off of Longhill for her great service on a recent visit. She assisted me with a special task and when her site didn't have the resources I needed, she took time off from her personal lunch break to get these resources from another local office. She provided genuine assistance and personally cared to make sure my task was fulfilled. Thank you for your great service. When was the last time you were served syrup not out of a bottle?

Ankit AjmeraAnd Nathan Layne Reuters Published Wednesday, Mar. 22, 2017 5:03AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Mar. 22, 2017 11:33AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Bondholders and investors on Wednesday turned their attention to questions about just how long Sears Holdings Corp can remain in business, a day after the company‚Äôs surprise disclosure it may not survive as a going concern. The disclosure raised concerns over the retailer‚Äôs debt load and its ability to stock inventory heading into the crucial 2017 holiday season. Sears warns it may close shop (Reuters) ‚ÄúWhile I don‚Äôt think the new disclosure means they will definitely file BK in 2017, it does seem to signal that the next 12 months are even more crucial than has been the case in recent years, as their margin of error is getting slim,‚Äù said Chad Brand, president of Peridot Capital Management, a Sears bondholder. BK is a shorthand for bankruptcy ‚Äì a prospect raised after Sears flagged doubts about its ability to stay in business in the ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù section of its annual report. ‚ÄúOur historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern,‚Äù Sears said in the report. Sears spokesman Howard Reif said the company hopes the actions it is taking will keep it in business. Sears‚Äô shares were down 13 per cent at about $7.90 in early trading on Wednesday. The company, which has $13.19-billion in liabilities, noted that it could have difficulty procuring merchandise from vendors. Bondholders are watching to see whether the company will have the cash and credit needed to stock its shelves for the 2017 holiday season. Retailers typically book orders for merchandise for the vital fourth quarter from now through mid-summer. Continued operating losses also could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement, according to the filing. (http://bit.ly/2mRUcce) ‚ÄúSears has repeatedly engaged in wishful thinking in earnings release after earnings release over the last several years that they could turn the business around,‚Äù said Ken Perkins, president of industry research firm Retail Metrics. ‚ÄúIn today‚Äôs highly competitive retail environment, which requires sizeable investments to compete with Amazon and off-price chains they no longer have the resources to do so.‚Äù Sears, which lost $2.22-billion in the year ended Jan. 28, has $286-million in cash on hand. Retailers in distress often use their accounts receivable. Sears has $466-million in receivables, down substantially from 2012, when the company had $635-million in receivables and $609-million in cash. Since 2012, Sears accumulated $10.54-billion in losses while revenue fell 47 per cent to $22.1-billion. During that time, Sears cut the number of its U.S. stores by nearly a third, reduced holdings in Sears Canada, and spun off the Lands‚Äô End clothing chain. BLOW TO LAMPERT In recent years, Sears has placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust (REIT), sold its Craftsman line of tools, and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire Chief Executive Edward Lampert‚Äôs hedge fund. Lampert owned nearly 10 per cent of the REIT that paid Sears $2.6-billion in 2015 for the stores it purchased, many of which were then leased back to the retailer. The announcement of Sears‚Äô potential demise is a blow to Lampert, a hedge fund investor who took control of Sears after merging it with Kmart, which he controlled, in 2004. He soon published a 15-page manifesto, in which he stated that conventional measures of retail success, such as same-store sales, were no longer relevant. Sears would regain its health by closing struggling stores and focusing instead on profitable sales, he wrote. Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011. The company said on Tuesday actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900-million sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year. But the filing also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic. As part of the Craftsman sale, Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. That puts a claim on some Sears‚Äô assets in an effort to protect pensions of retired employees. The agreement ‚Äúcontains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets, which could impact our ability to complete asset sale transactions or our ability to use proceeds from those sales to fund our operations,‚Äù the company said. Already, the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a $250-million cash payment to its pension plan by March of 2020, and the pension board has a 15-year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products.

The number of people living in the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers metropolitan statistical area rose 2% to 525,032 people, from 513,449 in 2015. The area growth represented a large portion of the population increase in the state. In Arkansas, the population rose by an estimated 10,395 people, between 2015 and 2016. Only 21 metropolitan statistical areas are growing faster than Northwest Arkansas, noted the Census data released Thursday (March 23). The pace of growth was roughly the same as between 2014-2015. The 2016 population estimates for metropolitan statistical areas and counties are of as of July 1, 2016. Mike Harvey, interim president and CEO of the Northwest Arkansas Council, said it‚Äôs ‚Äúconsistent‚Äù and ‚Äúrobust‚Äù growth, but he had expected the population to increase by between 13,000 and 14,000, instead of 11,583. He wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the Census Bureau revised the estimate to more closely align with expectations. The population increased largely because people are moving to the area, and they are moving here for job opportunities, Harvey said. Historically, for every job that was filled, one could expect another two people to move here, but this trend might be changing with millennials representing the largest segment of the workforce. Millennials are ‚Äúmore highly single‚Äù and waiting longer to have families, Harvey said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve handed the baton to the millennials.‚Äù As the 22nd fastest growing area in the United States, it shows it‚Äôs one of the best places to live, said Mervin Jebaraj, assistant director for the Center for Business and Economic Research in the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas. He citied the area‚Äôs amenities, jobs and low cost of housing compared to other areas. ‚ÄúThis is an attractive place to move. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs easier to make a living here,‚Äù he said. Most of the population growth can be attributed to the addition of jobs and the increase in students at the University of Arkansas, Jebaraj said. Northwest Arkansas is home to employers such as Wal-Mart Stores, J.B. Hunt Transport Services and Tyson Foods. The Northwest Arkansas MSA is the 105th largest metro, behind Portland-South Portland, Maine, with a population of 529,657. Based on Northwest Arkansas‚Äô growth rate between 2010 and July 2016, Rob Smith, communications and policy director for the Northwest Arkansas Council, estimated that the MSA‚Äôs population exceeded the Portland, Maine, area earlier this month. ‚ÄúOver the next two years, it‚Äôs a safe bet that we‚Äôll pass Lancaster, Pa., and Youngstown, Ohio,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúIf the growth stays the same in Northwest Arkansas and the places that are slightly larger than us now, we‚Äôll be living in a top 100 MSA by late 2019.‚Äù METRO, COUNTY GROWTH COMPARISONS Since 2000, the Northwest Arkansas MSA has grown 48%, from 347,045 people.

Rounding out the top five on the list were Myrtle Beach-Conway-North Myrtle Beach, S.C.-N.C., Bend-Redmond, Ore., Greeley, Colo., and Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla. About 86% of the U.S. population, or 277.1 million people, live in the 382 metro areas, an increase of 2.3 million people from 2015. As for county data, Maricopa County, Ariz., was the fastest growing county, replacing Harris County, Texas, as the county with the greatest population growth in the United States. The latter county had seen the most growth for eight consecutive years, according to a news release. Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, added 81,360 people between 2015 and 2016, or about 222 people per day. In the same period, Harris County, which includes Houston, had the second most growth, gaining 56,587 people or about 155 people per day. The Census Bureau uses ‚Äúbirths, deaths, administrative records and survey data to develop‚Äù population estimates, the release shows. In May, the Census Bureau will release city and town population estimates and the number of national, state and county housing units as of July 1, 2016.

"Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company's ability to continue as a going concern," Sears said in the annual report for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. (http://bit.ly/2mRUcce) The company said an inability to generate additional liquidity might limit its access to new merchandise or its ability to procure services. Continued operating losses also could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement, according to the filing. The warning comes less than six weeks after the company announced what it called the "next phase of its strategic transformation," in which it hoped this year to reduce costs by $1 billion and cut its debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion. Sears also is considering selling some of its businesses, such as the Kenmore appliances and DieHard car battery brands. The Sears catalog was an emblem of the post-World War II consumer boom in the United States but the company was unable to adjust the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart Stores, Target Corp. and others. The company lost $2.22 billion in the year ended Jan. 28. Since 2013 it has accumulated $7.4 billion in losses and seen revenue fall 44 percent to $22.1 billion. During that time, Sears cut the number of its U.S. stores by nearly a third, reduced holdings in Sears Canada, and spun off the Lands' End clothing chain. Its total liabilities stand at $13.19 billion. In recent years, Sears has placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust, sold its Craftsman line of tools, and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire Chief Executive Edward Lampert's hedge fund. Lampert owned nearly 10 percent of the real-estate investment trust that paid Sears $2.6 billion in 2015 for stores that it purchased, many of which were then leased back to the retailer. The announcement of Sears' potential demise is a blow to Lampert, a hedge fund investor who took control of Sears after merging it with Kmart, which he controlled, in 2004. He soon published a 15-page manifesto, in which he stated that conventional measures of retail success, such as same-store sales, were no longer relevant. Sears would regain its health by closing struggling stores and focusing instead on profitable sales, he wrote. Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011. The company said last month it would cut costs by $1 billion and reduce debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion this year. Sears said on Tuesday actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900 million sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year. But the filing also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic. As part of the Craftsman sale, Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. That puts a claim on some Sears' assets in an effort to protect pensions of retired employees. The agreement "contains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets, which could impact our ability to complete asset sale transactions or our ability to use proceeds from those sales to fund our operations," the company said. Already, the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a $250 million cash payment to its pension plan by March of 2020, and the pension board has a 15-year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products.

A spokesman for that hand-picked panel, Steve Schwarzman, praised Trump as a leader who wants to "do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans." Wait a minute... Steve Schwarzman? Isn't he a billionaire hedge-fund huckster on Wall Street? Yes ‚Äî and Holy Money Bags! ‚Äî there's Jamie Dimon, head of scandal-ridden JPMorgan Chase. Working-class champions? Trump's whole "jobs" panel is made up of Wall Street banksters and corporate powers like Walmart that instead are notorious for laying off and ripping off workers. Trump-the-candidate fulminated against such moneyed elites, calling them "responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class." But now, in a spectacular flip-flop as president, he has brought these robbers directly inside his presidency, asking them to be architects of his economic strategy. He‚Äôs brought these robbers directly inside his presidency. click to tweet Worse, he's doing this in the name of helping workers. Hello!!! To develop policies beneficial to working stiffs, bring in some working stiffs! But not a single labor advocate is on his policy council, in his Cabinet, or anywhere near his White House. Thus, the so-called "job-creation plan" announced by Trump and his corporate cohorts doesn't create any jobs, but calls instead for ‚Äî Ta-dah! ‚Äî deregulating Wall Street. The truth is, these flim-flammers actually want us rubes to believe that "freeing" banksters to return to casino-style speculation and consumer scams will give them more money that they "can" invest in American jobs. Do they think we have sucker wrappers around our heads? Trump's scheme will let banks make a killing, but it doesn't require them to invest in jobs ‚Äî so they won't. There's a name for this: Fraud.

Right now we have over 60 volunteers creating the sounds that you hear on the airwaves 24/7.‚Äù Zimmereman explained how KHOL provides an outlet for unique local perspectives while building community. ‚ÄúWith the exception of ‚ÄúDemocracy Now‚Äù every weekday at 3 p.m., everything you hear on KHOL is created in-house, by your friends, neighbors, and co-workers. If you don‚Äôt personally know someone who is involved here, chances are one of your friends does.‚Äù While media consolidation is at an all time high and large conglomerates are swallowing up smaller radio stations, independent media outlets are increasingly crucial to providing balanced views and giving citizens a voice. ‚ÄúThere are fewer, more powerful hands controlling the messages we see and hear on most media channels these days,‚Äù Zimmereman said. ‚ÄúWith a truly community outlet like KHOL, we receive zero state or federal funding, and are beholden to no outside interests. You can pick up the phone and talk to a live person. You can become a DJ. You can stop by the station anytime. We really are your community radio station.‚Äù ‚Äì Jessica Sell Chambers Readers‚Äô Choice Best Spa Spa Terre, Teton Mountain Lodge (Gold) Think resort spas are just for tourists? Think again. Spa Terre in Teton Mountain Lodge takes pride in their local guests.¬† That‚Äôs why locals get 20 percent off spa treatments year-round, and facility access to guests who want to join their friends, partners, parents and visitors while they get pampered. ‚ÄúWe cater towards what we can offer the locals,‚Äù said spa director Sara Dolentz. Dolentz also boasts that Spa Terre has ‚Äúsome of the best hands in the industry.‚Äù Its staff specializes in athletic bodies. ‚ÄúOur therapists are always thinking they‚Äôre not going to see repeat guests,‚Äù Dolentz said. But they always do. ‚ÄúThey really do make a difference with people who are kind of crazy athletes.‚Äù Sound familiar? Dolentz and her staff are welcoming and accommodating. The facility is nestled in the back of Teton Mountain Lodge, and includes numerous pools and hot tubs, a Tranquility Lounge, and fitness center. Holiday season may be over, but Dolentz advises there‚Äôs never a bad time to treat yourself. ‚Äì Shannon Sollitt Readers‚Äô Choice Best Bike Shop Hoff‚Äôs Bikesmith (Silver) Hoff‚Äôs Bikesmith founder and owner Tim Hoff has worked in bike shops since he was 12 years old. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a mechanic forever,‚Äù he said. His love of cycling started as a young sprout riding BMX, a passion he continues today. Now his repertoire includes mountain biking, road cycling, fat bikes, and practically anything with two wheels. Hoff started his own shop five years ago after a solid stint working for other shops in town, including Fitzgerald‚Äôs and Hoback (all while putting together used bikes in his garage). He started selling used bikes on his own and realized there was a void in the Jackson market that needed filling. Now Hoff‚Äôs is the go-to year-round place to buy used bikes, as well as higher end bikes from Rocky Mountain Bicycles, Devinci Cycles, and KTM Bicycles. But don‚Äôt expect a too cool for school attitude at this bike shop. Hoff and crew pride themselves on their laid-back attitude. They want their shop to feel inviting to everyone, regardless of cycling ability. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter if you bring your Wal-Mart bike in or your high-end bike, we are going to fix it,‚Äù Hoff said. ‚ÄúWe love getting people out riding bikes and seeing smiles on their faces.‚Äù ‚Äì Meg Daly Readers‚Äô Choice Best Place to Buy Drugs Stone Drug (Gold) A few years ago, Stone Drug‚Äôs future was unclear at best. Locals shook their heads and heaved wistful sighs as Walgreens popped up right across the road. But not only did Jackson‚Äôs most old school pharmacy and general store survive the mega-chain‚Äôs short tenure, its authentic charm helped it come out ahead. As the mountainside sloughed down and wiped the competitor off the map, Stone Drug responded with stickers and T-shirts celebrating its victory and endurance: ‚ÄúStone Drug Wins by a Landslide!‚Äù Clever pun, of course, but it is also a win for so many Jacksonites who love the small-town ambiance of the store, and prefer it to the corporatized pharmacies inside mega grocers. While you‚Äôre there, be sure to peruse Stone Drug‚Äôs offerings of custom fishing rods, bait and tackle, hunting gear and firearms, and kitchen classics like cast iron and canning materials. Need a birthday card or a model car? Look no further. Any visit to Stone Drug is a glimpse into a simpler time in Wyoming, and a great reminder that mom and pop businesses help keep the culture and character of this community alive. ‚Äì Melissa Thomasma Readers‚Äô Choice Best Shop to Buy Bling MADE (Silver) Seven years ago MADE was just a pop-up shop squeezed between other large businesses. Over a small counter, owner John Frechette sold his fused glass belt buckles. Today Frechette runs two brick and mortar MADE shops, one in downtown Jackson and one in Teton Village, both filled with unique items from more than 160 artists, many whose work is emblematic of Jackson Hole and the New West. Frechette had never been in retail before, and never expected any of this to happen. ‚ÄúIt was all an experiment,‚Äù he said. Now, the MADE experiment is a popular destination for shoppers looking for glassware, stationery, accessories, and yes, some pretty cool bling. ‚ÄúWe want to create a unique store that you don‚Äôt see everywhere, we love to highlight local artists and those from all over the country,‚Äù he said. MADE‚Äôs jewelry is affordable and high quality, often influenced by Western design‚Äîlike the delicate antler necklaces crafted by the valley‚Äôs own Padgett Hoke‚Äîhandmade earrings, porcupine quill necklaces, and Teton Range rings. On any given day in the store, Frechette says he hears four different languages. But he says locals are the bedrock of his business. ‚ÄúJackson is really supportive of small business. There‚Äôs certain times of year where it‚Äôs hard to survive without the locals.‚Äù ‚Äì Sarah Ross Readers‚Äô Choice Best Specialty Fitness Studio Revolution Indoor Cycling (Silver) Men in Axl Rose wigs and women in blue sequined top hats sweated it out Sunday morning for Rock the Ride at Revolution Indoor Cycling. While a DJ hovered over turntables, owner Julie Guttormson told sweaty cyclists, ‚ÄúYou woke up early to party!‚Äù The annual fundraiser Rock the Ride, where foursomes ride bikes for hours to raise money for stroke and cardiac patients, is personal for Guttormson. Eleven years ago, she suffered a stroke as a healthy, fit 31-year-old. She had three blood clots in her brain and though she came out of the fiasco unscathed, Guttormson decided to make some life changes. She quit her job in the hospitality industry to pursue healthy living and fitness full-time. She completed an Iron Man just one year after suffering her stroke, became a personal trainer and then opened Revolution, where her mantra is to host ‚Äúclasses for the masses.‚Äù Though costumed revelers may not be the norm at Revolution, the energy and lightheartedness swirling through the studio that morning certainly is. ‚ÄúFitness is taken really seriously, especially in this town,‚Äù Guttormson said. ‚ÄúI want people to know they can work hard but they can also come in and rehab, or have the goal to lose weight, but it should always be fun. After all, we are on bikes and rowers going nowhere, it has to be fun.‚Äù ‚Äì Robyn Vincent Readers‚Äô Choice Best in Uniform Sheriff Jim Whalen (Gold) ‚ÄúWas the contest only involving bald guys who are members of AARP?‚Äù joked the modest sheriff. Humor and humility come with serving and protecting since 1976, when Jim Whalen began his law enforcement career in the Air Force. A few years later the sheriff became a civilian police officer in Garden Grove, California. Working in tough neighborhoods there, Whalen says he loved the work, but that he and his wife Bobbie wanted to raise a family in a place with better quality of life. So in 1989 Whalen answered an ad for the Jackson Hole Police Department. Ten years later he transferred to the sheriff‚Äôs office where he worked with then Sheriff Bob Zimmer. ‚ÄúOur philosophies essentially mirror one another‚Äôs,‚Äù Whalen explained. ‚ÄúHis mantra was ‚Äòfair, friendly and honest.‚Äô Who doesn‚Äôt want to work under that?‚Äù In 2009, Whalen was elected to fill Zimmer‚Äôs shoes. For Whalen, it‚Äôs always been about being a veritable public servant. ‚ÄúOur philosophy is entrenched in a whole lot of discretion‚Äîcan we provide what we need to provide, in terms of public safety, not by being enforcers first and foremost, but instead can we achieve compliance with prevention?‚Äù With no shortage of gratifying moments in his career, Whalen says they all surround one thing: ‚ÄúThe ability to make a positive difference in people‚Äôs lives.‚Äù He remembered being a school resource officer when a child approached him with a problem at home. ‚ÄúWe were able to help them ‚Ä¶ in law enforcement and public safety you can have an impact on someone‚Äôs life and they will always remember.‚Äù Whalen will close the chapter on a 40-year career when his term ends in less than two years.

Price won the match. : Washington Post photo by Bonnie Jo Mount WELCH, W.Va. - He exhaled heavily, ruffling the light brown hair near the bottom of his goatee. Two volunteers tightened red headgear snug around his chin. Jordan Price hadn't planned to fight. The 18-year-old and his older brother had signed up as a joke. But it was too late to back out now. Price insisted to friends that he wasn't nervous, but he sounded as though he were convincing himself. He hadn't even trained, a choice his anxious eyes indicated he'd now begun to regret at least a little. Then a shout of encouragement broke his concentration. "Tear em up, Price!" Bill Price, two years older, cried out, enthusiastically smacking the black boxing gloves now fastened to his brother's fists. The bell rang. Time to brawl. One weekend every March, almost every resident in this town crowds the tan-and-gray bleachers of the local armory to watch their friends and neighbors beat each other bloody. The boxing-brawling event - known as "The Rough N Rowdy" - draws more than 2,000 spectators a night in a 3,000-person city nestled so deep in the mountains that your cellphone won't ring. The winners leave with a trophy, a jacket and a check for $1,000 - the same take-home as a few weeks of soot-covered work in the local mines. "People love violence. You've got a bunch of people down here who just want to show they're a badass," said Breyer Morgan, 21, who has been coming to the fights since he was a little boy and has worked the bell at the event for the past three years. "They see that $1,000, and you've got people coming out of the woodwork. There is nothing else to do out here . . . and that $1,000, that's a whole lot of beer, man." McDowell County was once the largest coal-exporting county in the United States. At its peak in the 1950s, when the county had 100,000 residents, Welch was a bustling downtown that housed the state's first multilevel parking garage and was surrounded by a smattering of vibrant villages planted in "the howlers" - the valleys that lay beneath the winding highways that cut through the surrounding Appalachian Mountains. It wasn't long after its height that the mines began to close, the beginning of a half-century of economic collapse that would rob McDowell of its jobs. The prospect of prosperity went with them. Welch is now a graveyard of shuttered storefronts sitting in the shadow of empty hillsides. Four out of every 5 people moved away as the coal industry faltered. Local shops closed. Even the local Walmart closed last year. McDowell is the state's poorest county, home to one of the shortest life expectancies in the nation. The people who coal left behind here have a movie theater, a dollar store, a liquor shop and a few fast food joints. On weekends, and many weeknights, people gather around 30-packs of beer in their garages; there's no bar and the nearest watering hole is nearly an hour's drive. But every March, when the first blades of grass break through the melting snow, they still have the Rough N Rowdy. - - - The Price brothers first attended this tournament as boys, traveling the 30 minutes from their home in War - a small town on West Virginia's southern rim - to stare in wonderment as their older cousins and uncles stepped into the ring to be pummeled. Now it was Jordan's turn. Much of his family - his father, stepmother, a sister and a brother-in-law - settled in the front row, some wearing custom-designed T-shirts declaring their allegiance to "Team Price." The rules of the brawl are simple: Anyone between the ages of 18 and 35 can sign up so long as they haven't boxed professionally. After passing a physical, they enter a single-elimination tournament to compete in refereed boxing matches with three one-minute rounds. Though a few serious fighters lurk in the field, most are untrained, taking to the worn ring to see if their playground prowess will yield a few moments of glory. Most have little chance of fighting more than once. The annual bouts happen during the first weekend of the month, just after many here have received their government assistance checks. That means fighters are more likely to have the $10 buy-in and their family cheering sections have cash for the $3 hot dogs drenched in warm chili. There's no beer sold inside, so small groups dot the parking lot, tailgates gathered around coolers of Bud Light. Jordan Price threw the first punch of his bout - striking near the top of his opponent's headgear. For two minute-long rounds, Jordan landed blow after blow, each connection of glove and flesh punctuated by the crowd's elated howl. His overwhelmed opponent, another local boy fighting in his first Rough N Rowdy, ducked his head in fear, flailing his arms, unaimed, finding little but air as Jordan ducked and bobbed. With six seconds left in the second round, the match was called. A technical knockout. Jordan had won. Bill Price would have similar luck in his match, which began about 10 minutes after his brother's. It was a scrappy fight with little style or technique. After three minutes of pawing at and chasing each other around the ring, the judges concluded that the elder Price brother had landed more blows. Bill, too, would advance to fight in the second round the following night. "The Price is right!" an announcer declared from ringside, prompting a roar. After hugs from his brother, his girlfriend and his father, Bill Price took a seat with Jordan near the front row as they cheered on the others, most of whom they knew from school. "Look at him! Muhammad Ali!" Jordan wailed a few fights later, as a childhood classmate stood victorious over his defeated foe. "McDowwwell County!" Bill shouted as he leapt from his seat, both arms stretched in the air. - - - The Rough N Rowdy event was created by Christopher MacCorkle Smith, 45, a towering former boxer who, at his wife's suggestion, left selling real estate in favor of hosting and promoting amateur boxing tournaments. The venture started out rocky, with events stumbling financially in Richmond, Virginia, and Charleston, West Virginia. He turned instead to a small West Virginia coal town called Williamson. "It was the last show we were going to do," Smith said. "Either we were gong to do well here or we were going to hang it all up." The Williamson event drew dozens of eager participants and thousands of spectators. Locals cherished the chance to duke it out with their childhood friends - and rivals - in the ring. Entire families came out to support each fighter, some of whom came straight from the mines to their bouts, their faces still a smoky gray. To foster local rivalries, Smith began having fighters "call out" potential opponents. In Welch, one local fighter vowed to stand over his defeated opponents and make a chicken call. Another pledged to train for the fight by eating only Krispy Kreme doughnuts. A brawler from the next county over said he'd defeat any McDowell County fighter who wanted a piece of him and that anyone who beat him could have his girlfriend. "Your girl is ours now!" came a shout from the crowd when that fighter went down for the count in his first match. In between each round, barely clad women compete to be voted the crowd's favorite ring girl, waving cardboard round cards above their heads as they dance, with varying degrees of rhythm, to the rap song "Ms. New Booty." They, too, stand to win a cash prize of $1,000. "See, in West Virginia we don't have any pro sports teams, we don't have any semipro teams. We don't have many concerts. We don't have NASCAR," said Leon Ramsey, chairman of the State Athletic Commission, as he hung out near ringside. "West Virginians flock to these events." - - - By the second night of fighting, the mood had changed. The room was still packed, but it was no longer overflowing. The county fair atmosphere had morphed into something more akin to a serious boxing tournament. Many fighters who win their first-round matchups at the brawl drop out before the second night. Most claim it's due to injury or sickness, what Smith has termed the "chicken flu." After a successful opening night, many local fighters, especially those whose first fight was against a high school buddy who happened to be less prepared then they were, correctly conclude that they've got little chance of winning the tournament - and all they think about is the physical and emotional pain they'd probably have to endure. Jordan Price was having those thoughts. He woke up bruised and sore the morning after his first-round victory. A cough, which he said he'd been nursing for a few weeks, had evolved overnight into a full cold. But even the suggestion that he could back out of the tournament earned him hours of mocking from his father, brother, sisters and an uncle or two who stopped by the family's hilltop home. His father, Bill Price Sr., who fixes up and trades cars for a living, was one of 20 children in an extended family born and raised on this hill. Now he, his siblings, and their offspring live in the homes and trailers where they had been raised a generation before. "Prices don't die, we multiply," Jordan said with a smirk, pointing down at the nearby houses, white dots scattered across the brown mountain, where other family members live. The brothers both hope to leave McDowell, though they both acknowledge that they probably will end up spending their lives on this hill above War. Bill Jr. hasn't worked much since graduating high school last year, but he has asked around at the coal mines, where workers confident in the new presidential administration insist that this will be the year, after decades of decline, that the coal jobs come back. "I hope they're right," he mumbles sheepishly. "Things are going to get better." Jordan, set to graduate this spring, had considered trying to become a game warden or taking a $14-an-hour gig as a steel welder in North Carolina. But for now, he's staying put. His family is here, even if nothing much else is. By the time they enter the armory for the second night of fights, both Price brothers are in sweatpants and T-shirts. They've come up with a plan - rather than face other opponents, they're going to fight each other and Jordan's going to let his older brother win. "They're blood brothers!" Smith exclaimed into the microphone moments later. "They've said that they've thrown down many times before! But this time it's in the ring!" It wasn't much of a match, with Jordan largely crouching in defense as his brother landed halfhearted blows to his body. After two rounds, Jordan quit the match. And Bill, a few minutes later, dropped out of the tournament. They retreated to the crowd as fans. They shouted for "T-Rod" Terry Foster, a baby-faced local baseball star from the small town of Cucumber who lasted several rounds in the heavyweight division. And Dakota "Cody" Kennedy, a lightweight who hopped around the ring in a circle before bursting forward with each punch. Both made it deep, but most of the local fighters ended up bested by outsiders. Even the ring-girl prize went to someone from far away: Mercedes Gagnon, a bubbly blonde 21-year-old who had driven nearly 400 miles from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Gagnon donned the black winner's jacket as she posed for pictures, vowing to use her prize money to fund a vacation for her and her boyfriend. Her two-day trip to Welch was over. The Price brothers were across the room, each with an arm slung over the shoulder of a girlfriend. They exited into a dark, cold night and headed back to War. The Rough N Rowdy, its lights and excitement, would be gone until next year. ¬© Copyright 2017 Prince George Citizen 'Please support the Prince George Citizen and online news like this by purchasing a digital subscription.'

And just last week, hackers on the social media sites 4chan and Reddit threatened to leak nude pictures of celebrities, including actresses Emma Watson and Amanda Seyfried. It‚Äôs easy to forget that in every picture we see, the people in that picture are real. Sometimes, it seems like technology is evolving, but people aren‚Äôt. Cyberbullying seems to be an issue that we tend not to take seriously until it happens to us or someone we know. I knew about cases of cyberbullying from the news, but didn‚Äôt feel the direct effects of it until this year when someone started sending emails to other people on campus from a fake address in my friend‚Äôs name. While he wasn‚Äôt hurt by it, he had to deal with an anxiety-inducing situation that could have potentially jeopardized his reputation. We grew up during the rise of social media, and along with it, the spread of cyberbullying. In 2010, I had just started high school when I heard the news that Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge after his roommate allegedly outed him by setting up a secret webcam that livestreamed Clementi kissing another man. This incident brought cyberbullying into a national spotlight, and soon after, high schools and middle schools began to crack down on it. For example, in 2010, New Jersey passed the Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights to tackle harassment, intimidation and bullying (HIB) in schools. Everything from a side comment in the hallway to a tweet complaining about a teacher was grounds for an HIB case. In my experience, however, it seemed that cyberbullying easily became another one of those high school assembly topics that we didn‚Äôt take seriously. In the same way that ‚Äújust say no‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work for preventing alcohol and drugs, scare tactics and a laundry list of warnings from a school official won‚Äôt stop our habits. People still maintained the same social media habits, good or bad, even after learning about cyberbullying ‚Äî and those habits continue for some people in college, too. Many college students have Snapchats, private Twitter accounts and ‚ÄúFinstas‚Äù ‚Äî fake Instagram accounts, where we put our trust in that sense of privacy to say things we wouldn‚Äôt say on ‚Äúreal‚Äù accounts. Beyond our own personal profiles, some of us also experienced the short-lived hype of Yik Yak, an app that allowed people to post anonymously about something going on in a specific location. Of course, on college campuses, several of the posts ended up being hurtful comments about students and professors. Though it is often seen as an issue that affects high schoolers or middle schoolers, online harassment and bullying isn‚Äôt a thing of the past for our age group. A study conducted by Indiana State University found that 22 percent of college students have experienced cyberbullying. We have the power to choose how we will use the internet. Compassion is the key to avoiding harmful incidents of cyberbullying. The internet is constantly changing, but one thing will always remain consistent: by looking out for each other, we can make a difference in someone‚Äôs life and make sure the bullies don‚Äôt win. ‚ÄîGianluca D‚ÄôElia Junior journalism major ¬† Printed in the 3/22/17 issue.

Bloomberg A customer shops wines at a Costco store in Mount Prospect, Illinois, on Dec. 4, 2012. (MUST CREDIT: Tim Boyle/Bloomberg) Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. A delivery service announced Tuesday that it will start making runs to Costco to pick up orders for customers, another move toward a world in which traditional retailers compete side-by-side with online sellers to move goods directly to homes. The service, Shipt, says it is launching its Costco service in Tampa and plans to expand to 50 markets and more than 30 million households by the end of the year. Grocery delivery is the latest way retailers in a thin-margin industry compete for customers. Kroger has teamed with Uber. Wal-Mart has been conducting test runs with Uber and Lyft since June. Instacart got a huge infusion of funding earlier this month. Other delivery services include Instacart, Amazon Fresh, Google Express and FreshDirect. Shipt says it is already working with Whole Foods Market and regional grocery chains such as H-E-B and Harris Teeter. Earlier this month, another supermarket chain, Meijer, announced that because of a successful trial run in southeastern Michigan, it'll start offering Shipt delivery across six Midwestern states. Shipt members pay a $99 annual fee for unlimited grocery deliveries. Customers have a one-hour window when the merchandise is dropped off. By 2025, as much as 20 percent of grocery shopping ‚Äî or $100 billion in annual consumer sales ‚Äî could be online, according to the Food Marketing Institute, which calls the shift ‚Äúseismic.‚Äù More than 70 percent of shoppers believe they'll shop for groceries online within the next decade, if not sooner. ‚ÄúEveryone's looking to save time and get more out of less time. With Shipt in particular, people love the service and the quality of the experience,‚Äù said Shipt CEO Bill Smith. While consumers have long since become used to the idea of ordering everything from books to furniture to clothing online, perishables requiring refrigeration pose a unique logistical challenge. Shipt says it is looking to deliver mostly three to four miles from stores, not from far-flung warehouses. ‚ÄúIf you order ice cream from us, we'll deliver it directly to you,‚Äù Smith explained. Personal-care items, like toiletries, have a higher potential for online delivery than perishables like groceries, but as consumers get more comfortable buying online, they'll move into more categories, said Rupesh Parikh, Oppenheimer senior analyst for food, grocery and consumer products. ‚ÄúConsumers are demanding the convenience of home delivery,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRight now, there's no easy answer to how to be able to meet the rapidly evolving consumer demands. I don't think right now there's a magic bullet. Consumers win with all this innovation out there.‚Äù Stacy Miletti of Troy, Mich., started using Shipt at Meijer about a year ago and spends about $90 every two weeks on items like breakfast cereal, milk and laundry detergent. ‚ÄúThe big motivation for me is it saves time. I don't have to walk up and down the aisles. I can log in at 2 or 3 in the morning and do the shopping when it works for me,‚Äù the 48-year-old real estate broker said. ‚ÄúI love it, but it's not perfect. The only thing I don't like about it is you have to be home when it's delivered.‚Äù She has yet to buy fruits and vegetables online out of concerns about quality, but by buying her staples online, it still makes her in-person shopping easier. ‚ÄúI don't want to buy a bad apple. I'd rather spend the time and pick out my own produce. It saves me time. I can get my bananas, apples and pears at the fruit stand up the street, and I'm in and out in two seconds,‚Äù she said.

Trump's trade nominee Bob Lighthizer has dropped hints on other NAFTA priorities, without committing himself, including patent protections, Canadian grocery shelves and Canadian softwood lumber.¬†¬†(Zach Gibson / Bloomberg)¬†¬† By Alexander PanettaThe Canadian Press Tues., March 21, 2017 WASHINGTON‚ÄîThe Trump administration says liberalizing cross-border online shopping is one of its trade priorities with Canada, according to a document that provides new clues on the administration‚Äôs plans entering NAFTA renegotiations. The statement comes in an exchange of letters between the administration‚Äôs nominee for trade czar and the top congressional committee that handles trade, which is considering his nomination. Canada has one of the lowest allowances in the developed world for online duty-free shopping ‚Äî Canadian consumers are allowed to purchase $20 worth of goods online from Amazon, eBay or other retailers before duties kick in, compared to $800 in the U.S. Read more: Trump calls NAFTA a ‚Äòcatastrophe,‚Äô suggests negotiating ‚Äòextra F‚Äô for ‚Äòfair‚Äô Article Continued Below Canada fires off letter to U.S. lawmakers who support Buy American rule Ontario leads pushback against New York state's Buy American policy Trade nominee Bob Lighthizer was asked about that by a member of the Senate finance committee, which is one of the congressional bodies that by law must be consulted before, during, and after the U.S. holds trade negotiations. He received written questions about wine, dairy, softwood lumber and pharmaceuticals, in addition to oral questions and answers at a public hearing this month where lawmakers made it clear they want important changes in NAFTA. In his written responses, he said the duty-free level, known as ‚Äúde minimis,‚Äù would be an issue. ‚ÄúI believe that increasing Canada‚Äôs de minimis level could be a significant issue in our overall bilateral trade engagement with Canada, as well as in our engagement with Canada in multilateral trade forums,‚Äù Lighthizer wrote back, in a 124-page exchange of letters obtained by Inside U.S. Trade. ‚ÄúI will consult with Congress and domestic stakeholders to develop a strategy that seeks to address concerns with Canada‚Äôs low de minimis level.‚Äù That debate has also begun in Canada. It‚Äôs pitted online retailers against the lobby group for bricks-and-mortar stores, the Retail Council of Canada which represents 45,000 stores including some giants like Walmart, Best Buy and Lowe‚Äôs. Lighthizer dropped hints on other priorities, without committing himself. Pharma: A U.S. drug company, Eli Lilly, has just lost a major lawsuit it launched against the Canadian government and been ordered by a NAFTA tribunal to pay millions in court costs. A lawmaker urged Lighthizer to demand stronger patent protections, which have been repeatedly invalidated in Canada. He replied that intellectual property was a high priority. Wine: Asked about restricted access to Canadian grocery shelves, which has already prompted U.S. action, Lighthizer said he would address unfair barriers to U.S. exports. Dispute settlement: A lawmaker complained that the dispute settlement process in NAFTA‚Äôs Chapter 19 had been used to weaken punitive actions against the dumping of Canadian softwood lumber. Lighthizer said he would work with Congress and industry on Chapter 19. Supply management: Several lawmakers have asked about Canadian controls over dairy and poultry imports. Lighthizer promised, without getting specific, to enhance export opportunities. Before opening NAFTA talks, the Trump administration must consult with Congress for at least 90 days. The president has said he‚Äôs eager to start. Donald Trump wants to turn to an economic agenda of tax cuts and trade, after a bruising few weeks marked by scraps over health care, Russian hacking, and partisan delays to nominations like Lighthizer‚Äôs. It‚Äôs unclear whether the White House can even start the 90-day NAFTA consultation without Lighthizer in place. It‚Äôs his legal role to consult with Congress. But his nomination is being held up in a round of intra-party horse-trading that could take weeks to resolve. The finance committee chair said Tuesday he could start NAFTA now: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready to roll,‚Äù Orrin Hatch said. He added, however, that it would be easier if Lighthizer was in place: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be hard to do it without him.‚Äù Hatch is tied up with other issues. He‚Äôs among the senators considering the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, and said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where my mind is right now.‚Äù He would also have a role in health-care reform, if a controversial health bill gets approved by the House of Representatives. He‚Äôs got issues with the health bill: ‚ÄúThe whole thing gives me heartburn,‚Äù he joked. A nail-biter of a vote is coming up in the U.S. capital on Thursday, with potential consequences on the Trump agenda. It appears votes for health reform might fall short, and the president made a trip to Capitol Hill to plead his case Tuesday. Donald Trump has warned lawmakers that if health reforms fall apart, that could affect tax and trade reforms. In a closed-door speech to Republicans, he personally singled out some of the conservatives threatening to stall the health bill. Trump made a joke that some interpreted as a threat ‚Äî to launch 2018 primaries against lawmakers who block him. Some were unswayed. ‚ÄúI have a conservative district,‚Äù said Walter Jones of North Carolina. ‚ÄúMy calls (from constituents) are running 10 to 1 against this bill.‚Äù In a few weeks, lawmakers could get their chance to confirm Lighthizer with a short-term spending bill up for review. It appears destined to become an omnibus negotiation. A West Virginia Democrat hopes to advance a personal priority ‚Äî a bill involving coal miners‚Äô pensions. Lighthizer is a bargaining chit. ‚ÄúI have nothing personally (against him) whatsoever,‚Äù said Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat. ‚ÄúBottom line is ‚Äî he‚Äôs the only vehicle I have (to get a pension deal).‚Äù Read more about: Donald Trump, United States Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines¬†Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E¬†1E6.

Newslook Sears Holding said in its annual report it faces "substantial doubt" about its ability to stay in business. (Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP) 46 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORE The company that operates department store chain Sears dropped a bombshell Tuesday: it may be on the verge of going out of business. Sears Holdings, which operates both Sears and Kmart stores, said in its annual report that ongoing sales declines ‚Äúindicate substantial doubt exists related to the company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern.‚Äù The company is working to find ways to mitigate that doubt but it said it can‚Äôt be sure it will be able to raise the cash to keep going. The loss of Sears stores across the U.S. would mark the end of an era for the chain that dominated the retail industry for decades. Founded in 1886, Sears was built around its famous catalog that was so complete that entire houses could be ordered -- delivered in pieces to be built on a site. Antioch resident Ron Marcinko said it has been ‚Äúa shame‚Äù to lose several Sears stores in Middle Tennessee over the years. A furniture builder and a Sears shopper for nearly half a century, Marcinko said other stores' tools can't compare to the quality of the Craftsman brand sold at Sears. "They had the best scroll saws I have ever seen," Marcinko said while standing outside the entrance to the Sears store at Rivergate Mall in Goodlettsville, about 12 miles north of downtown Nashville. The store, one of the only remaining Sears locations in Middle Tennessee, had a "Now hiring" sign on its front entrance Wednesday morning. Out of convenience, Marcinko said he now shops at Home Depot and Harbor Freight Tools more often than Sears because he lives about 30 minutes away from the Goodlettsville store. "I've been coming to Sears as long as I've known. Now Sears is slowly shutting down and I have to buy off-brand tools. It's a shame to see the good stores close," Marcinko said.

"I hardly ever come to Sears because I shop more online or at Walmart where I can buy my groceries at the same time," said Jan Minter, a Goodlettsville resident who visited the nearby Sears store Wednesday to look at mattresses. "I always try to find the cheapest price." Hendersonville resident Kathryn Reynolds said she decided to stop by Sears Wednesday to look at clothes for her grandson after she shopped at a nearby Target store. "Honestly, I haven't been in Sears in a few years but I was out and about in the area so I thought I'd swing through," Reynolds said. Outside the Sears store at Knoxville Center mall in East Knoxville, Cecelia McCray said she‚Äôs shopped frequently at Sears over the years. "I like Sears," she said. "I just like shopping here. I like their clothing, and you know, what they offer and their hospitality and how they treat people. I like that. Sears has been around for a long time. If they leave, I hate to see that happen." Emma Smith worked at Sears 11 years ago and has since become a customer, frequenting the shop to purchase clothes and shoes. Sears, to her, was "a little fun place to work." "The employees, we could laugh and kind of cut up with some of the customers and stuff. I've worked at places where you weren't allowed to even smile." The company's downturn is "very sad," Smith said. In January, Sears said it planned to close 150 stores. In the following month, the retailer initiated a restructuring program aimed at cutting¬†$1 billion in costs annually and reducing debt by $1.5 billion helped by proceeds from the sale¬†of one of its most valuable brands, Craftsman tools to Stanley Black & Decker.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Photo: Justin Sullivan, 2017 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Target‚Äôs legion of fans often complain about how they just can‚Äôt get enough of the red-and-white retailer. Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt help you with your red-dot addiction. We can, however, key you in on savings to take advantage of the next time you‚Äôre unable to resist that bright red Target sign on your drive home from work. See how many of these 15 savings tips you can use on your next trip to Target. Know when to shop 1. Know which days to shop Save money on your trip before you enter the store by knowing which days to go in for what goods. Most Targets reserve specific days of the week to mark down certain items to clearance. Below are the best days to shop for particular items, according to red-dot fan blog, All Things Target. Monday: electronics, accessories, kids‚Äô clothing, books, baby, stationery Tuesday: domestics, women‚Äôs clothing, pets, market (food items) Wednesday: men‚Äôs clothing, health & beauty, diapers, lawn & garden, furniture Thursday: housewares, lingerie, shoes, toys, sporting goods, decor & luggage Friday: auto, cosmetics, hardware, jewelry Clearance prices can also vary by store. One store might have items in the health and beauty department at a 30% markdown, while another Target a few miles away may put the same items on sale at 50% off. If you have multiple Target stores in your area, you might save even more on the items if you call ahead or shop around for the best deal. In addition, your local Target might follow a different or altered markdown schedule, and departments are at liberty to change their markdown day to a different day of the week. 2. Shop just after the holidays Shopping after holidays at Target can mean an opportunity to purchase some items at discounts as low as 90%. All you need to do is practice just a bit of patience. Target‚Äôs unofficial holiday markdown schedule according to All Things Target goes as follows: The day after the holiday: 50% off Three days after: 75% off One week after: 90% off 3. Free samples Every now and then, Target offers free samples on its website. All you need to do is fill out a short survey, and you should receive the product at your mailing address in three to five business days. Check samples.target.com to see if the retailer has any free samples currently available. Note: When there are no free samples available, this link will take you to their main website. Keep checking. Before you walk in... 4. Sign up for a REDcard If you make multiple weekly trips to Target, you could benefit from signing up for their branded credit card called the REDcard (Check out the MagnifyMoney Target REDcard review here). REDcard customers get 5% off their bill at the register, free shipping at Target.com, and an extra 30 days to return items. Like many store-specific credit cards, you can only use the REDcard in Target stores. If you don‚Äôt want a credit card, Target‚Äôs REDcard has a debit card version as well. You‚Äôll link the debit card to a bank account, and each purchase made with the Target debit card is automatically deducted from your account. You‚Äôll still get the 5% off of your bill at the register, and the debit option is also great for those who don‚Äôt want to add to a pile of existing credit card debt. If you do go with the credit option, you should be aware that with an interest rate at 23.4%, the 5% savings you‚Äôd get at the register is inconsequential if you carry a month-to-month balance. The card also comes with high fees for late and missed payments. For example, you‚Äôll be charged $35 if you forget to make a payment on time. The REDcard‚Äôs 5% off applies to every transaction and every item in the store. The only exception is with prescriptions that are picked up at the pharmacy. You‚Äôll get a 5% off coupon for every five prescription purchases with your REDcard, which you can use with your next big in-store purchase for a combined 10% off at the register. Both REDcard options can only be used at Target stores. 5. Find discounted gift cards online You can save even more cash at Target before you get to the store when you buy someone‚Äôs old Target gift card at a discount online. Look for discounted gift cards on websites like Gift Card Granny, which aggregates discounted gift card offers from around the web for you. As of this writing, the site has a $25 gift card for Target available for 6.5% off. ¬† If you snap up a deal like that and then shop with a REDcard, you‚Äôll get a total 11.5% off your purchase. Other great online gift card resellers are Raise, WhizWallet, and Cardpool. The sites resell both e-cards and physical gift cards so you may have to wait a few days to get yours in the mail. After you get the card or code, you‚Äôre all set to use the discounted gift card. 6. Download both of Target‚Äôs apps Target has not one but two apps where red-dot fans can find additional savings. As expected, one is the official Target app, where you‚Äôll be able to find coupons exclusive to the app. Just tap ‚Äúmobile coupons‚Äù in the Target app to sign up for alerts. The retailer‚Äôs other app, Cartwheel, is a social savings app that allows you to select coupons by category or by scanning items in store, then use your smartphone to apply the discounts at checkout. In addition to Target‚Äôs two apps, consider using other apps like RetailMeNot, which aggregates online and in-store retailer coupons. 7. Follow @Target on social media Like, follow, and subscribe to @Target on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, and other online social channels to hear first on social media about sales updates. The retailer might even post about deals exclusive to its social media audience. If your local store has its own accounts, follow them for promotional deals tailored to that location. 8. Try cash back apps and websites Sign up for cash back apps to save money each time you go to target. Sign up for an app like Ibotta, Ebates, BeFrugal, or Checkout 51. To make the most of savings on Ibotta and Checkout 51, you just need to take a picture of your receipt to get cash back credited to your account on the application. When shopping online, you can use the Ebates extension to see cheaper options or coupons for products, or check first on BeFrugal for coupons you can use on Target‚Äôs website. ¬† At the store‚Ä¶ 9. Save with coupons Target has come up with so many ways for consumers to get coupons, you‚Äôd have to try pretty hard to miss them. 5 places to find Target coupons: 1. The weekly ad,Target‚Äôs landing page for updates on coupons and deals 2. Manufacturer's websites, where you can find coupons like these on Procter & Gamble products 3. The Target app 4. The Cartwheel app 5. Text COUPONS to 827438 (Target) ¬† You can stack coupons from multiple sources to get even greater savings. 10. Take advantage of price match You can save money on purchases up to two weeks later by knowing the rules for Target‚Äôs generous price match policy. Check first to see if the retailer has marked down anything you bought within the past two weeks. If Target has lowered the price, you‚Äôll get the difference refunded to you. Target also matches prices to that of online retailers like Amazon and competitors like Walmart, so if you find a cheaper price on an item with a competitor, ask the cashier about price match. If you‚Äôre tech-savvy, you can download a browser extension to track certain items that you‚Äôve purchased. Services like Slickdeals will notify you when the price for something you‚Äôre tracking changes. 11. Look for clearance racks This may seem obvious, but you should keep an eye out for deals while you‚Äôre shopping since many in-store deals aren‚Äôt advertised. Look out for little red-and-white sale and clearance signs to find deals that evaded Target‚Äôs apps and website. Take care to double-check the end caps of racks facing the store‚Äôs walls, as you could find easy-to-miss clearance deals. 12. Shop store brands You‚Äôll find even more savings when you forgo name-brand products for one of Target‚Äôs many store brands. Store brands like up & up, Market Pantry, and Archer Farm will generally run you less than comparable name-branded products. For example, a pack of 86 up & up size 3 Overnight Diapers will currently run you about $14.99, while a comparable Huggies product with 92 diapers nearly doubles your cost at $24.29. 13. Don‚Äôt miss the free gift cards! There is free money all over Target waiting for you to come across it. Some purchases will earn you a free gift card if you can find them. Check the weekly ad for items you may already need that happen to come with a free gift card offer. You can use it right away, or wait until your next purchase to apply the card. Target offers free gift cards with purchases in-store and online, as pictured below. ¬† At checkout... 14. BYOB (bring your own bag) Bring your own reusable bag to earn a 5-cent discount at checkout. It doesn‚Äôt sound like much right away, but the cents add up to dollars quickly, especially if you make multiple Target trips a week. For example, someone who makes three Target runs a week who walks out with two bags on average will save $15.60 annually if they bring their own reusable bags. 15. Check your coupons at checkout Target gives you even more reason to return for another visit. Take a look at your receipt after checkout for coupons that‚Äôll help plan savings for your next trip.

If someone is asking you to, you're being scammed. (CBC) Related Stories Catfishing, romantic scams on the rise, Edmonton detective warns Latest phone scam draws attention of Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre Latest phone scam draws attention of Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre Edmonton police are warning people about a tax-payment scam after a woman was duped into purchasing $37,000 worth of iTunes gift cards ‚Äî and lost all the money. "She'd just had a baby, so the baby was brand new, she was sleep-deprived and she had shared with me that she was suffering from postpartum depression," Det. Linda Herczeg¬†said Wednesday. Those circumstances combined with some elaborate tricks fooled the woman into thinking she was dealing with the Canada Revenue Agency. Det. Linda Herczeg says one Edmonton woman lost $37,000 to the scam. (CBC) "She received a phone call from someone claiming to be the CRA," said Herczeg. "They do telephone number spoofing so the number that was displayed to her actually showed the CRA number." Police say victims are typically directed to purchase gift cards ‚Äî often in large denominations and quantities ‚Äî at specific retailers that don't ask too many questions. Once the cards are activated, victims are asked to remove the security stickers and provide the identification numbers to the fraudsters, who then sell the numbers on the black market. The new mother in Edmonton purchased the iTunes cards as requested and then was told she needed to buy more. When she hesitated the fraudster began threatening her with potential consequences. 'She spent $37,000 in purchasing¬†iTunes' "He says, 'We're coming to arrest to you, now you have no one to take care of your children; we're going to take away your passport, you won't be able to leave the country; you won't get any benefits from the federal government,' " said Herczeg. "So she just felt very pressured and very emotionally stressed to go and take care of that and so she spent $37,000 in purchasing iTunes and she lost all of the money." The new mom was one of 187 Edmonton victims of CRA fraud in 2016. In total, they were duped out of more than $625,000. The individual losses ranged from $100 to $72,000. The victims ranged in age from 20 to 90. Herczeg said the thieves request¬†iTunes¬†cards because they're in demand and easy to resell. ‚ÄòThey were physically on the phone with, they were led to believe, Revenue Canada‚Äô0:53 Can't pay your tax bill with pop songs Canada Revenue Agency spokesperson TJ¬†Madigan¬†believes the¬†fraudsters¬†rely on catching people off-guard. "As Canadian as it may be, you cannot pay your tax bill with Justin Bieber songs," said Madigan. "But people get frustrated and scared and panicked when they get a phone call from Canada Revenue Agency asking for something. "As the Edmonton police explained, sometimes in that panic and being held on the phone for long periods of time, they do things that wouldn't make sense. Revenue Canada spokesperson TJ Madigan said fraudsters can talk victims into doing things that don't make sense. "It's always about being suspicious. If something seems out of place or fishy, hang up the phone, don't respond to the email, and call CRA directly."¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬† Retailers are also stepping up to prevent this type of fraud. Walmart has posted notices and trained staff to keep an eye out. Jennifer Forster, manager of the Windermere Walmart¬†store, said cashiers are trained to get a manager involved for any purchase of iTunes cards that exceeds $100. Staff there have already saved one couple from getting scammed, she said. "They were physically on the phone with, they were led to believe, Revenue Canada," said Forster of two customers who were trying to purchase $1,500 worth of iTunes cards. 'Get a manager involved' "When we asked to look at their cell phone it clearly actually had the Revenue Canada phone number because we googled Revenue Canada to double check it." The couple was discouraged from making the purchase and advised to take the matter to police. They did.¬† "[They] came back about a week later and thanked us," said Forster. Edmonton police and the Canada Revenue Agency advise anyone to call them directly for advice and guidance if they receive a suspicious call or text from someone claiming to be be with the CRA.

Maggi, a former state governor and a billionaire soy farmer, told a Senate Committee that his main concern was that China and Hong Kong have not yet taken a definitive stance on their bans of meat from Brazil, the world's biggest producer of beef and poultry. China and Hong Kong are the top two importers of Brazilian meats, last year buying nearly one-third of the $14 billion worth of meat that Latin America's largest economy exported. Maggi, speaking before a joint Senate committee, told lawmakers that if the government does not take quick action to tamp down the scandal, it could take Brazil up to five years to recoup the global market share it would lose. The minister added that before the police investigation was made public last week, Brazil typically exported $64 million worth of meat a day, but that figure dropped to $74,000 on Tuesday. The two-year investigation dubbed "Weak Flesh" has lodged accusations against more than 100 people, mostly health inspectors, for taking bribes and allowing the sale of rancid products, falsifying export documents, or failing to inspect meatpacking plants at all. The probe by Brazil's federal police comes amid a sprawling three-year investigation into billions of dollars in political kickbacks paid by construction giants to win contracts with state-controlled firms, especially oil company Petrobras. Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland and South Africa have all announced partial or all-out bans on Brazilian meat imports this week, following measures similar to those taken by China, the European Union, South Korea and Chile. The industry took a domestic hit Wednesday, as Walmart Brasil said in a statement that it had suspended the sale of all products from 21 processing plants named so far by police as under investigation. The Brazilian government had already banned exports from those 21 plants - but allowed them to continue production and sales to the domestic market, a move that has angered some watchdog groups. "Is the health of a Brazilian consumer not worth the same as that of a foreigner?" said Sonia Amaro, head of institutional relations at the Proteste consumer protection group. "Brazilian industry has a history of this, of offering inferior or dangerous products to domestic customers while sending better goods overseas." Maggi and other government leaders have aggressively tried to assure the public that this is not the case and that the meat supply does not pose any health risks. They say the problems uncovered by police are isolated events, that those involved will be fired, and that the investigation focuses mostly on corruption, not tainted products. But Rafael Alcadipani, a professor of organizational studies at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo, refutes the government's argument. He said too little is yet known about the findings of the ongoing investigation, and that corruption is possibly a worse finding than batches of rotten meat. If inspectors were paid to not do their jobs, it is impossible to know if putrid products entered the market, Alcadipani said. "Because Brazil has the world's biggest meatpackers, those businesses have huge influence with the government, so the government will go to all lengths to protect them," he said. "Officials are clearly trying to focus attention away from the central question, which is whether or not there is systematic corruption in the sanitary system. Only allowing the investigation to play out will answer that."

Gwyneth Paltrow claims her daily vitamin regiment of D3, fish oil and probiotics can fight fatigue, wrinkles and even a slowing metabolism. Last week, Khloe Kardashian - who has been touting vitamins for years - posted a photo on Instagram of her staggering schedule, which includes 23 pills a day. And Lo Bosworth, of Laguna Beach fame, claimed on her blog that a hit of B12 and vitamin D can even fight depression.¬† They are just a few of the many stars who give the booming vitamin market a boost by promoting the products to their millions of followers. Unsurprisingly, however, doctors say that not only are these celebrity claims unfounded, but that you're wasting both your time and your money by popping the pills. According to medical experts, the majority of us don't need to be taking supplements, and that taking too many is what can actually cause health problems. Celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow (left) and Lo Bosworth (right) claim taking vitamins has helped them fight fatigue, wrinkles and even depression. But doctors say the claims are unfounded and that you're wasting both your time and your money by popping the pills Last week, Khloe Kardashian posted a photo on Instagram showing her weekly supplement schedule. Experts say, however, that taking too many can actually cause health problems There's a prevailing idea that we should all be taking multivitamins, which has blossomed into a $30 billion a year industry. But experts and recent research on the subject say otherwise. A 2013 large-scale scientific review found 'no clear evidence' that vitamins helped to increase a person's life span or decrease their odds of developing heart disease or cancer. Vitamin and supplement claims do not have to be approved by the FDA, so many of the supposed benefits are not evaluated through peer research.

A seven-year study involving 543 mothers and their children found they made no difference to language or developmental skills. Researchers, from the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute in Adelaide, looked at supplements containing an omega 3 fatty acid found in fish including salmon known as docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA. The pills showed no difference between children's general intelligence, language skills, nor overall level of IQ. In fact, mothers who had taken the supplements were more likely to report their children were badly behaved than those given the dummy pills. The study concluded that there was 'strong evidence for the lack of benefit of pre-natal DHA supplementation on IQ at seven years and cognition at 18 months and four years, despite higher numbers of pre-term children in the control group. And the US Preventive Services Task Force, a panel of primary care experts who give out medical advice based on scientific evidence, chose to not recommend the use of multivitamins to prevent heart disease or cancer in people who aren't deficient in certain nutrients. It's not just a lack of effectiveness. Many vitamins may not even contain the ingredients listed. A 2015 study conducted by the New York State Attorney General's office looked at supplements sold at Target, Walmart, Walgreens and GNC. They found that four out of five of those tested didn't contain the herbs they claimed but rather had filler ingredients, such as pine, citrus, beans, rice, wheat, asparagus and wild carrots.¬† However, there are a few groups for whom vitamin supplements are useful. One such group is pregnant women. The CDC has pointed to evidence that shows taking folic acid before getting pregnant and during early pregnancy lowers the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects - birth defects of the brain, spine or spinal cord. It is recommend that pregnant women take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily.¬†¬†¬† Registered nurse Rebekah Huppert, from the Mayo Clinic, told SELF: 'Most of the vitamins and minerals we need are in food, and a healthy diet will likely get you close, but while you're breastfeeding, taking a multivitamin can be your insurance policy.' Although most of the vitamins a baby needs are in breast milk, breastfeeding can deplete a mother of her own vitamin storage. And there are people that suffer from vitamin deficiencies such as B12 - if they follow a plant-based diet - and vitamin D if not enough sun exposure is gotten throughout the day.¬†¬† Gwyneth Paltrow's company, Goop, recently released a new line of vitmains. Gwyneth says she always 'feels exhausted' no matter how much sleep she has and 'Why Am I So Effing Tired' promises to help. 'Balls in the Air' is a daily multivitamin Women who need a boost before, during and after pregnancy are advised to take 'The Mother Load', while hormone expert Dr Sara Gottfried developed 'High School Genes' for peri- and post-menopausal women EXPLAINED: GWYN'S NEW VITAMIN LINE¬† Gwyneth Paltrow, has launched Goop Wellness - and along with it four gluten-free supplements to help women trying to juggle it all. They're $90 (¬£72) for a month, and promise to boost your flagging energy to maintain a Gwyneth-approved lifestyle. The tablets come in four bottles: 'Why Am I So Effing Tired?', 'The Mother Load', 'Balls in the Air' and 'High School Genes'. Balls in the Air is a multivitamin to promote overall health and wellbeing, while The Mother Load is the 'Rolls Royce' of pre- and post-natal vitamins. High School Genes, created by hormone expert Dr Sara Gottfried, is focused on post-menopausal women who feel their metabolism is slowing down.¬† ¬† Doctors say that vitamin D can be obtained by eating tuna, salmon, nuts, and seeds, but some may need to take a supplement to get the right amount.¬† And although supplements will help for some that have vitamin deficiency, experts advise against taking a supplement based on self-diagnosis. 'Take a supplement only if you need it,' Sonya Angelone, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told SELF.¬† 'The dose depends on several factors, including the levels in your own body.' Fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E and K, build up in your body for long periods of time so you want to make sure you actually need them before you take supplements. Water-soluble vitamins, such as B vitamins and vitamin C, can be flushed out of your body with water so your body can't store excess amounts of them.¬† But taking too much vitamin C, for example, and not drinking enough water can cause diarrhea and nausea.¬† If you feel you have a vitamin deficiency, speak to a doctor first.¬† From there, a blood test can be ordered and your doctor may recommend eating more of particular foods or taking a supplement.¬† 'Always speak with your health care provider,' Dr Sara Wider, a women's health expert, told SELF. 'It's a safer way to go.'

The Wednesday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories National by The Canadian Press Posted Mar 22, 2017 2:54 pm MDT Last Updated Mar 22, 2017 at 3:40 pm MDT Highlights from the news file for Wednesday, March 22 ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî CANADA OFFERS BRITAIN HELP AFTER TERROR ATTACK: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Wednesday‚Äôs apparent terrorist incident outside the British Parliament is a ‚Äúcowardly attack‚Äù on democracy around the world. And he says Canada stands ready to help Britain in any way it can after the attack, which left at least four dead in London. Police say the dead include the attacker and a police officer, and some 20 more have been wounded in the incident, which occurred on the grounds of the Parliament Buildings and the nearby Westminster Bridge. Parliament remains in a lock-down while police continue to search the area to ensure there are no other attackers. In Canada‚Äôs House of Commons, Trudeau said the scene unfolding in London is ‚Äúall too familiar‚Äù to MPs who were on Parliament Hill in October 2014 when a gun-toting Michael Zehaf-Bibeau stormed into Centre Block after killing a soldier standing on guard at the nearby National War Memorial. Zehaf-Bibeau was killed outside the Library of Parliament in a shoot-out with police and parliamentary security officers. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said he called British Home Secretary Amber Rudd to offer Canada‚Äôs assistance in the aftermath of Wednesday‚Äôs carnage. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî EI PREMIUMS, SIN TAXES, TAX CHEAT CRACKDOWN TO FINANCE LIBERAL VISION: The federal government is increasing employment insurance premiums and going after drinkers, smokers and tax cheats to help finance a 2017 budget long on vision ‚Äî high-tech growth, job retraining, lowering barriers for working mothers ‚Äî but lean on actual spending. The budget details how $11.2 billion will be meted out to cities and provinces for affordable housing over 10 years, and an ‚Äúinnovation and skills plan‚Äù for six sectors: advanced manufacturing, agri-food, clean technology, digital industries, health/bio-sciences and clean resources. It also details $7 billion in spending over 10 years for Canadian families, including 40,000 new subsidized daycare spaces across Canada by 2019, extended parental leave and allowing expectant mothers to claim maternity benefits 12 weeks before their due date. The federal deficit, meanwhile, is projected to be smaller than expected: $25.5 billion for 2017-18, not including a $3 billion contingency fund, before declining to $15.8 billion in 2021-22. EI premiums will climb five cents to $1.68 for every $100 of insurable earnings, as will taxes on alcohol and tobacco products, with annual increases tied to the rate of inflation. A crackdown on tax evaders and avoiders is also planned. The 71-year-old Canada Savings Bonds program, long synonymous with painless, low-interest savings for risk-averse adults and gift-giving grandparents, is also being phased out. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHIEF LINKED TO PUTIN INTERESTS: U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics, The Associated Press has learned. The White House on Wednesday acknowledged the AP‚Äôs revelations had ‚Äústarted to catch a lot of buzz‚Äù but brushed them aside. Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government. Manafort pitched the plans to Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10-million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work. Manafort confirmed again Wednesday in a statement that he had worked for Deripaska but denied his work had been pro-Russian in nature. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî GUILTY PLEAS IN NOVA SCOTIA INTIMATE-PHOTO CASE: Six male youths in Nova Scotia have pleaded guilty to sharing intimate images of high school girls without their consent, concluding one of Canada‚Äôs largest prosecutions involving a relatively untested but high-profile law. The six were charged in July 2016 after police in Bridgewater, N.S., concluded a year-long investigation by alleging the teens ‚Äî all local high school students ‚Äî had distributed intimate images of at least 20 girls. At the time, four of the accused were 15 years old, and the other two were 18. The six were also charged with possessing and distributing child pornography, but a Crown prosecutor confirmed those charges will be dismissed when they face sentencing July 31. The case is one of the first in Canada involving legislation introduced in late 2013 after the death of Nova Scotia teen Rehtaeh Parsons, which captured national attention. The 17-year-old attempted suicide and was taken off life support after a digital photo ‚Äî of what her family says was a sexual assault ‚Äî was circulated among students at her school in Cole Harbour, N.S. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî MAN WANTED IN BOY‚ÄôS DEATH FLED 2,000 KM BEFORE ARREST: An Ontario man accused of killing his seven-year-old stepson and badly injuring a banker with whom he‚Äôd once had professional dealings managed to flee 2,000 kilometres over four days before being arrested, police said Wednesday. Niagara regional police Chief Jeff McGuire said the nation-wide manhunt for 43-year-old Justin Kuijer, which began in St. Catharines, Ont., came to a peaceful end in the parking lot of a Walmart in Kenora, Ont., at about 5 p.m. on Tuesday. A member of the public who had heard of the search for Kuijer recognized the van in which the man allegedly fled. Six provincial police officers responded to the tip and arrested the former roofing company owner without incident, McGuire said. Kuijer had been the subject of a Canada-wide warrant on a charge of second-degree murder in the death of his stepson, Nathan Dumas, but McGuire said the man will in fact be charged with first-degree murder in the boy‚Äôs death, as well as attempted murder in the attack on the RBC employee. McGuire credited steady media exposure and public vigilance for Kuijer‚Äôs arrest, saying the end of the manhunt can help a devastated community begin to heal. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî ENBRIDGE CUTTING 1,000 JOBS AFTER SPECTRA DEAL: The cuts have come swiftly at energy giant Enbridge Inc., which is laying off about 1,000 staff less than a month after closing its blockbuster takeover of Houston-based Spectra Energy Corp. Calgary-based Enbridge says the layoffs, amounting to about six per cent of the 17,000 employees of the combined company, stem from the merger that closed Feb. 27. ‚ÄúAfter a careful evaluation, Enbridge has taken the difficult but necessary step to address the overlap in the combined company‚Äôs organizational structure,‚Äù said spokesman Todd Nogier in a statement. He did not provide details about where the cuts are happening, but says they‚Äôre being done across the merged company. Nogier also confirmed that the company will be moving out of the Enbridge offices in downtown Houston and consolidating operations in the state at Spectra‚Äôs offices there by the end of the year. Under the terms of the merger, Calgary became the headquarters of the combined company, while the Houston office became the company‚Äôs gas pipelines business unit centre. When the C$37-billion, all-stock takeover was announced last September, the companies said they expected to achieve C$540 million in annual cost savings from synergies. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî LAWYERS SEEK FEDERAL HELP FOR FAMILIES THAT HELPED SNOWDEN: Canadian lawyers representing three families who sheltered whistleblower Edward Snowden in Hong Kong urged Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen on Wednesday to expedite their applications as refugees to this country. ‚ÄúOur clients are specifically targeted by Hong Kong‚Äôs immigration authorities, who are actively trying to get our clients out of its territory and back to their home countries where they will be apprehended, tortured, or killed,‚Äù lawyer Marc-Andre Seguin told a Montreal news conference. The lawyers want Ottawa to accept the families on an exceptional basis while their applications are processed. Snowden fled to Hong Kong to avoid prosecution over the leak of classified material about U.S. government surveillance programs. A congressional inquiry into the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor concluded the leaks compromised national security. The families in question have been publicly quoted as saying they hid Snowden in their apartments for a few weeks in 2013 before he went to Russia. The lawyers told a news conference March 9 of their intention to bring ‚ÄúSnowden‚Äôs guardian angels‚Äù to Canada. Since then, according to Seguin, support for the seven people has increased but Hong Kong officials have also attempted to expedite their deportations to their home countries of Sri Lanka and the Philippines. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî SENTATE ETHICS BODY MULLS MEREDITH SANCTIONS: The Senate‚Äôs ethics committee is meeting behind closed doors to determine what sanctions can or should be imposed on disgraced Sen. Don Meredith for engaging in a sexual relationship with a teenage girl. Options under consideration range from a reprimand to outright expulsion from the upper house. Meredith has rejected near-universal calls from fellow senators for his resignation since Senate ethics officer Lyse Ricard issued a damning report earlier this month which concluded Meredith had violated the chamber‚Äôs code of ethics. Ricard said the 52-year-old, married, Pentecostal pastor, improperly used his Senate position to lure the vulnerable teen, identified only as Ms. M. According to Ricard‚Äôs report, Meredith‚Äôs relationship with Ms. M began when she was 16. It progressed from flirtatious online chats to fondling and sexually explicit live videos and, eventually, to sexual intercourse ‚Äî once shortly before the teen turned 18 and twice after. Meredith has acknowledged the relationship but maintains he had intercourse with the teen only after she turned 18. The Senate, which must sign off on whatever sanction the ethics committee recommends, has never expelled a senator before and it‚Äôs not clear whether it has the constitutional authority to do so when the senator in question has not been convicted of any crime. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî APPEAL COURT SAYS VICE MEDIA MUST TURN OVER FILES TO RCMP: A Vice Media reporter must give the RCMP the background materials he used for stories on an accused terrorist, Ontario‚Äôs top court affirmed Wednesday. In a case that pitted freedom of the press against the ability of police and prosecutors to do their work, the Ontario Court of Appeal said it found no errors in an earlier ruling that went against the Canadian media outlet. Reporter Ben Makuch, backed by various media and civil rights groups, had fought the RCMP‚Äôs production order, arguing police use of journalists to further criminal investigations would make sources reluctant to come forward. However, the Appeal Court said Superior Court Justice lan MacDonnell had been alive to a potential ‚Äúchilling effect‚Äù in this case. Those factors include an absence of a request by Makuch‚Äôs source for confidentiality ‚Äî in fact the source was ‚Äúanxious to tell the world‚Äù about his beliefs and conduct, the Appeal Court said. Vice expressed disappointment with the Appeal Court decision but said it might try to continue its legal battle by seeking leave to take the case to the Supreme Court of Canada. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî ALBERTA WANTS CHANGES TO ‚ÄòWOMEN‚ÄôS STUDIES‚Äô COURSE: Alberta‚Äôs education minister wants a school division to immediately revamp a course entitled ‚ÄúWomen Studies‚Äù that teaches tween girls about hairstyles, flattering clothing, dinner party etiquette and polite conversation. David Eggen says the NDP government has made gender equity a top priority and understands why concerns are being raised about the course offered by the Pembina Hills School Division to girls in Grades 6 to 9. ‚ÄúAlberta Education and representatives from my office are in contact with the school board and will be seeking changes to this course immediately,‚Äù he said in an emailed statement. David Garbutt, acting superintendent for the division in central Alberta, was in a board meeting Wednesday and unavailable for an interview. In a statement, he said the course is a ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù and the board is listening to the constructive criticism it has received. ‚ÄúWe will be reviewing the curriculum to ensure that it doesn‚Äôt reinforce stereotypes in the process of encouraging positive self-image and self-esteem,‚Äù he said.

Hard times for Sears as retailer notes doubt about future Associated Press | 0¬†comments NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Sears, a back-to-school shopping destination for generations of kids and the place newlyweds went to choose appliances, has said that after years of losing money that there is "substantial doubt" it will be able to keep its doors open. It's a dramatic acknowledgment from the chain that owns Sears and Kmart stores, which has long held fast to its stance that a turnaround is possible, even as many of its shoppers have moved on to Wal-Mart, Target or Amazon. Sears has survived of late mainly with millions in loans funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert, but with sales fading it is burning through cash. Sears Holdings Corp. said late Tuesday it lost more than $2 billion last year, and its historical operating results indicated doubt about the future of the company that started in the 1880s as a mail-order catalog business. At a largely empty Sears store in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the available parking far outstripped the number of cars in the lot, 85-year-old Jack Walsh and his 82-year-old wife, Mary Ann, said they have shopped at Sears their entire lives, buying items from curtains and window treatments to tires and tools. "I bought my tools from Sears and I've still got them," Jack Walsh said. The company known for DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliances has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says pension agreements may prevent the sale of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. "It's a sad story. This is the place that created the first direct to consumer retail, the first modern department store. It stood like the Colossus over the American retail landscape," said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. "But it's been underinvested and bled dry." Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 13 percent Wednesday. Sears tried to soothe investors' fears, saying in a post on its site that it remains focused on "executing our transformation plan" and that news reports miss the full disclosure that it's highlighting actions to reduce risks. It also said that the comments made in the filing were in line with "regulatory standards." Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. He pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging its best-known brands and its vast holdings of land, and more recently planned to entice customers with its loyalty program. The company, which employs 140,000 people, announced in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations, and unveiled yet another restructuring plan in February aimed at cutting costs and reconfiguring debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it's selling. Sears, like many department stores, has been thwarted by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon. A plethora of new online players have also revolutionized the market. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major refresh as rivals like Wal-Mart and Target invest heavily to revitalize stores. Sales at established Sears and Kmart locations dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. Industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and believe the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, says Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. "They're past the tipping point," Perkins said. "This is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be." For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, Perkins does not see much of a future. For decades, Sears was king of the American shopping landscape. Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s storied catalog featured items from bicycles to sewing machines to houses, and could generate excitement throughout a household when it arrived. The company began opening retail locations in 1925 and expanded swiftly in suburban malls from the 1950s to 1970s. "When I first got married at 19 or 20, we bought our first set of kettles from Sears," said Darla Klemmensen, who was shopping at the St. Paul store on Wednesday. "We still have some of those." Klemmensen says Sears has been part of her life since she was a child watching her grandmother order stockings and garters, and she remembers flipping through Sears catalogs as thick as her forearm, full of appliances, clothing and kitchen wares. But the onset of discounters like Wal-Mart created challenges for Sears that have only grown. Sears faced even more competition from online sellers and appliance retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot. Its stores became its albatross, many of them looking shabby and outdated. The company, based northwest of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, lost $607 million in the most recent quarter and revenue fell. "They've been delusional about their ability to turn around the business," said Perkins. Johnson, though, believes one avenue for Sears could be returning to its roots as a direct-to-consumer company, only using the internet versus the old catalog. He believes the Sears name still stands for something for the 40-plus customer. "It has a lot of good memories," he said. "It stands for being dependable and reliable." ___ Weikel reported from St. Paul, Minnesota. AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report from Newark, New Jersey.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) (Photo: GREGORY BULL, AP) 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Sears Holdings CEO Edward Lampert, the billionaire financier once billed as the next Warren Buffett, has seen an estimated half a billion dollars in wealth wiped out from his personal stock holdings in the troubled retailer over the past two years or so. Lampert‚Äôs quest to turn around Sears has proved costly, indeed. Since he started building his stake in Sears in early 2010, the number of shares he owns has nearly doubled to 31.3 million, data from S&P Global Market Intelligence show. Lampert is Sears' second-largest shareholder, behind hedge fund Fairholme Capital Management. But if you include Sears' holdings of Lampert's hedge fund, he has the biggest exposure of all investors. Sears' (SHLD) stock price, which is down about 95% from its 2007 peak, got crushed Wednesday after the company said it is struggling to stay in business and has ‚Äúsubstantial doubt‚Äù as to whether it can continue as a viable retailer. The stock closed down¬†more than 12% at¬†$7.98 per share. The one-day selloff alone cost Lampert an estimated $35¬†million.¬† USA TODAY estimates that the value of Lampert‚Äôs Sears stock has declined by roughly $510¬†million¬†since the end of 2014. That estimate was derived by calculating the value of his Sear‚Äôs holdings at the end of each year since 2010, using Sears closing stock price for the year and the number of shares Lampert owned at the time, culled from S&P Global Market Intelligence data. Using that methodology, the highest year-end value of Lampert‚Äôs Sears holdings was $760.3 million. After today's drop his stake is down to roughly $249.8¬†million. Lampert, who became CEO of Sears in early 2013, has been unable to turn Sears' fortunes around. Sales, due in part to stiff competition from retailers like Walmart as well as online retailers like Amazon.com, have been poor. What's killing Sears and Kmart? Forbes estimates Lampert's net worth at $1.92 billion. His plan when he combined Sears with Kmart in 2005 was to boost the cash flows of the once-strong retail outlets and use the money to fund other investments. Lampert‚Äôs hedge fund, ESL Investments, has also suffered a financial hit from Sears' fall. At the end of February, the hedge fund owned 20.5 million Sears shares, which is less than half the stake it owned at the end of 2010, when it held 48.2 million shares. The value of the hedge fund‚Äôs current stake in Sears fell by $23 million to an estimated $163.6¬†million Wednesday. 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2mR4sAs

Not just closing another round of stores, but the entire chain going the way of Sports Authority and Radio Shack. Tuesday, the retail giant warned it‚Äôs investors officially it cannot promise it will stay in business. Sears Holdings, the financial backbone of the company, says it now owes nearly $4.2 billion dollars in debt, up from $3 billion last year. Sears Holdings said there is now ‚Äúserious doubt‚Äù they will be able to survive. The chain says it‚Äôs ability to sell it‚Äôs assets to raise money is limited, because it has to try to uphold and maintain pension plans. In January, the famous Craftsman tool line was sold to Stanley Black and Decker. Now, SEARS is looking to sell off it‚Äôs legendary Kenmore Appliance and Diehard Battery and Auto Parts lines. The chain announced plans to close another 150 stores in January of this year, 109 of them old K-Mart stores which were bought when they went under in 2002. It was a bankruptcy merger. Only one of the closing stores, however, is in Washington. It‚Äôs the Lynnwood SEARS near Seattle. The K-Mart, Sports Authority, Office Max¬† local Tri-City stores performed well or decently, but were swept away by the tidal wave of national bankruptcy. The same goes for the Columbia Center location of SEARS. It‚Äôs continued to draw business, BUT if the entire chain goes under, it will too. SEARS began to show signs of erosion 20 years or more ago due to competition from Walmart, Home Depot, and other growing retailers. Then came competition from online shopping, such as Amazon. It‚Äôs the same issue being faced by other ‚Äòbrick and mortar‚Äô stores such as Macy‚Äôs and JC Penney. How long does it have left? Some experts say SEARS will need to raise $1.5 billion to get through 2017, Forbes Magazine in February said bond traders are predicting they will go out of business in two years, or less. ¬† ¬† Filed Under: chain | closing | Sears | stores Category: Business | National News | News | Tri-Cities News Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More Leave a comment Send to a friend!

Photographer: Anthony Souffle/Chicago Tribune/MCT The corporate owner of Sears and Kmart said on Tuesday that there was ‚Äúsubstantial doubt‚Äù that it could continue operating, as brick-and-mortar stores continue to face challenges in an e-commerce world. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the corporate owner, Sears Holdings Corp., cited its efforts to cut costs, sell property, tap new funding sources and make other moves to stanch the flow of red ink. Still, it reported a $2.2 billion loss for last year and said it had to use money from its investments and financing activities to fund operations. ‚ÄúOur historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern,‚Äù it said in the filing, its annual report. The disclosure is a setback for the company and for Edward S. Lampert, the hedge fund manager who engineered the combination of the two legends of American retail 13 years ago. Lampert has shut down stores, reshuffled the company‚Äôs organization and pushed to have a greater online presence. Still, Sears Holdings has lost more than $5 billion over the last three years as sales have declined. On Wednesday morning, in the first day of trading after the disclosure, shares in the company tumbled more than 13 percent. Sears, through its catalog, has been a fixture of U.S. homes for more than a century. Kmart, which has its own lengthy history beginning as a five-and-dime store in Detroit, became a major national presence in the 1960s as a big-box department store, with Blue Light Special discounts geared toward penny-wise middle-class Americans. But both brands were squeezed by Wal-Mart Stores, with its heavy discounts, and Target, which sold affordable goods but with more design and flair. Both Sears and Kmart also suffered because they were in older shopping malls and neighborhoods. Online retailing, with the rise of the likes of Amazon, presented a more recent challenge. To cope, Sears Holdings has been shrinking. This month, it sold its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & Decker in a deal valued at more than $775 million. Still, its long-term debt as of January totaled nearly $4.2 billion, almost double from the same period the previous year, according to the filing. In February, Sears Holdings said it had started a restructuring program that it said would save $1 billion annually. The program is focused on streamlining its back-office corporate and support functions, tweaking its product offerings and supply chain and looking for ways to reshuffle its real estate portfolio. As of January, Sears Holdings said, it had 1,430 Sears and Kmart stores in the United States. By contrast, a decade ago it had about 3,800 stores in the United States and Canada.

Business Retail Sears warns of 'substantial doubt' it can survive, but exec touts repair effort 130 years of Sears: Timeline of iconic Chicago company A video timeline of Sears from 1886 through 2017. (Jemal R. Brinson / Chicago Tribune) A video timeline of Sears from 1886 through 2017. (Jemal R. Brinson / Chicago Tribune) James F. PeltzContact Reporter An executive at Sears and Kmart‚Äôs parent company said the distressed retailer remains ‚Äúa viable business‚Äù even though it had warned regulators ‚Äúsubstantial doubt exists‚Äù that it could keep its doors open amid mounting losses. Sears Holdings Corp. raised concerns about its ability to continue operations in its annual 10-K filing with the federal government. The company also reported a $2.2-billion loss on sales of $22.1 billion for its fiscal year that ended Jan. 28, double its $1.1-billion loss the previous year. But the company‚Äôs chief financial officer, Jason Hollar, wrote in a blog post Wednesday on Sears Holdings‚Äô website that while ‚Äúregulatory standards‚Äù required management to issue the ‚Äúsubstantial doubt‚Äù statement the day before based on its dreary results last year, the company remained focused on turning itself around. There are ‚Äúactions we are taking to mitigate those risks,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe are a viable business that can meet its financial and other obligations for the foreseeable future,‚Äù Hollar wrote. Even so, Sears Holdings‚Äô regulatory filing rattled investors. The company‚Äôs stock plunged 12.3% to close at $7.98 on Wednesday. ‚ÄúInvestors continue to be highly skeptical of Sears‚Äô long-term viability,‚Äù independent retail analyst Bert Ely said. Fashion brands ‚Äî including several L.A. retailers ‚Äî are dying off as shoppers' habits change Shan Li American Apparel bit the dust. So did Nasty Gal. BCBG Max Azria filed for bankruptcy, along with teen retailer Wet Seal. The fashion industry has long been a fickle beast, with trends rising and dying sometimes in the space of weeks.

The fashion industry has long been a fickle beast, with trends rising and dying sometimes in the space of weeks. But changing consumer habits ‚Äî including the emergence of e-commerce... (Shan Li) Sears Holdings, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, is led by Chief Executive Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager who combined Sears and Kmart in 2005. Both chains are iconic American brick-and-mortar retailers. Long before the Internet and online shopping, Sears‚Äô product catalog was a staple in U.S. homes for decades, and Sears‚Äô Kenmore appliances and Craftsman tools were household names. But Sears Holdings has struggled with heavy losses for years as Sears and Kmart failed to keep pace with competition from the likes of discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. and with changing consumer-spending habits that shifted toward e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc. Sears Holdings has taken several steps to hang on, including shrinking the company to save costs. It now has 1,430 stores nationwide, including 151 in California, down 44% from the 2,548 it operated five years ago. Sears Holdings operates about 23 Sears and 13 Kmart stores in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The company employs 140,000 people. Earlier this year, Sears Holdings also sold the Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc. for $900 million, and it has been reformulating its debts to gain liquidity. Nasty Gal, once a fashion world darling, is now bankrupt. What went wrong? Shan Li By 2012, Nasty Gal was a fashion world success¬†story, growing from an Ebay store to nearly $100 million in sales in just six years. Founder and Chief Executive Sophia Amoruso¬†was Nasty Gal‚Äôs best model, embodying the Los Angeles company‚Äôs edgy-and-feminine aesthetic¬†and attracting flurries of laudatory...

Founder and Chief Executive Sophia Amoruso¬†was Nasty Gal‚Äôs best model, embodying the Los Angeles company‚Äôs edgy-and-feminine aesthetic¬†and attracting flurries of laudatory... (Shan Li) The question is whether Sears and Kmart will be able to draw more shoppers. In its latest fiscal year, Sears‚Äô comparable store sales ‚Äî those of stores open at least a year ‚Äî fell 9.3% from the previous year and Kmart‚Äôs comparable sales fell 5.3%. Some analysts said the ‚Äúsubstantial doubt‚Äù disclosure by Sears Holdings, which has lost $7.3 billion in the last five years, might indicate that the retailer cannot be saved. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre past the tipping point,‚Äù Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics Inc., told the Associated Press. ‚ÄúThis is a symbolic acknowledgment of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.‚Äù Ely said he expects to see Sears Holdings ‚Äúdownsizing its retailing footprint while focusing on offering merchandise to its customers that it can sell at a profit in the face of competition from the Internet and other brick-and-mortar retailers.‚Äù Sears traces its roots to 1886 when Richard Sears began selling watches in North Redwood, Minn. The following year he moved to Chicago and hired a watchmaker named Alvah Roebuck, creating what would become Sears, Roebuck & Co. Over the next century Sears expanded its department-store base, published its catalog and launched the Kenmore and Craftsman brands. The company also established Allstate Insurance and later expanded its financial services to include such firms as the Dean Witter Reynolds brokerage, but all the financial units were later divested.

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) NEW YORK (AP) - Sears, once the monolith of American retail, says that there is ‚Äúsubstantial doubt‚Äù that it will be able to keep its doors open. Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 14 percent Wednesday. Sears has been a member of the retail dead pool for years, but until this week the company had not openly acknowledged its tenuous existence, said Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC. Sears has long maintained that by balancing the sale of key assets while at the same time enticing customers with loyalty programs, it would eventually turn the corner. Yet industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and concluded that the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, Mr. Perkins says, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre past the tipping point,‚Äù Perkins said. ‚ÄúThis is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.‚Äù For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, which Sears also owns, Perkins does not see much of a future. Millions of dollars have been funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert to keep Sears afloat but with sales fading, it is burning through cash. Mr. Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. According to a regulatory filing late Tuesday, Sears Holdings Corp. lost more than $2 billion last year. Adjusted for one-time charges, its loss was $887 million. Sears has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says its pension agreements may prevent the spin-off of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. ‚ÄúOur historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern,‚Äù Sears said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sears, which employs 140,000 people, announced a major restructuring plan in February with hopes of cutting costs by $1 billion through the sale of more stores, jobs cuts and brand asset sales. And it‚Äôs reconfiguring its debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it‚Äôs selling. Sales at Sears and Kmart locations that have been open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer‚Äôs health, dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. The company plans to use a big portion of the $900 million it got for Craftsman to shore up its pension plan. It will put $250 million in cash and some income from annual payments toward the plan as part of a deal with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., a federal agency that protects private pension plans. The company said in its regulatory filing, however, that its agreement with the agency might stand in the way of more asset sales that would buy it more time. Lampert has long pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging best-known brands like Kenmore and DieHard, as well as its vast holdings of land. Those aspirations have been scrambled by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon for years. There are also new and dynamic players that have also revolutionized the market, namely Amazon.com. Department stores have been among the hardest hit by those seismic changers as Americans spend money on their homes or on dinners out, rather than on clothing. When they do buy clothes, they‚Äôre not spending much, hitting up places like T.J. Maxx for fat discounts. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major redo. Longtime rivals like Wal-Mart and Target are spending heavily to revitalize stores and they‚Äôre intensely focused on a new consumer that goes online before stepping into a store. Meanwhile, J.C Penney has been hitting Sears hard by bringing back major appliances to its stores. Penney, Macy‚Äôs and others have been shuttering locations as well. But real estate research firm Green Street Advisors says about 800 stores, or 20 percent of all U.S. mall anchor space, would need to close to match the inflation-adjusted sales productivity of 2006. Sears in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations. In its most recent quarter, Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, just northwest of Chicago, lost $607 million. Revenue declined to $6.05 billion from $7.3 billion during the same period the year before. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of losses. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,‚Äù said Perkins. In trading Wednesday afternoon, Sears shares dropped $1.29, or 14.2 percent, to $7.81.

When they do buy clothes, they‚Äôre not spending much, hitting up places like T.J. Maxx for fat discounts. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major redo. Longtime rivals like Wal-Mart and Target are spending heavily to revitalize stores and they‚Äôre intensely focused on a new consumer that goes online before stepping into a store.¬† Meanwhile, J.C Penney has been hitting Sears hard by bringing back major appliances to its stores. Penney, Macy‚Äôs and others have been shuttering locations as well. But real estate research firm Green Street Advisors says about 800 stores, or 20 percent of all U.S. mall anchor space, would need to close to match the inflation-adjusted sales productivity of 2006. Sears in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations. In its most recent quarter, Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, just northwest of Chicago, lost $607 million. Revenue declined to $6.05 billion from $7.3 billion during the same period the year before. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of losses. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,‚Äù said Perkins.

Last week, it was raw cheese, before that it was frozen vegetables and now it‚Äôs edamame we need to worry about, as the soybean product has been recalled in 33 states due to potential listeria concerns.

More: Whole Foods Latest Place to Recall Cheese Listeria was discovered during random testing of whole-pod edamame products, and now, as a safety precaution, all 8-ounce packages of Advanced Fresh Concepts edamame with sell-by dates of Jan. 3 to March 17 are being removed from shelves at major chains such as Wegmans, Kroger and Walmart (among other stores). If you were an unlucky buyer of the potentially bad product, you can return it for a full refund.

Florida Georgia Iowa Idaho Illinois Indiana Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Massachusetts Maine Michigan Minnesota Mississippi North Carolina New Hampshire New Mexico New York Ohio Oregon Pennsylvania South Carolina Tennessee Texas Virginia Washington Wyoming As of now, no listeria-infected edamame illnesses have been reported, but when it comes to scary bacteria, it's always much smarter to safe than sorry.

Sears said that there is ‚Äúsubstantial doubt‚Äù that it will be able to remain in business. The company, which runs Kmart and its namesake stores, has struggled for years with weak sales. Gene J. Puskar ‚Äî The Associated Press file By Anne D‚ÄôInnocenzio and Michelle Chapman, The Associated Press Posted: 03/22/17, 8:52 AM EDT | Updated: 13 hrs ago # Comments NEW YORK >> Sears, once the monolith of American retail, says that there is ‚Äúsubstantial doubt‚Äù that it will be able to keep its doors open. Company shares, which hit an all-time low last month, tumbled more than 12 percent Wednesday. Sears has been a member of the retail dead pool for years, but until this week the company had not openly acknowledged its tenuous existence, said Ken Perkins, who heads the research firm Retail Metrics LLC. Sears has long maintained that by balancing the sale of key assets while at the same time enticing customers with loyalty programs, it would eventually turn the corner. Advertisement Yet industry analysts have placed the staggering sums of money that Sears is losing beside the limited number of assets it has left to sell, and concluded that the storied retailer may have reached the point of no return. The company has lost $10.4 billion since 2011, the last year that it made a profit. Excluding charges that can be listed as one-time events, the loss is $4.57 billion, Perkins says, but how the losses are stacked no longer seem to matter. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre past the tipping point,‚Äù Perkins said. ‚ÄúThis is a symbolic acknowledgement of the end of Sears of what we know it to be.‚Äù For Sears to survive, Perkins believes it would need to do so as a company running maybe 200 stores. It now operates 1,430, a figure that has been vastly reduced in recent years. As for Kmart, which Sears also owns, Perkins does not see much of a future. Millions of dollars have been funneled through the hedge fund of Chairman and CEO Edward Lampert to keep Sears afloat but with sales fading, it is burning through cash. Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy According to a regulatory filing late Tuesday, Sears Holdings Corp. lost more than $2 billion last year. Adjusted for one-time charges, its loss was $887 million. Sears has been selling assets, most recently its Craftsman tool brand. But it says its pension agreements may prevent the spin-off of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. ‚ÄúOur historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern,‚Äù Sears said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sears, which employs 140,000 people, announced a major restructuring plan in February with hopes of cutting costs by $1 billion through the sale of more stores, jobs cuts and brand asset sales. And it‚Äôs reconfiguring its debts to give itself more breathing room. But it has to get more people through the doors or shopping online for what it‚Äôs selling. Sales at Sears and Kmart locations that have been open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer‚Äôs health, dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016. The company plans to use a big portion of the $900 million it got for Craftsman to shore up its pension plan. It will put $250 million in cash and some income from annual payments toward the plan as part of a deal with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., a federal agency that protects private pension plans. The company said in its regulatory filing, however, that its agreement with the agency might stand in the way of more asset sales that would buy it more time. Lampert has long pledged to return Sears to greatness, leveraging best-known brands like Kenmore and DieHard, as well as its vast holdings of land. Those aspirations have been scrambled by a new consumer that has ripped up the decades-old playbook that the industry has relied upon for years. There are also new and dynamic players that have also revolutionized the market, namely Amazon.com. Department stores have been among the hardest hit by those seismic changers as Americans spend money on their homes or on dinners out, rather than on clothing. When they do buy clothes, they‚Äôre not spending much, hitting up places like T.J. Maxx for fat discounts. Sears has upped its presence online, but is having a hard time disguising its age. Its stores are in need of a major redo. Longtime rivals like Wal-Mart and Target are spending heavily to revitalize stores and they‚Äôre intensely focused on a new consumer that goes online before stepping into a store. Meanwhile, J.C Penney has been hitting Sears hard by bringing back major appliances to its stores. Penney, Macy‚Äôs and others have been shuttering locations as well. But real estate research firm Green Street Advisors says about 800 stores, or 20 percent of all U.S. mall anchor space, would need to close to match the inflation-adjusted sales productivity of 2006. Sears in January said it would close 108 additional Kmart and 42 more Sears locations. In its most recent quarter, Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, just northwest of Chicago, lost $607 million. Revenue declined to $6.05 billion from $7.3 billion during the same period the year before. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of losses. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been delusional about their ability to turn around the business,‚Äù said Perkins. Michelle Chapman reported from Newark, New Jersey.

Outside Amazon‚Äôs first ‚ÄúAmazon Go‚Äù retail store in the Denny Triangle neighborhood of Seattle. (GeekWire Photo / Nat Levy) Amazon Go, the online retailer‚Äôs ‚ÄúJust Walk Out‚Äù convenience store in downtown Seattle, is still in private beta mode three and a half months after its unveiling ‚Äì and some reports suggest the concept is facing¬†tougher sledding than anticipated. The checkout-free store is just one of several brick-and-mortar experiments under way at Amazon. A different drive-up concept, AmazonFresh Pickup, seems nearly ready for its debut in Seattle‚Äôs Ballard neighborhood and SoDo district. Unlike AmazonFresh Pickup, Amazon Go envisions a system where customers can walk in off the street, pick up anything they want, and ‚Äújust walk out.‚Äù Their purchases would be tracked using high-tech object¬†recognition and inventory management systems, matched up with the customers‚Äô mobile app and automatically charged to their Amazon account. Since December, Amazon has been testing the system at an 1,800-square-foot store on Seventh Avenue. Only employees are allowed to enter the store, but when the store was unveiled, Amazon promised that it‚Äôd be open to the public in early 2017. Amazon has issued no updates since December, and¬†this week, Bloomberg News reported that Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúJust Walk Out‚Äù just isn‚Äôt ready for prime time yet: ‚ÄúThe technology has been crashing in tests when the store gets too crowded and requires human quality control, people watching video images to make sure customers are charged for the right things, according to a person familiar with the plan.‚Äù We‚Äôve reached out to Amazon for comment on the Bloomberg report, and we‚Äôll update this item with anything we hear back. Industry analysts told GeekWire they‚Äôre not surprised to hear the beta test is turning up challenges. ‚ÄúThe Amazon Go model relies on quite a few recent innovations ‚Äî computer vision, sensor fusion, deep learning, and presumably others; transforming those into a specific system will naturally require a lot of time and testing,‚Äù Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, said in an email. Caporaso said he expected Amazon to encounter more snags as the experiment proceeds from well-controlled transactions to less typical scenarios. ‚ÄúWhen you add the X factor of occasionally random behavior from a large number of people acting in their own interests, it‚Äôs probably not surprising that the results aren‚Äôt necessarily measuring up to expectations,‚Äù he said. Don Stuart, a managing partner at Cadent Consulting Group, agrees that perfecting the Amazon Go platform is a huge challenge, even for America‚Äôs biggest online retailer. ‚ÄúI know they want to get it right before they take it out of beta,‚Äù Stuart told GeekWire. ‚ÄúTechnological failure could be a huge hiccup. ‚Ä¶ There are all sorts of things that have the potential to crash the system.‚Äù For example, Amazon‚Äôs store monitoring system would have to notice¬†when customers are¬†carrying loose fruit and vegetables of various sizes, or when they‚Äôre lugging deformable items such as bags of rice. The image recognition system would also have to keep track of¬†customers‚Äô identities even when they take off their jacket, pull down a cap or put on a muffler. (Stuart and other experts delve into the challenges in a report published today by Convenience Store News.) Meanwhile, other retailers are pursuing different approaches to reduce the frustration of waiting in a checkout line.¬†Walmart is experimenting with¬†an updated version of its scan-and-go app,¬†and Kroger has been phasing in a sensor system aimed at anticipating how many checkers will be needed in its grocery stores at a given time. Kroger says its system can¬†cut the average wait time from four minutes to less than 30 seconds. (The Seattle area‚Äôs QFC grocery chain is a Kroger subsidiary.) ‚ÄúThey pretty much know how many people are in their check lines, by lane, by minute and by store,‚Äù Stuart said. Last week, Barron‚Äôs Next quoted an analyst at Morgan Stanley as saying that consumers care more about price and convenience than about the wait in the checkout line, and that Amazon Go‚Äôs perceived advantage was already fading. ‚ÄúWhile frictionless shopping differentiates ‚ÄòGo,‚Äô it is unclear if this is enough to make the concept viable long-term,‚Äù analyst Vincent Sinisi¬†was quoted as saying. Despite the cautionary signs, Caporaso said he expected Amazon to persist. ‚ÄúUnless and until Amazon Go proves utterly incapable of being implemented, Amazon will no doubt continue to work on refining the system, and other retailers will need ‚Äî and want ‚Äî to develop similar innovations,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf it can be achieved in some form or fashion, a ‚ÄòJust Walk Out‚Äô retail environment would offer consumers a better shopping experience, with greater speed and convenience, which is sure to build loyalty, which is every retailer‚Äôs goal.‚Äù Love space and science?¬†Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire‚Äôs aerospace and science editor.
