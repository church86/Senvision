So have employees of utilities and telecom firms. Finally, after years of stagnant pay, more American workers are receiving meaningful raises a trend driven home by the government's October jobs report. Average hourly pay surged 10 cents an hour last month to an average of $25.92, the government reported Friday. That's 2.8 percent higher than it was a year ago, the sharpest 12-month increase since 2009. The job market appears much healthier now, a sign that the plodding seven-year recovery is now providing some critical relief for workers. ___ Wal-Mart sets environmental plan as people seek green items NEW YORK Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices. The world's largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 percent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart's goals, announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. ___ S&P 500 index marks its longest losing streak in 36 years NEW YORK The slow, steady retreat of the stock market ahead of the 2016 election continued Friday, with the market falling for a ninth straight day. Wall Street is now in its longest period of decline in more than three decades. Investors continue to focus on the U.S. presidential election, which has become too close for comfort for some investors and has put the market on the defensive. The last time the S&P 500 fell for nine straight days is December 1980, nearly 36 years ago. Ronald Reagan wasn't even president yet. ___ US trade deficit in September at lowest level in 19 months WASHINGTON The U.S. trade deficit fell in September to the lowest level in 19 months as demand for U.S.-made airplanes and other exports increased while imports slipped. The politically sensitive deficit with China declined. The deficit narrowed to $36.4 billion in September, down 9.9 percent from August, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the lowest imbalance since February 2015. The latest report offers American manufacturers an encouraging sign that the problems caused by overseas weakness and a rising dollar were beginning to wane. ___ Samsung, after phone recall, recalls 3M washing machines Nearly 3 million Samsung washing machines are being recalled in the U.S. following multiple injuries including a broken jaw due to "excessive vibration." Samsung is the South Korean company that last month was forced to recall millions of its of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after batteries inside began to overheat and catch fire. Safety officials cited 733 reports of malfunctioning, top-loading washing machines and nine injuries, including the broken jaw and an injured shoulder. The recall Friday affects 34 models of washing machines manufactured between 2011 and this year. ___ Buffett's firm's 3Q profit drops 24 pct on investments value OMAHA, Neb. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported a 24 percent drop in third-quarter profit on Friday because last year's results were helped by a huge paper gain on the value of its Kraft Heinz Food Co. stake. The conglomerate billionaire Warren Buffett leads posted solid results at most of the more than 90 companies it owns as it reported net income of $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's down from $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per A share, a year ago when it recorded a $4.4 billion after-tax gain after Kraft and Heinz merged. ___ Icahn takes an even larger stake in Herbalife NEW YORK Billionaire Carl Icahn is extending a years-long proxy fight with co-billionaire Bill Ackman, upping his stake in Herbalife yet again. The two have been battling over the legitimacy of the supplements and weight loss company since 2012, when Ackman called Herbalife a pyramid scheme and revealed a massive bet against it. A regulatory filing this week shows that Icahn upped the stakes again, pushing his ownership from 20.8 percent, up to 23.1 percent. He's the California company's biggest stakeholder. At $54.70 per share, Icahn put another $100 million plus into Herbalife on Thursday. ___ EU Commission holds up DuPont-Dow merger review WASHINGTON The EU Commission reviewing the proposed merger of agriculture and chemicals companies DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical has put its work on hold as it waits for more information from the companies. The commission in August had expressed concern it could harm competition in the crop protection, seeds and petrochemicals sectors. DuPont and Dow agreed to merge in December in an all-stock deal then valued at about $62 billion. Shareholders for DuPont and Dow approved the merger in July. A Dow spokesperson said the Midland, Michigan company expects the merger to be completed in the first quarter of 2017, pending regulatory approvals. ___ UK's May seeks to keep Brexit plan going despite setback LONDON British Prime Minister Theresa May sought Friday to reassure European Union leaders that her timetable for Britain to leave the EU remains intact despite a court ruling requiring British lawmakers to have more of a say in the process. She telephoned Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU's top official, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to say her plan is still to start the process to remove Britain from the EU by the end of March. Officials say she will also call French President Francois Hollande and European Council President Donald Tusk. In Berlin, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said the court ruling should not interfere with the government's Brexit timetable. ___ Egypt devalues, floats its currency, meeting key IMF demand CAIRO Egypt on Thursday took the unprecedented step of floating its currency and later hiked fuel prices, meeting key demands by the International Monetary Fund under a $12 billion loan agreement to overhaul the ailing economy of the most populous Arab state. The floatation, accompanied by a 48 percent devaluation of the Egyptian pound, is the boldest economic measure taken by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi since his election in 2014. El-Sissi has often asserted that tough times lie ahead as the country struggles with an array of economic woes, from double-digit inflation to unemployment and an acute foreign currency shortage. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.39 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,888.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3.48 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,085.18. The Nasdaq composite lost 12.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,046.37. Benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 59 cents to $44.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 77 cents to $45.58 a barrel in London. Heating oil fell 3 cents to $1.43 a gallon, wholesale gasoline fell 4.5 cents to $1.38 a gallon and natural gas futures fell less than 1 cent to $2.767 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Zachary McClimans, 22, of Sharon, said he had reported the issue to management at the Hermitage store last week but 'no decision had been made' regarding the other employee, police said in a criminal complaint on Friday. McClimans decided one 'solution' to prevent his co-worker, identified as Jayson Hall, from harming him was shooting him, according to court documents. Scroll down for video  Walmart shooting suspect Zachary McClimans, 22, (left and right) said he opened fire on his co-worker because the employee was offended he was changing genders to female and had threatened him, police said McClimans shot his coworker, identified as Jayson Hall, with his grandfather's .380-caliber pistol inside the store in Hermitage, Pennsylvania on Thursday at about 10.30pm. People stand outside the store following the shooting So McClimans took his grandfather's .380-caliber pistol, drove to the store and shot Hall inside at about 10.30pm on Thursday, police said. McClimans, who had left during his shift earlier in the day before returning to the store later that night, had originally planned to shoot the Hall outside the store. However, 'he felt so strongly about shooting Hall that he could not wait, at which time he tracked down Hall inside the store,' according to the complaint. Hall - who was found in a back stockroom - was shot four times, including twice in the back, according to authorities. Chaotic scenes followed inside the store as frantic customers and Walmart employees were seen fleeing, WKBN reported. When officers arrived, witnesses told police the shooter was still at the store in the parking lot. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Number of gay characters on network TV hits record high -...

Share this article Share Chaotic scenes ensued following the shooting as frantic customers and Walmart employees were seen fleeing from the store Hall - who was found in a back stockroom - was shot four times, including twice in the back, according to authorities. He was taken to a local hospital where he is listed in stable condition Officers then approached the vehicle where McClimans was sitting inside, who had a gun with him that was taken into evidence. He surrendered to police and was arrested at the scene, according to the station.  Hall was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, where he is listed in stable condition. He is expected to recover, Hermitage police said. While McClimans told police he is switching genders, it was not known if he has begun identifying as female. Police checked the box marked 'male' on the criminal complaint and did not list any feminine aliases for McClimans. The Walmart store in Hermitage, about 70 miles north of Pittsburgh, closed overnight Thursday following the shooting and reopened on Friday morning. Store employees would not comment, but Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson confirmed in an email that one worker was injured and said one worker was fired. 'Our thoughts are with the associate who was injured. The other associate involved has been terminated,' Crowson said.  'We're continuing to gather all of the facts and work closely with law enforcement.' Following the shooting, officers at the scene located him inside a vehicle in the parking lot. He surrendered and was taken into custody McClimans has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, theft and carrying a firearm without a license Walmart said police would have to answer any questions about McCliman's allegation of harassment at the store. The victim named in the criminal complaint is not charged with a crime and could not immediately be reached to respond to McClimans' accusations against him. Police did not return calls seeking additional information about Hall or other aspects of the shooting. McClimans has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, theft and carrying a firearm without a license, WTAE reported. An attorney for him was not listed in court documents. Phone calls to several of his relatives went unanswered, except for one man who refused to give his name and declined to comment.

JOE RAEDLE , GETTY IMAGES By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices. The world’s largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 percent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart’s goals, being announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. Wal-Mart has extended its effort since then into its supply chain, where the company’s size – more than 10,000 stores globally – gives it outsized influence on the overall industry. The retailer is under pressure from consumers, especially millennials, who want environmentally friendly items. Wal-Mart is looking at technology that will let shoppers scan food to learn its origins and other information, beyond just tagging products with “green labels.” Kathleen McLaughlin, a Wal-Mart senior vice president, said she couldn’t estimate how much the programs will save or cost. While they have an impact on society, they overall also make good business sense, she said. Some areas of focus: SUSTAINABILITY The company will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and expand its use of clean and renewable sources to reduce emissions in its operations. Wal-Mart says it will be the first retailer to have an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in partnership with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. The Science Based Targets initiative is a partnership with World Wildlife Fund, World Resources Institute and others. Wal-Mart says it hopes to add zero waste to landfills in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S. by 2025. It plans to refine how it buys food so less of it goes unsold, and any that does is converted to pet food or fertilizers or diverted to charities. PRODUCTS The company wants its private-brand packaging to be 100 percent recyclable. It also plans to double sales of locally grown produce by 2025. It’s also working with suppliers and its private-label products to eliminate certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors and get rid of other food additives where possible. WORKERS Wal-Mart plans to work with industry groups and others to ensure that workers globally in sectors like seafood, produce, clothing and electronics are not forced to pay fees to land jobs and are not taken advantage of by recruiting agents. It plans to train suppliers to monitor whether workers are being exploited. Wal-Mart was among the companies to which an Associated Press probe last year traced seafood that came through a fishing industry that used slave labor. The seafood was also linked to supermarkets and pet suppliers such as Kroger, Whole Foods and Petco. Diane Regas, executive director at the Environmental Defense Fund, says Wal-Mart deserves credit for more than meeting its sustainability commitment. “I think that surprises people,” Regas said, but added, “There is a huge amount more to be done.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Clippers starters give bench a break, crush Nets to improve to 10-1 O.C. coin dealer jailed, but victims of his nearly $18 million scam may not get their mon Updated: Six people escape after Garden Grove Buddhist temple erupts in flames Update: Missing teen last seen at Disney hotel found safe Why Anaheim officials want to shut down this online charter school User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

So have employees of utilities and telecom firms. Finally, after years of stagnant pay, more American workers are receiving meaningful raises — a trend driven home by the government's October jobs report. Average hourly pay surged 10 cents an hour last month to an average of $25.92, the government reported Friday. That's 2.8 per cent higher than it was a year ago, the sharpest 12-month increase since 2009. The job market appears much healthier now, a sign that the plodding seven-year recovery is now providing some critical relief for workers. ___ Wal-Mart sets environmental plan as people seek green items NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices. The world's largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 per cent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 per cent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart's goals, announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. ___ S&P 500 index marks its longest losing streak in 36 years NEW YORK (AP) — The slow, steady retreat of the stock market ahead of the 2016 election continued Friday, with the market falling for a ninth straight day. Wall Street is now in its longest period of decline in more than three decades. Investors continue to focus on the U.S. presidential election, which has become too close for comfort for some investors and has put the market on the defensive. The last time the S&P 500 fell for nine straight days is December 1980, nearly 36 years ago. Ronald Reagan wasn't even president yet. ___ US trade deficit in September at lowest level in 19 months WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit fell in September to the lowest level in 19 months as demand for U.S.-made airplanes and other exports increased while imports slipped. The politically sensitive deficit with China declined. The deficit narrowed to $36.4 billion in September, down 9.9 per cent from August, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the lowest imbalance since February 2015. The latest report offers American manufacturers an encouraging sign that the problems caused by overseas weakness and a rising dollar were beginning to wane. ___ Samsung, after phone recall, recalls 3M washing machines Nearly 3 million Samsung washing machines are being recalled in the U.S. following multiple injuries — including a broken jaw — due to "excessive vibration." Samsung is the South Korean company that last month was forced to recall millions of its of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after batteries inside began to overheat and catch fire. Safety officials cited 733 reports of malfunctioning, top-loading washing machines and nine injuries, including the broken jaw and an injured shoulder. The recall Friday affects 34 models of washing machines manufactured between 2011 and this year. ___ Buffett's firm's 3Q profit drops 24 pct on investments value OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported a 24 per cent drop in third-quarter profit on Friday because last year's results were helped by a huge paper gain on the value of its Kraft Heinz Food Co. stake. The conglomerate billionaire Warren Buffett leads posted solid results at most of the more than 90 companies it owns as it reported net income of $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's down from $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per A share, a year ago when it recorded a $4.4 billion after-tax gain after Kraft and Heinz merged. ___ Icahn takes an even larger stake in Herbalife NEW YORK (AP) — Billionaire Carl Icahn is extending a years-long proxy fight with co-billionaire Bill Ackman, upping his stake in Herbalife yet again. The two have been battling over the legitimacy of the supplements and weight loss company since 2012, when Ackman called Herbalife a pyramid scheme and revealed a massive bet against it. A regulatory filing this week shows that Icahn upped the stakes again, pushing his ownership from 20.8 per cent, up to 23.1 per cent. He's the California company's biggest stakeholder. At $54.70 per share, Icahn put another $100 million plus into Herbalife on Thursday. ___ EU Commission holds up DuPont-Dow merger review WASHINGTON (AP) — The EU Commission reviewing the proposed merger of agriculture and chemicals companies DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical has put its work on hold as it waits for more information from the companies. The commission in August had expressed concern it could harm competition in the crop protection, seeds and petrochemicals sectors. DuPont and Dow agreed to merge in December in an all-stock deal then valued at about $62 billion. Shareholders for DuPont and Dow approved the merger in July. A Dow spokesperson said the Midland, Michigan company expects the merger to be completed in the first quarter of 2017, pending regulatory approvals. ___ UK's May seeks to keep Brexit plan going despite setback LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Theresa May sought Friday to reassure European Union leaders that her timetable for Britain to leave the EU remains intact despite a court ruling requiring British lawmakers to have more of a say in the process. She telephoned Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU's top official, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to say her plan is still to start the process to remove Britain from the EU by the end of March. Officials say she will also call French President Francois Hollande and European Council President Donald Tusk. In Berlin, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said the court ruling should not interfere with the government's Brexit timetable. ___ Egypt devalues, floats its currency, meeting key IMF demand CAIRO (AP) — Egypt on Thursday took the unprecedented step of floating its currency and later hiked fuel prices, meeting key demands by the International Monetary Fund under a $12 billion loan agreement to overhaul the ailing economy of the most populous Arab state. The floatation, accompanied by a 48 per cent devaluation of the Egyptian pound, is the boldest economic measure taken by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi since his election in 2014. El-Sissi has often asserted that tough times lie ahead as the country struggles with an array of economic woes, from double-digit inflation to unemployment and an acute foreign currency shortage. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.39 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 17,888.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3.48 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,085.18. The Nasdaq composite lost 12.04 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,046.37. Benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 59 cents to $44.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 77 cents to $45.58 a barrel in London. Heating oil fell 3 cents to $1.43 a gallon, wholesale gasoline fell 4.5 cents to $1.38 a gallon and natural gas futures fell less than 1 cent to $2.767 per 1,000 cubic feet.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business The Associated Press The Canadian Press         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   Sovrn Gives Publishers More Control with Outstream Video H.I.G.

Items needed include towels, trash bags, pillows and toilet paper.

The Mansfield man went inside the store and returned after purchasing 10 pillows for individuals who use the shelter. "I heard it on the radio this morning and you hear so much good stuff about Harmony House and I'm always thinking go do it, and I finally decided to get off my butt and do something," he said. The fundraiser benefits Harmony House at 124 W. Third St. Mansfield, which last year served  578 people. Last year Harmony House provided 14,416 nights of lodging,  43,272 meals and provided comprehensive case management to 578 people. In addition to shelter, the agency provides food and clothing, case management, workshops, after-school and summer programs for children, rent and deposit assistance, household items and furniture as available and six units of permanent housing. Friday, the 24-hour fundraiser kicked off right on time as volunteers set up their cardboard boxes for the sleep-out, in its 22nd year. Vicki Kane, executive director of Harmony House, said anything someone needs to survive is appreciated — pillows, blankets, personal care items and food. "We really appreciate it," she said. "Our clients have nothing. We supply everything, but we need the community's support because homelessness is a community problem," Kane said. Wayne and Pat Bell, who have volunteered at Harmony House for about 25 years, were at the sleep-out. Pat Bell said Harmony House gives people a safe, warm place they can live, to get them back on their feet. "We need toilet paper and towels and everybody gets a clean towel when they come and when they leave they take it with them, so we always need towels," she said. Kane said Boy Scout Troop 113 helps at the fundraiser each year, and the troop spends the night. Darla Schiro, an employee of Woodforest Bank located inside Walmart on O'Possum Run Road, came to volunteer. She said employees are taking turns and covering the entire 24-hour fundraiser. Kane, a licensed social worker who has spent 27 years working at the shelter, said that while growing up in Detroit, she spent some time living on the streets. She said many community leaders have slept out in past years, including former Mansfield Mayor Lydia Reid and Doc Stumbo, community organizer who works at Graham Automall. Stumbo crawled inside a cardboard box lined with a sleeping mat and sleeping bag Friday morning. "It makes you appreciate your warm bed at home," he said.  lwhitmir@nncogannett.com 419-521-7223 Twitter: @LWhitmir Buy Photo William O'Wings of Mansfield donated 10 pillows Friday during the Harmony House Sleep-Out for the Homeless fundraiser outside Walmart in Ontario.

Friday, November 4, 2016  |  Charlie Butts (OneNewsNow.com) A national anti-pornography group is waiting for an answer from a major corporation on how it will handle racy magazines. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation is concerned about Cosmopolitan magazine and the way Walmart stores handle it. Spokesperson Haley Halverson explains why. “For those who don't know Cosmo magazine, on the front it might just look like another woman's magazine - but inside it has a large number of very explicit sexual images and, more importantly, instructions on different sexual acts. So it's actually a very explicit magazine,” she says. Some stores actually have the magazine at checkout stands. In 2015, the Center received an agreement from Walmart regarding the magazine. Halverson “Walmart said that it would shield it in the checkout aisles, but they have not been enforcing this policy standard - and we hear reports from all over the country that Wamart's not doing it,” she says. “So now we're asking that they just stop selling the magazine altogether."  The National Center on Sexual Exploitation has communicated with Walmart but is still waiting for a response. The huge retailer previously agreed to remove a couple of controversial items from its website - one a book of photos that included nude minors, and another book on how to traffic women.

(Sarah MacMillan/CBC) Related Stories Stratford man arrested in connection to Walmart evacuation Charlottetown Walmart reopened after evacuation A man who caused the evacuation of the Charlottetown Walmart was sentenced Friday to 60 days in jail and ordered to pay the store almost $90,000. On the afternoon of Aug. 2, Charlottetown police got a call from someone who said there was a bomb inside the store. Court heard Logan Richard Arsenault, 19, made the bogus threat because he wanted his girlfriend — a Walmart employee — to have the day off. City police traced Arsenault's call to a phone booth in Stratford. Stratford RCMP found surveillance video and talked to staff of a nearby coffee shop, who remembered Arsenault coming in to ask for change to make a phone call. The store had to be closed for about six hours while a bomb squad from the mainland made sure the building was safe. No bomb was found. In addition to 60 days jail and three years probation, Arsenault was ordered to pay $89,100 to Walmart — the cost of wages paid to employees, lost sales and perishable food that had to be thrown out. Court also heard Arsenault and his girlfriend are no longer together. MORE P.E.I. NEWS | Wife of alleged 'screen cutter' pleads not guilty MORE P.E.I.

Check it out below. Tracy Morgan did a television interview on Today in June of last, his first public interview since his deadly car accident last year. Speaking with Matt Lauer alongside his lawyer Benedict Morelli, Morgan spoke out about the June 7, 2014 crash that landed him in a coma and the then-recent settlement with Walmart. On the morning of the accident, a Walmart truck driver caused a multi-vehicle accident involving the comedian and his assistant Jeff Millea, as well as comedians Ardie Fuqua, Harris Stanton and James McNair. James ‘Jimmy Mack’ McNair died as a result. Surprisingly, Tracy Morgan also thanked Walmart for “coming through in the clutch” and taking “full responsibility” for the accident. The sum of the settlement has not been disclosed but the pain remains for the comedian who lost his writing partner and close friend. “The case is settled, but the pain is always going to be there for Jimmy Mack,” Morgan tearfully said as he clutched at his cane. The comedy world suffered a huge blow that day, losing some talented comedians for over a year and losing Jimmy Mack permanently. Fuqua and Morgan have both remained sidelined from the stage for quite some time. But clearly Tracy Morgan is back in a big way. FOLLOW LAUGHSPIN ON TWITTER AND FACEBOOK!

Chase Pay Signals the Next Step of Bank's Walmart Relationship By David Heun November 4, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Furthering a relationship that placed Walmart on the closed-loop ChaseNet processing platform, Walmart has committed to accepting the Chase Pay mobile wallet in its stores and in-app. Chase Pay is built on ChaseNet, giving merchants a way to lower their card processing fees when accepting payments from JPMorgan Chase-issued card accounts. It operates by keeping the whole transaction on Chase's network, removing the third parties that are typically involved in open-loop card payments. The agreement also follows Chase's pact with the Merchant Customer Exchange joint venture of which Walmart was a key player, setting the stage for Chase Pay to come to several MCX merchants such as Best Buy. Chase's pitch was hard for merchants to ignore, offering an arrangement with no network fees, no merchant-acquiring fees and no fraud chargebacks on any transaction that Chase approved. Walmart is also working to expand its own Walmart Pay app by joining the list of retailers that accept Chase Pay as a funding source in-app. "We are excited about the opportunity to provide our customers with even greater convenience and value to our Walmart Pay app while expanding our relationship with Chase," Mike Cook, senior vice president and assistant treasurer at Walmart, stated in a Nov. 3 press release. "Adding Chase Pay as an option with Walmart Pay and online will create an enhanced experience for our customers." In addition to what had become an obvious eventuality in Walmart bringing Chase Pay into its fold because of the processing deal, the two mobile payment apps operate on similar technology through the use of QR codes and scanners. That should make it easier for Walmart customers to initiate transactions through either app at the point of sale. While Walmart continues to engage in legal and competitive skirmishes with Visa, the move to Chase Pay gives Walmart stronger footing at the negotiating table in that it provides the one thing Walmart has long desired: cheaper Visa payments.

Hey, I saw this on Recharge and thought it might be interesting for you. Cancel Send It! Print Walmart, the world’s largest company by sales, today set a goal to power half of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2025, double the 25% achieved last year. Given the scope of its operations and massive energy usage, the new firm target represents a benchmark for other companies to match or exceed, and continues Walmart’s leadership in the C&I sector for carbon reduction. It aspires to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions 18% by 2025. The move is also a significant step by Walmart for achieving its 2005 target of powering all its sprawling global operations with renewable energy. Walmart will now accelerate development of mainly onsite solar power and procurement of offsite solar and wind energy, to both meet the new goal and help reduce emissions. In 2015, Walmart ranked as the leading commercial solar energy user and the largest on-site renewable energy consumer in the US, with more than 340 solar installations there. By 2020, it hopes to increase this to more than 480. Last year, it also entered into a 10-year off-take deal to purchase 58% of power from the 200Mw Logan’s Gap wind farm in Texas owned by Pattern Energy. More such large-scale deals are likely in the next several years if wind power prices remain competitive. On 1 January, the retailing giant had more than 470 onsite and offsite renewable energy projects in operation or under development in seven countries and 17 US states.    To help achieve the 2025 goals, Walmart left unchanged an interim target of producing or procuring 7 billion/kWh of renewable energy by the end of 2020, versus more than 2 billion/kWh at the end of 2015. In Mexico, one of Walmart’s largest foreign operations, the company last year already met 60% of its electricity needs with renewable sources. The subsidiary’s goal is to procure 3 billion/kWh of renewable power by 2020.   Asia-Pacific Europe Americas Read Next: Are US corporations the next renewable growth engine?

Reuben Long Detention Center) Dominick Tooker (Source: J. Reuben Long Detention Center) MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) – Two men have been arrested after they broke into RVs at a campground in Myrtle Beach Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, fought with security, and fled to Walmart on foot. According to a police report, Zachary Todd, 24, of Murrells Inlet, was charged with shoplifting under $2,000, third-degree assault and battery, second-degree violent burglary and malicious injury to animals or personal property worth between $2,000 and $10,000. Dominick Tooker, 22, of Myrtle Beach, was charged with second-degree violent burglary and malicious injury to animals or personal property worth between $2,000 and $10,000. Officers responded to a trespassing call at Walmart on Maryport Drive Nov. 1. There, Todd was fighting with Ocean Lakes Campground security guards. The security guards said they chased Todd and Tooker after a campground maintenance employee had discovered the men hiding under an RV and confronted them. Inside Walmart, Todd ditched a Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom. Officers found a backpack full of children’s clothing, a Nintendo Wii with accessories and two Vizio TV remotes at the campsite. Outside Walmart, Todd punched one of the security guards in the head before they physically restrained him. Officers then took Todd and Tooker into investigative custody. It was discovered that Todd had local warrants and he and Tooker were taken to J. Reuben Long Detention Center. Back at the campgrounds, officers found several RVs had been broken into and there was a shopping cart containing TVs and other stolen property. Copyright 2016 WMBF News. All rights reserved.

The country’s biggest retailer is ramping up its environmental goals, noting that the plan is part of a “new era of trust and transparency.” The vow, which will be delivered by chief executive Doug McMillon today at the environmentally focused Net Impact Conference in Philadelphia, includes doubling sales of locally grown produce and supporting the “human dignity of workers in the retail supply chain.” The green-focused goals come amid a changing consumer landscape, with the millennial generation now outranking baby boomers in numbers and projected to move into their prime spending years. Millennials are also considered more likely to pony up for environmentally sustainable products, while members of Generation Z -- the demographic that’s younger than 20 -- are willing to pay more to shop at companies that are committed to helping social and environmental causes, Nielsen found in a 2015 survey. Play Video CBS This Morning What does the "natural" food label really mean? A Consumer Reports survey found more than 60 percent of Americans buy products labeled "natural," but nearly two-thirds believe natural means mor... “We have done a lot of work with our key customer target, millennials and busy families, and these issues are growing in importance with those customers,” Laura Phillips, senior vice president of Walmart Sustainability, told CBS MoneyWatch. “When we started the work [about a decade ago], we were maybe a little bit ahead of consumers, and they are pushing and pulling now.” It’s no coincidence that the goals are coming at a time when Walmart is seeking to rebuild shopper trust -- and reinvigorate its sales growth -- after complaints about empty stores shelves and poor customer service and even working conditions.  Under McMillon, the company has raised wages for more than a million workers and invested $2.7 billion during the last two years on training, education and higher pay. Still, Walmart has struggled to buck its reputation as a low-wage employer providing few opportunities for advancement. At employment site Glassdoor, the retailer’s rating has slowly improved during the past year, reaching a rating of 3.2, although that’s lower than rival Target’s 3.4 rating among its employees. Walmart wants to revamp how potential hires think about it, with the company noting that its vows include being “the place to go for an individual’s first job” and “provide a clear path for career advancement.” The company said it will train millions of workers to improve their career growth by 2025. It also said it will provide work schedules at least two weeks in advance so that employees will have more predictability in their lives, and will put in place a “strong leave policy” that allows workers to decide how to use their paid time off. As for the green goals, the company said it will source more products locally, including produce, with the goal of doubling its sales of locally grown vegetables and fruits by 2025. It said it will also work with suppliers and its own private-brand products to get rid of synthetic colors and artificial flavors “in products where customers don’t expect to find them.” Play Video CBSN One million Walmart workers are getting a raise CBSN Business Headlines: Walmart raises their minimum wage, Spotify may have been hacked, and Shake Shack innovator wants to give airplane food a... Its energy goals include relying on renewable sources for half of its energy needs by 2025, with Walmart saying that it’s the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan that has been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, a group created by nonprofits and agencies such as the U.N. Global Compact and the World Wildlife Fund to work with businesses on climate-change issues. So is Walmart walking the walk, or just talking the talk? After all, “greenwashing” -- or misleading consumers about a product or service’s environmental friendliness -- isn’t uncommon. But big-box retailers are likely a better choice, since they tend to be scrutinized closely by the public and have stronger control of their supply chain, according to a study from consulting firm TerraChoice.  “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of - and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in,” McMillon said in a statement. “That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

(WKBN) – The man who police say opened fire on an employee at the Wal-Mart on Hermitage Road was arraigned in Mercer County Court Friday. Zachary Thomas McClimans, 22, of Sharon, is charged with two counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault, theft, having a firearm without a license and reckless engagement, in the shooting of an employee inside the store Thursday night. His bond was set at $500,000. Police say McClimans quit his job at the store earlier in the day and came back at about 10:30 that night and shot the employee four times. According to a police report, McClimans was transitioning gender and told his co-workers about it. He says the victim, identified as Jayson Hall, became enraged and threatened him. Wal-Mart was investigating the threat, but McClimans said no action had been taken so he stole a gun from his grandfather and shot the co-worker, according to the report. When officers arrived, they found Hall with four gunshot wounds inside the store. Customers and employees told police the shooter was still at the store, directing them to the parking lot. “Numerous people were directing officers to a vehicle in the parking lot. They were indicting that the shooter was in one of the vehicles,” said Hermitage Police Chief Eric Jewell. Officers approached the vehicle and found McClimans sitting inside, according to Jewell. Police say he had a gun with him and it was taken into evidence. McClimans was arrested at the scene, where he surrendered to police.

BUSINESS Wal-Mart sets environmental plan as people seek green items Wal-Mart sign AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File This 2013 file photo shows a Wal-Mart store in San Jose, Calif. This 2013 file photo shows a Wal-Mart store in San Jose, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) Associated Press Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices.  The world's largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18% by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets such as Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50% clean and renewable energy sources.  Wal-Mart's goals, being announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. Wal-Mart has extended its effort since then into its supply chain, which, because of its size — more than 10,000 stores globally — gives it outsized influence on the overall industry.  The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer is under pressure from consumers, especially millennials, who want environmentally friendly items. Wal-Mart is looking at technology that will let shoppers scan food to learn its origins and other information, beyond just tagging products with “green labels.”  SIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter » Kathleen McLaughlin, a Wal-Mart senior vice president, said she couldn't estimate how much the programs will save or cost. While they have an impact on society, they also make good business sense overall, she said.  Some areas of focus include:  Sustainability The company will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and expand its use of clean and renewable sources to reduce emissions in its operations. Wal-Mart says it will be the first retailer to have an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in partnership with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. The Science Based Targets initiative is a partnership with World Wildlife Fund, World Resources Institute and others. Wal-Mart also will work with suppliers to scale back emissions by one gigaton by 2030, which it says is equivalent to taking 211 million cars from the road a year.  Wal-Mart says it hopes to be adding zero waste to landfills in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States by 2025. It plans to refine how it buys food so less of it goes unsold, and any that does is converted to pet food or fertilizers or diverted to charities.  Products The company wants its private-brand packaging to be 100% recyclable. It also plans to double sales of locally grown produce by 2025. It's also working with suppliers and its private-label products to eliminate certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors and get rid of other food additives where possible.  Workers Wal-Mart plans to work with industry groups and others to ensure that workers globally in sectors like seafood, produce, clothing and electronics are not forced to pay fees to land jobs and are not taken advantage of by recruiting agents. It plans to train suppliers to monitor whether workers are being exploited.  Wal-Mart was among the companies to which an Associated Press probe last year traced seafood that came through a fishing industry that used slave labor. The seafood also was linked to supermarkets and pet suppliers such as Kroger, Whole Foods and Petco.  Diane Regas, executive director at the Environmental Defense Fund, says Wal-Mart deserves credit for more than meeting its sustainability commitment. “I think that surprises people,” Regas said, but added, “There is a huge amount more to be done.”  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss LAPD will not help deport immigrants under Trump, nearly 4,000 students from L.A.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Walmart Offers New Vision for the Company’s Role in Society Walmart Offers New Vision for the Company’s Role in Society Posted on November 4, 2016 by CSRwire Press Releases, Events and Reports in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer At today’s Net Impact Conference, Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon will outline a roadmap that will guide the company’s role in society on critical issues over the next several years, pointing to a “new era of trust and transparency.” The roadmap adds fresh detail to Walmart’s sustainability agenda and contains new commitments that reflect a wider recognition of the company’s impact on communities and the planet. Among other things, Walmart is doubling sales of locally grown produce in the U.S.; expanding and enhancing sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, coffee and tea; and implementing a new plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with a commitment to source half of the company’s energy needs from renewable sources, to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. In his remarks, McMillon will also discuss company programs that will train hundreds of thousands of U.S. associates by the end of next year, providing them with skills needed to move from entry-level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay, along with a new pledge to take a leadership role in promoting ethical recruitment and treatment of workers in the global retail supply chain. Taken together, the initiatives are designed to make good on the company’s desire to become the most trusted retailer, not just by delivering affordable goods and a time-saving shopping experience, but with trust-building transparency and actions. “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of – and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in,” McMillon said. “That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.” The roadmap builds upon the three environmental sustainability goals Walmart set in 2005: to create zero waste in company operations, to operate with 100 percent renewable energy, and to sell products that sustain natural resources and the environment. Those aspirational goals have guided how Walmart engages on those vital issues and progress has been made toward them. The new roadmap builds on progress to date, but also broadens the company’s vision of its role in society. The commitments shared today include: Power half of the company’s energy from renewable sources under a plan designed to achieve science-based emissions targets: Walmart is one of the largest private-sector investors in renewable energy, including solar and wind power. In 2015, 25 percent of Walmart’s operations were powered by renewable energy, a significant step towards the 2005 goal. Going forward, the company will source half of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2025, as part of a plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. Under the recently approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with expanded use of renewable energy, to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. Achieve zero waste to landfill in key markets by 2025: Progress so far has been significant on the original goal. In 2015, 75 percent of Walmart’s global waste was diverted from landfills, helping to reduce costs to the business, customers and society. Under the roadmap, the company will achieve zero waste to landfill from our own operations in key markets, including the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Canada by 2025. The commitment is designed to meet or exceed EPA zero waste guidelines. Walmart will also continue working to reduce landfill waste in all markets, moving as fast as infrastructure and best practices allow. Sell more sustainably produced products while maintaining the low prices customers expect: Packaging: Walmart pledges to work with suppliers to reduce product and packaging waste and preserve natural resources. Our goal by 2025 is for Walmart’s private brand packaging to be 100 percent recyclable. Affordable, safe and healthier: Walmart will double the sales of locally grown produce in the U.S. by 2025 and work with suppliers and its own private brand products to remove certified synthetic colors and artificial flavors in products where customers don’t expect to find them, as well as reduce sodium, added sugars and saturated fat where possible. Additionally, Walmart will expand and enhance sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, grapes, coffee, and tea. Natural resources: Walmart is expanding sourcing of commodities produced with zero net deforestation. In partnership with governments, NGOs and industry groups, Walmart has previously been working to source private-brand palm oil and beef from Brazil’s Amazon with zero net deforestation. Under the roadmap, Walmart will expand its work into additional critical commodities, including all Brazilian soy and private-brand pulp and paper. McMillon also discussed the company’s $2.7 billion investment over the past two years in education, wages and training for associates in the U.S. and called for a broader industry push to ensure retailers are seen as employers of choice. “Today we are asking other retailers to join us in helping people live better,” he said. “Let’s use our collective power to create good jobs with good training that become good careers for all our associates.” Walmart will work to achieve the following: Support the human dignity of workers in the retail supply chain: Walmart is to ensure ethical recruitment and treatment of workers globally. This is on top of Walmart’s work underway in four areas that present risk to the dignity and safety of workers: seafood; apparel; produce; and electronics. Be the place to go for an individual’s first job: Walmart will further its efforts to afford a good experience for the thousands of people who come to the retailer for their first job. Associates will be provided with workplace mobility — a good start, new skills and a clear path to grow and succeed — joining the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment, a collaboration of businesses and NGO partners working whether or not they remain with the company. To further these efforts, Walmart has recently signed on to the White House First Jobs Compact, a nationwide effort to help connect out-of-school, out-of- work youth to their first jobs. Provide a clear path for career advancement: By 2025, Walmart U.S. will put millions of associates through focused training programs to equip them with skills to improve career growth, from entry level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay. The retailer’s Pathways program provides training in core skills for entry-level associates and rewards them with a pay increase upon completion. The Academy training program – for supervisory associates – is expected to graduate 250,000 people alone by the end of 2017. As part of this commitment, Walmart strives to be a destination employer for young people and returning service members. Predictability, stability and pay: Walmart is committed to improving predictability in the lives of its associates by providing work schedules more than two weeks in advance in the U.S.; as well as implementing a strong leave policy that empowers associates to decide how to use their paid time off based on individual needs. Walmart also believes in equal pay for equal work. Associates with the same qualifications, performing the same jobs and making the same effort to achieve the same results, should receive the same pay. Improve the lives of people in communities: Walmart will source more products locally around the world, including $250 billion in products supporting American jobs by 2023 and $20 billion in products from women-owned businesses in the U.S. by the end of this year. The retailer also committed to donating 4 billion meals to fight hunger by 2020 and, over five years, to contributing $25 million towards disaster relief and resiliency around the world.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) won’t be left behind. The online retailer has launched its own early bird deals on a wide variety of items — 8,788 items to be exact. Amazon’s major competitor for online sales is, perhaps surprisingly to some, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT). Including products carried by its marketplace sellers, Amazon offers more than 350 million products to its customers. Of that total, some 12.23 million are sold directly by Amazon. Wal-Mart claims it will have more than 20 million items for sale this year, with many millions more to come in the coming months. The company did not say if it is selling all those items directly or if some are sold by affiliate merchants. In any event, that’s still a lot of stuff. Among Amazon’s deals of the day for Friday is an assortment of athletic gear from Adidas. The company’s men’s Superstar RT Fashion Sneakers (ASIN: B01MXBT1OQ) in white or Night Indigo are on sale Friday for $45, a savings of 50% from the regular price of $90. An Adidas men’s Sport Luxe Bomber Jacket (model #F1625PM801) is on sale for $59.99, a 40% savings from the regular price of $100.00. This price is only good for Friday. ATGOIN Bluetooth wireless headphones (ASIN #B01E349FPY) are a daily deal for Friday at $26.99, a savings of 60% from the regular price of $66.99.

(File/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS) Anne D'Innocenzio, The Associated Press Published Friday, November 4, 2016 9:01AM EDT NEW YORK -- Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices. The world's largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 per cent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 per cent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart's goals, being announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. Wal-Mart has extended its efforts since then into its supply chain, which because of its size -- more than 10,000 stores globally -- gives it outsized influence on the overall industry. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is under pressure from consumers, especially millennials, who want environmentally friendly items and are choosing carefully where to spend their money. Wal-Mart is looking at technology that will let shoppers scan food to learn its origins and other information, beyond just tagging products with "green labels." Kathleen McLaughlin, a Wal-Mart senior vice-president who leads the company's sustainability efforts, said she couldn't estimate how much the programs will save or cost. While they have an impact on society, they overall also make good business sense, she said. Some areas of focus include: SUSTAINABILITY: The company will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and expand its use of clean and renewable sources to reduce emissions in its operations. Wal-Mart says it will be the first retailer to have an emissions plan approved under the process laid out under the Paris Agreement on climate change. Wal-Mart also plans to work with suppliers to reduce emissions, a big part of which will be at its 600 factories in China. Wal-Mart says it hopes to be adding zero waste to landfill in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States by 2025. It plans to refine how it buys food so less of it goes unsold, and any that does is converted to pet food or fertilizers or diverted to charities. PRODUCTS: The company wants its private-brand packaging to be 100 per cent recyclable. It also plans to double sales of locally grown produce by 2025. It's also working with suppliers and its private-label products to eliminate certified synthetic colours and artificial flavours and get rid of other food additives where possible. WORKERS: Wal-Mart plans to work with industry groups and others to ensure that workers globally in sectors like seafood, produce, clothing and electronics are not forced to pay fees to land jobs and are not taken advantage of by recruiting agents. It plans to train suppliers to monitor whether workers, many of them migrants, are being exploited. Wal-Mart was among the companies to which an Associated Press probe last year traced seafood that came through a fishing industry that used slave labour. The seafood was also linked to supermarkets and pet suppliers such as Kroger, Whole Foods, and Petco. Diane Regas, executive director at the Environmental Defence Fund, says Wal-Mart deserves credit for more than meeting its sustainability commitment. "I think that surprises people," Regas said, but added, "There is a huge amount more to be done."

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161104005437/en/ Among other things, Walmart is doubling sales of locally grown produce in the U.S.; expanding and enhancing sustainable sourcing to cover 20 key commodities, including bananas, coffee and tea; and implementing a new plan designed to achieve science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with a commitment to source half of the company’s energy needs from renewable sources, to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off of U.S. roads and highways for a year. In his remarks, McMillon will also discuss company programs that will train hundreds of thousands of U.S. associates by the end of next year, providing them with skills needed to move from entry-level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay, along with a new pledge to take a leadership role in promoting ethical recruitment and treatment of workers in the global retail supply chain. Taken together, the initiatives are designed to make good on the company’s desire to become the most trusted retailer, not just by delivering affordable goods and a time-saving shopping experience, but with trust-building transparency and actions. “We want to make sure Walmart is a company that our associates and customers are proud of - and that we are always doing right by them and by the communities they live in,” McMillon said. “That’s really what these commitments are about. And that’s why we’re so passionate about them.” The roadmap builds upon the three environmental sustainability goals Walmart set in 2005: to create zero waste in company operations, to operate with 100 percent renewable energy, and to sell products that sustain natural resources and the environment. Those aspirational goals have guided how Walmart engages on those vital issues and progress has been made toward them. The new roadmap builds on progress to date, but also broadens the company’s vision of its role in society. The commitments shared today include: McMillon will also discuss the company’s $2.7 billion investment over the past two years in education, wages and training for associates in the U.S. and called for a broader industry push to ensure retailers are seen as employers of choice. “Today we are asking other retailers to join us in helping people live better,” he said. “Let’s use our collective power to create good jobs with good training that become good careers for all our associates.” Walmart will work to achieve the following: About Walmart Walmart Stores, Inc.

Some areas of focus include: SUSTAINABILITY: The company will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures and expand its use of clean and renewable sources to reduce emissions in its operations. Wal-Mart says it will be the first retailer to have an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in partnership with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. The Science-Based Targets initiative is a partnership with World Wildlife Fund, World Resources Institute and others. Wal-Mart will also work with suppliers to scale back emissions by one gigaton by 2030, which it says is equivalent to taking 211 million cars from the road a year. Wal-Mart says it hopes to be adding zero waste to landfills in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States by 2025. It plans to refine how it buys food so less of it goes unsold, and any that does is converted to pet food or fertilizers or diverted to charities. PRODUCTS: The company wants its private-brand packaging to be 100 per cent recyclable. It also plans to double sales of locally grown produce by 2025. It’s also working with suppliers and its private-label products to eliminate certified synthetic colours and artificial flavours and get rid of other food additives where possible. WORKERS: Wal-Mart plans to work with industry groups and others to ensure that workers globally in sectors like seafood, produce, clothing and electronics are not forced to pay fees to land jobs and are not taken advantage of by recruiting agents. It plans to train suppliers to monitor whether workers are being exploited. Wal-Mart was among the companies to which an Associated Press probe last year traced seafood that came through a fishing industry that used slave labour. The seafood was also linked to supermarkets and pet suppliers such as Kroger, Whole Foods, and Petco. Diane Regas, executive director at the Environmental Defence Fund, says Wal-Mart deserves credit for more than meeting its sustainability commitment. “I think that surprises people,” Regas said, but added, “There is a huge amount more to be done.” ____ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

(CBC) Tom Murphy Host Tom Murphy is co-host CBC Nova Scotia's supper hour news program and correspondent for The National. He also hosts Land and Sea and is brother to Bob. Related Stories Walmart vows change amid concerns over food waste How Canada sucks at reducing food waste Here's how much food Walmart throws away over 12 days Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash The executive director of Feed Nova Scotia says food banks need to strategically go after food waste or what he calls "a very big prize." "If we got one-tenth of that we would double the impact of what we are doing right now," Nick Jennery said. He argued food banks must do more to prevent retailers from throwing out good food. A recent CBC Marketplace investigation found stores in Canada waste an estimated $3 billion of food annually. It found dumpsters full of seemingly edible food at Walmart stores across the country. Walmart insider says 'heartbreaking' amount of food dumped in trash Jennery said Feed Nova Scotia is trying to figure out the logistics of how it can get more of that food to the hungry. It's why the organization recently leased several new refrigerator trucks that are now crossing the province. They stop at major grocery retailers to pick up perishables and other foods. Food banks could be tapping into seemingly good food wasted by grocery store chains, volunteers say. (CBC) Food banks should learn more in order to tap into big retailers as a supply chain, Jennery said. "What are their store practices when they pull product off the shelf? What types of products? How much product is available?" he said. "We've got five trucks. I'm more than willing to reconstruct that if we can pick up the food in a more timely way — if I know there's more food to pick up — so we're having those conversations right now." Trying to be flexible In other words, Jennery wants to make it easy for retailers, who are in the business of selling food, not feeding the hungry, to get rid of what they deem to be food waste. "The more flexible we can be I think the more they might donate," Feed Nova Scotia truck driver Jimmy Nickerson said. "There's a potential to get even more, definitely." Jimmy Nickerson, a truck driver for Feed Nova Scotia, says he hopes they can be flexible to make it easy for stores to donate. (CBC) Once a week, Feed Nova Scotia goes to Costco, Sobeys, Walmart and Superstore stores across the province to pick up donations of regular groceries — anything destined for the dumpster could still be eaten. Jane Threlfall, manager of Walmart in Truro, N.S., says regular pick ups by food banks would help. (CBC) Jane Threlfall, manager of Walmart in Truro, N.S., said having a refrigerator truck pull up to their door at a regular time makes it a lot easier for the store to make a donation. "For us it means we are able to give them perishable goods, such as meat, cheeses, yogurt," she said. "Things like cold products that would at one point retailers may have to destroy, we are able to hang on to those and give it to them, as well."

Shopping 5 0 0 November 4, 2016 Black Friday 2016 Ads: JCPenney And Kohl’s Are The Latest Leaks — Is Walmart Next? Phillip Dengler Black Friday 2016, which will take place on November 25 this year, is now only three weeks away. While ads have been leaking daily over the past few weeks, there has been a lack of news from major retailers. That has all changed over the course of the past 24 hours, as Black Friday ads have leaked from JCPenney and Kohl’s. While frugal shoppers are still anxiously awaiting ads from Walmart, Best Buy, and Target, they are going to have to wait a little longer. The good news is that the remaining ads from major retailers should be out by the end of next week, with Walmart being the last of the group. Amazon does not release a traditional ad, but you can keep an eye on an upcoming press release to announce their doorbusters. JCPenney Sale Information and Circular The 72-page JCPenney 2016 Black Friday ad was posted to BestBlackFriday.com on November 4. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. [Image via JCPenney] As they did last year, JCPenney will open at 3 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. They will remain open the entire night and end their sale at 5 p.m. on Black Friday. In 2015, their doorbusters ended at 2 p.m. on Friday, so their sale this year is three hours longer. While it is not explicitly stated, their online sale is probably going to be live the entire day on Thanksgiving. Early arrivers on Thanksgiving at traditional brick-and-mortar locations have the chance to win one of the following coupons. $500 off $500 (valid in-store or at jcp.com 11/24-12/24) $100 off $100 or more (valid in-store or at jcp.com 11/24-12/24) $10 off $10 or more (valid in-store or at jcp.com 11/24-12/24) While this ad lacks many of the more exciting electronic doorbusters, it does have quite a few solid deals on home items, toys, and clothing. Here are a few notables. Boots for Her for $19.99 (reg. $60-$90) Cooks Power Blender for $7.99 after Rebate Home Expressions 100% Cotton Ombre Stripe or Sold Bath Towel for $2.99 (reg. $10) Up to 40$ Off Major Appliances Pyrex 8-piece Sculptured Bowl Set for $10 after Rebate Cooks 12-piece Stainless Steel Cookware Set for $29.99 after Rebate All orders over $99 at JCPenney’s website will ship for free. All orders over $25 will ship to your nearest store for free. Considering how easy it is to qualify for free shipping at other retailers, it is not recommended that you ever pay shipping charges on Black Friday. Target and Best Buy will both offer free shipping with no minimum order size this holiday season, and other retailers have easier requirements to meet. Kohl’s Sale Information and Circular The 64-page Kohl’s Black Friday 2016 ad was posted to Savings.com on November 3. [Image via Kohl’s] As they did in 2015, Kohl’s will begin their in-store Thanksgiving sale at 6 p.m. Black Friday deals will actually begin on their website on Monday, November 21, but many of the top doorbusters will not be available until Thanksgiving. While Kohl’s will remain open all day on Black Friday, their doorbuster sale will end at 1 p.m. Unlike last year, their first-page doorbusters will also be available online. This has been a recent trend over the past few years, but Kohl’s held out last year. Regardless, they will join the likes of Walmart and Best Buy in ensuring that Black Friday will eventually become more of an online event than an offline sale. Here are a few notable items from the sale. Sony PlayStation 4 Slim Uncharted Bundle + $75 in Kohl’s Cash for $249.99 (save $50) Microsoft Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle + $75 in Kohl’s Cash for $249.99 (save $50) Fitbit Charge 2 Heart Rate + Fitness Wristband + $30 Kohl’s Cash for $129.99 (save $20) Haier 49-in. 4K Ultra HD TV + $75 Kohl’s Cash for $249.99 (save $100) Save 50 percent on Toys from Various Popular Brands Apple Watch Series 2 38mm + $105 Kohl’s Cash for $369 While the prices on those items will be available at other retailers, the Kohl’s Cash makes all of the difference. Members can earn $15 in Kohl’s Cash for every $50 spent. While this is not a direct discount, it adds to the overall savings. Free shipping is available on all orders over $75. This was the rate last year, and it is somewhat surprising that Kohl’s has not dropped to a lower minimum. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target Projected Black Friday Ad Leak Dates As the Inquisitr recently reported, the rest of the major leaks should come next week. Based on previous year’s data, here are the projected dates. Target – November 8 Best Buy – November 9 Walmart – November 10 Amazon (Press Release) – November 16, 2016 As noted above, Amazon does not actually have an ad, but they will put out a press release to announce their top doorbusters. Now we want to hear from you. Will you be shopping at JCPenney or Kohl’s on Thanksgiving and Black Friday this year? What are your favorite deals from the ads? Tell us in the comment section below.

Walmart will add Chase Pay to its app USA TODAY 11/4/2016 Chris Woodyard © Gunnar Rathbun, Invision for Walmart Walmart customers checkout at the retailer's Black Friday event last year in Rogers, Ark. When Chase customers go shopping at Walmart next year, they'll have another option for paying via their smartphones instead of credit cards. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.86 +0.37 +0.52% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.66 +0.95 +0.90% CVS Health Corp CVS ▼ 74.72 -1.28 -1.68% The giant retailer announced Thursday that it will add the Chase Pay feature to its Walmart Pay app, creating another payment option for shoppers wielding digital devices for shopping online. The announcement comes as retailers rush to add as many easy digital ways to pay as possible -- and banks and credit card issuers try to make sure they are not left behind by the mobile payment revolution that has already given rise to Apple Pay. Digital payment apps have the side benefit of speeding up checkout lines, which have slowed down due to new. higher security chip-based credit cards. The joint Chase and Walmart announcement comes as other retailers rush to create payment apps. CVS Health, for instance, announced in August that it will roll out payment via its app across the country. Almost one of five U.S. consumers are expected to use their smartphones for in-store purchases this year., according eMarketer. The number is expected to climb 62% compared to last year to 37.5 million and is sure to grow more. Chase, which says it has 94 million consumer credit, debit and prepaid card accounts, says the deal with Walmart will "provide customers yet another way to use Chase Pay for everyday shopping,” says Jennifer Roberts, president of strategic alliances and loyalty solutions.

Zachary McClimans, 22, of Sharon, said he had reported the issue to management at the Hermitage store last week but 'no decision had been made' regarding the other employee, police said in a criminal complaint on Friday. McClimans decided one 'solution' to prevent his co-worker, identified as Jayson Hall, from harming him was shooting him, according to court documents. Scroll down for video  Walmart shooting suspect Zachary McClimans, 22, (left and right) said he opened fire on his co-worker because the employee was offended he was changing genders to female and had threatened him, police said McClimans shot his coworker, identified as Jayson Hall, with his grandfather's .380-caliber pistol inside the store in Hermitage, Pennsylvania on Thursday at about 10.30pm. People stand outside the store following the shooting So McClimans took his grandfather's .380-caliber pistol, drove to the store and shot Hall inside at about 10.30pm on Thursday, police said. McClimans, who had left during his shift earlier in the day before returning to the store later that night, had originally planned to shoot the Hall outside the store. However, 'he felt so strongly about shooting Hall that he could not wait, at which time he tracked down Hall inside the store,' according to the complaint. Hall - who was found in a back stockroom - was shot four times, including twice in the back, according to authorities. Chaotic scenes followed inside the store as frantic customers and Walmart employees were seen fleeing, WKBN reported. When officers arrived, witnesses told police the shooter was still at the store in the parking lot. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Number of gay characters on network TV hits record high -...

Share this article Share Chaotic scenes ensued following the shooting as frantic customers and Walmart employees were seen fleeing from the store Hall - who was found in a back stockroom - was shot four times, including twice in the back, according to authorities. He was taken to a local hospital where he is listed in stable condition Officers then approached the vehicle where McClimans was sitting inside, who had a gun with him that was taken into evidence. He surrendered to police and was arrested at the scene, according to the station.  Hall was taken to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio, where he is listed in stable condition. He is expected to recover, Hermitage police said. While McClimans told police he is switching genders, it was not known if he has begun identifying as female. Police checked the box marked 'male' on the criminal complaint and did not list any feminine aliases for McClimans. The Walmart store in Hermitage, about 70 miles north of Pittsburgh, closed overnight Thursday following the shooting and reopened on Friday morning. Store employees would not comment, but Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson confirmed in an email that one worker was injured and said one worker was fired. 'Our thoughts are with the associate who was injured. The other associate involved has been terminated,' Crowson said.  'We're continuing to gather all of the facts and work closely with law enforcement.' Following the shooting, officers at the scene located him inside a vehicle in the parking lot. He surrendered and was taken into custody McClimans has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, theft and carrying a firearm without a license Walmart said police would have to answer any questions about McCliman's allegation of harassment at the store. The victim named in the criminal complaint is not charged with a crime and could not immediately be reached to respond to McClimans' accusations against him. Police did not return calls seeking additional information about Hall or other aspects of the shooting. McClimans has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, theft and carrying a firearm without a license, WTAE reported. An attorney for him was not listed in court documents. Phone calls to several of his relatives went unanswered, except for one man who refused to give his name and declined to comment.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News Retail & Marketing More Visa ups ante in battle with Walmart by offering Manitobans $10 to shop where card is accepted Barbara Shecter, Financial Post  11.03.2016 Visa / Financial Post ShareAdjustCommentPrint Visa Inc., which has accused Walmart of using customers as leverage after the retail giant said in June it would stop accepting the credit card in Canadian stores, appears to be ratcheting up the months-long battle by offering $10 credits to cardholders in Manitoba who shop elsewhere. The new promotion, which will run throughout November in Manitoba, doesn’t specifically name Walmart, the U.S.-owned retail giant that sells clothing, toys, household items, and groceries. But the $10 credit is being offered to Visa cardholders who register their card and then make a purchase of $50 or more at a grocery store in Manitoba. “We hope this eases the inconvenience for Visa cardholders in Manitoba who cannot use their card everywhere they may want to,” Visa Canada spokesperson Carla Hindman said in an interview. Alex Roberton, a spokesman for Walmart Canada, told CBC News: “We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand.” Walmart Canada stopped accepting Visa cards in Manitoba stores on Oct. 24, following the initial withdrawal from stores in Thunder Bay, Ont. after a dispute over fees. Negotiations broke down between the credit card company and the retailer in June, and Walmart declared it would stop accepting Visa cards in stores across the country beginning the following month. At the time, Walmart said the fees it was charged for accepting Visa were “unacceptably high,” and its aim was to keep all costs as low as possible so it could keep prices low for customers. In an open letter to cardholders and other merchants in June, Visa said it had already offered Walmart “one of the lower rates” of any merchant in Canada, and accused the retailer of demanding rates even lower than what the credit card company charges charities and schools. “They believe that their cost to accept Visa cards should be much lower than all other merchants… And yes, charities and schools too’,” Visa said in the letter, which was published in newspapers including the National Post. We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand The letter also accused Walmart of “using their size and scale to give themselves an unfair advantage.” The fees the companies are at odds over are called “interchange” fees, which are paid by all merchants on each credit card transaction. Once collected, the fees are shared by banks that issue the credit cards, credit card processors, and credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard. Interchange fees have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with retail groups and some politicians arguing that they ultimately drive up the cost of goods for consumers. In late 2014, after a series of negotiations, the fees charged to retailers in Canada were voluntarily reduced in a move that kept the government from entering the fray and regulating the interchange rates set by credit card networks. But retail and consumer groups have continued to complain that the rates in Canada outstrip those in jurisdictions including Australia and parts of Europe. A banking industry source told the Financial Post last summer that the dispute between Visa and Walmart could put some $82 million in interchange fees at stake for the Canadian banks that issue Visa cards. While not material, the amount is not insubstantial either, the source said, suggesting banks could put put pressure on Visa to head back to the negotiating table and cut a deal to lower fees charged to the retailing giant.

The exact number of robots to be installed at Walmart was not disclosed, yet the Estonian company plans on reaching 15,000 units total across the pond. US retail chain Walmart is huge: they are the retail business with the world's biggest turnover, employing a total of over two million people, and come in second place only to Amazon in e-commerce turnover. E-commerce, however, requires solid logistics, and this is where Estonian business Cleveron, whose headquarters are located in Viljandi, comes into play. The company's PackRobots, which will begin serving more and more Walmart customers in the future, are likewise built in the Southern Estonian city. Customers making purchases from Walmart's online store can order their goods to be delivered to the Cleveron PackRobot for pickup. The first unit is already up and running in Bentonville, Arkansas, home of the retail giant's headquarters. "The first PackRobot has been in Walmart since mid-September," confirmed Cleveron founder and board member Arno Kütt. "So far we have received very positive feedback from there; clients have embraced [the package terminal]." Cleveron's PackRobot technology was likewise developed in Viljandi. The company considers the opportunity to get its foot in the door with the first automated package machine on the US market to be its breakthrough moment. This was achieved in cooperation with machine maintenance firm Bell&Howell, with whom the Estonian company signed a cooperation agreement one year ago; certification and testing followed the signing of the contract. "The existence of such a partner was a prerequisite for cooperation with Walmart," explained Kütt. "Over 700 maintenance workers across the US work for Bell&Howell, and they will be maintaining our machines." In the future, assembly is expected to take place on location in the US as well.

CDT November 03, 2016 Walmart customers checkout at the retailer's Black Friday event last year in Rogers, Ark.   (Photo: Gunnar Rathbun, Invision for Walmart) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST When Chase customers go shopping at Walmart next year, they'll have another option for paying via their smartphones instead of credit cards. The giant retailer announced Thursday that it will add the Chase Pay feature to its Walmart Pay app, creating another payment option for shoppers wielding digital devices for shopping online. The announcement comes as retailers rush to add as many easy digital ways to pay as possible -- and banks and credit card issuers try to make sure they are not left behind by the mobile payment revolution that has already given rise to Apple Pay. Digital payment apps have the side benefit of speeding up checkout lines, which have slowed down due to new. higher security chip-based credit cards. The joint Chase and Walmart announcement comes as other retailers rush to create payment apps. CVS Health, for instance, announced in August that it will roll out payment via its app across the country. Almost one of five U.S. consumers are expected to use their smartphones for in-store purchases this year., according eMarketer. The number is expected to climb 62% compared to last year to 37.5 million and is sure to grow more. Chase, which says it has 94 million consumer credit, debit and prepaid card accounts, says the deal with Walmart will "provide customers yet another way to use Chase Pay for everyday shopping,” says Jennifer Roberts, president of strategic alliances and loyalty solutions.

Walmart is doing the same thing in China but with some pricey twists, including $3,200 Zojirushi rice cookers and $295,000 diamond rings. Over the past two years, the retailer has repositioned the 14 Sam’s Clubs in the country to offer more expensive products. Shoppers can pick up $500 Dyson hair dryers, $1,700 bottles of 1995 Château Lafite Rothschild red wine, and $7,000 high-tech massage chairs, in addition to imported pistachios and desserts conjured up by Michelin-rated chefs. There’s even a $4,100 Laurastar ironing system that comes with four hours of in-home instruction. Unlike its small business focus in America, Sam’s Club on the mainland is all about catering to the whims and preferences of an emerging middle and upper class willing to spend more for premium items.

That’s the ambition we want to fill.” Walmart sees big potential in China: Its Sam’s Club in Shenzhen, a fast-growing urban center in the southeast, is the chain’s best-performing outlet globally. Walmart, which posted $482 billion in revenue for its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, doesn’t break out China sales, but it says the growth of clubs there is among its fastest globally. Chinese memberships now number 1.8 million and are growing 10 percent to 12 percent annually. In addition to rolling out a premium product lineup, the retailer almost doubled its annual membership fee in April, to 260 yuan ($40), to attract more upscale shoppers, those earning at least $25,000 in yearly household income, roughly three times the nation’s average in 2014. Miles says members remaining after the fee increase spent 8 percent more on average per visit. “Sam’s Club’s potential in China is greater than anywhere,” says Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. Members “want a fine bottle of wine, they want a great fresh-food experience, they want a 4k television,” he says, referring to the latest high-resolution technology. “Even a $15,000 price point can be a great value for what you are getting.” That upmarket tack—from a Samsung curved TV for $26,000 to a 61-bottle collection of Médoc wines, complete with its own cooler, for $14,472—capitalizes on a Chinese bias toward imports. They see them as higher-quality and safer after domestic suppliers experienced some recent well-publicized food-safety concerns. “I don’t have to go through online channels to get foreign brands now,” says He Lihui, a 35-year-old sales executive who was shopping at the Shenzhen Sam’s Club for Wonderful brand pistachios from the U.S. and waffles made with European ingredients. A customer looks at flat screen TVs. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Sam’s Club’s own brands, such as its Member’s Mark private-label oatmeal and kitchen towels, or the Asda brand developed for Walmart stores in Britain, aren’t perceived as high-end in their home markets, according to Jack Chuang, OC&C Strategy Consultants’ Greater China partner. But Sam’s Club has been pitching the foreign provenance of its house-branded items and selling them for less than what imports generally cost in China. “What they’ve done in China is a rebranding exercise using the fact that to Chinese shoppers, ‘imported’ is a badge for premium,” he says. Walmart aims to more than double the number of Sam’s Clubs there to 35 in three years, and it’s built an entire mall with a 1,900-car parking lot for a 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) store in Zhuhai, near the casino island of Macau. The investment in the new mall, which has leased space to Starbucks, Uniqlo, and other big brands, became necessary because other potential retail sites lacked adequate parking. Similar projects with malls anchored by Sam’s Clubs are planned in Jiangxi and Guizhou provinces. Sam’s Club’s success is in sharp contrast to the performance at the 412 Walmart-branded stores on the mainland, where McMillon says sales are flat. Big brick-and-mortar retailers such as Walmart and France’s Carrefour have struggled as Chinese consumers increasingly turn to e-commerce platforms for electronics and other non-perishable goods, both of which are high-margin categories at Walmart’s large stores in China, says Wai-Chan Chan, a senior partner in the Asia-Pacific retail and consumer practice at consultant Oliver Wyman. In an attempt to remedy that, Walmart on Oct. 20 announced a distribution partnership with JD.com, China’s second-largest e-commerce company after Alibaba Group. Customers can now order Walmart items from around the world through a store on JD.com; they’re delivered using the e-commerce company’s sprawling fulfillment system, which reaches homes in 90 percent of the country. Already, customers living near 20 Walmarts can get purchases delivered within two hours; more stores will be added later. A customer pushes a loaded shopping cart near the entrance. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Sam’s Club has also opened a flashy online storefront on JD.com, making its items available to nonmembers for the first time, albeit at a 10 percent premium. “We’re indifferent as to the format,” McMillon says. “Our job is to make sure that we are there to serve customers however they want to be served.” One bonus from boosting online access: Sam’s Club can use the geographic data from e-commerce sales to identify where it should set up warehouses next, says Walmart China’s senior vice president for e-commerce, Ben Hassing. Sam’s Club has no major club rivals in China. Its biggest American competitor, Costco Wholesale, doesn’t operate brick-and-mortar stores there. That could change: Costco opened a store on Alibaba’s Tmall online platform last year, a move OC&C’s Chuang describes as “dipping their toes into the water.” For now, Sam’s Club has the pool—and the growth—to itself. —Bloomberg News The bottom line: Sam’s Club in China, whose membership is growing at 10 percent to 12 percent annually, is repositioning itself to sell pricier goods.

The giant retailer announced Thursday that it will add the Chase Pay feature to its Walmart Pay app, creating another payment option for shoppers wielding digital devices for shopping online. The announcement comes as retailers rush to add as many easy digital ways to pay as possible — and banks and credit card issuers try to make sure they are not left behind by the mobile payment revolution that has already given rise to Apple Pay. Digital payment apps have the side benefit of speeding up checkout lines, which have slowed down due to new, higher-security chip-based credit cards. The joint Chase and Walmart announcement comes as other retailers rush to create payment apps. CVS Health, for instance, announced in August that it will roll out payment via its app across the country. Almost one of five U.S. consumers are expected to use their smartphones for in-store purchases this year, according to eMarketer. The number is expected to climb 62% compared with last year to 37.5 million and is sure to grow more. Chase, which says it has 94 million consumer credit, debit and prepaid card accounts, says the deal with Walmart will "provide customers yet another way to use Chase Pay for everyday shopping,” says Jennifer Roberts, president of strategic alliances and loyalty solutions.

Sports Photos Faces in Places Arts Around The Area People In Society Spotlight on Wicomico Social Lounge Annual Christmas Spirit Campaign Looking For Volunteers, Sponsors Nov 03,2016 by Bethany Hooper OCEAN CITY – The Young Professionals of Ocean City are gearing up for their 6th Annual Christmas Spirit Campaign, and members are looking for volunteers and sponsors to help the children. Each year, the Young Professionals look to the community to sponsor a Christmas shopping day for underprivileged youth who attend Buckingham, Ocean City and Showell Elementary schools. Each of the schools, in addition to the Worcester Youth and Family Services, select an average of 10 children to participate in the event each year. The kids will meet at Outback Steakhouse in West Ocean City at 5:30 on the morning of Dec. 3, where a transit bus provided by the Town of Ocean City will take them to Walmart. Once there, each child is paired with a chaperone and given $100 to buy gifts for their families and themselves. “It’s fun,” co-chair Cate Nellans said. “It’s a worthwhile cause, and it’s worth it to see them shop. They always want to buy things for their mother or grandmother, and we always have to tell them it is okay to shop for themselves. They really want to shop for their families.” Nellans said the campaign is looking for individuals to chaperone and entertain more than 50 children that morning as they make their way from the Berlin Walmart to Outback Steakhouse, where they will receive breakfast with Santa. “We really need volunteers right now, especially as we go back to Outback for breakfast,” she said. “That is where we lacked help last year.” Currently, 16 individuals have signed up to participate as chaperones, but Nellans said the campaign is in desperate need of volunteers for each of the children. SonRise is already working with the group to provide entertainment and refreshments as kids wait to get their presents wrapped by the Young Professionals. Children in grades first through fifth will have the chance to participate in games in Walmart’s activity room and at Outback Steakhouse at the conclusion of their shopping trip. With just a month left, members are encouraging locals and businesses to either donate or sponsor a child for the event. Those wishing to sponsor have three levels to choose from, with options ranging from $100 to $500. Businesses that choose to sponsor a child will have their name put on the event’s banners. However, those who cannot afford to sponsor are encouraged to volunteer or contribute in-kind donations, such as wrapping paper, bows, ribbons and tape. Last year, at least 75 individuals and businesses, including Walmart, Outback Steakhouse, SonRise and Burley Oak, contributed to the shopping fund and the event’s festivities, according to Nellans. Fundraising is continuing to move at the same pace as last year, but additional funds above the required amount will provide more children with the opportunity to join the event, according to the event’s committee. Any money left at the end of the trip will be placed into the next year’s fund. The Young Professionals supplement the fund by hosting fundraisers throughout the year, including a Christmas in July celebration and a wine tasting event. The organization will also host its last fundraiser for the event at Burley Oak in the near future, although no date has been set. For more information, or to participate as a volunteer, message the Young Professionals Facebook page, or visit the Ocean City Chamber of Commerce website at www.oceancity.org and click on the Christmas Spirit Campaign banner at the bottom of the page. Volunteers must complete a form and background check before the event. ← Previous Next → 0 shares About The Author: Bethany Hooper Bethany Hooper has been with The Dispatch since 2016.

The woman, who is identified in the complaint by the pseudonym of “Jane Doe,” was an employee at the Route 1 store in this township when the alleged sexual assault occurred on June 13, 2015. The overnight manager at the time, Henry A. Deleon, was charged a week later with sexual assault. He was indicted in January by a Mercer County grand jury and eventually pleaded guilty to a lower offense, fourth-degree criminal sexual contact, which spared him from serving time in prison. Deleon, 25, of Trenton, was sentenced in July to two years of probation. Walmart fired him after his arrest last year, a company spokesman said Wednesday. News of the attack at the store is being reported for the first time by New Jersey 101.5, which obtained a copy of the woman’s lawsuit in federal district court of New Jersey. The lawsuit claims Walmart officials ignored the woman’s repeated complaints about Deleon and that other female employees also had filed sexual harassment complaints against him. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of damages, alleging claims of a hostile work environment under the state’s Law Against Discrimination. The woman said she was forced to quit her job because of the “intolerable” work environment caused by Walmart waiting only until police arrested Deleon before firing him. A spokesman for Walmart said the company had not yet been served with a copy of the lawsuit. “We take the allegations seriously,” Randy Hargrove said. “Our associates are expected to act professionally at all times and if they do not we will take appropriate action.” Deleon is also named as a defendant. It was not clear Thursday if he had an attorney. Sergio Bichao is deputy digital editor at New Jersey 101.5.

Wal-Mart customer questions shift to new discount program Lee Rood , lrood@dmreg.com 6:16 p.m. CDT November 3, 2016 Walmart (Photo: Getty Images) Sherry Erickson doesn’t have a car, doesn’t splurge on cable, can’t afford the newspaper. Living on about $700 a month, the Des Moines east-sider takes saving money on groceries seriously. So much so, Erickson actually took a class in Ankeny on how to make the most of coupons and grocery store promotions, she said. That’s why the 54-year-old was alarmed this week when she went to Wal-Mart in Windsor Heights and learned the store had discontinued matching lower prices of competitors in print ads. A store cashier, she says, gave her the impression the store also had quit taking coupons. “Why are they doing this?” asked Erickson, who lives on Social Security Disability. “It’s the world’s biggest box store.” A local store manager said Friday Erickson needn’t worry: The store still takes coupons. In early October, it also dropped prices on more than 15,000 items, he said. That was in anticipation for Oct. 24, when the store quit matching competitor’s lower prices in print ads at the register. Instead, the store is telling customers to use Wal-Mart’s app, which includes a discount program called Savings Catcher. Savings Catcher refunds the difference in the lower price of an item advertised by a competitor and refunds it back to customers by way of a Wal-Mart e-gift card. The switch is happening at stores across Iowa because more people have been using the Savings Catcher app than price matching, according to Ryan Oshel, the Windsor Heights store manager. “People will save a lot of money on this,” Oshel promised. “It’s happening at stores around the state, but not 100 percent of Iowa.” Shoppers who use Savings Catcher on the Wal-Mart app take a picture of the receipt bar code or type in their receipt number and receive the difference in price on the e-gift card within 72 hours. Oshel said the store dropped prices ahead of the switch as an enticement. The slashing affected everything from laundry detergent to vitamins to frozen beef patties, he said. The Savings Catcher app, he said, searches Wal-Mart’s prices on the receipt and compares them with those advertised by competitors. It pays the difference when the competitor beats out Wal-Mart. Oshel said no retailer wants to quit taking coupons. “We love for people to use coupons. It’s savings for customers and like cash to us. If the coupon is 35 cents, we get reimbursed for that. Coupons are designed to get people to try a new product or get people to switch over.” Those who still favor price matching, however, have criticized the new app, which has been rolled out nationally since March. (Wal-Mart’s national PR folks have not said exactly how many stores are affected.) The website PriceMatchWithRachel.com, for example, says the app misses deals on some fresh produce, bakery items or items sold in multiples, such as two for $5. And the app only makes price comparisons with national retailers, not local chains. Other consumer advocates, however, say the app could speed up lines at the register. And, for better or worse, the e-cards guarantee the savings is spent back at Wal-Mart. Erickson says she’s relieved to hear Wal-Mart was still accepting coupons. But she’s not thrilled about not getting to take home her savings from price-matching in cash. “The whole principle is to have extra money to pay bills,” she said. She says she will probably still shop at Wal-Mart with coupons, but go to other stores more often when price-matching will save her cash.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Visa Inc., which has accused Walmart of using customers as leverage after the retail giant said in June it would stop accepting the credit card in Canadian stores, appears to be ratcheting up the months-long battle by offering $10 credits to cardholders in Manitoba who shop elsewhere. The new promotion, which will run throughout November in Manitoba, doesn’t specifically name Walmart, the U.S.-owned retail giant that sells clothing, toys, household items, and groceries. But the $10 credit is being offered to Visa cardholders who register their card and then make a purchase of $50 or more at a grocery store in Manitoba. “We hope this eases the inconvenience for Visa cardholders in Manitoba who cannot use their card everywhere they may want to,” Visa Canada spokesperson Carla Hindman said in an interview. Alex Roberton, a spokesman for Walmart Canada, told CBC News: “We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand.” Related Walmart stops accepting Visa at all its stores in Manitoba as fee dispute continues Walmart Canada expands ban on Visa to Manitoba, raising stakes in high-profile fee dispute Walmart Canada stopped accepting Visa cards in Manitoba stores on Oct. 24, following the initial withdrawal from stores in Thunder Bay, Ont. after a dispute over fees. Negotiations broke down between the credit card company and the retailer in June, and Walmart declared it would stop accepting Visa cards in stores across the country beginning the following month. At the time, Walmart said the fees it was charged for accepting Visa were “unacceptably high,” and its aim was to keep all costs as low as possible so it could keep prices low for customers. In an open letter to cardholders and other merchants in June, Visa said it had already offered Walmart “one of the lower rates” of any merchant in Canada, and accused the retailer of demanding rates even lower than what the credit card company charges charities and schools. “They believe that their cost to accept Visa cards should be much lower than all other merchants… And yes, charities and schools too’,” Visa said in the letter, which was published in newspapers including the National Post. We don’t comment on how other organizations want to promote their brand The letter also accused Walmart of “using their size and scale to give themselves an unfair advantage.” The fees the companies are at odds over are called “interchange” fees, which are paid by all merchants on each credit card transaction. Once collected, the fees are shared by banks that issue the credit cards, credit card processors, and credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard. Interchange fees have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with retail groups and some politicians arguing that they ultimately drive up the cost of goods for consumers. In late 2014, after a series of negotiations, the fees charged to retailers in Canada were voluntarily reduced in a move that kept the government from entering the fray and regulating the interchange rates set by credit card networks. But retail and consumer groups have continued to complain that the rates in Canada outstrip those in jurisdictions including Australia and parts of Europe. A banking industry source told the Financial Post last summer that the dispute between Visa and Walmart could put some $82 million in interchange fees at stake for the Canadian banks that issue Visa cards. While not material, the amount is not insubstantial either, the source said, suggesting banks could put put pressure on Visa to head back to the negotiating table and cut a deal to lower fees charged to the retailing giant.

Walmart Adding Chase Pay As An Online, In-App Payment Option Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Adding Chase Pay As An Online, In-App Payment Option Image courtesy of Patrick November 3, 2016 1:29 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk Another Way To Pay mobile payment systems mobile payments walmart retailers chase pay jp morgan chase Despite the fact that Walmart already offers its own mobile payment system, the retailer is opening up doors to other forms of digital payments in an effort to cut costs on processing electronic transactions. Walmart customers will be able to use Chase Pay starting next year to pay for purchases both on Walmart.com and in the Walmart app, The Wall Street Journal reports, while shoppers can also use Walmart Pay in physical stores. Walmart is trying to reduce the fees it has to pay for taking debit and credit card payments, and conveniently enough, Chase has said that merchants who use its payment services could pay lower fees for card transactions than they would otherwise. In September, Walmart also said it would use Chase’s back-end system called ChaseNet to process card transactions at lower rates. “We believe the agreements we have announced will bring much needed competition to the payments markets,” a Walmart spokesman said. This isn’t Walmart’s first time at the mobile payments rodeo: along with its proprietary Walmart Pay system, the retailer is a member of the Merchant Customer Exchange, known as MCX, which is a group of companies that got together in 2012 and planned on building a mobile payment technology called CurrentC that would compete with others in the field. But because it’s not terribly easy to create an entirely new payment system, those efforts have apparently been put on hold for the time being. “MCX is focused on our core business working with our merchants and financial institutions,” the group, which also has an agreement to use Chase Pay, told the WSJ in a statement. “We see value in both MCX and Chase Pay,” Walmart’s spokesman added to the WSJ.

Published Nov 3rd, 2016 12:41 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas About two months into his new role as CEO of Walmart Global eCommerce, Marc Lore has seen several management changes, including at least three departures of high-ranking execs from the division based in San Bruno, Calif. Those departing are Neil Ashe, former president and CEO of Walmart Global eCommerce; Fernando Madeira, president and CEO of Walmart.com; and Diane Mills, a senior vice president of human resources for the eCommerce division. No departure date has been set for the executives because they are still working on projects, according to corporate spokesman Dan Toporek. Lore replaced Ashe as the division boss. “It’s a transitional time,” Toporek said, adding that many of the big structural pieces required for its e-commerce operations were now in place. Toperek told Talk Business & Politics Ashe and Maderia’s plans to leave were announced before Lore took over as CEO. The retailer confirmed that Brent Beabout, who oversaw the digital supply chain, left the company a few weeks ago. He will be replaced by Jet.com co-founder Nate Faust. Wal-Mart said the roles of the new team is being reshaped following the $3.3 billion Jet.com acquisition which was finalized last month. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said Aug. 8 that Ashe “has made great progress running and growing the business … re-platforming, nearly doubling the GMV (gross merchandise value) of online offerings, building a winning e-commerce team but now there is a natural inflection of leadership change.” McMillon also said the two brands — Walmart.com and Jet.com —will co-exist separately but be managed by Lore. He said Lore will take the best of both brands and blend improvements that benefit the entire company. Some of the first things analysts expect Lore to fix at Walmart.com is improved search capabilities and incorporating the popular customer pricing options as they fill their online baskets. McMillon said the pricing algorithm which adjusts as customers opt to buy in bulk or chose other low cost shipping options has helped Jet.com increase its average basket amount over the traditional online order. Jet.com’s average basket contains 6 items worth more than $80, compared to single items at most retailers. McMillon is also fond of the supplier relationships that Jet.com forged for its system. While some of the suppliers will likely never be a good fit for Wal-Mart’s everyday low price strategy, the retail giant may find areas to offer a wider variety of items online. Jet doubled its one-day delivery of first party products penetration rate from 25% to 50% of U.S. households since the site launched in 2014. Jet is approaching 99% of U.S. households for two-day delivery. In New York City Jet offers same-day delivery at no additional costs to its shoppers. Analysts now wonder what this might mean for Walmart’s $49 annual Shipping Pass service for two-day delivery. Jet is also making some headway in online grocery delivery as Walmart U.S. has been piloting the service in limited markets since 2014. Walmart announced in June plans to test online grocery delivery using Uber and Lyft in Denver and Phoenix. Jet is delivering fresh grocery only in select East Coast areas, but has plans to expand into more cities next year. Analysts wonder how Lore might change the retailers’ online grocery strategy. A criticism of Jet.com was that the online retailer was not making money. Lore said prior to the deal with Wal-Mart that Jet.com might not make money until 2020.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Walmart Black Friday 2016 IPad Mini 2 Deal Released Posted: Nov 3 2016, 10:01am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 3 2016, 12:10pm CDT, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   The iPad mini 2 is now $49 off in the early Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale. Walmart has launched the early Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale on November 1. Initially the retailer offered the Apple iPad mini 2 32GB Wi-Fi for $249.99, which is only $10 off the price this iPad sells from Apple directly. Now Walmart reduced the price to $219.99. With a price of $49 less than what Apple charges for the iPad mini 2, this is now a tempting deal. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals The iPad mini is a favorite item for Walmart to offer as a deal. The past two years, Walmart offered the iPad mini at a low price. Now the iPad mini 2 is Walmart's choice.  The Apple iPad mini 2is still in the official iPad line-up that Apple is offering. With a 7.9" Retina display, A7 chip with M7 motion coprocessor, Front and Back cameras, the iPad mini 2 is still a valid choice. It is ideal for casual use and as second screen while watching TV. It is also great for young kids. Walmart offers the iPad mini 2 32GB in white and space gray online at walmart.com for $219.99. Walmart's habbit using the original sales price of the iPad mini 2 as reference for calculating the savings is confusing. Apple has reduced the price of the iPad mini 2, at the time of the launch of the iPad mini 4. Walmart's stated $95.63 savings are not real. It's $49 compared to the current regular price of the iPad mini 2. At this point it is hard to predict if Walmart is cutting the price of the iPad mini 2 further closer to Black Friday. We have to wait for the highly anticipated Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad to find out. As many other retailers are releasing their Black Friday 2016 ad this week, there is a chance that Walmart is also releasing their ad before the Presidential election. Our initial release date prediction is November 11, based on past years. Find the best Walmart Black Friday 2016 deals on sale today in our Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals list.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Someone Just Bought Sony PS4 Pro At A Walmart Posted: Nov 3 2016, 12:25pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 3 2016, 1:43pm CDT, in News | Technology News   Credit: Juniper Roth Twitter   So much for waiting until November 10 for a Sony PS4 Pro. Why pre-order the Sony PS4 Pro and wait for its November 10, when you just can waltz into your local Walmart and buy one now? This is what person identified on Twitter as Juniper Roth in Tucson Arizona just did. He bought the $399 Sony PS4 Pro at his local Walmart and posted a bunch of photos of his new PS4 Pro. Don't Miss: Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Deals We have seen journalists showing off their PS4 Pro review units they received this week. Now the first Sony fan has his PS4 Pro in his hands. The Sony PS4 Pro comes with a 1TB hard-drive. The photos published by Juniper Roth show the HDD slot of the PS4 Pro and the drive itself amongst other details. The series of photos is mini unboxing. See the photos below. The Sony PS4 Pro features increased performance to handle 4K gameplay and HDR. Sony briefed several journalists on the PS4 Pro and showed the side-by-side comparisons of games running on PS4 and PS4 Pro. The difference is dramatic and well worth the $100 extra. Not only does the PS4 Pro improve the quality of 4K optimized games, but also games with lower resolution using a technique called checkerboard rendering. The Sony PS4 Pro will be in stores that follow street dates on Thursday November 10. You can try your local Walmart if you can get them to sell you the PS4 Pro now. They have it in their storage already. So far we have not seen a PS4 Pro Black Friday deal and we do not anticipate to see one. It also looks like that Sony is not even offering a PS4 Pro Bundle for the Holidays. Based on the first released Black Friday 2016 ads there are also no new PS4 Slim bundles. Sony is not seeing the need to match Microsoft's Xbox One S Holiday bundle bonanza. Update: See the latest tweets from Juniper Roth below. The owner of the PS4 Pro is taking questions via Twitter.

The digital wallet will be integrated into the Walmart app for in-store purchases, allowing Chase Visa credit and debit cardholders to pay at the checkout by showing a QR code to the cashier. Chase Pay will also be added to Walmart's website next year, allowing customers to make online purchases while earning rewards and receiving offers. The service secures transactions with token technology, which utilizes one-time complex codes to process transactions and keep card information secure. Chase Pay differs from Apple Pay, which uses contactless NFC technology and is secured with Touch ID in addition to tokenization. Walmart has so far refused to adopt Apple Pay, opting for QR code payments services like Walmart Pay and Chase Pay instead. The retailer has said it is open to supporting other digital wallets in the future. Chase Pay was created in partnership with MCX, the consortium behind the indefinitely postponed payments service CurrentC. Walmart was a leading member of MCX between 2012 and 2015, when the consortium's three-year exclusivity window expired. In 2014, Walmart explicitly said it would not accept Apple Pay. Walmart's app is a free download on the App Store [Direct Link] for iPhone.

Chase Pay is currently live on “select merchant websites”, JPMorgan Chase says, but the service “will launch for mobile payments at participating merchant registers and a form of payment in select merchant apps later this year”. “We are excited about the opportunity to provide our customers with even greater convenience and value to our Walmart Pay app,” says Mike Cook, senior vice president and assistant treasurer for Walmart. “Adding Chase Pay as an option within Walmart Pay and online will create an enhanced experience for our customers.” Walmart Pay was unveiled in December 2015 and went live for iPhone users in April 2016, before completing a nationwide rollout in July this year. Chase Pay was unveiled during Money20/20 in Las Vegas in October 2015.

The progressive creep of the holiday shopping season has reached its largest point this year, with the first sales now starting shortly after the calendar turns to November. Shoppers looking for Black Friday 2016 sales already know what they’ll be getting from the e-commerce giant Amazon, which has released thousands of sale items and some special offers. Walmart has also started releasing some of its pre-Black Friday 2016 deals, a preview of the sales that will kick in at Thanksgiving. Amazon launched its Black Friday 2016 sales this week, listing tens of thousands of items with deep discounts through its Black Friday Deals Store. The store will remain open through December 22, with expanded options for how shoppers can order. The site will be offering a $5 gift card for those who buy one of the exclusive deals through Alexa voice shopping, for example. “This holiday season, we’re offering more deals than ever before and — for the first time ever — giving Prime members an opportunity to use Alexa voice shopping for purchasing their holiday gifts hands-free,” Doug Herrington, the senior vice president of North American Retail at Amazon, said in a statement (via Fox News). There are some other special offers to entice shoppers to Amazon this holiday shopping season. Members of Amazon Prime also get a 20 percent discount on pre-order and new release video games, Fox News noted. And shoppers who might need a bit of help finding the right present can check out the more than 20 gift guides offered by Amazon for Black Friday 2016.

The Black Friday 2016 ad has also leaked from Sam’s Club, BGR reported. Although the retailer hasn’t released all its details, the site noted that there will be deals on the iPhone 7 and other electronics. Below are some of the best Black Friday offerings from Sam’s Club (via BGR). $249 PlayStation 4 Uncharted 4 bundle (save $50) $249 Xbox One S Battlefield 1 bundle (save $104) $548 60-inch Vizio 4K UHD SmartCast Home Theater Display TV (Save $400) $299 55-inch JVC Class 4K UHD TV (save $100 – online only) $348 50-inch Vizio 4K UHD SmartCast Home Theater Display TV (Save $250) $129.88 Fitbit Charge 2 (save $20) $99.86 Fitbit Alta with extra band bundle (save $30) There had been some concern among retail experts that Black Friday 2016 shopping might see a dip in enthusiasm, especially with the huge number of online deals cropping up. Howard Davidowitz, the head of retail consultancy and investment banking firm Davidowitz & Associates, told CBS News that Amazon’s early Black Friday sales could lead an even bigger push for shoppers to stay at home rather than fighting the crowds on Black Friday. “In the retail business what you are always looking for is how to get the jump on your competitors – that’s the game,” Davidowitz said. “Now, here is the price leader, the fastest-growing retailer in the United States — they’re getting the jump on everybody. I think it’s brilliant they are going to capture even more market share this way.” While Amazon may be capturing the early attention ahead of the holiday shopping season, the more traditional brick-and-mortar retailers will be getting their turn soon. Eric Jones of the website BestBlackFriday.com told CBS News that the major stores have yet to leak their Black Friday 2016 ads, and those doorbuster sales are likely to generate just as much excitement this year as they have in the past.

Henning  BAY CITY, MI — On parole for less than a month, a Bay City man opted to risk his freedom by stealing some "The Walking Dead" DVDs from a Walmart. The gamble didn't pay off, as he's now heading back to prison. Bay County Circuit Judge Harry P. Gill on Monday, Oct. 31, sentenced David M. Henning, 23, to 18 months to five years in prison. Henning is to begin chipping away at the term after he serves the remainder of his paroled term. The judge also ordered Henning to pay $258 in court fines and costs. Henning in September pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree retail fraud. In exchange, the prosecution dismissed a charge of unarmed robbery, a 15-year offense. The charges stem from Bay County sheriff's deputies on the evening of July 21 responding to the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road in Bangor Township for a shoplifting complaint. Upon deputies' arrival, Walmart staff told them they observed a man and a woman stealing items. As they attempted to stop the culprits near the building's front doors, the male subject — Henning — shoved a male employee, court records show. Police allege Bay City man threatened to blow up food business The male employee grabbed Henning in a bear hug and another employee reached into a large, leopard-print bag Henning was carrying and retrieved numerous stolen items. The male employee eventually released Henning as Henning continued to struggle, court records show. Henning then went to his 19-year-old female companion, took her car keys, ran outside, and drove away in her car, court records show. The woman remained at the store and gave a statement to police, saying she only knew her cohort as "John" and that she brought him to Walmart to steal property, court records show. She added her cohort had gone on other recent Walmart shoplifting expeditions — stealing a Nerf gun in one — without getting caught. Among the items the pair stole were bobby pins, five CDs, five "The Walking Dead" DVD sets, "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" and "Empire" DVD sets, "Insurgent," "Allegiance," and "Divergent" DVDs and blonde hair dye, all totaling $254.33, court records show. Police later located the woman's vehicle at Henning's Bay City residence and noticed a leopard print bag inside it, court records show. With the property owner's permission, police searched the home and found Henning hiding underneath a pile of clothes, court records show. After being read his Miranda rights, Henning initially declined to speak with police but soon changed his mind. He said he went to Walmart to steal items and struggled with an employee, though he knew he shouldn't have. He further told deputies he has a problem with impulsive stealing and goes to classes for it, court records show. Henning on Monday, July 25, appeared in Bay County District Court for arraignment on one count of unarmed robbery. The charge is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Lengthy criminal history Henning's rap sheet includes other offenses that occurred at Walmart. In January 2015, he stole Xbox games "Grand Theft Auto IV" and "Sniper Ghost Warrior" from the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road in Bangor Township. On his way out of the store, he engaged in a scuffle with a loss-prevention officer. He ended up pleading guilty to second-degree retail fraud in exchange for the prosecution's dismissal of an unarmed robbery charge. In February, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail with credit for 52 days served. Two months later, a Bay County judge sentenced Henning to three years probation on a conviction of malicious destruction of a building between $1,000 and $20,000 for a crime he committed on Jan. 5 of that year. Bay City man pleads guilty to misdemeanor in Xbox game theft, 15-year felony dismissed In August 2015, Henning called Bay County Central Dispatch and said he was going to blow up T&M Bosco Distributing Co. at 407 11th St. Police searched the area and found no explosive devices. Police believed Henning had called in similar prank threats the previous year. "I made the call," Henning told police. "I used an old Obama phone that I had before I went to jail. I told the person that I was going to blow up Bosco's. Once I realized it was 911, I hung up the phone. I don't know why I did it." Henning was charged with a four-year felony count of false report or threat of a bomb or harmful device. On Dec. 7, 2015, Henning was sentenced to 16 months to five years in prison on the vandalism conviction for which he previously received probation. The Michigan Department of Corrections paroled him on Tuesday, June 28.

That Walmart closed during the winter, affecting around 130 employees.  "I know that the building has sold," Stephanie Addair, McDowell County Economic Development Authority executive director, said. "And back in May, I did have a conversation with the West Virginia Development Office. My representative is Chris Pauley. There were several companies that were looking at the building." The deed shows Walmart sold the building to Kimball ABG LLC, a company based in Illinois, for $175,000 on September 14. The address of Kimball ABG on the document also shows that's where Rural King, a farm and home company, is located.  Addair couldn't confirm that Rural King is the store replacing the Walmart building. But she did say the move is expected to bring more jobs to the area, regardless. "That was also a store people shopped at that we lost," Addair said. "And I think, you know, we need more things in our community to the citizens who live here." The vacant Walmart building behind me, has been out of commission since January. No representatives from Rural King we spoke with were able to confirm it's the store moving in to the building.   The corporate media contact from Rural King has also not returned our calls.

(Al Hartmann | The Salt Lake Tribune) The old Granite High School at 3300 S. 500 E. in South Salt Lake remains boarded up in July. A prominent developerís deal to buy the old property has been extended and a new development plan is in the works. Garbett Homes and Wasatch Property's previous plan included 78 homes and a retail center anchored by a neighborhood Wal-Mart grocery store and would have put $10.6 million in Granite School Districtís coffers. Residents reluctant to back residential plan that doesn’t include details on commercial half of site. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) The South Salt Lake Planning Commission is expected to vote Nov. 17 on a new proposal to develop the southern half of the old Granite High School property. But the plan got 3½ hours of attention at the commission's meeting Thursday, where about 25 residents chimed in. A plan to develop the site of the closed century-old school with homes and a Wal-Mart grocery store on the northern portion died at the hands of a mayoral veto in March. Now, Garbett Homes has revived the deal with a proposal that focuses only on the less-controversial residential half of the lot. Garbett Homes has applied to change the land use to get started on construction of about 80 homes near 3540 S. 500 East. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The developer says the homes will imitate the style and solar capability of homes in the nearby Terra Sol development and feature a 1-acre park. The commission's feedback to Garbett Homes: The proposed park doesn't meet city standards for green space, and the commission also thinks it could be better situated to serve the larger public. Community Development Director Michael Florence says some of the speakers from the public liked the plan, and some listed lack of green space and wanting to preserve the property's history as concerns. Most opponents brought grievances from the old plan. Residents hesitated to back a plan that didn't specify what would happen to the commercial northern half of the old school site. "We made it clear to the Planning Commission that they had to consider the merits of the project that was in front of them, because the north half wasn't part of this project," said Florence.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS Police: Multiple stabbings at Mountain View High School, suspect in custody Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Democrat Elijah Cummings presses Jason Chaffetz to investigate Donald Trump's finances Denying polygamists' religious argument, judge propels food stamp fraud case toward trial Utah counties seeking to give money to restore busted Colorado swinging bridge Utah lawmaker changes LGBT leader's mind, clears committee on way to becoming judge Poll reveals mixed feelings on Utah's 'Zion Curtain' law as restaurants plan new effort to tear down ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Times Community News Daily Pilot Weekend Nifty '50s hair curlers meet the 21st century Don Leach / Weekend A single Spoolies hair curler. A single Spoolies hair curler. (Don Leach / Weekend) Karen Robes Meeks In a large manufacturing plant in San Clemente, the product that took Jeanne James seven years to conceptualize and perfect began to take shape. Through a large window facing the manufacturing floor, James watched as a worker loosened hundreds of pink silicone Spoolies hair curlers from a steel mold and inspected them before placing them in bins. On any given day, roughly 6,000 curlers are made. For the South County resident, it's been a labor of love to develop the retro curler into a modern user-friendly product that is now being sold at 400 Wal-Mart stores across the country. "This isn't just a hair curler to me," said James, who serves as founder and CEO of the San Juan Capistrano-based business. "This needs to be a quality part that is just right and works well and measures right. It's very much a part of who I am." Don Leach / Weekend Spoolies Hair Curlers founder Jeanne James in the company's San Clemente factory. Spoolies Hair Curlers founder Jeanne James in the company's San Clemente factory. (Don Leach / Weekend) Created in the 1950s, the original Spoolies hair curlers allowed women to wrap their hair around rubber-based spools around and "sleep in comfort," resulting in "perfect pin curls" by morning. James' association with the original Spoolies dates back to her childhood in Missouri, where she was the lone straight-haired girl in an extended family of curly heads. "Everybody had curly, wavy hair but me," she said. "[My mother] wanted me to fit in, so she would give me an old-fashioned perm. You could smell it in your hair for at least a week." Spoolies gave James an excuse to forgo the smelly perms and please her mother, so she wore them every night.

(Don Leach / Weekend) Fast forward to 1995, when she and her husband were in Kenya for their church and their charity, Children's Health Education and Leadership Project. There she was moved by the Kenyan girls who weren't given educational opportunities because of how expensive it was to send them to school. "Ever since we left Kenya in 1996, it was engraved in my mind that these sweet Kenyan girls weren't going to get an opportunity to have an education," she said. "I can't help everyone, but maybe I can help a few, and the best way is to create a business. What can I do that I would love to be involved in and also help to benefit these girls?" After doing charity work in Spain, the couple returned to the U.S. in 2003 and James began researching a business. "I actually prayed about it, and I was just putting it out there that this is something I would really like to do for these girls," she said. She remembered Spoolies hair curlers and searched online to find out that Conair gave up the trademark a year earlier. So she applied for it and acquired it three years later. She worked to modernize the product, making it more pliable, heat-resistant and creating it out of silicone instead of rubber. She holds the utility and design patents for the Spoolies curler. "It was a lot of trial and error," she said. "I had to learn a lot about manufacturing. Manufacturing is still very much a man's world. When you show up at a manufacturing plant with a part from the '50s and say, 'Can I make this?' You don't get a call back. You can't come unprepared. You have to respect it." Don Leach / W Rows of new Spoolies hair curlers rest on a table. Rows of new Spoolies hair curlers rest on a table. (Don Leach / W) She immersed herself in the manufacturing world, hiring engineers to do two-and three-dimensional drawing of her curler. She attended trade shows and spoke to manufacturers about the molding process and what kinds of materials they used. She had prototypes made. "You have to prove yourself, especially as a woman, that you're sincere and you really want to make this product," she said. "By the time I got to [my current] manufacturing company [in 2014], I knew exactly what I wanted to do." James is seeing the work finally paying off for the company, which incorporated in 2014. Spoolies was one of a handful of businesses to receive a trendsetter award and prime placement at Cosmoprof North America, a major trade show that allow beauty manufacturers and entrepreneurs the ability to meet with industry buyers, distributors, retail buyers and salon and spa owners. "​Spoolies was really well-received by the market as it fits in with the trend of styling the hair without heat damage," said Daniela Ciocan, Cosmoprof North America Marketing Director. "Both the media and the buyers loved the product especially since it's a refresh of a true and tested product popular in the '60s that actually works. And you can use it even with dry hair and no heat is necessary to give you wavy healthy hair." That spurred interest from international buyers and from Wal-Mart. After meeting with two buyers in June to pitch Spoolies at Walmart's Open Call for U.S. products in Bentonville, Ark., James' curlers —the smaller pink curlers and the blue jumbo curlers — are being sold or about to be sold in some 400 Wal-Marts in the U.S. "Our customers are telling us that where a product is made matters," said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart's vice president of U.S. Manufacturing. "Second, we know there are some great advantages that come with a shorter supply chain when you can make your items closer to where you sell them such as cost reductions and potential job creation opportunities." The company in 2013 committed more than $250 billion toward purchasing U.S.-made products and has been holding summits to attract home-grown businesses. "Spoolies is one of those great examples," Marsiglio said. "We're proud of them and looking forward to seeing how the product does." That product visibility is huge for her company, which expected business to grow exponentially in the coming years, James said. "The possibilities are great for a small company like us," she said. "As the curlers are selling, I hope they sell welland expand our products to other stores." As for her efforts to support Kenyan girls, James already is making good on that promise. She recently purchased laptops and beds for a dorm that can accommodate 50 girls. "I would love Spoolies to grow to be able to help a lot of girls around the world," James said.

So have employees of utilities and telecom firms. Finally, after years of stagnant pay, more American workers are receiving meaningful raises — a trend driven home by the government's October jobs report. Average hourly pay surged 10 cents an hour last month to an average of $25.92, the government reported Friday. That's 2.8 percent higher than it was a year ago, the sharpest 12-month increase since 2009. The job market appears much healthier now, a sign that the plodding seven-year recovery is now providing some critical relief for workers. ___ Wal-Mart sets environmental plan as people seek green items NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart is laying out its environmental map for the next several years as it tries to satisfy customers who want green products at affordable prices. The world's largest retailer says it will seek to reduce emissions in its own operations by 18 percent by 2025, and work toward adding no waste to landfills in key markets like Canada and the United States. It also plans to be powered by 50 percent clean and renewable energy sources. Wal-Mart's goals, announced Friday by CEO Doug McMillon, follow a plan set in 2005 as the company sought to deflect criticism of its practices and burnish its image. ___ S&P 500 index marks its longest losing streak in 36 years NEW YORK (AP) — The slow, steady retreat of the stock market ahead of the 2016 election continued Friday, with the market falling for a ninth straight day. Wall Street is now in its longest period of decline in more than three decades. Investors continue to focus on the U.S. presidential election, which has become too close for comfort for some investors and has put the market on the defensive. The last time the S&P 500 fell for nine straight days is December 1980, nearly 36 years ago. Ronald Reagan wasn't even president yet. ___ US trade deficit in September at lowest level in 19 months WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit fell in September to the lowest level in 19 months as demand for U.S.-made airplanes and other exports increased while imports slipped. The politically sensitive deficit with China declined. The deficit narrowed to $36.4 billion in September, down 9.9 percent from August, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the lowest imbalance since February 2015. The latest report offers American manufacturers an encouraging sign that the problems caused by overseas weakness and a rising dollar were beginning to wane. ___ Samsung, after phone recall, recalls 3M washing machines Nearly 3 million Samsung washing machines are being recalled in the U.S. following multiple injuries — including a broken jaw — due to "excessive vibration." Samsung is the South Korean company that last month was forced to recall millions of its of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after batteries inside began to overheat and catch fire. Safety officials cited 733 reports of malfunctioning, top-loading washing machines and nine injuries, including the broken jaw and an injured shoulder. The recall Friday affects 34 models of washing machines manufactured between 2011 and this year. ___ Buffett's firm's 3Q profit drops 24 pct on investments value OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported a 24 percent drop in third-quarter profit on Friday because last year's results were helped by a huge paper gain on the value of its Kraft Heinz Food Co. stake. The conglomerate billionaire Warren Buffett leads posted solid results at most of the more than 90 companies it owns as it reported net income of $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per Class A share, in the quarter. That's down from $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per A share, a year ago when it recorded a $4.4 billion after-tax gain after Kraft and Heinz merged. ___ Icahn takes an even larger stake in Herbalife NEW YORK (AP) — Billionaire Carl Icahn is extending a years-long proxy fight with co-billionaire Bill Ackman, upping his stake in Herbalife yet again. The two have been battling over the legitimacy of the supplements and weight loss company since 2012, when Ackman called Herbalife a pyramid scheme and revealed a massive bet against it. A regulatory filing this week shows that Icahn upped the stakes again, pushing his ownership from 20.8 percent, up to 23.1 percent. He's the California company's biggest stakeholder. At $54.70 per share, Icahn put another $100 million plus into Herbalife on Thursday. ___ EU Commission holds up DuPont-Dow merger review WASHINGTON (AP) — The EU Commission reviewing the proposed merger of agriculture and chemicals companies DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical has put its work on hold as it waits for more information from the companies. The commission in August had expressed concern it could harm competition in the crop protection, seeds and petrochemicals sectors. DuPont and Dow agreed to merge in December in an all-stock deal then valued at about $62 billion. Shareholders for DuPont and Dow approved the merger in July. A Dow spokesperson said the Midland, Michigan company expects the merger to be completed in the first quarter of 2017, pending regulatory approvals. ___ UK's May seeks to keep Brexit plan going despite setback LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Theresa May sought Friday to reassure European Union leaders that her timetable for Britain to leave the EU remains intact despite a court ruling requiring British lawmakers to have more of a say in the process. She telephoned Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU's top official, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to say her plan is still to start the process to remove Britain from the EU by the end of March. Officials say she will also call French President Francois Hollande and European Council President Donald Tusk. In Berlin, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said the court ruling should not interfere with the government's Brexit timetable. ___ Egypt devalues, floats its currency, meeting key IMF demand CAIRO (AP) — Egypt on Thursday took the unprecedented step of floating its currency and later hiked fuel prices, meeting key demands by the International Monetary Fund under a $12 billion loan agreement to overhaul the ailing economy of the most populous Arab state. The floatation, accompanied by a 48 percent devaluation of the Egyptian pound, is the boldest economic measure taken by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi since his election in 2014. El-Sissi has often asserted that tough times lie ahead as the country struggles with an array of economic woes, from double-digit inflation to unemployment and an acute foreign currency shortage. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.39 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,888.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 3.48 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,085.18. The Nasdaq composite lost 12.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,046.37. Benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 59 cents to $44.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 77 cents to $45.58 a barrel in London. Heating oil fell 3 cents to $1.43 a gallon, wholesale gasoline fell 4.5 cents to $1.38 a gallon and natural gas futures fell less than 1 cent to $2.767 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Waiting until the start of the season doesn't seem to be too smart of an idea either, but what the heck? Here's one man's early predictions for March Madness, which is four months and approximately 10,500 games away. This won't be a line-by-line breakdown, but rather a cut-and-run look at what might happen. EARLY ROUNDS: The first question always is, will a 16 seed beat a No. 1 for the first time? Not this season. There just doesn't seem to be any champions from the low Division I conferences that can pull the monumental upset. Watch Texas Southern of the Southwestern Athletic Conference be the one that scares a tournament favorite. There has to be a No. 12 beating a 5 (it's not in the rule book, but close) and this year's dandy dozen will be Princeton. The Tigers are a veteran team that should emerge from the Ivy League and then ruin the tournament for a possible 5 seed like Rhode Island. The other could be No. 12 Belmont of the Ohio Valley Conference against a Big 12 team like Texas. For those fans of close seedings, the 8-9 games are always entertaining and usually close. Four 8-9 winners could be Notre Dame, Iowa State, San Diego State and Colorado. Of those four winners, watch for Notre Dame and Iowa State to knock off No. 1 seeds Kansas and Villanova, meaning no repeat champion. REGIONAL ROUNDS: Having sent two No. 1s home early, it will be Duke and North Carolina carrying on the mantle for the favorites. The No. 2 seeds in Kansas and Villanova's brackets are Oregon and Kentucky and they move on to the regional finals where they both lose, the Ducks to West Virginia and the Wildcats to Louisville in the most-hyped game of the tournament and one that is the epitome of an intrastate rivalry. Duke and North Carolina knock off No. 4 seeds UCLA and Michigan State to reach the Final Four as No. 1 seeds. It's Wisconsin and Virginia moving on to the Final Four with the wins over Oregon and Kentucky. FINAL FOUR: Despite the pleas of many, the Final Four will be held in Glendale, Arizona, rather than moving it to Tobacco Road for the Blue Devils against the Tar Heels. Virginia, which gives the Atlantic Coast Conference three teams in the national semifinals, beats Wisconsin in a defensive battle. Duke finds a way to beat the Tar Heels, with the freshmen playing a huge role for Mike Krzyzewski. An all-ACC matchup between Duke and Virginia goes to the Blue Devils, title No. 7 for Coach K.

They told her they had a warrant for her arrest. It was 2007, and months prior, Pinyard wrote a bad check to purchase groceries at Walmart. “I was young, and I was stupid. I was trying to feed my family,” she said. "Was I wrong? Yes. But am I still wrong? No.” Pinyard spent the night in jail and was later found guilty of felony grand theft and sentenced to 1½ year's probation. Fast forward 10 years, and Pinyard is still paying for her crime. She's among 1.7 million people who’ve been permanently stripped of their voting rights due to a felony conviction, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Sentencing Project. No other state makes it harder to get rights restored — it takes years, and only a fraction of clemency applications are granted. NAPLES DAILY NEWS 2016 Poll Tracker - USA TODAY In a state like Florida where elections are decided by the smallest of margins, the consequences could be huge for both parties. The new registrations could lead to voters who could push either party's candidate over in a tight race. Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton are virtually tied in Florida polls leading up to Election Day, so every vote will matter. NAPLES DAILY NEWS Elections 2016 | Naples Daily News Florida's election history is rich with races that have been decided by a small number. In 2000, Al Gore's loss to George W. Bush by 537 votes decided the presidency. Even in 2012, President Barack Obama scraped past former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by just 74,309 votes. Gov. Rick Scott won his two elections by just over 60,000 votes each. “This election, more than any other election, it means something,” said Pinyard, 40, of Ocala. With a son and two young daughters, one of whom's autistic, she said she’s worried about how they’d fare growing up under a President Trump whose rhetoric she finds offensive. “The fact that I have a choice here and I could make a difference, it irritates me. It really, really irritates me. I have a birth-given right to vote, and it’s being taken away from me.” Criminal disenfranchisement laws across the U.S.  (Photo: Courtesy of the Brennan Center for Justice) Related link: See an interactive map showing disenfranchisement laws across the United States. Florida's history of limiting the civil rights of felons is rooted in the state's constitution, written after the Civil War. Scott rewrote the rules surrounding clemency after taking office in 2011, making Florida the toughest state in the country for felons to regain their voting rights. Scott argues the clemency process should be part of a felon’s rehabilitation. He says it takes time for people to prove they’ve changed. “We want people to turn their lives around, and if you have, come before the clemency board and show that you did,” he told the Daily News. The majority of states allow felons to vote once they’ve completed their prison sentence, parole or probation. Maine, Vermont and Puerto Rico let people vote while in prison. Florida, Iowa and Kentucky are the only states that require felons to apply to have their rights restored. Iowa and Kentucky, however, are far more lenient. From 2011-15, 93 percent of clemency applications in Iowa and 86 percent in Kentucky were approved, according to each state’s governor’s office. During that same time period in Florida, 8 percent, or 2,014, were approved. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who serves on the clemency board, is a strong proponent of Scott's policy. "Out of fairness to law abiding citizens and victims of crime, the Attorney General does not support automatic restoration of civil rights without some type of review," Bondi's press office wrote in a statement. NAPLES DAILY NEWS Federal judge OK with how Florida is registering voters The power to reinstate civil rights to felons is vested in Florida’s clemency board, made up of Scott and three Cabinet members — Bondi, Commissioner of Agriculture & Consumer Services Adam Putnam and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater. To grant restoration of civil rights, the governor must agree with two Cabinet members; however, the governor has the sole power to deny clemency. Restoration of civil rights includes the right to vote, sit on a jury, hold public office and take the Florida bar. Restoration of the right to possess a firearm is a separate form of clemency that requires a different application. So few felons have had their rights restored during Scott's term that others have stopped applying. Requests for restoration of civil rights under Scott have decreased by nearly 95 percent from former Gov. Charlie Crist's administration, according to data from the Florida Commission on Offender Review, the state agency that administers clemency applications. During Crist's term, 384,786 clemency applications were received, while just 22,161 felons applied during Scott's first term. The number of applications continued to fall off in 2014 and 2015, with just over 2,000 each year, according to agency records. Buy Photo Applications for restoration of civil rights in Florida from 2011 to 2015.  (Photo: Naples Daily News) Florida is the only state where felons must wait an additional five to seven years after completing their sentence, which includes parole and probation, before they’re eligible to apply to have their rights restored. Offenders must be crime-free during those years, and the application is tedious. Felons must obtain certified copies of the charging document, judgment and sentence for each of their felony convictions, which can be extremely difficult for people whose crimes were committed decades ago. Once submitted, the application takes several years to process. Offenders who have committed more serious crimes must travel to Tallahassee for an in-person hearing before the clemency board. If rejected, applicants must wait two years before reapplying. Shorter applications led to more requests for clemency in Iowa. Applications there nearly doubled after the state reduced the number of questions by more than half in April, according to data from the Iowa governor's office. While Iowa saw spikes in applications during election years, requests for clemency in the past few months have increased more than in prior election years before the application had been streamlined. For felons seeking clemency in Florida, it hasn’t always been this tough. Crist restored civil rights to 155,000 felons during his four-year term, and Republican Jeb Bush granted nearly 77,000 felons clemency during his eight years as Florida governor. As of Oct. 5, Scott had restored voting rights to 2,339 felons. Under Crist the civil rights of nonviolent felons who had completed all conditions of their sentence — including satisfying parole, probation, court fees, and victim restitution requirements — were automatically restored. Of the 155,000 felons who were granted clemency under Crist, 25 percent registered to vote in the 2012 general election, according to a study conducted by University of Pennsylvania professor Marc Meredith and Harvard doctoral candidate Michael Morse. The researchers matched felon clemency data to voter files to find 59 percent registered as Democrats, 18 percent registered as Republicans and 23 percent as independent or third party. Crist, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, claims when he championed the automatic restoration of civil rights for felons while running for governor as a Republican in 2006, then-GOP Attorney General Bill McCollum and other party leaders called to express disappointment over his decision. “They thought it would open a floodgate to the Democratic vote, and they didn’t want that,” said Crist, who is running for a St. Petersburg-based congressional seat as a Democrat. McCollum denies the allegations, saying that, though he disagrees with automatic restoration of civil rights, his stance has nothing to do with politics. When Scott took office in 2011, he created an application process for felons, set a five- to seven-year waiting period to apply and required applicants to obtain certified court documents. Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, said it was somewhat unexpected when Scott and Bondi “immediately took a reflex tough on crime position” and reversed Crist’s policy. “He had never articulated there was a problem with the policy Crist had set up,” Mauer said. Orlando resident Desmond Meade leads Floridians for a Fair Democracy and is president of the felon assistance group Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. He said felons struggle with enough issues, including housing and employment, as they try to reintegrate into society. Scott is creating another barrier by making it more difficult to obtain their fundamental right of citizenship — the right to vote. “Once a person has a stake in their community, they’re going to become and remain a contributing member of society,” Meade said. Meade, who served time for a series of drug possession crimes in the early 2000s, said he was denied clemency for failing to meet the waiting period requirements and was too “disheartened” to reapply. “The more inclusive democracy is the more vibrant democracy,” he said. “I should not have to leave the state to enjoy citizenship, not in 2016.” He and other ex-offenders point to Tuesday's high-stakes election, stressing that their votes, more than ever, deserve to be counted. Buy Photo Fort Myers resident Neil Volz, right, gathered signatures for a ballot initiative at a Donald Trump rally at the Collier County Fairgrounds on Oct. 23, 2016. The initiative would place the issue of felon voting on the ballot in 2018. Volz was involved in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal in 2005 for which he was charged with criminal conspiracy and sentenced to two years’ probation.  (Photo: Annika Hammerschlag/Naples Daily News) “I’m such a big believer in this experiment we call self-government, and not to be involved is one of the tougher things for me to embrace and accept as I continue to move forward with my life,” said Neil Volz, the former chief of staff to Congressman Bob Ney, R-Ohio. Volz was involved in the 2005 Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, for which he was charged with criminal conspiracy and sentenced to two years’ probation. “I made a bunch of stupid, selfish decisions, and I accept the consequences,” he said. But the fact he continues to pay for his decisions nearly two decades later, he says, isn’t right. Volz, who now lives in Fort Myers, works for a local nonprofit that helps homeless people and in his free time volunteers with Meade for the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. Volz, who applied for clemency in 2011 and hasn’t heard back, has been collecting signatures for a referendum that would put the issue of felon voting on the ballot for 2018. Any future changes are too late for Pinyard, the Ocala mother who served her time for a bad check. She applied to have her rights restored in 2011 after Scott changed the rules to require her and other nonviolent felons to wait five years after completing their probation. The waiting period rendered Pinyard’s application ineligible, and she was denied. As Election Day nears, she feels helpless, she said. “I just hope someone up there wakes up and realizes that people make mistakes. But people do change,” she said. “We have a voice, and our voice counts too.” Daily News staff writers Alex Glorioso and Arek Sarkissian contributed reporting to this story.  113 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://nplsne.ws/2f2iC1o TOP VIDEOS Daily Scoop for Nov. 15, 2016 1:19 Daily Scoop for Nov. 14, 2016 1:21 Beach erosion threatens the economy of Cape San Blas 2:52 Kristallnacht 1:48 Veterans play softball against Seacrest Country Day School 0:47 Anti-Trump March and Protest in downtown Miami 0:58 Fiance waits for WWII soldier's return 2:57 Veterans enjoy their day with free food at Bob Evans 0:52 Behind the Headlines: Cures for political hangover 25:30 Coming up on Sunday’s Behind the Headlines 1:10 More Stories Shrinking Shores: Florida reneges on pledges to its beaches Nov. 15, 2016, 8:31 a.m. 'We're not going anywhere': Millennials march against Trump Nov. 15, 2016, 7:55 a.m. Giuliani the favorite as Trump weighs secretary of state Nov. 15, 2016, 7:43 a.m. Google to pull ads from fake news sites Nov. 15, 2016, 9:43 a.m.

The comedian has forgiven Kevin Roper, the Walmart truck driver who caused a massive accident in the summer 2014 that seriously injured Morgan and killed his comic friend James McNair. “I forgave him, and I’m not even mad at him no more,” Morgan said on Thursday’s episode of “Conan.” In the spring of 2015, Morgan settled his lawsuit with the mega company saying, “Walmart did right by me and my family, and for my associates and their families.” Fellow comedian Damon Wayans claims Morgan got $90 million in his settlement. Ever the ready for the punchline, Morgan, 47, added to Conan O’Brien, “But you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbors.” Morgan imagined his neighbors saying, “’If you wouldn’t have hit his ass, he wouldn’t be living next door to me!’” Now with a few extra dollars in his account, Morgan is sure to drive his Lamborghini slowly, at 30 miles per hour, through his neighborhood. “They ain’t never seen a black motherf—ker in a Lamborghini,” he laughed. Roper, who had been up for 28 straight hours leading to the fatal crash, pled not guilty to aggravated manslaughter, vehicular homicide and aggravated assault in February 2016. The defense and prosecution are expected to meet in court again on Nov. 9.

Photos Fashion Shopping Music Movies TV Share < br />this article: Tracy Morgan Forgave the Truck Driver Who Hit Him in 2014  Scott Baumgartner | November 4, 2016 - 1:37 pm Share < br />this article: Tracy Morgan Believes He Visited Heaven While in Coma and More Celebrity News We’ve rounded up some of the best stories of the day featuring news... MORE >> Tracy Morgan dropped by Conan O’Brien’s late-night talk show where discussed his tour bus’s collision with a Walmart tractor trailer in 2014 that injured him and claimed the life of his friend James McNair, stating that he’s ready to forgive and more on. “I forgave him,” the 47-year-old actor said. “I’m not even made at him no more, but you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbors.” Morgan explained that, after his near-fatal accident, he decided to move and, according to him, his new neighbors aren’t thrilled about his arrival. “If you wouldn’t have hit his ass, he wouldn’t be living next door to me!” he joked from the perspective of the residents who live near him. 12 Controversial Comedians: Daniel Tosh, Kathy Griffin and More 12 Photos » After the highly-publicized accident, Morgan received a settlement from Walmart in 2015. Although the exact amount was not revealed, it was reportedly substantial. Morgan got his new aforementioned home as well as a new top-of-the-line ride — a Lamborghini. When O’Brien asked how fast he goes in in his new sports car, Morgan replied: “30 miles per hour, so everybody in the neighborhood can see it. They ain’t never seen a black motherfucker in a Lamborghini.” “I don’t do speed,” Morgan told the cheering audience. “Speed is for kids.” Check out the clip above.

The shareholder, among the company’s 10 biggest, raised its concerns in recent meetings with activist investment funds after losing patience with the company’s direction, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. The investor cited Whole Foods’ poor inventory and vendor management, high costs and failure to make the most of its unique appeal to millennial shoppers among the key issues. Several activist investors, who asked not to be named, said they are aware of the shareholder’s suggestions and are studying Whole Foods carefully. It’s unclear if any has begun accumulating a position in the Austin, Texas-based company, which has a market value of about $8.9 billion. “Whole Foods Market values the strong and open relationships we have with our shareholders,” Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail Friday. “As discussed on Wednesday’s earnings call, we are focused on pursuing the right strategies to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term.” Shares of Whole Foods rose 2.7 percent to $29.22 at 12:42 p.m. in New York after being temporarily halted. The stock has suffered a steep decline, falling by half from a 2015 high of $57.20. The company said Wednesday it will end its longstanding practice of having dual chief executive officers, naming co-founder and co-CEO John Mackey to serve as sole CEO starting Dec. 31. Larger mainstream grocers, including Kroger Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., continue to advance on Whole Foods’ organic turf, weighing on sales. Kroger has a market value of about $29 billion and Wal-Mart is valued at about $214 billion. Whole Foods is trying to fight back by offering more discounts and starting a new chain aimed at younger shoppers. Organic products have become widely available at U.S. stores, often at lower prices than Whole Foods offers. Food deflation hasn’t helped the company, as other retailers slash prices amid falling costs for items like beef and eggs. Whole Foods has said its new chain, called 365, will add to 1,200 conventional stores it already plans to build. That forecast was issued in 2013, shortly after the stock reached its all-time high of $65.24. Analysts have since questioned whether there’s capacity for more high-end organic grocers in the U.S. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Bob Rupcich of Bailey Court had compiled a 19-page report citing alleged violations of the city of Princeton Land Development Code with Breck Loos of Sterling wanting to use a portion of the building for warehousing and distribution plus retail usage for another part of the vacant area of the store. A petition signed by 22 residents objected to the special use permit to warehousing in a district right next to a residential area. "While we do support new retail operations in the now vacant real estate, we believe that the proposed warehousing operation and their associated disruptions would be detrimental to the R1A residential abutting area," the petition said. Rupcich cited the neighbors' major concerns as declining property values, alteration of the essential character of the neighborhood, adverse noise from running diesel trucks during unloading/loading process, vehicle vibration from trucks being felt at nearby homes, fork lift noise due to OSHA mandated backup alarms, unknown operating hours, inadequate screening (six-foot fence required), intrusive lighting from security lights on the back of the building, intrusive security surveillance possibly intruding on residents' privacy, and west side of building used by trucks getting to loading docks due to the building only being 30 feet from their property lines. Other factors cited were outside storage, refuse containers and odors, proposed outside compactor, storm water drainage, litter and safety. Jim Lund, a nearby resident who runs a trucking company, said semis can't safely back in or pull out of the proposed 12-foot-wide docks. Resident Charlie Yelm said storm drainage pipe used for the current building has eroded and buckled, and he was concerned with more water problems with the area being paved for use by trucks. Rupcich said warehousing is an inappropriate use of this area, and the city shouldn't be held hostage if he said he would leave without the variance being granted. "We support retail and the city, but this is a wrong operation for this area," he said. Resident Greg Malm added, "We wish him well, but somewhere else." Comment on this story at www.bcrnews.com.

Two years ago, Tracy Morgan almost lost his life in a car accident with a Walmart tractor-trailer. His friend, comedian James McNair, was killed in the June 2014 limo-bus crash on the New Jersey Turnpike. Morgan spent two weeks in a coma and still has scars on his head from the deadly incident. But Morgan says he's made peace with the driver who caused the collision. In an interview with Conan O'Brien, Morgan said, “I forgave him and I’m not even mad at him no more." But, he joked, "You know who is mad at him? All my white neighbors." Morgan said the reported $10 million settlement he received from Walmart helped him move to a nicer neighborhood, where he drives around in his Lamborghini. He never goes more than 30 mph, though, so he can show it off. "If you wouldn’t have hit his ass, he wouldn’t be living next door to me," Morgan joked, imagining what his neighbors might say. “I’ve got daughters.” According to CBS New York, the driver of the Walmart truck, Kevin Roper, pleaded not guilty in February 2016 to aggravated manslaughter, vehicular homicide, and aggravated assault. He is currently awaiting trial. Advertisement Entertainment • News • Pop Culture Photo: Kristina Bumphrey/StarPix/REX/Shutterstock.

Morgan once again spoke candidly about the traffic collision which left him in a coma and took the life of his friend and fellow comedian, James "Jimmy Mack" McNair, all while imbuing the tragedy with his reliable sense of humor.

"I forgave him and I'm not even mad at him anymore," Morgan told the cheering Conan audience. "But you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbors! 'You wouldn't have hit his ass, he wouldn't be living next door to me! I got daughters!'" A new favorite pastime for Morgan is to slowly cruise around his fresh neighborhood in his Lamborghini, generally maintaining a speed of "30 miles per hours so everybody in the neighborhood can see it." Morgan is currently preparing for Lee Daniels and Jay Z's forthcoming Richard Pryor biopic Is It Something I Said. During a chat with the Breakfast Club crew last month, Morgan opened up about the extensive creative process behind capturing the spirit of Red Foxx with an honest portrayal: "I'm not trying to do an impression," Morgan said at the time. "I'm trying to channel him. Just like Jamie [Foxx] did with Ray. He didn't do an impression. He did Ray on heroin. That's a dark place. You wanna go until you know how to get to that dark place."

WMT, +0.45% said it plans to double the sales of locally-grown produce by 2025, expand its sustainable sourcing of 20 commodities including bananas and coffee, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of the new commitments in its sustainability agenda. Wal-Mart's Chief Executive Doug McMillon will lay out the plan at the Net Impact Conference taking place on Friday. The retailer's goal is for an 18% emissions reduction in its own operation by 2025, a plan approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, which is aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement. It will also work with suppliers to reduce emissions by one gigaton by 2030, the equivalent of taking more than 211 million cars off U.S. roads, the company said. Other goals include reducing packaging waste, achieving zero waste to landfills in key markets by 2025, and working with partners to ensure ethical treatment of workers across the supply chain. Wal-Mart shares are inactive in premarket trading, and up 13.6% for the year so far. The S&P 500 INdex SPX, +0.29% is up 2.2% for 2016 so far.

Nordstrom next? by Stirrups Nov 4, 2016, 4:00am PDT tweet share pin Rec Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images I was a busy boy yesterday. I had three customer meetings, two conference calls, and took two trips into the office to get email and paperwork completed in between. 7:15AM to 6:45PM. And all throughout the day, no matter where I went or with whom I was was working, no matter business, lunch or commute, every time I became a part of a group of at least three people the conversation instantly turned to Game 7. For the most part these were all people I have seen and worked with for nearly ten years. Never have I had this happen where everybody talks about The Big Championship Game of the day before. A couple of NFL Super Bowls came close. But to drag those games down, there was that obnoxious snark of superiority out of every third person as to how they only watched for the commercials. And, to be honest, even Super Bowl commercials are no longer the national event they were a few years ago. It's never happened to me with any NHL Stanley Cup. It only approximated yesterday with the NBA Finals when the Lakers won, and when I was working downtown LA. But still that was mostly among the slightly more sports-minded people. Yesterday it was everybody. Even people who would come right out and clearly confess that they didn't know sports very well. But that was OK, they would say, because they were with me and I knew a lot about baseball. Apparently, I had their back, and they could freely swim with the rest of us in the delight of Game 7 excitement. That all makes sense now that I know that this Game 7 kicked absolute ass in the overnight ratings. It was THE most watched baseball game in 25 years. Over 40 million viewers. Now, to be clear, I am not sure how they count all those eyeballs in a global live streaming epoch, but 40 million people is roughly the combined population of half of America. (This list, from Oklahoma to Wyoming which would be 24 States, adds up to 43.7million.).......... Things will be quiet among all these people when Monday rolls around. But not here, friends. Not here at all. Welcome To The Off-Season Links: ______________________________ Let's Get Organized A new season has started. We have some important dates to track. Here is our calendar of events for the rest of this year: 11/5: Contract Options decision day 11/7: Final day for teams to extend Qualifying Offer. This year it's $17.2million 11/7: Finalists for the big-time 2016 awards are announced 11/8 - 11/10: GM Meetings in Scottsdale, Arizona 11/8: Free Agency period begins 11/8: Gold Glove winners announced 11/10: Silver Slugger winners announced 11/14: Deadline to accept/reject Qualifying Offers 11/14: Rookies of the Year award winners announced 11/15: Managers of the Year award winners announced 11/16: Cy Young award winners announced 11/17: Mike Trout overlooked yet again for AL MVP Award 11/18: Rule 5 Draft protection deadline 12/1: Current CBA expires 12/2: Deadline for teams to tender pre-arb and arb contract offers 12/5 - 12/8: MLB Winter meetings in Washington, D.C. 12/8: Rule 5 draft ______________________________ World Series Hangover Joe Maddon is not perfect, and his tinkering in Games 6 & & opened the door for the dinosaurs to show their teeth. But he is still the smartest guy in the room. And to think, he was our to lose, and lose him we did........... You can stop feeling sorry for Cleveland fans immediately. And you can start reminding Cubs fans that just because their team won a World Series, that doesn't mean they can let their guard down and start trusting everybody to do the right thing............ These lovable loser Cubs are such a monster that not only did they deliver on what everybody expected them to do all along, but they are already 3/1 favorites to do it again next year............. Yeah. This is the bottom of the 9th that had me mesmerized. The gassed Aroldis Chapman was practically daring the Indians lineup to walk off with the title. It was more pitching than overpowering. The Indians had that World Series right there for the taking, and missed it. The Cubs absolutely stole that frame, right out from under the noses of Cleveland.......... I'm sure there are 1000 such stories about Cubs fans. This is the one we will go with............I'm sure there is only one of these stories about Cubs pllayers. So I cannot do anything but go with it. Ben Zobrist is a cool dude, as are his fans.............. What next for Steve Bartman? Now may you rest, forever and in peace, Harry Caray, Budweiser has put in the time to make you whole.............. ______________________________ A Little Bit of Angels News Did you hear? The Angels kicked off the off-season for all of MLB by acquiring Tigers' outfielder Cameron Maybin. You did hear, right? Yeah? No? well, welcome back to planet earth, then. I mean, with only World Series new to report, the Maybin acquisition was the top fresh news everywhere. Hey, it ain't Willie Mays, but the bar was pretty low out there in left field. Not only is Maybin an upgrade over the 2,816 guys we have experimented with since dumping Hambone off onto Texas, he is an upgrade over what would have been Hambone, too, had we kept him to this age...........As FanGraphs puts it, "this move is simply wonderful"............ Brett Oberholtzer, who had been DFA'd, has been outrighted to Salt Lake City. Still in the organization. Have a Happy Thanksgiving and a very Merry Christmas, Oberholtzer family. And Brett? Yeah, you. Have a Do-It-Better New Year............ ______________________________ Trade Winds Maybin was a good catch because the Tigers are looking to retool, and Epstein absolutely beat other team to the punch here. It was like his own personal Black Friday rush to the electronics aisle, when everybody else was still indulging in tryptophan-induced couch dreams. One guy that won't be getting out of Detroit is the significant bullpen upgrade option that is Francisco Rodriguez. His ERA+ of 128 last season was better than anything on the entire qualifying LAA pitching staff............ Here is your full roster of possible Free Agents this winter. Not all these dudes will make it all the way to market.............. Theo Epstein, when he recovers from his hangover, has the toughest job in all of baseball. His team is adored. They are indulged. They are, pardon the sickeningly over-used cliche, family. They are the Big Beast of Baseball, fulfilling the destiny ordained on them from before anything even started. So does Epstein stand pat, forcing all the other GM's to try and catch him? Or does he work to improve his weakest roster spots, which would mean kicking off the bus some guys that are national heroes today, riding int he parade? Theo won. Big. But now he wakes to a no-win situation of his own making........... The Phillies declined their option on Ryan Howard. I'm shocked............ Dexter Fowler has already announced that he is stepping off that Cubs bus I keep talking about, and looking at Free Agency. But he is more than open to hiring back on with Chicago...for a raise, of course. I know that you have probably forgotten the Fowler backstory, what with all that has happened since last October. But Fowler is the guy who was traded from Houston to the Cubs two years ago, then was granted his Free Agency by the Cubs one year ago. Supposedly, he had agreed to sign on with the Orioles, then stunned everybody by signing back on with the Cubs overnight and saying that he never had anything inked with Baltimore........... Ian Desmond, the dude nobody wanted and who signed on with Texas for a year and moved to the outfield, totally blowing it out and having a stupendous season, will be extended a QO by the Rangers. Not that any QO offer matters to Billy Epstein, but $17.2 million in the hand from Texas might be too tempting to even give Epstein a chance to bid high and use ex-infielder Desmond to fix our 2B.......... ______________________________ The Duffle Bag Victor Rojas' brother is back in the Detroit organization, coaching the Mud Hens.........The MSM continues to crumble in the face of our Brave New World.................Mike Montgomery threw something called a "Golden Pitch" the other night. Very, very rare. I had no idea such a thing existed, but it's a fun angle............Cleveland, who quite recently put a major dump on San Francisco while enjoying their Cavaliers come back from a 3-1 deficit to take the NBA crown, now have to taste the bitter other end of that glory. And the Internet is there to make sure they chew and swallow that bitterness, forever............ ______________________________ More From Halos Heaven Neil Walker is the one splash signing the Angels desperately need WeekEnd HaloLinks: Mike Trout's Silver Linings.

Motion chairs are just one of the promises so-called 4D technology will bring to Canadian cinemas this summer when movie exhibitor Cineplex opens its first 4DX auditorium. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ THE CANADIAN PRESS Share Adjust Comment Print Here’s our roundup of the best and brightest stories this morning. Walmart, le superstore: Sign laws to ensure trademarks comply with Quebec’s “linguistic landscape” go into effect Nov. 24, the Office québécois de la langue française says. The rules will allow businesses to keep their trademark names, even in English, but requires them to add a descriptor in French – not necessarily next to the name but somewhere that is visible, according to the OQLF. The Office will provide assistance to companies needing guidance to implement the new rules. They aren’t expecting outrage, which probably means they haven’t met some of our Facebook commenters. Cuts pretty deep: Bagpiper Jeff McCarthy was perplexed and perturbed when he was handed a $221 ticket by police for wearing a sgian-dubh (pronounced skin-do), a small knife that is a common accessory for men in traditional Scottish dress. The piper was cornered, then ticketed by officers who spotted the knife tucked into his kilt hose while he was taking a break during a McGill University convocation ceremony. “As I was walking by these three police officers, one of them … asked me, ‘Is that a knife?’ and I said, ‘Absolutely’.” McCarthy hasn’t decided whether he will contest the ticket, which amounted to about half his salary that day. Oh god, please hold the bubbles: Canada’s largest movie exhibitor is launching a pricey new ticket option: an immersive moviegoing experience called 4DX. Cineplex is screening Marvel’s Doctor Strange in the new format, which includes motion seats and an array of environmental effects — including rain, wind, lightning, snow, scents and bubbles — to correspond with appropriate sequences. Adult admission is $24.99. For now, Canadians can only get this experience in Toronto. Okay, now we’re outraged: Canadian courses for Trump University were taught by a couple who used aliases, declared multiple bankruptcies, lost a real-estate licence and was sanctioned by securities regulators over a multimillion-dollar swindle, according to documents reviewed through a joint investigation by CP and AP. They taught Trump courses in Canadian cities in 2010, before Trump’s namesake real-estate seminars folded amid mounting inquiries from U.S. regulators and complaints from former students. Trump assured customers he had personally hand-picked only the best people to teach. Trump University staff included at least four felons, including a cocaine-trafficker and a former army sergeant court-martialled for sexually assaulting a fellow soldier’s eight-year-old daughter.

Hermitage police Chief Eric Jewell said Zachary T. McClimans, of Sharon, was taken into custody by police in the parking lot of the Walmart following the shooting around 10:30 Thursday night. The chief said this morning that Mr. McClimans was sitting in a vehicle in the parking lot, a handgun in his possession, when police took him into custody. Mr. McClimans was scheduled to be arraigned this morning on charges of attempted first-degree murder, attempted third-degree murder, aggravated assault and other related offenses. He is being held at the Mercer County Jail on $500,000 bond. The preliminary investigation has revealed that Mr. McClimans and the victim, who was shot multiple times, were co-workers at the store and that Mr. McClimans had "specifically targeted the victim over an ongoing dispute."  The victim, who has not been identified, was on duty at the time of the shooting. Mr. McClimans apparently had been on duty earlier in the day but had left the store then returned. The victim was shot four times and is in stable condition at a trauma center. The chief noted the challenge of securing the large crime scene and interviewing patrons who were shopping at the time.  Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Your e-mail: Your Name: Friends e-mail: Friends Name: Message: Captcha Submit Advertisement Create a free PG account.

Comedian Tracy Morgan has forgiven the truck driver who nearly killed him. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The 47-year-old star was left seriously injured in June, 2014 after a Walmart truck crashed into the comedian's vehicle in New Jersey, killing comedy writer James 'Jimmy Mack' McNair. Tracy suffered severe brain trauma and a broken leg, among many other injuries, and had to learn how to walk again during his months-long rehabilitation. But the former 30 Rock comedian has now put the traumatic incident behind him, insisting during an appearance on late night chat show Conan on Thursday (03Nov16) that he doesn't hold a grudge against the driver of the truck. "I forgave him," Tracy insisted. "I'm not even mad at him no more." However, Tracy added that his neighbours might not be as forgiving, joking: "But you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbours. 'If you wouldn't have hit his a*s, he wouldn’t be living next door to me!''' Tracy and Walmart executives reached a financial settlement over the collision back in 2015. While the exact amount the comedian received is unknown, it was enough for him to splash out on a new house and a Lamborghini. Revealing he drives the swanky vehicle at 30 miles an hour "so everybody in the neighbourhood" can see him, Tracy added: "I don't do speed. Speed is for kids." Tracy previously admitted that while he has little memory of the crash, he does remember meeting his late father while comatose in a New Jersey hospital. "When you're in a coma for eight to 10 days you're basically knocking on the door (of heaven)," he said in a taped interview for Oprah Winfrey's Master Class TV special. "I don't know if I was in the coma, or in and out of the coma, but I remember I was just talking to my dad. "He had this green thing on and I just remember him saying, 'I'm not ready for you son'. And I started crying so hard. I was crying harder than probably I cried at the funeral. And I just kept saying, 'Dad!' because he was my best friend." © Cover Media Online Editors Your Comments COMMENT RULES: Comments that are judged to be defamatory, abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted.

PARK CITY, Utah, Nov. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- PECO Real Estate Partners (PREP) is pleased to announce that the company has acquired The Hanover Mall in Hanover, Massachusetts, previously owned by CW

Tracy Morgan Doesn't Hold A Grudge Against Driver Who Nearly Killed Him By WENN in Movies / TV / Theatre on 04 November 2016 Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest StumbleUpon Reddit Fark Email Comment Follow Tracy Morgan Tracy Morgan Oprah Winfrey Comedian Tracy Morgan has forgiven the truck driver who nearly killed him. The 47-year-old star was left seriously injured in June, 2014 after a Walmart truck crashed into the comedian's vehicle in New Jersey, killing comedy writer James 'Jimmy MACk' MCNair. Tracy suffered severe brain trauma and a broken leg, among many other injuries, and had to learn how to walk again during his months-long rehabilitation. But the former 30 Rock comedian has now put the traumatic incident behind him, insisting during an appearance on late night chat show Conan on Thursday (03Nov16) that he doesn't hold a grudge against the driver of the truck. "I forgave him," Tracy insisted. "I'm not even mad at him no more." However, Tracy added that his neighbours might not be as forgiving, joking: "But you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbours. 'If you wouldn't have hit his a*s, he wouldn’t be living next door to me!''' Tracy and Walmart executives reached a financial settlement over the collision back in 2015. While the exact amount the comedian received is unknown, it was enough for him to splash out on a new house and a Lamborghini. Revealing he drives the swanky vehicle at 30 miles an hour "so everybody in the neighbourhood" can see him, Tracy added: "I don't do speed. Speed is for kids." Tracy previously admitted that while he has little memory of the crash, he does remember meeting his late father while comatose in a New Jersey hospital. "When you're in a coma for eight to 10 days you're basically knocking on the door (of heaven)," he said in a taped interview for Oprah Winfrey's Master Class TV special. "I don't know if I was in the coma, or in and out of the coma, but I remember I was just talking to my dad. "He had this green thing on and I just remember him saying, 'I'm not ready for you son'. And I started crying so hard. I was crying harder than probably I cried at the funeral. And I just kept saying, 'Dad!' because he was my best friend."

Photo: Courtesy of the New York Comedy Festival A little more than two years after narrowly escaping death in a horrific six-vehicle crash on the New Jersey Turnpike, comedian Tracy Morgan sits in the living room of his $13.9 million mansion in tony Alpine, NJ. He plays with his giggling 3-year-old daughter, Maven Sonae, and exudes a kind of soulfulness that rarely informs his bombastic stand-up routine. “The accident gave me a different perspective on life,” he softly says over the phone. “It would have done the same for you.” Tracy Morgan with his daughter, Maven, and wife, Megan, last year at the Primetime Emmys in Los Angeles.Photo: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Morgan, 47, is not just alive, but truly thriving. His career has shot into overdrive: He appeared with Conan O’Brien at the Apollo this week, has projects galore on his slate, and will headline a New York Comedy Festival show at Carnegie Hall on Saturday night. The comic has denied reports he got a $90 million legal settlement for the accident from Walmart, whose truck slammed into Morgan’s limo. In a statement in May 2015, he said, “Walmart did right by me and my family, and for my associates and their families. I am grateful that the case was resolved amicably.” Morgan — who was in a coma for eight days and feared he’d never walk properly again — attributes his remarkable comeback to personal rather than professional motivations: “I wanted to be well enough to play with my daughter when she got older, to see my sons grow, to see my wife grow. Those things were on my brain. They focused me on getting healthy.” (Morgan has three grown sons with his first wife. His daughter, Maven, is with current wife Megan Wollover.) While he has upcoming film roles (“Fist Fight,” “Tag”), Morgan’s current big project is a TBS sitcom featuring Jordan Peele as co-writer and executive producer. On the as-yet-untitled show, which has been shooting on location in Brooklyn, Morgan plays an ex-con returning from a 15-year prison stretch and adjusting to life in his newly gentrified neighborhood. He says the crash gave him greater clarity in his creative process. “I was sitting around after the accident with ideas and visions, things coming back to me, my brain rebooting,” Morgan says. “A lot of the show is based on my life in New York City. Stories I have known, lives I have seen that touched me. The idea was there before the accident, but [surviving] the accident gives me a second chance.” Morgan poses at Madison Square Garden in January.Photo: Anthony Causi He gets to reminiscing about inner-city New York — he describes himself as being from “Brooklyn, by way of The Bronx” — during a grim time. “I’m from the ’80s generation,” says Morgan. “Crack and AIDS destroyed a whole generation of people. They went away to prison for making easy money by selling crack, or else they went away by dying of AIDS. I am from the missing generation.” He quickly drops the crack-era talk and pauses the interview so he can wrangle his chattering daughter. One can almost see his smile — the one made famous when he played an exaggerated version of himself on “30 Rock” — through the phone line. He talks about the excitement of appearing on “Conan” during the talk-show host’s stint at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. It’s his first time on that historic stage since his 2010 HBO stand-up special. ‘I wanted to be well enough to play with my daughter when she got older, to see my sons grow, to see my wife grow.’ “I got my start on 125th Street. It was at Uptown Comedy Club” — where Morgan and other up-and-coming comedians would engage in epic freestyling put-down battles — “and [I’ve] traveled millions of miles in comedy and showbiz. But it’s always good to come home.” Morgan is all too aware of how close he came to never coming home again. However, bad as things had been for him — his wife, Megan, recently told Essence magazine, “I look back on [the post-accident period] like a movie or a nightmare” — he swears that he won’t shy away from mining the experience for laughs. “Listen,” he says in his throaty, booming voice, “if you don’t laugh about it, you cry about it. But that’s what I built my career on, Richard Pryor-style, taking all the bad things in my life and making them funny.” Like when he made a surprise appearance at the 2015 Primetime Emmys and quipped about emerging from the coma and being “ecstatic to learn I wasn’t the one who messed up!” Morgan acknowledges that nearly losing his life helped his comedy, even before he made a single crack about high-speed collisions on New Jersey highways. “It gave me something to talk about. It gave me something to think about,” he says, leaving the impression that maybe he had begun taking his comedic talents too much for granted. “It’s like with a girlfriend. You ignore her for a long time, then you see her with another man and you get more into her. I’m paying closer attention. I’m more into detail.” Still, when it comes to spinning the crash into comic gold, even a man as outrageously humorous as Morgan may have his work cut out for him. “I had nightmares, as any human would, but they were not accident nightmares. I don’t remember the accident,” he says. “They were dreams about Jimmy [Morgan’s frequent collaborator, James McNair, who died in the collision], childhood, my dad. You go through a traumatic brain injury and your life passes before you. Trust me on that.” With the end of the allotted interview time at hand, Morgan puts in a heartfelt request. “Do me a favor,” he says. “Tell the people of New York City that I love them.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under comedians ,  jordan peele ,  new york comedy festival ,  tracy morgan Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Beyoncé makes surprise appearance at Country Music Awards Read Next Beyoncé makes surprise appearance at Country Music Awards Most Popular This Week 1 The one scenario that could still get Hillary into the White House 2 Melania Trump's girl-on-girl photos from racy shoot revealed 3 Assassination threats against Trump flood Twitter 4 Trump calls slain cop's widow to offer condolences 5 Kellyanne Conway tells The Post she feels 'blessed’ over White House gig 6 White House open to a Clinton pardon Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 117,618 Donna Brazile fires back at CNN for 'ripping me a new one' 76,349 Abandoned girl leads cops to dead mom in possible ‘love triangle gone bad’ 38,620 Michael Strahan was 'hurt' by Andy Cohen's 'Live' remarks Now On Ashley Graham insisted that her Barbie’s thighs touch Carrie Fisher: I slept with Harrison Ford Oprah is selling off her last Chicago property SEE ALL Video :47 Russian teens livestream a shootout with police before committing suicide Now On David Blaine Eats A Live Frog On ‘The Tonight Show’ SEE ALL More Stories pagesix Michael Strahan was 'hurt' by Andy Cohen's 'Live' remarks Now On Decider Alec Baldwin Is A No Show On 'SNL', Backs Down From Trump nypost Donna Brazile fires back at CNN for 'ripping me a new one' New York Post Twitter Facebook Instagram Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Twitter Facebook Instagram Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2016 NYP Holdings, Inc.

But hey, that's not to say that a hefty settlement payment didn't contribute to Morgan's charitable mood. As Morgan explained on Thursday's Conan, while he isn't mad at that Walmart driver, you know who is? "All my white neighbors." But that sure as heck doesn't stop Morgan from driving around his new, ritzy neighborhood, all deliberate like, in his cool, fancy Ferrari. After all, the man's got a new lease on life and he's not going to miss a chance to milk it.

TV Tracy Morgan forgives the Walmart truck driver who hit him But … by Oliver Gettell • @ogettell Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (TBS) Conan Posted November 3 2016 — 10:27 PM EDT See also Tracy Morgan to star in TBS comedy created by Jordan Peele Tracy Morgan returns to Dover Downs two years after car accident Tracy Morgan doesn’t bear any ill will toward the Walmart truck driver who crashed into his vehicle in 2014 — but he can’t say the same for some of his new neighbors. “I’m not mad at him, I forgave him,” the comedian tells Conan O’Brien in a clip from Thursday’s episode of Conan. “But you know who is mad at him? All my white neighbors.” Amid audience laughter, Morgan summons mock anger: “If you hadn’t hit his ass, he wouldn’t be living next door to me!” The 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live alum also tells O’Brien that since relocating his home, he’s been enjoying leisurely rides in his Lamborghini. Asked how fast he drives, Morgan replies, “30 miles an hour, so everybody in the neighborhood can see.” Morgan has been steadily returning to the public eye since his June 2014 accident, which occurred when a truck struck his limousine van from behind on the New Jersey turnpike. The crash killed Morgan’s friend and mentor James “Jimmy Mack” McNair, left Morgan in a coma, and seriously injured three other passengers. Morgan settled a lawsuit against Walmart in May 2015 and first returned to the stand-up stage a year ago. He is currently on tour, has a role in the upcoming movie Fist Fight, and is working on an FX comedy pilot with Jordan Peele.

The event, which takes place at 220 Broad St., will run from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. A second event is planned from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 3  at  Wal-Mart, 2024 Genesee St. in Oneida. The event will be conducted by the Sheriff’s Office along with the City of Oneida Police Department, and is made possible by the support of the Oneida Wal-Mart. Also available at the event will be various informational items geared toward child safety and safety concerns in general, available at no charge. Madison County Sheriff Allen Riley explains that using equipment that contains the latest digital fingerprinting technology and high-resolution photography capabilities, many Sheriff's Offices across New York are able to produce a SAFE CHILD card for parents and guardians. The card contains the child’s name, biographical information (including date of birth, gender, height, weight, hair color, eye color, and other identifying data), and a fingerprint image of both index fingers. The card can be made in just a few minutes and can be easily carried in a wallet or pocketbook. The goal of the program is to record and securely store the fingerprints, basic biographical information and photographs of children who are not missing — information critical to expediting the return of a missing child. The storage of information is secure, entirely voluntary and requires the written consent of a parent or legal guardian. The information gathered is digitally recorded and stored at a separate database at the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS). Once included in the database, parents or lawful guardians can request that information be purged at any time and, after a child turns 18, the fingerprints will be purged from the database. The child's photo should be updated once a year.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscriber Services Classifieds Submit Announcements & News Market Place Classifieds Real Estate Your Community News Blotters Herkimer County Oneida-Verona New Hartford Rome Utica Oneida Indian Nation Whitestown Blogs - Living - Sports Sports: Anne Delaney Sports: John Pitarresi Sports: Ron Moshier Boilermaker College Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Capitol Watch Reports from the Courant's politics staff Politics Capitol Watch Lawmakers Seek Campaign Finance Reform After Petit Ad Lawmakers Call for Campaign Finance Reform Photo by Christopher P. Keating Presumptive House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz of Berlin and incoming House Democratic leader Matthew Ritter of Hartford talk about proposed changes in campaign finance laws due to major third-party spending in the election campaign. Presumptive House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz of Berlin and incoming House Democratic leader Matthew Ritter of Hartford talk about proposed changes in campaign finance laws due to major third-party spending in the election campaign. (Photo by Christopher P. Keating) Christopher KeatingContact Reporter The presumptive House Speaker called Thursday for changes in the state campaign finance laws with more disclosure on commercials by Republican funders like Wal-Mart and the Koch brothers. But Republicans countered that reform cuts both ways, and they want more disclosure about exactly who funded pro-Democratic campaigns like the recent one against Dr. William Petit, a Republican in a tight legislative race in Plainville. Both sides want individual donors to be disclosed at certain levels for contributions to third-party political action committees. The third-party PACs have been playing an increasingly large role in elections ever since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the doors to major funding in a case called Citizens United. “Sadly, the influx of outside third-party, special interest money, affirmed by the Supreme Court Citizens United ruling, has essentially in many instances allowed wealthy out-of-state funders to hijack our local legislative campaigns,’’ said Rep. Joe Aresimowicz of Berlin, who will be the House Speaker if Democrats retain their majority in next week’s election. Currently, the top five donors to the political action committees must be disclosed. Democrats say they will propose legislation in 2017 to expand that number and extend it to all donors beyond certain levels. Incoming House Democratic leader Matthew Ritter of Hartford said legislators thought that they were reforming the system when they approved public financing that was signed by Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell. Editorial: Nasty Spins Like Petit-Trump Ad Turn People Off To Politics This election reached a new low with an ad linking William Petit with Donald Trump's "attack on women and families." Mr. Petit is a Republican candidate for the state House whose wife and daughters were murdered in an attack that seriously injured him. "Poor judgment," Connecticut's largest labor... This election reached a new low with an ad linking William Petit with Donald Trump's "attack on women and families." Mr. Petit is a Republican candidate for the state House whose wife and daughters were murdered in an attack that seriously injured him. "Poor judgment," Connecticut's largest labor...Read the story “When you get a grant of $30,000 and someone from outside Connecticut with no interest other than maybe one or two bills can dump $100,000 in one day with no disclosure, how is that campaign finance reform?’’ Ritter asked. “It’s not.’’ Both Aresimowicz and Ritter favor challenging certain aspects of the Citizens United decision in Washington, D.C. “Maybe we’ll give the Supreme Court another chance,’’ Ritter told reporters at the state Capitol in Hartford. “When we have a new justice come January, which we hope, to take a look at some of these issues and say, ‘What Connecticut is doing is good for the state. Let them operate the system the way they want to operate it.’ " But House Republican leader Themis Klarides of Derby questioned how much the state legislature can do to change federal law. “Citizens United is Citizens United,’’ she told reporters. “It’s been held constitutional. We can’t do a lot on the state level.’’ Union Head Resigns Following Ad Linking William Petit To Trump And 'Attack On Women And Families' CHRISTOPHER KEATING A top union official resigned his post Thursday after a union-sponsored campaign ad targeting a candidate, the lone survivor of the 2007 Cheshire home invasion, led to a firestorm of protest.

Paul Filson, the executive director of the SEIU Connecticut State Council, stepped down after a digital... (CHRISTOPHER KEATING) Klarides said that Democrats were hypocritical because a union-backed group called Labor United paid for campaign ads that tied Republicans to Donald Trump, including Petit and about a dozen others. “The hypocrisy of the Super PACs is really amazing to me,’’ Klarides said, adding that the first influx of Labor United money was $120,000. “All of that money came from SEIU, the biggest labor union in Connecticut. Is that within their legal right to do?  Absolutely. But that money comes from union dues. If you want to talk about who’s giving to what Super PAC, do I know who’s donating to that Super PAC? I don’t know. … If they want more transparency on our side, they better darn well expect to have the same transparency on their side.’’ Klarides charged that Democrats have been running away from their record during the campaign, taking some of the positions espoused by Republicans. “What galls me the most is they’re pro-business now – all of a sudden,’’ Klarides said. “They have been running away from their governor, which is understandable because he’s toxic..."

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Nov 3, 2016 at 1:57PM With the S&P 500 only 3% below its all-time high, finding stocks that are undervalued by the market is not easy. When the rising tide is lifting all boats, stocks that are under water from their intrinsic value likely means they're being discounted for a reason. Usually, maybe -- but not always. There are plenty of mispricings by the market due to incorrectly reading a company's temporary problems as systemic ones. Today we'll look at three such cases where a stock has been beaten down, but its business still holds long-term promise. Image source: Flickr via Random Retail. Pennies on the dollar Over the past couple of years, few companies have profited as well from the economic malaise that has afflicted the country than deep-discount chain Dollar General (NYSE:DG). As consumers struggled to regain their financial footing, they flocked to dollar stores as a means of allowing their wallets to stretch to the maximum. Dollar General and rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) flourished as consumers liked the dollar-or-more treasure hunt of their stores. And as they installed refrigerators and freezers to give customers a wider selection of consumable goods (items that might have carried slightly lower margins but helped boost store traffic), their sales, profits, and footprints grew. But that all seemed to change with the second quarter as Dollar General and Dollar Tree stumbled, falling well short of analyst expectations. Shares of Dollar General have fallen nearly 30% from their all-time highs while Dollar Tree's are down an equally precipitous 25%. The main culprit was a change in consumer perception of their value proposition, while a resurgent Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) refocused its energy on being the low-cost leader. Coupled with food price deflation and cuts in SNAP food stamp benefits, the retailer has been put under pressure. but those are factors that impact many discounters, including Dollar Tree and Wal-Mart. However, the long-term demand and need for the dollar stores remains intact. Currently valued at 14 times forward earnings and at a fraction of its sales, Dollar General is worth a look. Image source: Tractor Supply. Plowing under growth Rural retailer Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) got hit especially hard after providing early guidance for its fiscal third quarter that saw it anticipate comparable sales, revenues, and profit all coming in lower than previously anticipated. Blaming weakness in both the energy and agricultural markets, Tractor Supply also said winter season products were falling short of expectations, suggesting its troubles might not be limited to just one quarter. The deflation being experienced by the discount retailers is also hitting the farm equipment supplier's customers, which are comprised largely of farmers and ranchers. If farm incomes are down due to the commodity cycle hitting its low point, Tractor Supply will have a tough time selling its big-ticket items, while the consumables business will be impacted by the falling prices, too. Yet its livestock and pet operations, which account for around 45% of its revenue, remain strong. Even though its business weakened in the current quarter, that segment still generated mid-single digit comparable-store sales increases. This will continue to assume a larger portion of its business as it grows its footprint from the 1,575 stores it currently operates, giving it a chance to pick off the higher-margin private label goods sales and increasing the amount of consumables it sells. When the cycle turns once more, it will be positioned to capitalize. Paying a $0.96 dividend that currently yields 1.55%, Tractor Supply is planting the seeds for the payout to grow in the future. Image source: Lear. Bolting together a plan Trading just a point or two below its all-time highs means auto parts maker Lear (NYSE:LEA) can't be considered a beaten-down stock, but that doesn't mean it's not still undervalued. Indeed, when it reported third-quarter results recently, it beat Wall Street expectations and raised its guidance for the rest of the year. It certainly looks like it's firing on all cylinders. Despite that, however, Lear remains an underappreciated stock, perhaps because of the more difficult time Ford, GM, and Chrysler are having moving cars this year compared to last. Although the automakers are still selling millions of cars,  2015 was a record year when more than 17.4 million cars were sold. As of this writing, though, October auto sales are expected to fall 7% from last year, the sixth month of falling sales, a situation that hasn't been seen since the financial markets' collapse. Lear, however, is still doing brisk business. The automotive seating and electrical distribution systems posted sales of $4.53 billion in the third quarter, beating analyst forecasts of $4.48 billion, with adjusted earnings of $3.19 per share coming in ahead of expectations of $3.02 per share. For all that, Lear is cheap across multiple metrics. Its stock is valued at just 8.5 times future earnings, it is priced at less than half its sales, and when you compare its price to its earnings, shares trade at just a fraction of their growth potential. That suggests there is a lot of upside still in this stock if Lear's shares simply trade up to a fair market valuation. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The GST council has approved a four-tier GST tax structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent that aims to lower tax incidence on most goods. However, luxury items like high-end cars and demerit goods including tobacco, pan masala and aerated drinks, will be taxed at the highest rate and will also attract a cess in a way the total incidence of tax remains at almost the current level. "With GST rates announced today, there is a good progress in this journey to have GST by April 2017. With half the CPI basket at 0 per cent and a majority of daily consumption essential items at 5 per cent, it will keep inflation in check. Looks good and progressive tax regime," said Walmart India President and CEO Krish Iyer. Beverages and snacks major PepsiCo said the food processing industry is looking forward to rational tax rates for carbonated beverages, savouries, fruit juices under the GST regime. "The GST Council discussions are going on currently and we are waiting to get more clarity -- it's too early for us to comment on the current developments," said PepsiCo India Region CFO Rajdeep Datta Gupta. Coca-Cola India has a similar response. It said it does not have details on the applicable GST rates, including the cess, as the company manufactures and markets beverages, including juices, juice with fizz, dairy products, iced tea and carbonated beverages such as soda. "At this point, we do not know which of these products are classified in which category. It is therefore difficult to comment on the impact of the announced rate slabs," said Coca-Cola India. As for air-condition maker Daikin, the move would bring about "a positive development" for the consumer durable industry. "This is definitely a good sign and positive development for the consumer durable industry. Lower tax will also add to the growth of the overall industry and the benefits in due time will be passed on to the consumers," said Daikin India CEO and MD Kanwal Jeet Jawa.   PTI First Published: Thursday, November 3, 2016 - 21:21 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus MOST READ TOP NEWS MOST VIEWED Did this Indian businessman just surrender Rs 6,000 crore?

Falk / Staff Photographer Pottstown's Marvin Pearson started losing his sight at 8 and was completely blind two years later. During that time, he inexplicably also lost his hearing. Now, at 18, he is a senior at Pottstown High School after spending three years at the Overbrook School for the Blind, and plays football. He scored a 65-yard touchdown and two-point conversion in recent games. by Kathy Boccella, Staff Writer Close icon Kathy Boccella Staff Writer After going blind and then deaf while still in grade school, Marvin Pearson learned how to get around his Pottstown neighborhood, even walking alone six blocks to a Walmart. Regaining some hearing after getting an implant in his left ear, he excelled at wrestling and track at Overbook School for the Blind, figured out how to defeat his two sisters on PlayStation games, and occasionally alarmed them and his mother by roller-blading around the house. Slideshow Blindness can't sack Pottstown running back Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon But that still wasn't enough. During the summer, Pearson contacted Pottstown High School and said he wanted to return to his hometown school for senior year - and there was one other thing. He was going out for varsity football. "I talked to him and said, 'It's going to be a process,' " recalled Pottstown head coach Gary Rodenbaugh. This fall, that process quickly evolved into a remarkable journey not only for his blind and hearing-impaired running back, but for Pearson's teammates, who say his contagious can-do spirit has made an otherwise so-so season a life lesson they will never forget. It was the viral video of a 65-yard touchdown sprint last month during the last play of a 48-0 rout that gave Pearson a burst of fame, including a TV appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he was given a $10,000 scholarship and the promise of a trip to meet his football idol, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees. No one seemed to care that the other team's defense stood aside as Pearson tore down the field. The real highlight for the teen was his three-yard plunge for a critical two-point conversion in a victory over Upper Merion High School, because that time he fought off live tacklers to reach the end zone. "It was time to show I was just a football player, not a blind football player," said Pearson, recalling how six defenders couldn't bring him down until he was finally over the goal line. It was the epitome of what Pearson has done again and again since he began losing his sight at age 7: Finding a way to do just about anything other kids do. "People ask, 'How does your brother play football, how does he run track?' I say, 'I don't know,' " marveled his older sister MarDaije, a freshman at Chestnut Hill College. "It's like he never even lost his sight," she said, adding: "He doesn't think he has it worse than others. He feels equal to everybody else." Indeed, Pearson, who maintains a 3.6 grade-point average, is already sprinting toward his next goals, college and a career in sports management, a fitting choice for a kid who's juggling 17 fantasy football teams. "Marvin doesn't know what obstacles mean," said his mother, Ana Carmona. "He has none. If they're there, he does not see them." Growing up in Pottstown, Pearson was an active, sports-loving kid who played youth football in Conshohocken and, his mother recalled, was often "hardheaded." The child's stubborn determination would serve him well when seemingly out of the blue, his vision began to deteriorate. Doctors eventually determined that he suffered from retinal detachment, and laser surgery on both eyes didn't prevent a total loss of sight over the next two years. "I was never the type to cry," Pearson recalled of the experience. "I wasn't scared, but it was frustrating trying to prove to doctors and teachers that I couldn't see." About a year into his vision crisis, Pearson started losing his hearing as well. Carmona said neither the family nor doctors ever figured out the cause. Only the cochlear implant prevented him from completely losing touch with the outside world. Yet Carmona said the harrowing experience seemed to be harder on her than on him. "Marvin, honestly, he took it on the shoulder," she recalled. "It was me in the corner crying every night and angry with God." Pearson's relatives say he always remained focused on what he could do, not what he couldn't. He knew his way around his Bright Hope Community neighborhood, so it wasn't long before he ventured out with his cane, making it two blocks to an aunt's house or to a nearby park with an assist from one of his sisters. "He always just kept going and acted the same," said MarDaije. Sometime he insisted on riding his bike, and she would have to run alongside. At Pottstown Middle School, he wrestled and played football, although he wasn't cleared for full contact. He started high school at the Overbook School for the Blind, where he also played goal ball, developed for blind athletes, in which players try to score with - or block - a ball that makes noises with tiny bells. In transferring to Pottstown High this fall, Pearson, 18, knew it was a chance to pursue his unfulfilled dreams on the gridiron - for real this time. It's a road that few travel. The U.S. Association of Blind Athletes is tracking just two similar players in the entire country, defensive lineman Jay Spencer at St. John Paul II Catholic High School in Huntsville, Ala., and long snapper Jake Olson at the University of Southern California. But Mark Lucas, executive director of the USABA, said it's possible for a blind athlete to succeed in just about any sport as long as coaches are willing to provide adaptations. Rodenbaugh and his staff were more than willing to adapt. They drew up plays for Pearson to take the snap under center and plow forward behind a wedge of blockers, but they also saw the larger, intangible benefit of someone who could teach his teammates about overcoming adversity. Just 5-9 and 154 pounds, Pearson said he idolizes Brees because the Saints quarterback was once dismissed as too short at 6 feet. "We're both underrated," Pearson said. "He's small, I'm blind. And we're both individuals that people don't expect to be as tough as we are." At a recent practice, a few guys worked on the sidelines with Pearson while the first-team defense was on the field. He put his hands together to catch passes, and even threw a few strikes of his own, with a helper telling him how far to throw and pointing his left arm in the direction of the receiver. "Good throw, Marvin!" they said again and again. Teammates appreciate both his accomplishments and his attitude. Nehemiah Figueroa, 16, admires how Pearson works up the home crowd with a few front flips before a game. "Marvin basically proves that no matter what your disability is, you can do anything you want," he said. The 65-yard dash against rival Pottsgrove - in which the opponents didn't challenge Pearson as he sprinted for the touchdown with a teammate's guidance - came with mixed emotions. It had been the Pottsgrove coach's idea. "I just kind of shared with him, this was going to be an opportunity to get to the end zone," Rodenbaugh recalled. "Marvin, being a competitor, was like, 'I don't want them to let me.' I emphasized it was a sign of respect for what you've been able to do and what you've shown to the world." It also proved that Pearson sometimes literally doesn't know when to quit. Five yards past the goal line, he finally dove to the ground. "We were yelling, 'Stop, stop!' - if he kept on running, he would have hit a gate," his mother said. That momentum should carry him to college next fall. It sounds like Pearson might be leaning toward Kutztown University. "I talked to the coach," he said. "He sounds like the kind of guy who will give me a chance to play." kboccella@phillynews.com 610-313-8232@Kathy_Boccella Published: November 2, 2016 — 3:59 PM EDT | Updated: November 3, 2016 — 1:08 AM EDT The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

ELECTION 2016 What Twitter, Google, and Politics Have in Common The internet economy is broken, according to Doug Rushkoff, who sees the fallout in both tech companies and our elections. By Helaine Olen Helaine Olen is a veteran personal finance journalist, the author of Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry, and the co-author of the upcoming Everything You Need to Know About Personal Finance ... on an Index Card. @helaineolen Personal finance journalist@helaineolen WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement When Americans go to the polls next week, they will be finalizing an electoral cycle characterized largely by resentment--and Doug Rushkoff, for one, mostly blames the changes spawned by the internet. Instead of the once-promised glorious new age, one that would free us from the tyranny of the corporate state, we got income inequality, the housing bubble, increased corporate power, and, now, a presidential election like none other in our history. And Rushkoff, a longtime media theorist and author, says the tech industry is partly responsible. The problem, he says, is not the digital economy itself, but the fact that it adopted an economic model that no longer works. "The conflict here is not really between the 99 percent and the 1 percent. It's not even stressed out employees against the companies they work for or the unemployed against Wall Street so much as everyone--humanity itself--against a program that promotes growth above all else," he writes in his most recent book, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: How Growth Became the Enemy of Prosperity. (The title is a reference to San Francisco protests in 2013 and 2014.) I recently reached out to Rushkoff to discuss the book and how the economic problems he identifies are playing out in both politics and private business--including at Google and the currently much-beleaguered Twitter. (This Q&A has been edited and condensed for clarity. And in the interests of full disclosure, Rushkoff mentioned my book Pound Foolish, which he blurbed, in Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus.) You write about Twitter's problems in your book. What has it done wrong? I feel like I'm watching the slow death of Twitter. I liked Twitter because it's super simple. It's an utterly transparent, easy-to-understand messaging system. People that subscribe to me see my messages in their feed. It isn't asking anything of me. Every once in a while there was an ad in the feed. I knew what it was. They are making money off this service. This is good. Everybody's happy, right? It turns out no. There's not room for that. Wall Street right now considers Twitter an abject failure because it turns out that they can't figure out how a 140-character messaging app can make more than $2 billion a year. That's not the way to make money with a company like that, a company that has a great sustainable revenue stream. Twitter could last a long time as a $2-billion-a-year business. It's not allowed to because the investors want home runs. They want 100 times that. They want $200 billion dollars a year or bust. A single or a double's not possible. Why does your book throw metaphorical rocks at Google? At first, Google represented the good guys. There were two kids in their Stanford dorm room who were going to take down Yahoo, which was the big Wall Street company. Now, Google has become not only one of the biggest companies in the world, but now even a holding company. They're appropriated the sharing, good-for-the-world ethos of San Francisco as a brand image, while actually working against all of those values. You think Google fell victim to something you call the growth trap. Can you explain that? One day they took too much money. What if Google had grown a little bit slower, but then got to stay one of the good guys? It would have been way better. There's no reason to grow that much, but that's really the growth trap. When you talk to the CEO of a Fortune 100 company, they'll say, "My shareholders are demanding 7.2 percent growth this year. The only way I'm going to be able to show that growth is by selling off one of my productive assets. It's like amputating one of my good arms in order to show growth on the balance sheet or by firing 10,000 competent employees." What the CEOs are realizing is that the long-term sustainability of their companies, or the long-term sustainability of the markets on which those companies are relying, is being surrendered to show growth because that's the prime, core command of the economy for the last 700 years. Our economy is doing exactly what it was programmed to. It's just that when you do this, on digital steroids, it starts happening in more extreme ways. That slow suck that sometimes people and nations were able to recover from now is a super-fast suck that we don't know how to deal with. So what do we need to do instead? What I'm talking about is pre-distributing the means of production before the fact. What does that look like? Take WinCo, the West Coast chain that's eating Walmart's lunch. It's the same business model as Walmart, except the workers are the shareholders. The workers are paid more. They own the company. They treat their regions differently because they live in the towns where they're working and they own the company that's impacting their towns. They have just as good prices as Walmart and so they beat Walmart. They have better customer service and better employee retention. That's distributive. How do you convince nascent companies to go along with this? You have to show people that the probability of having a total monopoly unicorn business is very low. It's 1 out of 100,000 that you will get to be Facebook, Google, or Exxon. It's really hard to be one of those. I think more people are looking at that and saying, "You know? Fifty million dollars is not so bad. No, I won't get to go to certain parties and I won't get on the cover of certain magazines, but I'll have $50 million." Right, but all we see are the companies and people who won the lottery, as you put it. How do we convince people to change when that's the model? I recently went to Silicon Valley, and I was trying to argue to young developers that tens of millions of dollars as your exit is enough. Be happy with that. But there's a certain ego thing. They want to be Mark Zuckerberg. They want everyone to know who they are. On the other hand, there are a lot of people out there that are realizing being a millionaire and working for a living is more fun than trying to be a multi-billionaire and never working. They're kind of seeing that. Basically, if you set your sights--and I hate to call it lower, but let's call it that--if you set your sights lower, you've got a company. God bless. You should be really happy with that. It's partly the digital culture that makes you need to have 10 million followers. You have to be Elon Musk or Travis Kalanick in order to feel OK about yourself. There are ways to do it. You just have to think about doing it small rather than at large scale or by creating a community of people who share in the value creations. Patagonia did by going private. Michael Dell did by going private so he could retake control of his company. His name is on it. It's a family business in a certain way, so he wants to think about how can this business survive rather than not. Once you take a lot of money, your investors will insist that you hit a home run. That means that you pivot away from your very viable and highly probable, profitable business strategy and adopt instead a scorched earth one-in-a-million unicorn strategy. How is this all playing out in the politics of 2016? People do have a sense that the system itself is rigged against them. That something is wrong and it's wrong on a fundamental level. It's depending on the operating system that's killing us all. They get that an establishment candidate in one way or another is going to be supporting this existing system. What many of them want, just like the people who are throwing rocks at the Google bus, is someone to break the thing. Donald Trump, if nothing else, is consummate with the digital media environment. He's an internet troll manifesting in the real world. He's born of the angry comment section after any article. Published on: Nov 3, 2016 Advertisement

Photograph: Brian J Clark/The Virginian-Pilot Sam Wollaston @samwollaston Thursday 3 November 2016 05.34 EDT Last modified on Thursday 3 November 2016 05.36 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Portsmouth in Virginia, and on the recording of a 911 call, a man is reported to have been shoplifting at Walmart. A police officer is on his way. A few minutes later and now we are with the police Taser camcorder. “Take your hand out of your pocket,” says the officer. “You’re not going to Tase me because you’re not going to arrest me for nothing,” says the man suspected of shoplifting. There is then a 15-second gap in the recording, because – the officer says later – the man knocked the Taser out of his hand and it hit the ground so hard that its camera stopped working, for 15 seconds. When it comes back on again, it is recording the aftermath of a shooting: audio mainly; voices, as the camera is lying on the ground, though the enormity of what has happened is immediately obvious. “Shots fired, suspect down …. Don’t die on me, brother; talk to me, man … He’s unresponsive, have medics standing by … I’m not getting a pulse, starting CPR …” During that quarter of a minute of camera malfunction, William Chapman, 18, has been shot and killed. Self defence, and all by the book, says Stephen Rankin, the officer. First-degree murder say Chapman’s family and the prosecutor (this is one of the rare cases that ends up in court). Over 90 minutes, This World: Unarmed Black Male (BBC2) forensically unpicks the case from that car park – a young man lying in a widening sea of blood, and a mum at home who does not yet know her boy is gone – to a verdict in the case against Rankin. The documentary makers are secured access to Chapman’s family, and also to Rankin himself, who talks. Plus Rankin’s partner and others because the film – unlike the court case, which can’t – goes back to before those shots were fired, to the first time Rankin fatally shot an unarmed man while on duty. Unarmed Black Male also puts Chapman’s death into the context of a year – last year – in which he was just one of 306 African Americans killed by police. So here is Walter Scott in Charleston, South Carolina, being shot eight times from behind as he walks away; and Eric Harris in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who was killed by mistake (“Fuck I shot him, I’m sorry,” says the officer); and Philando Castile in St Paul, Minnesota, shot after being pulled over for a broken tail light, the aftermath filmed by his girlfriend as her man bleeds beside her; also Micah Johnson’s reprisal sniper attacks on police officers in Dallas. It does not matter how much you’ve seen some of this footage, it still acts like a Taser to hope itself. So much of Unarmed Black Male is shocking, depressing and sad: the footage; the numbers; the grief of a mother, two mothers, mourning their sons; the anger of a community. And the picture it shows of a country divided by race. Divided to the extent that the witnesses – a group of (white) construction workers and the (black) Walmart employee who made the 911 call – see two different events: William Chapman attacking Officer Rankin, and not attacking him, respectively. Rankin was an accident waiting to happen and should not have still been a police officer, says his ex-wife and a former boss. A serious gun enthusiast, he referred to his firearms case as “Rankin’s box of vengeance”. But then, judging by this recruitment video you might think that was just the kind of person the Portsmouth police department was after. It’s like a game of Soldier of frigging Fortune, complete with metal-guitar solo, one of the most chilling moments in a chilling film. Possibly even worse is Rankin explaining that what normally happens in these cases is that you get three weeks of administrative leave while they investigate the incident, then you return to work and get a medal for a valorous act if that is appropriate, which it usually is. “Three weeks and a medal,” he says with a little smile. For killing someone. It might make you angry, watching. But James Jones’s absorbing documentary remains objective, open-minded and journalistic, allowing the events and the people to speak for themselves. And it is all the more powerful for that. In the end, Stephen Rankin gets 130 weeks – two-and-a-half years – not of administrative leave but jail time, after the jury finds him guilty of voluntary manslaughter. No medal.

(Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group) By Joyce Tsai | jtsai@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: November 5, 2016 at 7:00 am | UPDATED: November 5, 2016 at 5:22 pm OAKLAND — A deluge of pro-charter money that’s come into the Oakland Unified school board race has raised questions in the community over how much influence groups outside the city, including wealthy Wall Street and Silicon Valley donors, should have in the local election. More than $825,000 in independent expenditures have been poured into the local race, which boasts a dozen candidates running for four district seats. The vast majority has come from expenditure committees established by two pro-charter, education reform groups: Families and Educators for Public Education, established by GO Public Schools Oakland; and the Parent Teacher Alliance, run by the California Charter Schools Association. Their money has gone to support three candidates: James Harris, Huber Trenado and Jumoke Hinton Hodge. “I’m concerned that these people from outside of Oakland are having this disproportionate effect on our school board race,” said Ann Swinburn of Parents United for Public Schools. “Oakland parents, educators and our community have clear visions for the kind of strong public schools we want to have, and these folks from outside of Oakland are trying to usurp that decision.” Families and Educators has spent about $440,000 on the race so far, according to the Oakland City Clerk’s Office campaign disclosure website. The committee recently received a $300,000 donation from Wall Street billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and it has received more than $48,000 in donations from Silicon Valley investor Arthur Rock. The Parent Teacher Alliance so far has spent $395,000 on the race, according to the state Secretary of State’s Office campaign disclosure website. It has received millions of dollars from James and Alice Walton of Wal-Mart and Reed Hastings of Netflix, via the California Charter Schools Association Advocates, the political action arm of the CCSA. It’s this type of outside spending from big-money donors that makes it hard for grass-roots candidates to compete, Swinburn said. “They are running a very well-financed crop of candidates in this political campaign, with money from Wall Street and Silicon Valley billionaires, while we’re sitting here with 8 to 10 people trying to make phone calls from out of our homes,” Swinburn said. “It’s a very unbalanced equation, and the people who are going to lose out are the kids in Oakland.” However, candidate Harris said the critics’ emphasis on big money has been more about spreading “rumor and innuendo” than helping the kids of Oakland. “All the money in the campaign, it seems just another way to spread vitriol,” he said, adding that he has no control over what outside groups spend. The race has been especially heated in District 7, where Harris, a first-term incumbent, faces Chris Jackson, a former trustee of San Francisco City College. Jackson’s supporters have attacked Harris for having received more than $165,000 from the Parent Teacher Alliance and $60,000 from Families and Educators, while Harris supporters have railed against Jackson for owing $13,905 in fines and administrative penalties from campaign violations from three separate San Francisco Ethics Commission cases. To boost Hinton Hodge’s campaign in District 3, Families and Educators has spent about $35,000 and Parent Teacher Alliance has spent about $78,000. Hinton Hodge, who seeks her third term, bristled at the suggestion that candidates who have received PAC money are not running grass-roots campaigns. Her opponents in the race are Benjamin Lang, Lucky Narain and Kharyshi Wiginton. “I don’t know those (donors) personally, but what I understand is that those people want to make an investment in the transformation of education …,” she said of the affluent donors, “and they are another group of people who have similar values as I have around reforming the school. So I don’t rule out any of those things to try to improve things.” Trenado, a public school teacher, has received $43,000 from Families and Educators and $148,000 from the Parent Teacher Alliance. He is running in District 5 against incumbent Roseann Torres, as well as Michael Hassid and Michael Hutchinson. The tenor of the race has changed with all the slick mailers and ads, Torres said “Alas, now even a school board race has the toxicity of big-dollar campaign tactics,” she said. Trenado said that he’s far from the (wealthy) 1 percent he’s being associated with. “I have never met any of these millionaires,” he said on Facebook. “The idea that because they funded organizations that endorsed me I am now a sellout to corporate America is ridiculous.” Ash Solar, executive director of GO Public Schools, said that the unprecedented levels of spending this year are more a reflection of the fact that there’s been “a presidential election that has sucked all of the air in the room” and voters will be faced with one of longest state election ballots in history, and local school races are at the bottom of it. California Charter Schools Association Advocates spokesman Richard Garcia, said unions wield powerful endorsement and campaign clout and have spent much more money than his organization has statewide. “Just like unions have done for decades, we support our candidates because we believe they have the best interests of students in mind,” he said.

Updated: November 15, 2016 @ 11:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Life Entertainment Dining Buy & Sell Close AP The Best Reason to Buy Chipotle Stock Now… And a Bear's Response newsfeedback@fool.com (Brian Stoffel and John Maxfield) Nov 4, 2016 0 Image source: Getty Images Long-term shareholders of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) have endured a rags-to-riches...and back to rags story. After years of meteoric growth, the company's sales -- and its stock -- have been deflated. But does that mean that the company is doomed? Hardly. In fact, Motley Fool analyst Brian Stoffel, who recently wrote about why he was selling his shares, admits that he thinks the company will be just fine. That doesn't, however, mean that he thinks the stock is a good buy. Fellow Fool analyst John Maxfield, however, begs to differ. He took to Twitter following Chipotle's recent earnings release -- and stock drop -- to share his opinion. Why are #Chipotle's shares tanking? Because of amateurs. Buy $CMG at this price. You'll thank yourself in 5 years. https://t.co/zwtwFnBKfo pic.twitter.com/nXulpdkKAS — John J. Maxfield (@OneMarlandRoad) October 26, 2016 Below, John shares why he's so bullish on the company, and Brian follows up with a response. Chipotle will weather this storm and recover even stronger John Maxfield: It's impossible to deny that the fallout from Chipotle's foodborne illness outbreaks has been significant. Its profits fell 95% in the third quarter. Its restaurant-level operating margins have been sliced in half. And its same-store sales in September were still 20% below where they were in the same month last year. But the question that enterprising investors should ask themselves is this: Did these outbreaks permanently impair Chipotle's brand, or will the effect be temporary? The answer, in my opinion, is that the impairment is most likely to be temporary. As I've argued before, Chipotle is not the first popular food chain to be abandoned by customers after a foodborne illness outbreak. The same thing has happened to McDonalds, KFC, Taco Bell, and Jack in the Box, and even Costco, Wal-Mart, and Whole Foods. Yet ask yourself today, when you go to any of these companies' locations, are you concerned about contracting E. coli? To this end, on Chipotle's third-quarter conference call its executives offered tangible evidence to suggest that customers are indeed coming back to its stores. Nearly all (95%) of its most loyal customers have returned. And while formally less frequent customers haven't come back at the same rate, the burrito chain saw 30 million new customers visit its restaurants in the past six months. Finally, while Chipotle has long promoted the narrative that it's a healthier, more sustainably sourced option than its fast food counterparts, the real value it brings to the table for an ordinary Joe like me is delicious food. By Chipotle's own admission, this suffered in the wake of the crisis, as it focused solely on food safety. I'm no epicurean, but even I noticed the degradation in quality. But the chain has corrected this. With an aggressive marketing campaign on the horizon, coupled with a return to its primary value proposition -- serving delicious food -- I believe Chipotle's struggles will soon be forgotten by even its most ardent critics. I don't disagree, but that doesn't make the stock a buy There's not a whole lot that I disagree with in here. Lots of companies go through tough times -- and live to see another day. While I rarely eat out these days -- thanks to being the father of a three-year old -- I still make time to visit the local Chipotle when I can slip out. I've said before that I don't think the food scandal is the cause of Chipotle's (the stock, not the company) fall, but rather a catalyst. I think the competition will be catching up, and the days of comparable store sales growth (comps) of nearly 20% are long gone. Keep up with money news, sent to your inbox Sign Up!

The difference between my view and John's, as I see it, has more to do with the stock's price than with the underlying company's ability to bounce back. Currently, shares are trading for about 38 times expected earnings in 2017. I simply don't think that Chipotle will be able to grow fast enough to justify those prices. It's hard to find an apples-to-apples comparison, but when we look at other restaurants of a similar size and age, we see that Chipotle has very lofty expectations baked into the stock price. Create column charts Data source: E*Trade At the end of the day, the restaurant industry is a brutal one. The value of your brand and reputation are the only real competitive advantages you have. If you're the first mover -- as Chipotle was in its simple-menu format and ethically sourced food -- you can make waves. But eventually, you'll become a victim of your own success. Competition will catch on, copy you, and steal your growth thunder. That's actually good news for all of us, as it means more delicious options to choose from. It also won't spell the end for Chipotle's business. But as far as the stock goes, I simply think expectations are far too high. A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Ed Kaiser / Edmonton Journal Share Adjust Comment Print Canada’s Supreme Court ruled in Edmonton’s favour Friday in a contentious tax case that could have cost the city big time. “This isn’t just about Capilano. This is a huge win for us on assessment,” said Mayor Don Iveson, celebrating the news after a committee meeting Friday.  The split 5-4 ruling was about whether the city’s Assessment Review Board has the power to increase assessments when property owners appeal, and whether the courts should trust that board as the experts in determining the value of a property. It started in 2011, when the City of Edmonton sought to increased the assessed value of Capilano Mall to $31 million. The owners of Capilano Mall appealed to the board, a city-appointed independent tribunal, arguing their property was only worth $22 million.  But after Capilano’s owner gave city officials its submissions and evidence, city staff decided the property was not classified properly in city records — it was listed as community centre instead of a power centre. They also had rent for its main tenant, Wal-Mart, at $3.50 a square foot when it should have been $11.50. City staff resubmitted an assessment saying the property was actually worth $45 million. The assessment board decided on $41 million. Capilano’s owner appealed. Both the Court of Queen’s Bench and the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled in Capilano’s favour, ordering a new hearing. But the City of Edmonton raised the matter to the Supreme Court. The four dissenting judges said the board only had jurisdiction to rule on issues raised in Capilano’s original complaint. It should have ignored the city’s new submissions. But five judges ruled the assessment board’s decision to increase the assessment was reasonable, and higher courts should respect the tribunal’s expertise in property evaluation. The Supreme Court decision is final. “That’s a pretty big win for us,” said Rod Risling, branch manager for assessment and taxation. This year, 2,467 property owners filed complaints, including many of the most high-value properties. Most downtown office towers file an appeal every year, Risling said. Since the Court of Queen’s Bench ruling, the tribunal has not been allowed to increase an assessment, only decrease it when a complaint is filed, said Risling. On Friday, that changed back again. “We’re thrilled to see the Supreme Court upheld what has been the practice,” said Risling. “If they see an error, they have the ability to increase (the assessment again). … We just want everyone to pay their fair share.” An owner’s property and education taxes are based on a property’s assessed value each year. This year, businesses pay $1,912 for every $100,000, which means Capilano Mall would pay $783,920 if their property is still at $41 million. estolte@postmedia.com twitter.com/estolte  Delay on solving stinky pipes doesn't pass smell test for Edmonton...

Home World news Police: Shooting suspect says threatened over gender switch Police: Shooting suspect says threatened over gender switch Sgt. Jesse Salame Zachary McClimans told police he wanted to prevent the co-worker from hurting him and felt so strongly about it that rather than wait until after work, he went into the store and shot the co-worker. The victim is expected to survive. By: Associated Press | Pitsburg | Published: November 5, 2016 3:25 AM Sgt. Jesse Salame Zachary McClimans told police he wanted to prevent the co-worker from hurting him and felt so strongly about it that rather than wait until after work, he went into the store and shot the co-worker. The victim is expected to survive. Police say a 22-year-old man shot a fellow worker at a Pennsylvania Wal-Mart store because the other man was offended that he was changing genders to female, and allegedly threatened him. Zachary McClimans told police he wanted to prevent the co-worker from hurting him and felt so strongly about it that rather than wait until after work, he went into the store and shot the co-worker. The victim is expected to survive. McClimans remained jailed Friday on attempted homicide and other charges in the Thursday shooting in Hermitage, about 70 miles north of Pittsburgh. Court documents didn’t list an attorney for him. McClimans told police he’s switching genders. It wasn’t immediately known if he has begun identifying as female. Wal-Mart officials said they are concerned and looking into the shooting.     Please Wait while comments are loading...

Editor's Corner: This election, actions greater than words Leah Ulatowski , USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 3:52 p.m. CDT November 4, 2016 Buy Photo Leah Ulatowski (Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Like most weeks, I have enjoyed candid conversations with readers over the last few days—from people who have commended coverage of a particular topic to individuals who expressed concerns but were genuinely interested in listening to my explanations behind certain decisions at the Press. However, I have also navigated a few calls where the readers expressed great frustration before I could even greet them--usually concerning the election, whether it be coverage, letters or op-eds. And I totally get it. It’s been a tiring season for everyone, and we’re all feeling the pressure of a major change in leadership on the horizon. At only 22 years old, I have—like most—already felt the influence of politicians’ decisions on my life and that of my family, and that’s why I would never dream of telling anyone to be passive when it comes to advocating for causes or leadership that they believe in. However, with days before the election, I think it is important to reflect on the fact that, in the face of social media posts and heated political discussions even amongst friends, there are a variety of tools at our disposal when it comes to changing our communities—and as cliché as it may be, a little bit of kindness or a genuine smile can make waves in the days preceding and following this election. In Sheboygan County, we are so fortunate to live in a community where there are so many people who choose to invest in others every single day, even in little ways. I’ve had so many conversations with people, read so many social media rants and have been blasted with so many political ads this week, but the interactions that had a lingering impact on me were the positive ones. I remember a kind waiter at Field to Fork who had a little extra spring in his step and a contagious smile that made my party’s day. I remember giggling at a particularly enthusiastic Wal-Mart greeter in Plymouth who cheered me up when I was running errands at 10 p.m. after a long work day. I remember the awesome folks at the Sheboygan County Food Bank who lead our Stock the Shelves efforts every year. Sometimes in a world where we have instant access to public platforms for our words, we lose sight of the impact of our actions. I think when people see something different or positive in us, they become genuinely interested in what our values and philosophies are—what makes us tick. And I believe this invites real discourse about the beliefs that have shaped us rather than issuing passionate words that fall on deaf ears because we haven’t made any investment in our audience enough for them to care. This is the same approach that I have to remind myself of daily. It’s no secret that the media has been dragged into a negative narrative this political season, but I know that my interactions with the community are going to do far more for dispelling those ideas at the local level than if I issued a passionate column about it every week. I’m inspired by our local law enforcement who regularly go out and give back to the community on a volunteer basis, from major contributions like prepping hundreds of meals at Meals on Wheels to the little things like taking selfies with trick-or-treaters. That makes greater strides for the promotion of positive police and community interactions than just about any other approach. While we are incredibly lucky to live in a country that allows us to vote and be a vital part of the election process, we still need to let the cards fall where they may and that can lead to understandable feelings of having to let go of control. When I feel like I don’t have control of a situation, it’s easy to compensate in unhealthy ways. Instead, during this election season when emotions are running high all around us and our staff is plugging away at results stories with half eaten pizza strewn across the Press office, I want my goal to be thinking about the positive things I can control—offering compliments to the unsung heroes, smiling at someone, meeting criticism with grace, paying for someone’s coffee. I’m not perfect, there will be days that I won’t be little miss sunshine or particularly generous, but I can’t help but think it will be interesting to at least try and meet all the pressure next week with an approach different than the route some voters, and unfortunately candidates and leaders, have chosen.

Gothamist is a website about New York View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC Trader Joe's Apparently No Longer A Safe Space For Employees To Get Stoned In The Freezer by David Colon in Food on Nov 4, 2016 4:28 pm A new report suggests that stores like the Upper West Side location are more like Traitor Joe's. (Jen Chung/Gothamist) Trader Joe's has slowly expanded their footprint in the city with a reputation for being more than just a grocery store where you buy cheap bags of wasabi almonds. Friendly employees, employees who are maybe too friendly, and wow are they hitting on you as they ring you up set TJ's apart from its competitors in a city that's become more polite over the years but is still mostly gruff. How do they do it? As someone who worked there for four years, I can tell you that they did it in part by offering healthcare and more than the minimum wage to employees. Some of us were also stoned. Like, really stoned. But that loose, friendly atmosphere has apparently melted away since my days at the Cobble Hill store, and has allegedly been replaced by the cold and petty authoritarianism people associate with Wal-Mart and other corporate chains. The Times recently spoke with Thomas Nagle, an ex-employee who said he was fired for not radiating a positive enough attitude, and has filed an unfair labor practices complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. According to Nagle, managers at the Upper West Side store repeatedly told him that his greetings to managers weren't genuine enough to meet company standards. He also said that dangerous safety conditions and overbearing management led to a unionization push at the Upper West Side store. (Trader Joe's said in a statement: "We are committed to maintaining a great and safe environment in which to work. We promote an open and honest environment that encourages questions, suggestions or concerns to be raised.") Other employees who spoke to the Times anonymously reported managers who worked to keep employees from talking to each other, being yelled at for drinking water between ringing up customers, mysterious firings of respected employees seemingly for asking reasonable questions about store policy and turning the requested cheery attitude asked of employees into a Flanders universe-esque required smile policy. Some of these sound like familiar gripes. Drinking water before waving another customer down was a pretty easy delaying tactic when you didn't want to be turned into a human conveyor belt, but you had to make sure you didn't overdo it or a manager would suggest that hey, maybe don't slow everything down. If you were someone who could be counted on to be dicking around on the floor when customers were shopping, managers definitely would come around to casually ask what you were up to, as a way of telling you to get back to work. But that was an earned bit of prodding, and it wasn't hard to make it look like you were doing something if you really wanted to talk to someone. The enforced smile policy and attempts to legislate how cheerful employees are sound new to me, though. Customers always asked me and other co-workers, "Boy why are you so friendly?" The answer was like I said, the pay and the health insurance and the drugs. But it also helped that your bosses weren't constantly on your ass. While the employee guidelines really did talk about creating a "WOW customer experience," that didn't mean walking around with a smile for seven hours you were on the floor. Most of the time, it was as simple as asking someone "What can I help you with?" instead of "What?" when they asked you something. That being said, Trader Joe's employees have more asked of them, personally, than most retail jobs. Wearing a name tag with your hometown on it was a useful way to get to know co-workers, but felt invasive when customers would read it out loud and start just telling you about the time they visited and expected you to react joyfully upon hearing this. Being friendly to customers gave rise to a kind of entitlement on the part of the customers. On more than one occasion, I had customers ask me why I wasn't smiling and chatting and being a dancing monkey for them as I rang them up. It can be a tough needle to thread, but it was also really hard to screw it up so badly that they would fire you. Even in the throes of the recession, when there were plenty of bodies available to replace someone, grumpiness wasn't what would get you fired. Sneaking out of work during your shift to have a beer down the block wasn't what would get you fired, and neither was being visibly stoned. It was mostly being late, or just not showing up at all that got you canned. Damn, I think I miss my Trader Joe's job? Want more like this?

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     First Mix Mi Sale Lasts For 10 Seconds Only Posted: Nov 4 2016, 12:27pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News     Xiaomi Mi Mix is already a hit!! Xiaomi has created much anticipation among fans with its announcement of Mi Note 2 and Mi Mix flagships. Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart The company managed to increase the excitement further with their flash initial sales of Mi Mix. The flagship handset has performed well. It has managed to break Xiaomi’s own personal sale record after a 50 second long sale event on November 1. This sale is a perfect example of viral marketing but one cannot turn a blind eye towards Mi Mix and its new sales record. To be honest, one did not expect so much curiosity regarding Xiaomi’s flagship phone. The 10 second sale is certainly awe-inspiring. However we are not sure as to how many units were sold. Xiaomi’s claims it manufactures only 10,000 Mi Mix units per month. It is still quite unclear as to how many units were shifted within the 10 second period. Xiaomi put two versions of the Mi Mix for sale. The standard version with a 4GB plus 128 GB setup was priced as $590. On the other hand the Exclusive edition having a 6GB and 256 GB storage was priced $740. Don’t feel so bad if you have missed out on the flash sale. Xiaomi has promised another sale on November 8. As per our analysis the handset has a limited nature. Thus the Chinese OEM will not be maintaining such a tight schedule for too long.

Especially if you already use a lot of Google services, pitching $129 for a device that sits right between the Echo and Echo Dot in size might be a good choice for you. Now, the device is available for purchase from several retailers… Early this week, Google Home started popping up at Walmart stores, but even if you saw one, you probably weren’t going to be able to buy one until today. Our own Justin Duino saw one, actually, and after taking the device to the register was told that it shouldn’t have been on the shelves and that they weren’t allowed to sell it. That’s not the case anymore. As highlighted in a tweet sent out by Google this morning, you should be able to find a Google Home on the shelf (and actually be able to buy one) at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart for $129. You can also buy one outright from the Google Store with an estimated shipping dat of sometime around a week from now. If you haven’t already, be sure to read our review and check out our unboxing video.

The shareholder, among the company’s 10 biggest, raised its concerns in recent meetings with activist investment funds after losing patience with the company’s direction, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. The investor cited Whole Foods’ poor inventory and vendor management, high costs and failure to make the most of its unique appeal to millennial shoppers among the key issues. Several activist investors, who asked not to be named, said they are aware of the shareholder’s suggestions and are studying Whole Foods carefully. It’s unclear whether any have begun accumulating a position in the Austin, Texas, company, which has a market value of about $8.9 billion. “Whole Foods Market values the strong and open relationships we have with our shareholders,” Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail Friday. “As discussed on yesterday’s earnings call, we are focused on pursuing the right strategies to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term.” Whole Foods has suffered a steep decline in share price, falling by more than half to $28.46 at the close of trading Thursday from a 2015 high of $57.20. The company said Wednesday it will end its longstanding practice of having dual chief executive officers, naming co-founder and co-CEO John Mackey to serve as sole CEO starting Dec. 31. Larger mainstream grocers, including Kroger Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., continue to advance on Whole Foods’ organic turf, weighing on sales. Kroger has a market value of about $29 billion and Wal-Mart is valued at about $214 billion. Whole Foods is trying to fight back by offering more discounts and starting a new chain aimed at younger shoppers. Organic products have become widely available at U.S. stores, often at lower prices than Whole Foods offers. Food deflation hasn’t helped the company, as other retailers slash prices amid falling costs for items like beef and eggs. Whole Foods has said its new chain, called 365, will add to 1,200 conventional stores it already plans to build. That forecast was issued in 2013, shortly after the stock reached its all-time high of $65.24. Analysts have since questioned whether there’s capacity for more high-end organic grocers in the U.S. Go to MSN Home More in Money 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney AdChoices More in Inside the Ticker The rise, fall and rise again of Hostess Brands Inside the Ticker United to restrict low-fare flyers to one carry-on bag Reuters Costco's CEO has a simple recipe for making money The Motley Fool Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit Associated Press After Trump's election, stocks take a wild ride Inside the Ticker AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

State police in Greensburg need help identifying a man who assaulted a Good Samaritan and made off with a lost wallet discovered outside a Hempfield Wal-Mart on Oct. 17. The unknown person later used credit cards from the wallet to make $650 worth of purchases, troopers said. The wallet was dropped by a 38-year-old Greensburg man in the parking lot of Greengate Centre, police said. A second man, also from Greensburg, found the wallet and asked a person sitting in a nearby vehicle if it belonged to him. The person inside the vehicle refused to let go of the wallet even after a photo identification contained inside showed it did not belong to him, Trooper Christopher Cole wrote in a news release. The suspect assaulted the man who found the wallet “by digging his fingernails into his hands” and threatening harm. The suspect returned to a late-model Chevrolet Trailblazer, and a female driver sped away, Cole said. Credit cards from the wallet were used later that day to buy more than $650 worth of items from Giant Eagle stores in Hempfield and North Huntingdon and the next day at Wal-Mart. The suspect is described as a young, white male about 5 feet 8 inches tall, with brown hair, balding on the crown. Police said he has a scruffy beard and was wearing a gray, sleeveless T-shirt and possibly has a tattoo on his left arm. Anyone with information is asked to contact Cole at 724-830-2431.

Josh Swade knows that. And he totally gets why the one headline on most of the stories written about the documentary he spent much of the past two years making has been what it's been. Because, yes, Ben Simmons really did say the NCAA is "f---ed up." And, Swade knows, that's a great headline. "I understand why that's what has gotten traction," Swade, co-director of "One & Done," which debuts at 9 p.m. ET Friday on Showtime, told me by phone this week. "And that's fine. But that's only a very small part of the picture and the story we tell. So I just hope that, as a result of all of this attention, people actually do see the film and are able to take away everything that transpires -- and not just that one moment." To be fair, though, that one moment is a fascinating scene in a 91-minute film that provides a unique, if not unprecedented, look behind the curtain of what it's like to spend a year in college, in this era, as the next great basketball thing. Simmons, then a freshman at LSU, is buying bedding at a local Wal-Mart. He swipes his debit card. The machine asks if he'd like cash back. And suddenly it kind of hits him that he'd love cash back but that his checking account is nearly empty. Here's a guy who is merely months from signing a $20 million guaranteed contract with Nike. It's not a stretch to suggest, even at that time, that he's probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He's watching networks and universities use his likeness to generate revenue. And all of this, stacked on top of each other, is getting to him. It's what led to the quote that's created the most buzz over the past week. "He was frustrated in that moment," Swade said. "And we were there with him." Truth is, they were there with him a lot -- first in his native country of Australia, then during his final year of high school in Orlando, then during his only year of college in Baton Rouge, and all the way through the 2016 NBA Draft in New York, where Simmons was selected first overall by the Philadelphia Sixers. What you watch transpire through the film is a young person go from wide-eyed and excited to super-jaded and alone. Simmons doesn't appear to have many, if any, friends around campus. He doesn't seem to have a good relationship with his teammates. In one scene, he's held on the court to do a postgame television interview while the rest of LSU's players head directly to the locker room. It's early January. The Tigers had just won at Vanderbilt. Simmons finished with 36 points and 14 rebounds. And I've seen this scene enough to know how it usually goes down. The player enters the locker room and his teammates immediately swarm him. That's the typical reaction. But when Simmons enters the locker room, big smile, all joy, he's met with ... almost nothing. Some teammates barely acknowledge him. And you don't need to know anything else about anything else to understand why LSU struggled from start to finish and didn't even come close to making the NCAA Tournament. "I do think there was a lack of team chemistry," Swade said. "That's fair to say." Little glimpses like this -- and of Simmons noticeably bothered by the reality of being a target of national criticism while still only 19 years old, and of Simmons struggling with the demands strangers have for him nearly every public minute of every day -- make the film worth watching for any fan operating under the assumption that it's easy to be young and famous. But the questions you'll be asking when it's over are still the same questions people have been asking for a while, and those questions are these: Should prospects like Ben Simmons be in college at all? And, if so, should they really be held to the traditional standards of amateurism? Ben Simmons had a difficult season at LSU. USATSI No matter how you might personally answer those questions, know this: Ben Simmons was terrible for the one-and-done rule. From the start, he knows he's only spending one season in college, that he only has to get a 1.8 GPA in the first semester to be eligible for the second semester, and he eventually decides that once the first semester is over, in mid-December, he will quit attending classes because, in his mind, it's pointless. "Are you ever at school?" his sister, Emily Simmons, once asked via FaceTime, and it was a completely fair question. "I swear to God it's like you're a full-time athlete." In essence, he was. Which is not to suggest all one-and-done prospects approach college this way. Because they don't. Jahlil Okafor always knew he'd only spend one year at Duke, but he still lived in a normal dorm with normal students and seemed to enjoy the experience. And I know Kevin Durant looks back on his one year at Texas fondly, same way John Wall feels about his only year at Kentucky. That said, it'll never not be awkward for the NCAA to preach about how much it cares about academics when there's a system in place that allows a prospect like Simmons to basically quit school in December but play through the end of the season anyway. And the problem is that there's no obvious way for the NCAA to fix it without pushing back against the one-and-done rule by making freshmen ineligible, which, of course, is never going to happen. So it is what it is. Either way, my opinion is well-established. I think prospects should be allowed to enter the NBA Draft out of high school, and that student-athletes should be allowed to profit off of their own likeness in whatever way they can. In that world, the truly elite talents would never spend an undesired day on a college campus, and the ones who do would earn whatever the market suggests they're worth. Yes, I realize, it would be weird at first for some fans to know the point guard at Kansas has a six-figure endorsement deal with a restaurant in Lawrence. But, like everything else, most would get over it in time, and these circular conversations would finally go away for good. Problem is, I'm not in charge of the NBA Draft or the NCAA rules. So the system will, for the foreseeable future, likely remain similar to what it is now. Which, I guess, means this: the prospects who are comfortable with being an amateur for a year while waiting to become eligible for the NBA Draft should enroll in college, enjoy the experience for what it is and, if nothing else, chalk it up as a brand-building exercise that could lead to a larger-than-normal apparel deal. And the prospects who aren't comfortable with that should take a stand and refuse to play along with a system they deem unfair. I personally have no problem with either approach. I think there are benefits to both. But it would be fascinating to watch the next Ben Simmons flash a middle finger and publicly say, "It's ridiculous how the NBA has me playing a waiting game that's unnecessary, and I know most people like me just go to college anyway, but I'm not going to do it. I'd rather not play at all than play for a scholarship I don't value and a cost of attendance stipend that's pennies relative to my actual worth. So I'm going to spend the next year training alone. And, hopefully, enough future prospects will follow my lead in a way that forces the NBA and the NCAA to look at the rules they have in place and consider changing them for the better." In hindsight, that's what Ben Simmons should've said and done. And that's my main take away from "One & Done." It's that Ben Simmons shouldn't have been one. He never should've been one.

Arizona, Colorado and Maine all have ballot measures to hike local wages to $12 an hour, while Washington State voters will consider $13.80 an hour. All increases are to be phased in gradually by the year 2020. The pendulum seems to be swinging in favor of higher wages nationally, where 29 states and Washington, D.C., now have minimum wages above the federal level of $7.25 an hour. The federal minimum wage has been stagnant since 2009, but the Obama Administration has taken steps to offer workers better protections during that time period; the Department of Labor, for example, enacted sweeping changes on overtime regulations. In less than a month, on December 1, more than four million salaried employees earning $23,660 to $47,476 each year will be eligible for overtime pay. While economists continue to debatewhether or not higher pay is good for business, employers like Wal-mart, Target, and Facebook have offered higher pay to workers in recent years. And both presidential candidates agree that a raise of the minimum wage is in order: Republican nominee Donald Trump has proposed $10 an hour, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton supports a wage of $12 an hour, and $15 an hour in cities and municipalities where that is economically feasible. "Since 2000, every ballot initiative that's been put in front of voters to increase the minimum wage has succeeded." -Laura Huizar, staff attorney for the National Employment Law Project Wage advocates like Laura Huizar, staff attorney for the New York City-based nonprofit National Employment Law Project, hope to see all four state ballot initiatives pass next week. "State and local action is putting more pressure on the federal government. The growing support for higher wages across the country is showing that you can increase wages and improve communities, improve conditions for families and workers .... There's a strong message that Congress should do something," Huizar says. "In recent years, since 2000, every ballot initiative that's been put in front of voters to increase the minimum wage has succeeded." "If you are going to occupy someone's time for 40 hours a week, you ought to provide them with a wage that is sufficient for them to at least get by" -Judy Amabile, owner of Product Architects, Inc. In Boulder, Colorado, Judy Amabile, owner of Product Architects, Inc., said she's supporting the ballot initiative to hike wages to$12 an hour by 2020 from the state's current rate of $8.31. Although she already pays workers above the minimum, starting at $12 an hour, Amabile says it's simply the right thing to do. "We see that as a fundamental fairness issue," she says. "If you are going to occupy someone's time for 40 hours a week, you ought to provide them with a wage that is sufficient for them to at least get by, put a roof over their head and put food on their table." When she began paying her entry level workers more several years ago, Amabile expected labor costs to increase at the business, which manufactures water bottles. But costs per worker went down, while retention went up. People were working harder and calling out sick less. Andrey Rudakov | Bloomberg Getty Images An employee prepares a bag containing a customer's food order inside a Burger King fast food restaurant in Moscow, Russia. But not everyone on Main Street is behind the push for higher wages. The National Federation of Independent Business, a conservative lobbying group based in Washington, D.C.,recently saw its uncertainty index hit at 42-year high for small businesses, the owners of which are increasingly concerned about issues like higher pay. "[Small business owners] are very worried about hikes in the minimum wage, rising health-care costs under Obamacare. They can't raise prices, so they won't be able to absorb higher labor costs," says Juanita Duggan, President and CEO of the NFIB. Huizar disagrees, noting that more money for workers can lead to an economic boost, which benefits Main Street. "Businesses know firsthand that more money in the pockets of workers will mean more money for those workers to spend at local businesses," she says.

When the appointment finished, although we drove separately, we headed to the hospital parking garage together. As we chatted away, we mindlessly stuck our little tickets into the payment kiosk. We suddenly stopped in our tracks, stunned by the sticker shock-- $33 each! It cost us almost $70 just to park in the hospital garage for a few hours—more than my doctor co-pay! Hospital parking fees have always bugged me, but lately, they seem to have crept up in cost. With my husband being chronically ill this past year, I have driven to and parked in many different city and suburban hospitals, so I’ve seen my share of parking garage fees. The cost of many, as my father was fond of saying, is like highway robbery without a gun. How can some hospitals manage to give you gratis parking while others charge an arm and a leg? Parking fees can be a real burden to someone who has a family member in the hospital for a prolonged period of time or has to return for treatments often due to severe illness or injury, rehab or treatment of chronic conditions. Some hospitals validate parking, but the lower rates often are still high. If a ticket is validated and the amount goes from $20 to $15, most people feel like they’ve been given a real bargain. But if you think about it, the discounted amount is still outrageous. I think the few hospitals that offer their patients free parking should brag about it in their advertisements because it certainly is an amentity that sets them apart from the others. Hospitals are businesses. Would we shop at a store like Walmart or Target if it charged us to park in its lot? Would we go to a movie theater or bowling alley if we had to pay to park there? Skilled nursing homes and rehabs offer visitors free parking so I’m not sure what makes a hospital different.  I hear people gripe about the cost of the parking garages all the time, but nothing is ever done about it so the costs just keep inching up. Okay, I agree it’s not the greatest rip-off or over-priced service we may encounter in any given day, nor is it the end of the world, but it does make you temporarily annoyed to shell out the five, ten or fifteen bucks as you’re exiting the garage. I believe hospital parking fees may be tax-deductible, but that doesn’t negate the fact that drivers have to put out the money up front. Plus, how many people really bother to claim those little garage receipts, yet alone know where they are or think about them on the following April 15? Hospitals encourage family members to visit and help in the care, but I was thinking it must get really costly for parents who are taking shifts and coming and going all day. The fees can really add up, especially over time. And let’s face it, with the exception of getting dropped off and picked back up or Ubering or taking a taxi cab to the hospital, patients don’t really have a choice but to drive and park there. Weekly and monthly rates help, but they can still be a hardship to someone who is already dealing with the other expenses and emotional consequences of a family member’s illness. Few chronically ill patients, or anyone not feeling well or with a child or parent who is not feeling well, are going to take public transportation there. Can you imagine expecting someone who has just had chemo or radiation or surgery of some sort to hop on a SEPTA bus to stop at CVS for their prescriptions and then head home? Hospital administration often responds by saying that parking is not a “medically necessary” expense for them to cover, in the same way that they wouldn’t cover a patient’s transportation costs there. True, I can understand that, but a garage is on site, a patient is already there. I can’t help but wonder how a young parent with a sick child or an elderly person on a fixed income can afford those fees over a long period? It almost does seem “medically necessary” to make a trip to the hospital within reach of everyone of all income levels. I’ve often heard hospital parking garage fees referred to as a “sick tax” and there really is some truth in that. I have to laugh at the hospital parking fee charts that say the parking is free if under 30 minutes or under 45 minutes. Can someone please tell me the last time you were out of a doctor’s office and exiting the parking garage in under 30-45 minutes? Continued... 1 2 See Full Story I’ve heard that some of our local hospitals which have the for-fee parking do offer patients coming in for chemo and radiation or dialysis free valet service. And I applaud that service. It is courteous and kind. That’s the way it should be. Hospitals should also have some kind of assistance program that families can apply to if they have a loved one hospitalized for more than a few days or an illness that requires frequent visits, because parking day and night really adds up big-time. Hospitals offer all kinds of reasoning for charging patients to park. City hospitals will say people would park in the garage to go shop and run other errands if parking were free (I say validation cures this). Also, aside from a few seniors I know who live alone and periodically eat at hospital cafeterias, I don’t know too many other people who want to go anywhere near hospitals unless they have to go. Hospitals may also say parking garages are expensive to build and maintain, so if they offer free parking, they may have to cut back elsewhere on other services. I say “baloney!”  If they factor in the money for building maintenance in their budgets, I can’t figure out why they can’t also factor in maintaining  their parking garage. It’s one thing to price some people out of a mall, stadium or theater parking lot, but if patients can’t afford to pay to park at the hospital– well, that’s not a luxury destination. That’s a public health issue, in my opinion. There’s always talk about the escalating cost of health care and how people can barely afford to see a doctor or go to the hospital when needed. After my experience this year, I have to wonder, should there also be managed care for hospital parking? The Affordable Parking Act? ObamaPark? 1 2 See Full Story 1 2 3 See Full Story 1 2 3 4 See Full Story Last week, I had an appointment at a hospital in Philadelphia, and due to time constraints, my son met me there.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah Firm tied to polygamous group settles child labor case By Lindsay Whitehurst Associated Press Published: Nov. 4, 2016 12:40 p.m. Updated: Nov. 4, 2016 12:48 p.m. + Leave a comment HILDALE, Washington County — A Utah concrete company with ties to a polygamous group has agreed to pay about $145,000 to settle a federal child labor case alleging it put at least two underage laborers to work for long hours with little pay on job sites around the country. Along with back wages and damages, Phaze Concrete agreed Wednesday to pay minimum wage in the future and not to use underage workers or keep employees on the job for more than 40 hours a week, according to court documents. Federal attorneys have said Phaze drew teenagers from the polygamous group to work on contract jobs for companies such as Wal-Mart, Scheels All Sports and Hobby Lobby for nearly a decade. The Hildale-based company disputes the allegations but reached the agreement to avoid costly litigation, it said in the settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor. A judge must still approve the agreement. Lawyers for the company and the Labor Department didn't immediately return messages seeking comment. Two teenagers said in court documents that they were put to work at ages 12 and 14, spending 12 hours a day or more pouring concrete and operating heavy equipment such as backhoes. They were paid about $200 every two weeks, though sometimes the checks didn't appear, prosecutors said. Phaze has acknowledged that three teenagers worked on a job site two years ago but said it hasn't happened since. Authorities had no evidence of new problems. The case filed in August follows other investigations and court cases linked to the secretive polygamous group known as the Fundamentalist LDS Church. It's been tied to abuses such as underage marriage and discrimination against nonmembers of the church living in the border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Earlier this year, a judge found that another company affiliated with the church, Paragon Contractors, used hundreds of children, some as young as 6, as laborers on a pecan farm. The judge is now weighing what sanctions to impose on the company. Paragon has denied the allegations, saying children and families from the group volunteered to pick up fallen nuts for the needy. A jury in Arizona found this spring the town unconstitutionally denied basic public services, such as police protection, to residents who weren't sect members. Several FLDS Church leaders have also been charged in Utah with conducting what prosecutors call a multimillion-dollar food stamp fraud scheme. High-ranking leader Lyle Jeffs escaped home confinement in the case and remains on the run. + Leave a comment Like that? Read this.

Around 12:14am, police responded to a report of a suspicious vehicle in a parking lot on North Brightleaf Boulevard near Wal-mart.  Police said they located ski masks, bandanas, two guns and ammunition inside the vehicle. Tyrek Pierre Christmas, 18, of Clayton; Devin Javon Richardson, 18, of Garner; and Hasheen Arman Simpson, 18, of Smithfield were each charged with two counts of carrying a concealed weapon. The blue 2002 Toyota they were driving was also impounded.  The teens were then transported to the Johnston County Jail where their bonds were set at $5,000 each. On Friday, police spokesperson Captain R. Sheppard said detectives are investigating whether the suspects have any connection to the Oct. 25th robbery of Little Caesars Pizza at 1202 North Brightleaf Boulevard and the Oct. 24th robbery of Dunkin Donuts at 1006 North Brightleaf Boulevard.         Johnston County’s #1 Local News Source Email event information to Events@JoCoReport.com General Questions: Email our staff at Info@JoCoReport.com News Related Questions or Issues: Email our News Desk at News@JoCoReport.com Want to advertise with us?

Tracy Morgan made an appearance on CONAN recently to talk about what he's been up to. The comedian discussed the traffic accident that nearly took his life and revealed that he's forgiven the truck driver who nearly killed him.  While returning from an event in 2014, Morgan's minibus was involved in a six-car accident in New Jersey when it was struck by a tractor-trailer operated by Wal-Mart. The crash killed his friend and collaborator James McNair. The driver of the truck had allegedly dozed off behind the wheel after nearly 14 hours on the clock and 11 behind the wheel.  Related Content Love & Sex Tracy Morgan’s Wife Megan Morgan On The Call That Changed Her Life and Healing With Love After Tragedy Subscribe to our daily newsletter for the latest in hair, beauty, style and celebrity news.

Online court records show Zachary McClimans, of Sharon, is charged with attempted homicide and other charges for the shooting late Thursday night in Hermitage, about 70 miles north of Pittsburgh. Police said at the scene that the suspect recently stopped working at the store and may have had a dispute with the employee. Online records didn't list an attorney for McClimans, who faces a preliminary hearing Nov. 15. Police didn't immediately identify the employee or that person's condition, and The Associated Press could not immediately obtain a copy of the criminal complaint. After the shooting, the store was evacuated and closed. Related Topics: newspa. newswalmartshooting Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2016 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)

Published Wed, Nov 26, 2014  |  Floyd Brown, Political Expert Amazon (AMZN) started Black Friday deals early, but don’t count me in this year. I’ve been a customer of Amazon almost from the beginning, when all they delivered were books. I don’t know how many thousands of dollars of merchandise I’ve ordered over the years, but it’s likely in the tens of thousands. I adopted Amazon because it fit my busy lifestyle. Instead of having to visit Wal-Mart (WMT) and hustle from aisle to aisle… just to wait in a long line to pay for my merchandise… Amazon allowed me to buy with a few clicks and find the product at my doorstep just days later. But after making its worst business decision ever, I will forever boycott using the site. And I might not be alone… At first, Amazon’s premium service, Amazon Prime, improved on the customer experience. With no shipping and two-day delivery, there was no way to beat it. My Amazon purchases exploded. In fact, I was so addicted to Amazon last year that I spent most of Black Friday on the site completing my Christmas list. No need to fight the crowds at the mall. No need for rain checks. Heck, they even delivered my out-of-town gifts directly to the intended recipient. All of this joy is over now, however… Serious Lapse in Judgment If you’re a regular Amazon customer, you’ve likely noticed a change. Amazon dropped the United Parcel Service (UPS), and it increased shipping with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Amazon made a deal with the Devil, and the customers are now required to pay. Let me explain… When the deal was announced, the U.S. Postal Service thought it was the lifeline it needed to survive. Since bills and most correspondence now come via email – and checks are often delivered by Automated Clearing House (ACH) – the USPS has lost its reason to exist. Mail volume has plummeted and most of the mail delivered these days never makes it past the trash can into the house. They’re bleeding financially. Now, Amazon pays huge delivery fees, and it’s looking to build its own fleet of trucks and vehicles to deliver packages. Instead, it thought it had a match made in heaven: Take the excess capacity of the USPS, and make it the delivery system for Amazon. Makes sense, right? But there’s a major problem with the equation. Amazon is going from being the best firm at delivering products… to being one of the worst. From Pick-Up Lines to Picket Lines In the past, the United Parcel Service would leave the parcels at your doorstep. Instead, USPS wants to cram it into your mailbox. But if you miss your mail for a day or the package doesn’t fit into your mailbox, you’re out of luck… the parcels end up back in the dead letter room at your local post office. So instead of delivery, the Amazon customer has to go to pick up the package at the Post Office. That’s a line even more dreaded than Wal-Mart’s. Americans hate standing in the USPS line. And this is what’s happening to thousands of Amazon customers around the nation. Instead of enjoying the delivery of Amazon Prime, you’re now faced with the hell of waiting in the line at the Post Office. What sounded like a good idea on paper is a disaster for the Amazon customer. I wonder if Jeff Bezos and the other leaders of Amazon know what they’re doing to their own customers. If this keeps up, they soon will.

Comments (246) Lonnie Philpott says: November 26, 2014 at 6:29 am Not much different at UPS. Every time I order something it seems there is a reason why it cannot be left at the house so a trip to the UPS office is in order and their lines and lack of caring is as bad or worse than USPS. I, for one, get better service from USPS. [Reply] V Paiva Reply: November 26th, 2014 at 12:04 pm Not only is a trip to UPS as bad as USPS, but here where I live I have to travel to another city to the UPS terminal. There isn’t one in this city. [Reply] Heather Reply: January 27th, 2015 at 12:59 pm My issue with the USPS delivery is that to fulfill their Amazon two day obligation they mark the package as delivered when they never even came to my house. Has happened at least ten times. This is hurting small business owners who use USPS and then have to eat the coast of the first order. I’ve called the post office before and I know they are lying about the delivery and I say that I will report it to the shipper and they just say “go ahead”. They have to scan a bar code on my mailbox for mail delivery. Not sure why they wouldn’t have to do that for packages. It’s a total scam. [Reply] Richard Reply: March 26th, 2015 at 11:44 am I agree! This has happened to me as well. I was definitely home early and awaiting my package in the room where a knock or doorbell would have definitely been heard. Screw them. My item was cheap. I’ll just not pick it up at all and they have send it back costing them more labor as I order my item from some place else. I don’t mind picking it up if they had actually come and missed me but they definitely lied in my case. Mike Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 7:31 pm This has happened to me several times recently. Our post office here in Corpus Christi says they “attempted delivery” but I was home each time and the doorbell never rang. I have had to wait until Saturday, when I am not working, to drive up to the post office to pick up my package. They have lost a priority mailed package and certified letter as well in recent weeks. I ask for a manager and the are always conveniently unavailable and never return my calls. I am done with USPS, and if Amazon doesn’t begin to offer options other than USPS I will cancel my prime membership and be done with Amazon. WhyMeLord Reply: August 8th, 2015 at 2:02 pm I can receive a package from China faster than I can a package sent one (small) town over. FWIW I can walk to that shipper’s location faster than USPS delivers. The problem has gotten so bad that on our purchase orders we advise vendors that any package shipped via USP is at their risk. USP tracking confirms the deliver two or three days BEFORE it is delivered. Complaints to Postal inspector are ignored. A letter to the Postmaster by name sent to the Washington Office the address was provided by my congress critter) was returned stamped “Addressee Unknown” david Reply: January 11th, 2016 at 10:21 pm The barcode they scan on your mailbox has nothing to do with your deliver of mail. That is scanned to show where they are at a given time and would be scanned regardless of whether you had mail or not. I’m curious why you people have so many problems having Amazon packages not delivered. 99% of the packages that Amazon sends out are sent “carrier-leave if not response” meaning the packages should be left whether you’re home or not. I’d drop that on the post office next time you call. Leaving that isn’t even optional for the carrier. great grandma Reply: February 13th, 2016 at 8:42 am Two companies that I ordered on line from,one sent UPS,but had them delivered to the Post Office,the other sent Fed Ex,who they also delivered to the Post Office.I will not order from either of these companies again.Ask who will be delivering your package,but make sure you ask if that company will be making that delivery to your home. Mike Reply: March 3rd, 2016 at 10:19 am Exactly right. This mostly happens for Sunday delivery. They simply will not deliver on Sunday. They lie about trying. I have been home and nothing was left on the door AND it was marked “LEAVE” which requires nothing else. Magically, the next business day they leave it at the door. Greg Brandeau Reply: December 30th, 2014 at 3:51 am I’m not sure if it is where I live (LA) or something else, but both USPS and UPS are terrific at leaving packages at my house that won’t fit in my mailbox and/or that need to be signed for. In addition, both UPS and USPS allow you to re-route your package or sign for your package on their websites. My experience with Amazon and USPS over the holidays has been fantastic! Same with UPS. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 7:50 pm I live in Baton Rouge, LA. I have had the same experience. However, my friends and family do not. I think it depends on the letter carrier and their delivery schedule. My packages always come to my doorstep on time. I have relatives that have home security cameras. We have evidence of the letter carrier leaving a notice in their mailbox instead of attempting a delivery. As a result of this, they only choose the one day shipping on Amazon so that UPS or FedEx will make a successful delivery. [Reply] Dawn N Reply: May 30th, 2015 at 9:54 pm I chose 1 day delivery, and it’s being shipped via USPS. JJthe DAGGER Reply: June 29th, 2015 at 8:45 pm I don’t get this. I’m a carrier with the USPS and I would rather deliver a package then sit in front of your mailbox and fill out a slip for you to pick the package up at the USPS, haul your package around all day and then haul it back into the office. I really can’t comprehend why any carrier would do this when most days you barely have any room to move. I question the validity of your responses. Think about what I just wrote because this leaving notices and hauling a full truck of parcels back to unload at the local USPS doesn’t sound realistic. I think most of you just have an ax to grind and decided to talk out of your rears. steven Reply: May 7th, 2015 at 8:56 am I work for the USPS and we are instructed to leave parcels at the doorstep unless it’s not considered safe or bad weather [Reply] Charlene Reply: October 21st, 2015 at 12:40 pm Well, you don’t work for every state now do you! People are not going to find the time to come on here and make a crazy remarks for the fun of it. I have been a amazon customer since 2000 and postal service has slacked off for about a year now in my area. I don’t get my packages left on my premises even though its secured and of course I am the one who is placing the order so I am fully aware that I would not be home to receive it. People do work and that was the benefit for becoming a prime member in the first place and be able to enjoy the 3 day delivery. Even now requesting redelivery attempts are not made until after my 3 requests on the USPS website. I don’t see the logic is wasting gas to come all the way to my home just to go back and dump it at the post office. If this is the method that supervisors are telling their workers to get people to come into the Post office then its a dumb idea. I can have a tiny amazon package that has a scented oil in the box go back to the post office! It’s ludicrous. Sm Reply: November 28th, 2015 at 4:50 am Same here. Been with USPS for a year. Its a total pain in the a$$ to bring parcels back with me. The only way I do is if the business is closed or it’s a signature confirmation and they weren’t home. RachelK Reply: February 7th, 2016 at 10:33 am The issues we have with nondelivery are that the carrier doesn’t even bring the packages, because my spouse has met him at the mailbox while he was filling out the slip and my spouse asked where the package was and the carrier responded that he left it back at the post office. We’ve also had A LOT of packages stolen, even spoke with an 1811 who said they are aware there are a lot of thefts going on and there is an active investigation (in other words, tough luck to us.) As I type this, I’ve had a puppet that I ordered for my play therapy kit marked as delivered, and it never was. Sadly, most of what disappears through the Houston Street office is toys (both sending and receiving.) and identification (My husband was notified that his DL was being used by someone else, the DL that disappeared at the Houston St office 3x.) I will probably order my books and play therapy stuff through other sellers that use UPS or Fed Ex. My Amazon Prime account though, I may just not renew because we never use it like netflix, and with everything going through USPS (meaning I may not get everything) it’s not worth the money. Joe Reply: July 2nd, 2015 at 4:21 pm I’m on hold with UPS right now and Amazon and I are begging them to allow store pick-up as I won’t be home to sign for the package. Instead of working with Amazon to fulfill MY request, this is supposed to be about me I thought, UPS is insistent they most uphold the terms of their contract with Amazon though we are requesting flexibility to fulfill my request. I guess it’s more important that the contract, which I’m not party to, be upheld despite Amazon’s request then the sale be completed. I thought “the market” was about responsiveness to customer needs? [Reply] sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:45 pm The customer you refer to is not the receiver of the package; for the delivery company their customer is the shipper who pays the postage. Terry Lamb Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 1:53 pm I think this author has been smoking something! Here it is, MLK day and the USPS just 2 packages at my front door. I get excellent delivery service no matter how they ship my order so go boycott all you want! [Reply] Numnutz2005 Reply: February 22nd, 2015 at 6:23 pm Thats imposible dude….usps delivers NO packages on MLK day so if your going to lie at least make sense. Their holiday schedule is posted on their site too. [Reply] Mike Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 4:13 pm I work for USPS. We worked MLK day. Amazon packages go 365 except christmas and thanksgiving. Whether we deliver mail or not that day, Amazon goes. Paul Reply: October 12th, 2015 at 10:34 am its Columbus day, my carrier just made a delivery from amazon, spoke with carrier, she told they are required to deliver all amazon packages, my regular mail was not delivered today William Doores Reply: February 25th, 2015 at 2:36 pm Speak for yourself Mike. I can’t get a package delivered by the Post Office. I think it is mainly because my carrier is too lazy or too stupid to do his job. I NEVER use the Post Office to mail a package. Some of them couldn’t pour piss out of a boot. [Reply] Jo Reply: July 3rd, 2015 at 8:10 pm You don’t know what you are talking about, William Doores. Calling a carrier lazy or stupid…? Grow up a-hole… sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:49 pm This idiot William Doores needs to go to work at USPS and see what it is all about☺ Noah Reply: March 4th, 2015 at 5:07 pm My thing is if I wanted to go out and get something I purchased on amazon I would’ve just gone to the store. What I see is packages going straight to the post office for pickup so I can sign for them here as if I couldn’t do that if the mail man brought it here anyway. [Reply] Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 6:56 pm I am a Seattleite that is fed up with this “deal with the devil” Amazon has made with USPS. Amazon’s poor choice of shipping results in many lost hours & frustration to me, the customer. As a business owner, the hours I spend tracking down shipments, calling their customer service for refunds, not to mention the time I spent researching and ordering the items I chose to begin with – makes AMAZON the most COSTLY PLACE for me to spend money anymore. USPS will not even get out of their truck to walk a package to your front door. Nor do I have an option of choosing a delivery method that is reliable for me, the CUSTOMER. I just spent 45 minutes on the phone to cancel almost $700 worth of merchandise I purchased within the last couple of days. I received that same text message everyone else is talking about here: “Delivery Attempted: We were not able to deliver your Amazon package with Fujitsu ScanSnap IX 500 Scanner and 4 other items. We’ll try again tomorrow. Then it leaves tracking information.” When I log into my account it says I need to look for the Notice left on my door for further instructions. No Notice. Why? Because they didn’t even bother to get their lazy you-know-whats out of the truck to walk to the door. I have been waiting since 8:00 this morning and it is now 3:50 pm (PST) Nobody even ‘attempted’ to deliver and they couldn’t care less about the time Amazon’s customer’s waste away from work or other important parts of their lives as AMAZON & USPS continue to disappoint again and again. For condominiums (aka multifamily housing) USPS will only drop everything off at an office location on site wherein it is immediately lost, broken or only open during business hours – which are the same hours everyone else is at work! This is ridiculously frustrating and absolutely NOT “Customer-centric.” I used to have a lot of respect for Jeff Bezos and his philosophy to build a business by creating it from the customer point of view. Obviously he hasn’t googled his own shipping problems for quite a few years as rants about this same issue go back for years. This is nothing new and Amazon stands silent on the issue IGNORING THEIR CUSTOMERS. There are plenty of alternatives and AMAZON PRIME isn’t really worth much without the 2-day shipping guarantee. Buying from e-bay or a MULTITUDE of other online retail stores not to mention just walking into a local store is so much less frustrating and much more satisfying for my overall customer experience. Shame on you Amazon. This Seattleite is taking her business elsewhere from now on. You owe your customers a public apology for this fiasco. [Reply] Jen Reply: September 6th, 2015 at 4:29 pm Amazon bans you permanently from buying on their website if you complain or return items as well! Their attitude is basically you take what we give you regardless of what the terms were when you ordered, or you can stick it you-know-where. Customer-centric – haha what a joke! [Reply] Bmack Reply: August 27th, 2015 at 10:20 pm I work at a post office in Youngstown, Ohio and I ALWAYS choose UPS or FedEx when I have the option. I told my Postal manager that 2 Amazon Prime packages were not delivered. He just laughed! [Reply] Frank Reply: September 19th, 2015 at 9:30 am I don’t care how my items come ups or fed ex I just prefer not the postal service. The idiots that deliver my mail can’t read. On this route we have yelled for years about wrong house number or wrong street on the mail. For some reason they can’t read the whole address when you call to complain all you get is we got a new carrier again since this walking house to house is too hard for one to stay on the route. I can’t even tell you how many deliveries have been lost both that I know about and never knew. I try to get everything shipped ups instead of USPS at least I know they will deliver it. If I ship something out I have to go to the post office and pay the extra signature required just to make sure it goes to the right place. I laugh every time I see those commercials about the USPS dedication to your mail. I understand there may be mistakes once on awhile but this happens every week for over 3 years now. [Reply] K. Miehl Reply: December 19th, 2015 at 1:13 am I have lost 2 packeages for my Christmas orders within 2 weeks !!!! This has never happened to me before, with Amazon using UPS for delivery. This is Frustrating and Unbelieveable !!!! >:( [Reply] Vinny d Reply: February 12th, 2016 at 4:17 pm Placed order on Amazon. Product coming from Vegas to Connecticut USPS said delivery Febuary 11. Was sent feb 8. Just got email it’s in California. I’m dropping Amazon [Reply] Dr. Clark says: November 26, 2014 at 6:34 am I’ve noticed a few other things. Packages are being sent through FedEx and when the package reaches the nearest city they are given to the USPS adding 3 more days to the shipping. In addition, if a product doesn’t work, the customer has to pay for return shipping and the customer is charged for the original shipping on top of it. Therefore, I ended up paying $8 for a product I don’t have. [Reply] Veronica E Lowe Reply: February 2nd, 2015 at 1:20 pm that handoff only occurs when you use free super saver shipping. this article is about amazon prime. that said, however, I’ve had no problem with either one being left at the door. and have always received any packages with guaranteed delivery dates, on that date. [Reply] Namma Reply: February 6th, 2015 at 11:38 am That’s not true. I’ve been a Prime member for three years and the last seven month have been horrendous in getting a package delivered. One even was labeled Parcel Post even though I have never changed my default Prime Membership shipping method of 2 days. My last order was sent UPS Ground. Amazon is experimenting, however, they fail in that there is NO feedback and no way for the customer to insist on not using certain methods such as SurePost, SmartPost, etc., etc. WE, the customer, KNOW our delivery carriers strengths and weaknesses and Amazon DOES NOT. Nor is there a direct mechanism in place for Amazon to collect customer feedback about shipping and take the no doubt thousands of complaints up with their “shipping partners” as being violations of the contract, IF they included this in the contract. Hopefully they aren’t that stupid. If this continues I will quit Prime. There’s no point to it since the offerings on the remainder of Prime seem to fit a much younger demographic and are not to my taste. Businesses NEED to remember that they NEED the customer more than the customer needs them. If you doubt this simply search – DIY – and see the resurgence in making things on your own cutting out the merchant and the delivery nightmare that many have resorted to. 543 millions results are about what you will get. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 8:00 pm I completely agree. I don’t understand why the customer can’t be given the option to choose the shipping carrier as opposed to the delivery time. All three carriers are more than willing to negotiate and Amazon already has a built in shipping calculator. I wish Amazon would have the options laid out plain and simple, instead of letting the system or seller choose one by default. Example: What Amazon Currently Has: 1 Day Shipping- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) 2 Day Shipping- FREE (Guaranteed by March 15, 2015) Standard Shipping – FREE (Guaranteed by March 20, 2015) What I Would Like: UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) UPS 2nd Day Air- FREE FedEx 2Day- FREE USPS Priority Mail 2/3 Day- FREE UPS Ground- FREE FedEx Home Delivery- FREE USPS Parcel Select- FREE, $1 Back on Prime Membership Cost This way the customer has the option of choosing the delivery time AND shipping carrier. David Reply: June 3rd, 2015 at 8:28 pm Are you high? You can’t understand because your clueless of what the actual cost of shipping is, that’s made abundantly clear with this UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) USPS offers flat rate boxes at 44$ But you somehow think your 99 bucks means that amazon should eat 40 bucks. Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 7:00 pm Well said, Namma Tim Reply: August 30th, 2015 at 2:57 pm I agree. Amazon should allow the customer to choose the method – company, speed and cost – of shipping items they want. If you like priority mail, choose USPS, if you like UPS or FEDEX choose them. The company’s shipping matrix is broken. sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:57 pm GET OFF YOUR REAR END AND GO SHOPPING!!!!! THIS WHOLE COMMENT SECTION SOUNDS LIKE MY TWO 5TH GRADERS Steven Palmer Reply: December 5th, 2015 at 7:36 pm Just purchased 2 separate items. I used Amazon.com credit card, then it says use the free 2 day since I have prime. Dec 1. it says 2 day, plus I checked weekends are good, too. Friday gets here, no package. Then it is changed to Sunday. They apparently kept driving from central California, past Albany, Oregon another 1.5 hours to Portland. Then took the package all the way back to Albany, close to where I live. I gave them both my Box number and my physical address to make sure I get it. What could go wrong? They locked up my package in Albany and changed it to Dec 8. Now my 2 day delivery is locked up 20 minute from me and will be one week late. Screw Amazon, screw UPS! Screw Amazon credit card. I don’t need them. I have 50 CC’s, others with zero balance. Shove Amazon prime! 15 years of doing business with Amazon, and it just goes downhill. [Reply] Karen Reply: August 20th, 2015 at 7:35 am I worked for UPS for 27 years and recently retired. I can pretty much guarantee that UPS is not losing Amazon. What is happening is UPS and FedEx is contracting with the post office to pick up these packages in bulk from the shipper like Amazon, deliver to the post office and pay $1.00 for each package delivered that can be put in a mailbox. If an address is scanned in the UPS system like a large box that won’t fit in a mailbox and a smaller package is going to same address they are delivered by UPS, but if a small package is the only one going to that address it will be taken to post office for delivery. As drivers we didn’t like this because it held up the package for a day and customers couldn’t understand why it said UPS was delivering but it came by USPS. We could never understand how this could be profitable but I can guarantee that if it wasn’t UPS wouldn’t do it. Hopefully I have cleared up some of this but I may have made it more confusing. [Reply] Joe Reply: September 18th, 2015 at 7:37 am That is completely right. UPS takes packages to almost every post office every day. They give USPS packages that are not cost effective for their delivery person to deliver. [Reply] i hate people Reply: January 4th, 2016 at 3:28 pm No, you guys are dead wrong. I work at USPS, and Amazon made a deal with USPS to allow them to deliver their packages on Sundays. FedEx, UPS, and most carrier companies don’t deliver on Sunday but the post office do now. This is a contract between USPS and Amazon, and it has absolutely nothing to do with UPS and FedEx, and they are losing out in the end. Tom says: November 26, 2014 at 6:48 am Maybe you order things too small. I ordered from Amazon just last week, and UPS delivered yesterday to me. However, much of what FedEx has been charged with delivering by sellers has been coming the final step via USPS. Almost everything that has FedEx charges, USPS delivers to me. [Reply] Dennis Rogers says: November 26, 2014 at 9:10 am Amazon prime is slow delivering some packages such as book up to a week and a half, I recently recieved an email thanking me for purchasing a program on amazon fire tv which I did not want when I tried to cancel the order I was informed it would cost $35.00 for something I did not order. Amazon and I do not do business at this time. [Reply] John Reply: March 4th, 2015 at 11:10 pm This the worse service I’ve ever had ordering from anyone. I order some compression shirts which I didn’t know coming from Korea , still in route two weeks later and was told I have 31 more days to wait. when ask for my refund I told when I get my stuff back you get your money back. which I’m sure will take 2 more months are longer. Make sure you read delivery date. Not shipping date. [Reply] Kodster says: November 26, 2014 at 10:10 am I don’t have any problem with Amazon… I’m a Prime member, and I specifically choose a street shipping address in order to get the expedited, guaranteed shipping of 2-days, because I have a PO Box, as well, and that’s my billing address. I’m REQUIRED to have a PO Box in the town I live in, since I live within the city limits. The only issue I have is with FedEx… if they do SmartPost (deliver to the post office, who in turn delivers to me), I don’t have any issues… however, if they are required to deliver directly to my home? Forget it. If I’m lucky, I’ll see the package a week later than it was supposed to be guaranteed to be delivered. UPS… no problems, right on time, and as expected. Point is, we ALL have issues with the delivery systems that Amazon contracts with. Until people get it in their heads that they, as well as we, are customers of each other, and should treat each accordingly (that Golden Rule… treat others as you would want to be treated yourself), nothing is going to change. [Reply] Ben Ther says: November 26, 2014 at 10:35 am I applaud Amazon for going with USPS. I am much more likely to purchase more from them because of it. And returns that you have to pay for is totally reimbursed. You’re not out anything. This is one area that could use some tweaking. It is aggravating to have to return something at your own expense but you don’t lose out in the end. Get over it, Floyd Brown. What this really is is right wing propaganda. I prefer USPS over any other shipper. [Reply] D Reply: December 12th, 2014 at 3:37 pm That doesnt work for everyone and some areas, including mine, have a terrible USPS system and no matter what I do, nothing changes. When Amazon shipped with UPS, everything was FINE. Now the problems are starting…Having to go to pick up my packages at the local PO. Missing packages that say delivered but end up being, you guessed it, at the local PO, etc…Never once did I have a problem with UPS. It has nothing to do with “right wing”.

[Reply] Vera C Reply: July 16th, 2015 at 8:40 pm YUP this has happened to my boyfriend. He ordered from Amazon and paid extra for next day shipping. The tracking showed delivered but there’s NOTHING. It also happened when my friend bought me a hardrive through Amazon with expedited shipping and tracking showed that it was delivered but there was absolutely NOTHING in my mailbox nor anything at front door, porch, ANYWHERE! ! And OF COURSE it just happened to me again! Tracking said that it was delivered Monday july 13,2015. And I haven’t seen my package ANYWHERE nor was there even any notices left for me!! I think that the mail lady here COULD POSSIBLY be stealing the amazon packages. Or she’s just so much in a hurry that she could have placed it with one of my neighbors packages. I’ve seen her scanning A LOT of packages ALL ONE AFTER ANOTHER and not put them in the mailbox after each scan. (I was tanning at the pool, mailboxes for our apartment complex is in clear view from the pool). I’ve received my neighbors packages with my packages SOOOOO many times before. I have the courtesy to just hand deliver them to the correct address (knocking at my neighbor’s door, if they aren’t home then I leave it at their front door) . That’s not my job to do that. But I do that only because I KNOW how it feels to lose a package. .. the USPS here in La Verne Had no phone number to call and complain to. No 800 number …nothing.. and the people at the post office don’t even bother to check. When my boyfriend went in there to try to pick up his package that was never delivered, the lady told him to come back later so that she has time to look for it. He came back a few hours later and she said she didn’t get to check yet. He asked her to please go and check, all she did was walk in the doors and walked right back out and said she couldn’t find it…. it’s like WTF??!! YOU DIDN’T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING AROUND AND DIDN’T ACTUALLY CHECK ALL YOU DID WAS WALK IN AND RIGHT BACK OUT OF THE DOORS!! … no manager was available to complain to. .. USPS F***ING SUCKS! ! AND IS ALWAYS LOSING PACKAGES! !! ANY PACKAGES THROUGH UPS IS ALWAYS on time and I’d any delays.. you would know. .. customers are always able to know where their packages are with UPS. … I’M SO SICK OF LOSING PACKAGES THAT ARE BOUGHT THOUGH AMAZON!! It almost seems like a scam. Especially when you have paid extra for expedited shipping! And suddenly never receive it but tracking shows delivered! ! Soooo shady!! [Reply] NotRightWing Reply: February 6th, 2015 at 10:10 am Why would this be “right wing propoganda” and why do you prefer USPS get the business? THAT sounds like liberal ideology to me. Allow me to clarify.. The US Post Office is NOT a government agency. they are quasi govermental. That means they skirt federal taxes (oops, liberals should be groaning). UPS and FedEx pay enormous amounts of federal taxes (yay!). So please help me understand your glee over an inferior service handling packages? [Reply] Ron Reply: July 12th, 2015 at 5:02 pm I’m a liberal and I despise USPS. I’ve already complained to Amazon about the decline in service since they dumped UPS and switched to USPS.

The only exception is inclement weather (I leave my personal cell number so a customer can call me for a re-delivery the next day) or someone has requested that the package not be left. If you want your packages left at the door, simply go to USPS.com and request that the carrier leave the package. Now that isn’t so hard, is it?

Lately I’ve come to think of myself as an unpaid USPS employee, who has taken on the job of re-delivering packages mis-delivered by my carrier. This, despite having mailbox at my curb with two-inch-high letters with my street number. UPS messes up, too, just not as often.

Their prices can not be beat by Wal-Mart or anyone else. So as far as I am concerned I have NO problems and usually my shipping is free. I do not see a reason not to continue to do business with them. Maybe what you are ordering is something that they do not stock and has to come from someone else. If and when I have a problem then at that time I will contact them and see what they do. [Reply] Luke says: November 26, 2014 at 4:03 pm Fantastic. UPS has one of the worst services. On Monday I ordered a product from Amazon at around 1:00pm. I was expecting a two-day delivery (I’m a Prime customer). Guess what? The package came next day at around 5:00pm. Since USPS workers can access apartment buildings they can reach your apartment directly. This a problem for FedEx and UPS. The difference is that FedEx does allow you to pick up your package after certain hours. Good luck doing this with UPS. Overall, I’m glad that Amazon is not using UPS anymore. [Reply] THE POSTMAN says: November 26, 2014 at 4:11 pm Mr. Brown you can calm your nerves. The USPS has instructions (at least in south east Texas) to leave any Amazon package at the customers door, no matter what. So if you have the type of address where the postman has access to your front door, the package will be left. Have you communicated with your postman? Simple, DIRECT communication with your postman goes a long way to getting those Amazon packages delivered right. [Reply] LINDA Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 1:38 pm Hey Postman, how can I get my mailman to deliver? My Amazon Prime membership now gets me Delivery notices that show delivered but no package.

The new carrier I have can’t even close the door on the mailbox let alone bring something to my porch like the old carrier did. [Reply] Windy Reply: December 23rd, 2014 at 9:14 pm My post man does the same thing!! He is so lazy. He stuffs a package in my mail box that I have difficulty removing.

[Reply] Jeff W says: November 27, 2014 at 10:18 am I don’t know who the author of this piece is but his bias against the USPS is pretty obvious. Also, he is completely wrong about how USPS delivers. I have worked at the USPS for 20 years , the last 8 have been in a branch office. I see Amazon packages everyday, brought to us from both fed ex and UPS for last mile delivery. On average between both carriers about 500-600 parcels a day, many more right now. I am also a loyal amazon prime customer, and have been for more than 5 years. Gotten many things from them as well. First of all, UPS still delivers Amazon. It does depend on size since UPS started doing dimensional pricing. If it is small, they will probably not deliver. But in some cases they do. I see people everyday come in our PO, complain about our price and say they are going to UPS. They always come back. As far as your package delivery, we leave parcels at places all the time! I have no idea where you live, but unless it is in a place where the carrier think it is unsafe, they will leave that parcel. If they don’t call and complain. Personally I would rather have someone who cares about my security than just leaving it and going. Also, sign the notice left for you and they will received. Happens all the time. This is really another case of some anti federal government idiot who thinks life would be better and his prices lower if we did not exist. We are the only ones that will deliver to every address. That is why the others drop off to us…they can’t deliver to certain places and keep costs down. If we weren’t around, you would be paying through the nose or driving to a centralized pick up point for your parcels. And as far as waiting at the PO for stuff, management has cut our staffing back so much that we cannot keep our unit fully staffed. That is a whole different issue that I would love to discuss with this moron. Bottom line, we do it right and it most cases cheaper. If he has problems I dare say they are of his own creation. This article was a biased piece of untruths and blather. [Reply] Ron W Reply: December 27th, 2014 at 10:43 am Jeff says they do it cheaper than fed-ex or ups. What about the Billions of dollars the post office lose each year. If they had to make a profit like private business does to stay in business. These billion dollar losses have to be paid sooner or later by the tax payers. The USPS would be higher than private services if they had to recoup their cost of doing business and having taxpayers pay. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:19 am Usps does not receive any taxpayer money. Do your homework before you say stupid things. Since 2006, the Post Office has been legally required to pre-fund health benefits for future retirees at a cost of around $5.5 billion a year. The only business or branch of the government forced to do this. And none of the is taxpayer money. [Reply] Chas Reply: December 27th, 2014 at 2:40 pm Going with USPS major mistake, at least in my area. Prime 2 day takes 3 to 5 days using USPS. I’ve had a number of packages that “track your package” says it will be delivered by such and such day by 8pm, no way USPS delivers that late. Tracking say delivery attempted- couldn’t leave unattended. In variably the package appears the next day in or on my mail box which several hundred feet from my house next to a major expressway. A Macbook Air was left “unattended” on top of mail box in the rain. Found it before water had reached the laptop. Waiting today for package tracking says will be delivered by 8pm today, BS, won’t see it till Monday. [Reply] Chaupt Reply: February 18th, 2015 at 9:06 pm If the box is say 40-50lbs, USPS has either left if in the middle of my driveway so I have to get out of my car to remove it, or they put an “attempted delivery” notice in my mailbox and make me drive out of my way to go get it after standing in line to turn in the slip and waiting for them to find where the box was stashed and then get a dolly to roll it out to me. Amazon! This is not acceptable. And, yes, I have had the trouble of them smashing items that don’t really fit into the mailbox too! Had to actually cut one apart piece by piece to get at the item inside!! [Reply] Robbie Reply: February 21st, 2015 at 3:52 pm I don’t know if it’s regional or not, but the USPS carrier for my area will not leave any packages at the front door.

Things were much better for me when Amazon used UPS and I could get everything delivered to the front door. [Reply] Dan Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 6:26 pm I don’t have an issue with my carrier, but the USPS has gotten so slow in my area, its plain ridiculous. It takes 7 days for a letter to get from Florida to Maine. Packages that use the USPS take 3-5 days longer than with UPS/FEDEX. Why does it take 2 days for a package to be delivered by my local postman? They tell me it’s because Amazon and some other stores use palletized shipping. It’s great if you are served by a post office serving thousands, but the rural post offices get the stuff when UPS/FEDEX feels like dropping off a pallet. Small PO’s may not get a pallet every day. It’s all about saving money, and I understand, but deliver that slow should be much cheaper than regular FEDEX or UPS. [Reply] Jenna says: November 27, 2014 at 4:32 pm I completely disagree!! It really depends on what you have ordered. I love Amazon like you do. And my brother has an Amazon prime membership as well. I have seen Amazon deliveries coming from UPS as well. I agree USPS delivers most of them BUT I can never blame them for poor service. Most of the times, my package is left at my front porch (behind a pillar) and my area has low theft rate (central CA). And in case the USPS employee takes it along, I do not encounter long lines- cause I know the USPS office opens at 8am when there will be no one there. If I am expecting a delivery today and I am too lazy to get it from the post office, then I’ll be sure to open my door when the postman rings my doorbell. I think Amazon is amazing as usual. Local post offices are closer to homes for a reason. And if they are really that FAR, and the lines are really that long 24/7, then shop at Walmart. 😉 [Reply] Dwiniger says: November 27, 2014 at 7:42 pm So true. Waiting on a watch now. Lost tracking of the item after 3 days when it went to Ohio by mistake. I paid for Prime. Item only needed to ship less than 100 miles from origin to my house. Instead it left the state and nobody knows why or can tell me when to expect delivery. Amazon Prime? USPS? What a waste. Amazon literally laughed at me when I called them. They said to reorder another one. Brilliant advice! Defines insanity right??? [Reply] Steve says: November 27, 2014 at 9:31 pm Normal people would just get on the internet at USPS.com and set up a new deliver date, or just call the toll free number to get the item redelivered. Floyd Brown isn’t the brightest light shining… [Reply] Robert says: November 28, 2014 at 6:52 am This article is absolutely stupid. Anyone can simply call the phone number on back of USPS notice and request a new delivery date or just sign the back and write in when you want your package brought back out, it has a section for that on back if you read the notice then simply put in your mailbox and flip up your flag and they bring it back out on day you request. No lines, No fuss…..I love that Amazon uses USPS now. I seem to get my stuff even faster now. [Reply] Annette says: November 28, 2014 at 7:52 am Starting with Floyd Brown, some of these comments are way off. The USPS does not return the amazon packages that do not fit in your box. As a matter of fact, carriers have specific instruction to leave the package at the door step even if no response at the door. Also, as for the FedEx packages that USPS delivers, it may take FedEx a week to ship to USPS; however carriers are required to deliver no later than next day. Track your shipment on the internet and you’ll see exactly what I’m saying. Stop trash talking, particularly when you obviously do not know what you’re talking about. Facts First! [Reply] Shannon Reply: February 17th, 2015 at 3:10 am Untrue, they WILL claim it doesn’t fit in the box. I was supposed to receive a package today but did not. The tracking shows a notice was left that it was undeliverable due to being too large for the box OR that my box was too full. My box was empty of anything, including a notice of any sort. The Amazon customer service guy told me on his end it showed USPS would deliver tomorrow. Everything the author complains about in this post, I have experienced. I am also fed up with Amazon Prime due solely to their use of our horrible local USPS. [Reply] Amy says: November 28, 2014 at 8:28 am I disagree with the post. I have been using Amazon like you from just about the beginning and yes I have noticed that USPS delivers a lot more, BUT I have never had a problem with packages left by my door or somewhere on my porch if it doesn’t fit. NOT once have I had to go to the post office to pick up. [Reply] Lenny Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 12:48 pm Wrong! USPS leaves a little notification in my mail box stating that I need to pick up the package. I have to leave work early to stand in line at the Post Office. More than six times so far since October of this year. It’s pure laziness. UPS and Fedex ALWAYS delivered to my door. like most, I’m at work during the day when deliveries are suppose to be made. Complaining to my local Post Office hasn’t helped. Coming home to a package waiting for me at the door was what made the Amazon ordering process great. That seems to be over now. I have a large number of co-workers that have the same complaint. Annette, it may be different from your experience however, please do a few Google searches and it will become clear to you that this is a problem for thousands of us. Maybe YOU should get the facts first. [Reply] Jamie F. says: November 28, 2014 at 8:36 am You know what’s worse than having to trek down to the postal service? Leaving a package outside my backdoor during a rainstorm that’s been going on for several days! No, not a freak, oops, it ended up raining, a serious rain storm! I’d rather travel a few miles to get my stuff from the postal service instead of having it ruined and get a “you don’t have insurance” excuse, which Amazon does not offer. [Reply] Jesse says: November 28, 2014 at 9:15 am I loved amazon, but now it seems like every order comes from USPS. I have never not had a bad experience with USPS. Unless they stop sending it with them and go back to the old way I will not continue my subscription and just get off my lazy butt and go pick the stuff up at the stores. [Reply] Jan says: November 28, 2014 at 9:21 am I haven’t had much trouble with Amazon, I get my kindle e books from them. Never a problem. Once in a while I order a regular book for my brother who is in prison and they follow through. I never had a problem with returns. They always give me credit back to my credit card and a return label. So Amazon is like everyone else: some like them, some don’t. [Reply] chad says: November 28, 2014 at 10:35 am I work for UPS and the USPS Amazon packages are parcel post and are too small for a driver to deliver it. Many times we deliver to a post office, a huge bag of letters and “smells” this is a way to help the post office out with business, and it helps UPS to focus on priority mail, ex. Next day air, Savers, two days, and just regular ground. When you have an organ on ice that is being shipped to a local hospital…..and you have the latest Nicholas Sparks book for a resident… It is easier to forget the book and give it to the mail service so you can focus on the priority. Hopefully this helps some of you understand this more. [Reply] Dustin Thomas says: November 28, 2014 at 3:48 pm I like the move to more USPS. I get my packages on Saturday or Sunday now when I’m actually home. My block has parcel lockers for when I’m not. UPS just “hides” them under the mat. Let’s be honest. USPS is cheaper anyway. They are lowering prices while UPS and FedEx are raising them. [Reply] Tiffany says: November 28, 2014 at 4:41 pm I think your article is very bias and left out much relevant information. I am an avid Prime user and I have many relatives that work for the USPS. You did not address the fact that you could actually schedule a redelivery online and make a request for the carrier to leave the package at your front step. You also left out that if you have to go to the USPS office for the package, they have a separate line (which is never long) for just picking up packages. Here’s another piece of info your “journalistic” writing failed to disclose: one of the reasons why Amazon did not extend their UPS contract is because they did not meet the 100% tracking protocol, while surprisingly, USPS did. Your article is full of misleading information. I wonder what your intentions were in writing this article? Maybe you want to SABOTAGE Amazon? Sorry, that’s pretty much impossible but your article is high up in SEO when I did a search for the USPS. Guess that was your strategy? [Reply] Quasi reporte^^ says: November 29, 2014 at 12:30 am What a misleading piece of ‘journalism’. Parcels are left at homes, notified via email of delivery time, and not brought back to a ‘dead letter’ office. Sheeeesh, do a little reseach into reality before relying on myths and/ or propagand. You got paid to do this? Sad. [Reply] Kelley says: November 29, 2014 at 12:38 am I’m preferring USPS these days because with UPS it ties me down waiting for the package whereas with the post office, the package goes in the mailbox and I can pick it up at my convenience. Also USPS packages move on the weekends while they stay put with UPS, which means sometimes the package arrives more quickly. To be fair, sometimes with the post office the pack comes more slowly. [Reply] Wendy says: November 29, 2014 at 12:53 pm I remember a few years ago the UPS strike had a lot of eBay sellers unexpectedly forced to use USPS. Quite a few stayed with USPS, finding UPS wasn’t the bargain they thought it was. As to the headache of standing in line for a package, that depends a lot on the LPO and the individual carrier. I’ve had carriers leave fairly large packages on a sopping wet driveway and fairly small packages held at the LPO. But I’ve rarely had to deal with long lines there. [Reply] Mike says: November 29, 2014 at 10:22 pm Floyd, take a 2nd think! You are obviously anti-USPS! I could tell you stories about white & brown! ALL carriers: brown, white, and red-white-blue, have their problems! And, exactly, where do you go to pick up that package that requires a signature from white or brown? Your U.S. Post Office is right there in your community and open. Have a problem with USPS? Call them and let them know. It is USPS policy to deliver those Amazon packages, and on Sundays in many communities. The USPS recognizes packages are their future. They are not perfect, but still provide a great service to us. [Reply] James Whitmore says: November 30, 2014 at 3:30 pm I am a rural mail carrier for the USPS who leaves parcels at doorsteps when they don’t fit in the mailbox – in addition, the recipient doesn’t have to be at home for me to leave the parcel at their doorstep – unless a signature is required. Other rural mail carriers at the post office where I work (Appleton, Wisconsin) follow the same procedure – we try to minimize trips to the post office whenever possible. I am sorry for your poor service and suggest that you contact your local postmaster, who hopefully will correct the problem. [Reply] Jerry says: November 30, 2014 at 6:32 pm First off, the USPS is the most economical way to ship packages. Second, the USPS services every home 6 days a week and is required by the postal regulatory committee. Third, the post office is actually is in the black 6 billion dollars because of its increase in parcel delivery. Forth, the post office provides free insurance and free tracking of your parcels which was a service that we charged for in the past. Maybe you outta get your facts straight before you bash the largest and oldest employer in the U.S.!!!! [Reply] Chris says: November 30, 2014 at 8:58 pm Every time that I have ordered from Amazon in the most recent past, it has been left at my doorstep by USPS. Packages have also arrived on-time or a day early. No issues in Chicago with needing to be picked up. [Reply] EMW Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 6:23 pm I feel the same. I have received all my packages on time with USPS. With UPS, I have to wait for one attempt for delivery, then let UPS know I want them to hold it, then travel to the UPS center across the river at limited times for pickup. I don’t dislike UPS or FedEx but I much rather USPS because it is more convenient. [Reply] Patricia Lynn says: November 30, 2014 at 10:46 pm I have the exact opposite opinion of this writer. My main concern is security. I DON’T want packages just left at the door, and that’s what UPS does. They either knock and immediately leave, or sometimes don’t even knock. I MUCH prefer having packages delivered to the apartment’s secure postal boxes, or having them delivered to my door by the USPS or any company OTHER THAN UPS, because none of them have ever just left a package outside my door where it might easily be stolen. I wish we were always allowed a choice of delivery method, because I would never choose UPS.

[Reply] Luke says: December 5, 2014 at 10:52 pm I agree with this article entirely. Amazon used to ship only small low cost items by Surepost and Smartpost.

Those who actually frequent real news sources, you know those that actually post sources or links to major announcements such as what you are claiming will know that Amazon is not carrier exclusive. During times of high volume such as Black Friday and Christmas Amazon will expand use of carriers they don’t typically utilize, such as the USPS. Another bonus is if you are a Prime customer and they are late delivering the package you can contact customer service (phone, live chat, and email work) and they will extend your Prime membership by a month or you may get a $10-15 credit to use. If you are not a prime member they will typically refund your shipping costs if it is late and shipped by Amazon. [Reply] Metatrox says: December 8, 2014 at 11:58 am I’m sooo disappointed with USPS. I signed up for prime primarily for the free 2 day shipping. USPS is not guaranteed! Thats not what I pay for! I cant count on them at all.

[Reply] Gallie says: December 9, 2014 at 3:26 pm Local USPS has a new contract w/Amazon to “leave if no response.” Several folks in my bldg have had their items stolen, just left on a doorstep on a weekend instead of a pick up at post office notice. [Reply] Joe Reply: December 18th, 2014 at 8:47 pm If you get a USPS account you can give delivery instructions on the tracking number page (eg authorize to leave with neighbor or custodian, put a hold on it etc.).

Customer service is great; if they make a mistake they usually give a gift card credit. Exchanges and returns are simple, just print the return label and drop off at a UPS Store. My packages arrive mostly by UPS still with an occasional FedEx. Since Prime is free two day shipping, if they don’t get it out of the warehouse in time, they overnight it FedEx at no extra charge to ensure I get it on the date promised.

I have delivered thousands of Amazon parcels, it’s a fantastic cooperation between UPS and USPS. They fly them to us and process them down to individual offices then drop them off for us to take out, which eliminates the outdated excuse that USPS ruins every parcel. Most of their parcels won’t fit in a standard mailbox, but that does not mean we take them back to the office. We get out and take them to wherever the customer asks to have their parcels placed, typically the door. I have yet to encounter a package from Amazon requiring a signature, but there really would be no difference between USPS and UPS in regards of a signature, if they aren’t there they get a notification which they can sign and put in their mailbox for re-delivery (something ups can’t do, since they can’t use our mailboxes) or go pick it up at the nearest location and, for rural customers especially, their post office is always closer than a ups facility. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:32 am I also have delivered thousands of amazon packages to the door. And we deliver every package the day we get them. Even when UPS brings them late. And we deliver them on Sundays and holidays. And I have only seen one amazon package that required a signature. [Reply] Bill says: December 12, 2014 at 11:02 pm This article is clearly biased against USPS.. Maybe this guy has a lot of UPS stock? I am also a long time and frequent Amazon customer, and the recent change has actually improved my delivery. My UPS depot is on the other side of town, but I can walk to my post office. Also I have yet to have USPS not leave an Amazon package, but I have fought with UPS for years about why they won’t leave a package,. the surly attitude of their drivers, and the way they often smash packages. As much as I wish that Amazon would ditch UPS, I received Amazon packages in the last couple of days from UPS. I also get Fedex and Lasership delivery from Amazon, and have had only minor problems with all of them except UPS. [Reply] Gordon Reply: December 26th, 2014 at 11:27 am I haven’t ordered from Amazon since they switched to USPS but I don’t think they have gained anything. I have had packages delivered by UPS that it took a month to get them after UPS said it was delivered. It finally appeared out by the mailbox. In the mean time I let the vendor know and they sent me a replacement two times. I received 3 of the item before the first order was delivered. I never knew who had the first order. USPS puts the mail in the wrong mailbox until they are driving me crazy. A few days ago they delivered the neighbors mail to our mailbox. They have delivered our mail to neighbors a number of times. Once a check was delivered to a neighbor. It took a week for it to get to us. It had been opened and stapled through the check and the envelope to keep it in. Another time some medicine was delivered to one of the neighbors. Again it was opened before they gave it to us. I think the people delivering and the neighbors need to learn to read and stop opening our mail. [Reply] Michele says: December 13, 2014 at 10:26 pm Fact: Since Amazon signed the contract with the USPS, four (count them, four!) Amazon packages delivered to our Post Office box were immediately and without notification to us *returned* to Amazon as “undeliverable.” We have been Amazon Prime members since 2001. Amazon Customer Service was mortified. We have spoken numerous times to our post office staff, begging them not to do this, to simply do what they would do with any other package we receive (ie, put a notice in our box and we then pick it up). Each time they vacantly nod their head and say they will. Each time our Amazon (and ONLY Amazon) packages are returned without notice to us. And this time – the final straw – was all of the grandchildren’s Christmas presents. Amazon is trying to make up for the incompetence of the USPS by now noting on our account to ONLY deliver via FED EX or UPS to our doorstep. This contract needs to go. I’ve never seen a more worthless group of people. If this is a common occurrence, Amazon will drop them like a hot potato and the USPS will be a thing of the past. [Reply] Marc says: December 15, 2014 at 6:09 pm I’ve got the same problem that Gallie noticed – the reverse of everyone else here. The latest way Amazon is trying to thwart the problem of missed deliveries is to release the carrier from liability for items left on doorsteps. I live in the city in Baltimore, and have had numerous packages, including a $700 camera, stolen in the last couple of months. Unless you, or a worthy neighbor, see a package being left outside your house, it will be stolen in what I would guess to be a matter of seconds. Thieves just follow the mail carrier through town and their Christmas shopping is complete. Idiotic policy. Adding insult to injury, our lazy local mail carrier in Baltimore has since applied the Amazon philosophy to ALL packages being delivered. [Reply] Don Reply: January 3rd, 2015 at 10:46 am Yes, that is my experience in Baltimore too. Have discontinued using Amazon Prime because of its use of the USPS in the Baltimore area.

Called Amazon, asked for replacement. the item that was “delivered” will leave USPS and go back to Amazon in 15 days… [Reply] I Do Not Like USPS! says: December 20, 2014 at 2:33 pm Another argument against USPS that no one, it seems, noticed: USPS does its delivery run once a day. So, if package has arrived to your local USPS facility at, say, 12PM, but your postman starts delivery route to your street at 11:59AM, you’re out of luck – you will have to wait extra day for your package. UPS will run delivery routes several times a day, as long as there are packages to be delivered. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:59 pm Maybe you have noticed that USPS delivers to every house on the route…not just parcels like ups, fedex. If we didnt…maybe we could make double runs. Also your carrier sorts and cases every piece of mail on his route as well as loading his vehicle. [Reply] Paul says: December 22, 2014 at 7:55 pm I have the same problem but I don’t blame UPS or USPS. If I have a guaranteed delivery date for the 24th and I’m told UPS will have it delivered then. I then find out it’s not to me but my post office and I won’t receive several items until the 26th. I called UPS and they said that’s how it is . Guarantee date by them but not USPS. This is all back on Amazon on how they ship now. I didn’t know this and I have been buying part of my Christmas items from them for awhile.

[Reply] Richard says: December 26, 2014 at 8:31 pm Thank you, Mr. Brown, for bringing up this subject. And for those that are getting front door delivery of your mail and parcels from the USPS, I am happy for you. We moved into a neighborhood with new housing during the early part of this summer where front door delivery by the USPS is not available, by design. Instead, mail and parcels are delivered to a mailbox/parcel container clusters located at selected street intersections. I suppose it saves time and money for the USPS to do it this way. If there are no parcel containers vacant or if the package is over sized for the container, the USPS wont leave it, but will leave a notice in the mailbox to have it picked up. We tried several times to have them redeliver packages, but the problem of parcel container vacancies or package size also determine whether the attempt to redeliver is successful or not. When Amazon was shipping by UPS or FedEx, we would always get our packages delivered to the house, always. Now, we get about 30% of our packages if shipped via USPS. We’ve been Prime Members since 2004, and since October, we have substantially cut down our ordering from Amazon because of their heavy use of the USPS as shipper of 90% of our orders. Amazon should give shoppers the option of which carrier to use in order to work around obstacles like mail box clusters. [Reply] Tasha Miles says: December 28, 2014 at 1:22 am Amen to this author!! I too have been one of Amazon’s Number One Fans since early years. I also order all our small business supplies from them to the tune of 30K+ Per year. USPS is a disaster for me because we live on a rural route and we never get packages delivered to the door. This results in a trip to the post office which is 15 miles away and not well run. I can’t find a solution through Amazon. I’m willing to pay more and /or wait longer for my packages JUST DON’T USE USPS! .. but there is no way to opt out. Why a “can do” company like Amazon pairs up with a “can’t do and don’t want to try to do” government agency like the USPS is beyond my understanding. The results were predictable without having an MBA. [Reply] Calvin says: January 9, 2015 at 3:07 pm My problem isn’t so much that they are using the postal service (live an an area where we have the combined mailboxes), it is that they have increased the cost of Prime and are using a cheaper service altogether (USPS). For me it seems like they are trying to boost revenue and at the same time decrease costs. My Prime membership is about to end this January and I do not plan on renewing. $20 price increase for cheaper USPS package deliveries… no thank you. I can wait a few extra days with all the non-primies.

[Reply] Nick says: January 16, 2015 at 6:58 pm I’m not sure where the author lives, but at my house the USPS carrier places letters in the mailbox at the end of my driveway and packages on my front porch. Granted, I live in the suburbs and not a gigantic apartment building, but still the article is very misleading. The only time I’ve had to go to the post office to pick up a package is when a signature is required and I wasn’t home when USPS attempted to deliver. UPS and USPS are both really good about taking a note with my signature on it and leaving a signature required package as well. FedEx on the other hand is awful. They actually refuse to deliver a package early. Let me explain: say a seller uses ups ground to ship a parcel, that service has a 5 day guarantee. Many times it gets to the customer in 2-3 days, everyone is happy in this instance. Well, very recently I had that very thing happen with fedex, except those crooks actually held my package at a processing center for THREE DAYS before finally delivering it. I saw this on the tracking system with the message “package not scheduled for delivery today”, so I called their customer service department and my god were they awful. They could not have cared less, seriously. I even said that USPS and ups would never do something like this. Her response “well that’s our policy”, justifying NOT delivering it “early” and holding it to deliver on the 5th day. Fedex is also not good at all for working around “signature required” restrictions. I once left a note saying it was ok to leave the package at the door and provided my signature and telephone number, only to come home to a snippy “we missed you” flyer with “must get sig in person” written in pen on it. That fedex “smartpost” someone else mentioned (where fedex does the work from origin to destination city, then hands off to USPS for delivery) is another awful set up. That can often end up being a 8 day service in my experience. Needless to say I’d rather drive to pick up my purchase from the origin than be forced to use fedex again! [Reply] EMW says: January 19, 2015 at 5:56 pm This article is incorrect. The USPS has left several packages at my door. I have not had to go to the USPS to get a package.

Therefore, I pay the Prime fee but don’t get the 2 day shipping as promised. [Reply] TC says: February 16, 2015 at 7:06 am USPS is far better than UPS. However Amazon tricks you into thinking you are paying $100 for prime getting free 2 day shipping, while the truth is that Amazon is actually only shipping it normal mail or slower. They get away with it because they have so many warehouses everywhere. But it is false advertising. [Reply] TC says: February 16, 2015 at 7:09 am Many times packages sent by UPS still get dropped off by UPS at the USPS for delivery. [Reply] LW says: February 18, 2015 at 8:49 pm USPS is certainly NOT better than UPS for me. The postal service will not deliver to my door since I live inside a gated community and the USPS’s carrier union contract doesn’t require them to deliver inside the gate, so any parcel that won’t fit inside the small parcel boxes must be picked up from the post office — a 45 minute round trip. Super frustrating! I’ve started breaking up my orders into 1 thing at a time — sometimes one in the morning and one in the evening — to try to keep boxes as small as possible with hopes they’ll fit inside the parcel locker. Plus, I figure it costs Amazon a heck of a lot more by making them ship each item individually, so maybe they’ll reconsider allowing their customers to select their own carriers. [Reply] Tom Reply: March 11th, 2015 at 2:35 am A 45-minute round trip? Why don’t you try living in civilization? [Reply] Reid says: February 23, 2015 at 2:07 pm As others have said USPS carriers marks items as delivered to stay out of trouble for not getting their route finished. Then your lucky if you ever receive item.Next your left proving it didn’t get delivered and good luck with that USPS has no system in place to make sure carriers deliver package. I just had to go to Post Office to file a complaint about 4 packages that say delivered but weren’t. Well guess what they found all 4 in carriers truck in a bag with many other packages from up to a week ago that weren’t delivered. She had been fired they said and it looked like the packages were going to be taken home. No way to know how many end up in dumpsters or worse. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:45 pm Packages left in vehicle would be found the next day. I believe you made this up. Also postal management will scan parcels left in office as attempted because the clerks missthrow them and the carriers are instructed to leave them in a tub or on floor by supervisors desk before they leave. These packages may not be delivered until the next day. Try not to blame everything on your carrier especially if you don’t take the time to get to no them as your carrier. [Reply] Ace21 says: February 27, 2015 at 1:58 pm I am fed up with Amazon because of this. What used to take a few days to deliver a package now takes 1-2 WEEKS. Reason being is my UPS location is in a city 30 miles away. Yesterday, a package arrived at UPS, great, should be out for delivery that day. NOPE. Already gone through this once, I immediately contacted UPS so I could drive over and pick up the package. I was told NO, they are required to turn the package over to the Post Office in the city, which then sits on the package for a few more days ‘sorting it’ to be shipped to the Post Office in the city I live in. Once that finally happens, my local post office then sits on it for another day or 2 ‘sorting’ it, all the while the Post Office is telling Amazon the package has been delivered. EVERY SINGLE PACKAGE I have ordered that came USPS has stated ‘delivered’ when checked online at least 1-2 days BEFORE the package is actually delivered. Today, I just looked, and the post office is stating package is delivered, yet, it is still sitting in a post office in a different city from which I live in. No more Amazon for me if this is the service I can come to expect. I will pay a few more dollars to buy items as local as possible and if they have to be shipped, USPS will NEVER be an option for me as they are the absolute worst shippers I have ever experienced (of course that will vary city to city, but mine is terrible). [Reply] Tom says: February 28, 2015 at 1:32 pm My problem is that for large packages, my local USPS has been claiming “delivery attempted” even though I’m certain this did not happen. Twice in three weeks (original and replacement order) for a large (28 lb bag of dog food) package this has occurred. I was at home both times and there’s no way I (or my dog) missed any doorbell, nor were there any notices. I requested redelivery and the package goes into la la land both times (“delivery status not updated”). IMO this is Amazon’s responsibility. I have to go to the post office to pick it up, I might as well just go to the store. For example, I work for an IT company that provides web hosting services but we outsource to other data centers for the physical hosting. I can’t tell my customers “oh, your site is down, please call the data center”. I take responsibility for the vendors I choose, and Amazon must as well. [Reply] Kyle says: March 4, 2015 at 12:07 pm The business decision Amazon made is one of simple economics (short-sighted, but simple). Of the three major players (UPS, FedEx, and USPS), only one has no shareholders to answer to so that’s the only one willing to lose money on every delivery. Experience with all of these carriers depends, primarily, on the individual people involved (the driver for your route / your mail carrier). If you have a good one (I used to), then you might not even notice that Amazon made that decision. If you have a bad one (I do now), you’ll consider Amazon’s decision to be a bad one. The other difference in the carriers is that you have no recourse with USPS. My USPS carrier frequently scans the package as delivered even though he never even drives down my street (e.g., snow on the ground and no tracks whatsoever). Frequent trips to the PO have only created discord, not solutions. Sometimes my USPS carrier ends up delivering the package in another day or two, sometimes I never get it. Taking it up with the merchant is of no use because the tracking information shows it’s been delivered so I appear to be the liar. I continue to look for online merchants that ship via UPS or FedEx (without handing off to USPS). It’s becoming more and more difficult to find these because – as I stated originally, no one can delivery cheaper than the one who’s willing to lose money on every delivery. [Reply] Nevada says: March 8, 2015 at 12:31 pm Living in rural Nevada, I find USPS services to be the best option for me. USPS does not deliver to my house due to my choice in location, so I head to the Post Office daily. Using a PO Box means I know when I will get my mail and if I have a package a key is left in my box. That key is numbered and used to open a larger package box in the same area. I don’t want things left at the front door of my house. I want them inside dry and safe. Maybe instead of expecting free services from USPS people should purchase the use of a PO Box? There are no lines to pick up mail and it can be convenient. I’ve had really bad experiences with home delivery which included packages being left at the wrong house with Fedex and UPS and Ontrac (being the worst!). However, out of all three UPS is much better in following up with mistakes, but to pick up a package at their shipping department means a 45 min drive (one way) for me! I dislike ordering from companies that use anything but USPS and from my perspective, Amazon made the right choice. [Reply] will says: March 10, 2015 at 10:52 pm USPS leaves packages on the street here. They are too lazy to bring it to the front door. So we’ve had lots of packages disappear. Most frustrating is that we spend a huge some of money on an extra large locked delivery box, and they still are too lazy to open the door (its one way) and place it inside. Maddening.

Recently, I have had to return a computer case I purchased on Amazon THREE TIMES due to shipping damage caused by UPS employees. This is not an uncommon occurrence for me when I get packaged via UPS.

Ordered a two-day package that I needed as a gift and expected it on Friday. When I got home, happily awaiting the package.. all I got was a pink slip telling me to go f myself. I threw the pink slip away and waited for it to be returned to Amazon and instead got another gift at the store. The post office is open 9-5 (I’m at work 8-5, an hour away) and then open saturdays 9-1, which meant I either use my sleep-in day to get there early, or suffer the wrath of a dreadfully long and painful wait at the Brooklyn USPS office.

Troy says: March 25, 2015 at 6:15 pm I literally got off the phone with the USPS about this situation. I live in an apartment complex in a small town in the country. I ordered something from Amazon on Monday, with free 2-day Prime shipping. I was home sick today from work – perfect, I’ll be here to receive the package. About an hour ago (3PM), the tracking said “attempted delivery by USPS, notice left” at 9:30AM. What? I was here – no one attempted delivery. Plus, the notice that was left in my mailbox (not until 3:30PM) had the back crossed out – they won’t deliver even if I gave them permission to! Now, I have to wait until Saturday to get to the post office (they are open from 9AM – 5PM Monday – Friday…hmmm, right during my work hours too). To me, that’s laziness on the part of the carrier. Not the first time this has happened, and if I would have known they were using USPS to deliver, I would have spent the extra money and bought it at the store. [Reply] Al Day says: March 26, 2015 at 6:15 pm My experience is just the opposite. USPS delivers to my door while UPS will not deliver at all to my location. Packages delivered by the postal service are usually in better condition than those delivered by UPS when they used to deliver here. So I don’t agree with the synopsis of issues in this article. Amazon now has all their UPS shipments to me going back which tends to piss them off. In time they will just give us a choice or lose our business. All vendors should offer choice so whoever is best where you are can deliver for you. It should never be the vendors choice. I’m willing to pay extra to have FedEx or USPS deliver all my stuff. No more UPS for me. [Reply] Kyle says: April 3, 2015 at 7:46 pm I’ve made over 70 orders from Amazon in the past 6 months, them switching to USPS is a dream come true. I don’t live in an apartment any more, but generally only USPS carriers can easily get into most apartments, which is an enormous plus right there. UPS drivers will often just leave notices without even ringing the bell if it’s not safe for them to throw your packages all the way from the curb to your door. Tampering with legitimate mail is a serious offense, but petty theft if UPS/FedEx; consider the implications for packages that are obviously from Amazon. Finally, I feel like people complain about post offices like they do the DMV – have you ever actually been to one? Mine is huge and beautiful, and there’s rarely much of a line. I know not all of these things will apply to everyone but there’s not much to complain about with regards to the USPS unless you’re a crazy libertarian or something. [Reply] Larry says: April 4, 2015 at 12:16 am I’ve noticed this trend lately myself. I live in an apartment building in NYC and am not always home, but UPS would usually be kind enough to leave my Amazon packages with my neighbors, or at the least attempt re-delivery. USPS? Pink slip for pickup the very first day, without so much as a buzz through the intercom. I’ve missed several packages when I was actually at home because the delivery person wouldn’t take the time to notify me. Then I usually have to wait until the weekend to pick them up, only to be forced to wait in line for 45 minutes. On top of it all the employees at the local post office are rude and sarcastic, and actually raise their voices at the customers. I’ve already started shopping locally to avoid the dreadful post office, or I order items from Amazon that I know will fit inside my mail box (which they don’t always leave in there anyway). And the Amazon Dash button, you’ve got to be kidding me, who in their right mind would wait 45 minutes in line to pick up paper towels when they could spend 5 min for $1 more, or sometimes even pay less? Sure those dollars add up, but so do the 45 min. Would you rather have spent 5 hours and 40 minutes picking up paper towels over the course of a year, or $12?

There have been a few times I had to wait an extra day because I wasn’t home when the package arrived. But mostly I just have things shipped to my office – which is open 7 days a week. To be honest, I feel that Amazon’s deal with the USPS has added value to my Prime membership. Sure they might have kinks to workout, but I think it’s a good thing in the long and short run. [Reply] Vandy Reply: April 7th, 2015 at 8:15 pm I’ve noticed many fewer products are being allowed to go to Amazon Lockers, at least in my case. I order lots of business supplies, books, and clothes through Amazon, and stuff that usually goes to a Locker now must come to either my home address or my P.O. box. Fortunately, I already have a P.O. box in my city and I go once a week on Saturday mornings (if I’m in town) when the lines aren’t that long. We have a separate line in my P.O. branch for picking up packages ONLY. Doesn’t mean it’s not a long line, but it’s separate from regular window services. I don’t want to see the USPS go under. It’s an institution that should be allowed to run and I’m 100% against privatization contracts that the capitalists like Obama are proposing and now sticking us with, such as they just signed with Staples. Staples employees are not fit to run a Post Office. But then I’m a communist. Never underestimate the hypocrisy of capitalists, though. They’d sell their own mothers for a quarter.

I cancelled my prime membership and don’t use them anymore since they switched to USPS final leg delivery. USPS is a joke. They don’t deliver packages to my house because it has a long driveway. I’ve met USPS at the street and they hand me a ‘We attempted to deliver your package” notice. To top it off, the notice always says I can pick it up the next day at the post office, but 80% of the time they don’t have it ready so I usually have to wait 2 days after the ‘guaranteed’ delivery date. Also, this is a way for FedEx and UPS to offload costs onto taxpayers. As is usual with corporate-government corruption, profits go up, service goes down. Screw all these hucksters. [Reply] Terie says: April 13, 2015 at 1:36 pm For those of you complaining – I complained too. But, I took my complaints to Amazon and they put in my account to NEVER transfer any of my packages to the post office. Once they made that notation, I have not had any further issues with the 2 day shipping. Nothing is taken to the Post Office anymore. I now have to give that information to all of the companies that are doing this. I hate seeing that my package will be delivered a certain day and then discover it won’t be for another day because it was sent to USPS. Then it takes at least another 2 -3 days. Unacceptable. That is why USPS gets no business! [Reply] Sean says: April 17, 2015 at 5:12 am I would like to say that yes, the postal service has terrible customer service in my city. I worked as a carrier for all of one month after graduation from University, and the structure and idiocy of my local post office made it impossible for any educated or markedly skilled employees to remain there for any amount of time and keep their sanity. My “manager” called me every 10 minutes on my cell phone while I was out making amazon deliveries, causing me to be slower than needed to make these deliveries (yes, to the front porch.) The carriers that I was hired along with tried hard to get the mail delivered on time and correctly, but the constant berating from management to “go faster!!!” resulted in most people either cutting corners or quitting after a couple weeks. The system in place is setup for the idiots to eventually take charge, while the hard workers end up finding more lucrative work elsewhere. This all shows in the service that customers receive from their post office nowadays. I bet most of the people who are now having problems with their mail had no problems 10 years ago, and this is a result of the current system of allowing the inmates to run the asylum. The post office is a case study in what not to do as a company, how not to treat your employees, and how not to treat your customers. It is lunacy and idiocy at its finest and I don’t expect to see it around 10 years from now if they don’t make some serious changes in management. Amazon is backing the wrong horse in the name of profit, but they are only hurting themselves in the long run. The Post office is not capable of keeping it’s promises to Amazon.

I have received packages via USPS before, and I have to leave a note on the mail box to give them permission to leave my bigger packages on my porch. I don’t know if this is the case for any of you, but I’m not sure if they are allowed to leave packages without permission. I have ran into this before and now always leave a note when I am expecting something via USPS so that the post person knows what I want.

[Reply] miguel says: May 3, 2015 at 9:26 am USPS has time and time again missed my 2day delivery dead line. The tracking always says its out for delivery but never arrives that day. Then they update the tracking saying I wasn’t home but they never left the sticky note on my door which means they never even attempted. Then the post office holds my package for a day and attempts to redeliver the following day. So 2 day delivery turns into 4 day. This is the gunhill road post office in the Bronx. The employees there don’t care about their job and delivering on time. I run a business and use amazon prime as a means of getting my supplies. But without reliable delivery times I’m starting to question if i should find alternative means. When my packages get shipped via FedEx or UPS I never have an issue.

I have to manually try tracking it to find out that is at the post office and I have to then go pick it up. Most of the time, the driver just doesn’t feel like delivering the box and it sits in the truck. So many times, I’ve been home only to not receive the package and track it online later only to find out they say ‘attempted delivery, notice left’ to cover their own butt. In reality, they did not attempt any delivery nor did they even leave a notice for me. I’ve also try their online redelivery service with shoddy results. Sometimes, they don’t even redeliver. Last Christmas, they even lost a package from Amazon. USPS has completely flakey service, terrible customer service and no follow through for the actual delivering of shipments!

I wasted a beautiful Saturday stuck at home waiting for this package which was already late, because of course it could not possibly show up more than 24 hrs late (wrong). The last ten packages which I had delivered to work where handed off to my mail room a full 24 hours after the package was marked delivered. I will not be renewing my prime membership if they do not move back to using UPS. Amazon was great and refunded my shipment.

Problem is the mailboxes for the development are in a room that locks at 7pm daily and isn’t open on Sunday’s. What this means for me is that I no longer get my Amazon prime items delivered to my door. And if I can’t make it to the mailroom by 7 (I work 12 hr shifts) I won’t get my prime items for days!!. I asked the postal delivery person to please deliver Amazon items to my house. I got a VERY Stern no, that is what the larger mailboxes are in the mail room. Postmaster said the same thing.

If you get a slip just go online and request redelivery [Reply] John Reply: September 29th, 2015 at 12:39 am Requesting redelivery does nothing. My USPS carrier is refusing to deliver packages he deems too heavy. I know this because of the last package he refused to deliver. I filed a complaint and they fessed up that he said the package was too heavy, but still refused to deliver it. Which is odd, because normal carriers like UPS or FedEx use things like hand carts to move around heavy packages. I also doubt the women at the front desk of the post office are going to move the package around any easier than the postal carrier could. Funny how the front desk staff at the post office have to move the heavy package around, but the actual carrier doesn’t. So on this latest package, Saturday(2 days ago), the carrier lied and claimed there was no secure place to deliver on the delivery slip. Of course I had two USPS packages scheduled for delivery on Saturday. The heavy one was not delivered at around 8am, just the slip was left. The lighter one was delivered around 2 and left on my porch without issue. So much for a lack of a secure location. I filed for redelivery for today and instead of getting my package the status on Amazon updated to “Sorry, your package is delayed because of an issue with the carrier.” Even when the carrier gets called out, they still feel comfortable refusing to deliver packages. Very nice job security, you can’t get fired for refusing to do your job. I know I am never going to see that package from Amazon, it was prime pantry, so maybe Amazon will do something since they want prime pantry to work. Last time they resent the heavy item and laughably it was resent with USPS when Amazon said they would put a note on the order to use a different carrier. But it got delivered on a Sunday and I think they have different people delivering on Sunday, so that time the carrier left it on my porch. With USPS it is simply up to the carrier. Some people have carriers that deliver anything and some people have carriers that refuse to deliver everything. It is hit or miss. I filed a complaint about the fact that the carrier lied by saying there was no secure location, at the very least if the carrier is refusing to deliver because the item is too heavy, they need to put that real reason the delivery slip so Amazon knows it is a carrier issue. It is annoying to have to explain this to Amazon when Amazon’s system is telling them there was no secure location, it makes the customer(me) look bad. USPS should not be lying on these delivery slips. So that is where I am. I can only get light packages from Amazon. If anything is heavy and comes via USPS, there are no guarantees I will get it. My only question is how long will Amazon let me order before they just kick me off despite the fact that they are the ones who chose the carrier? [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:49 pm Any carrier, regardless of the company they work for should be instantly terminated for refusing to deliver a package. Job description shows up to 70 lbs lifting. If carrier has some sort of disability or restrictions other qualified employee should deliver your package. If your postmaster does not take care of this problem call the Senate. You will see a difference. Shame on anyone out there who works and does not care about customers. You are customer as well and treat people way you want to be treated unless you are real JERK. Sorry but it is what it is!

[Reply] matt Reply: July 3rd, 2015 at 5:16 pm Thank you for beating me to this!!! I love how he writes the post office couldn’t survive without Amazon. People don’t realize the post office was forced to payout future employee retirements. What business wouldn’t take a hit when being forced to do that? It is also one of the most reliable companies in the world. [Reply] Nikki says: July 2, 2015 at 5:53 pm My UPS and Fed Ex deliveries are delivered right to the door always. The Post Office hangs everything in a sack swinging off my rural mailbox out on the road. It is over a city block away from my house and they leave stuff there in a plastic bag in the pouring rain or whatever. I can’t even see it’s there plus anyone driving the road can just stop and steal it. A lot of stuff has gotten wet and been ruined. I’m elderly and am unable to walk or drive to my box and have to wait for relatives to pick stuff up for me. It’s very unkind as I’ve known the mailman all his life. Guess he doesn’t care. [Reply] dave Reply: September 22nd, 2015 at 12:51 am Nikki, you can request your mail and packages be delivered to your door because of health reasons. We have folks who are disabled or aged who we will go right up the driveway and deliver to your house everyday. There is a form to be filled out from your postmaster, but when approved we do what is called a dismount, and bring mail to you so you do not have to go to mailbox. Hopefully this helps! [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:42 pm Nikki, Rural Letter Carrier should never leave box hanging on the post or your mailbox. If you are less than half mile away from the box package should be delivered to your door unless can fit in the box. If your carrier does not care, consumer affair cares. Also, like Tom said get letter from your doctor and all your mail, (not just packages) will and should be delivered to your door. It is called HARDSHIP and can not be denied. [Reply] Tom says: July 3, 2015 at 10:35 pm I am a letter carrier in Spokane, Washington with 28 years experience. In the last year and a half we have seen a huge increase in Amazon packages, and exactly a year ago we started delivering Amazon on Sunday, using temp carriers. Now that nearly every package has a tracking barcode, it has become painful for us to not give good, on-time service, because if we don’t, the supervisor may hear about it on the phone, then the carrier will hear it, and no one likes to hear customer complaints, especially from the people that we serve and interact with every day. Our scanners now upload instantly, and customers can go to the website and track their packages in real time. One of the strengths of the ol’ post office is the national forwarding system. It is not uncommon for someone who has recently moved, to order a package from Amazon or eBay, for example, and forget to give them their new address, resulting in the package going to the postal unit that delivers to their old address. (I see this happen every month.) It takes a few extra days, and there might be a forwarding charge, but it does usually get forwarded, whereas if UPS or FedEx get such a package, they will deliver it erroneously and then will probably get to go pick it up again (if the new people give it back), and return it. I have nothing against UPS or FedEx. They have their respective strengths as well. UPS rates are much higher than USPS rates for packages under ten pounds. There seems to be a large percentage of the public who don’t notice that when they ship via UPS, UPS takes its profit and then farms the package out to USPS to deliver at the lower rate. From the viewpoint of UPS, this looks like a really good deal. From the viewpoint of customers, it does not look like a good deal, or it should not, anyway. The problem with all delivery companies is that they use people to do the work. Not all people care about the customers they serve. I certainly do, and want to give the best service possible every day to everyone on my route. We just heard an inside word that Amazon is about to terminate using FedEx and UPS for the most part and use mostly USPS. This will cause some problems with people who use P.O. boxes for their mail, and it will be interesting to see how this is solved. [Reply] Stephen Walsh says: July 20, 2015 at 1:03 pm I’ve accepted the fact that I will never receive an Amazon package delivered via USPS on a Sunday. My local post office uses the tactic of saying they delivered it in the system so Amazon thinks it was delivered on Sunday, but the package isn’t placed on my doorstep until the following day. [Reply] Melinda Miller says: August 3, 2015 at 8:19 pm To the hardworking dedicated postal workers who have posted, thank-you for your excellent commitment to service. However, I believe it does matter where you live whether you get good USPS service or not. UPS and FedEx have the same issues. If the Postmaster of the local post office don’t care and follow-up issues and complaints, why should the delivery personnel care? There are lazy people in all businesses. You may think people are crazy with some of their complaints of non-delivery but they really do happen exactly the way they say they do. I ordered something for my daughter and it went “out for delivery” never to be seen again. The next thing I mailed noted out for delivery on a Monday and a tag for postage due showed up in her box on Friday, she works from home. A letter posted to her in her state took 5 business days to arrive. She can go 3 days without any mail and then get a large pile. I, on the other hand have excellent mail service. People make the difference in the service, not the organization. [Reply] Lee says: August 9, 2015 at 10:00 pm Well I just got my first taste of the awesome USPS /Amazon partnership! Three different deliveries show as “delivered” to “front porch/door” on the USPS tracking site, but not one package on my porch and I have been home all day doing work around the house, I would have either heard the door or have seen the packages (in fact I believe I was walking my dog right out front at the time!). USPS service has been poor in my area, lots of mis-delivered mail and they have lost two “priority” packages of mine in the last few year. And as others have noted, they are a unaccountable. It’s bad news for Amazon, the biggest reason of all I have been such a huge customer is the shipping. I like the fact you can see the date something will be delivered and know you can count on it. I’m willing pay extra sometimes for a product just so I can have the ease and confidence of shipping. The author is correct, they made a deal with the devil and have destroyed their core competency by teaming up with worst delivery service on earth. [Reply] Randy K says: August 20, 2015 at 11:01 am The USPS is responsible enough to ensure that your package isn’t stolen, and according to this “article” that’s bad for the customer? If the customer leaves a not for the mailman that says “Please leave all packages at back door” or a similar note, then the package will be left there. This was obviously written by a UPS employee that feels threatened. A strong Post Office is good for the American people. UPS has to make a profit to keep their shareholders happy, they don’t care about the customer only the bottom line. For the Post Office, the customer IS the shareholder so they have an incentive to make the customer happy. Does UPS deliver to every house? NO, they only want the high profit stops. How about the Post Office? YES, it’s called “universal service” and is protected by the US constitution. As far as the false statement about the “Dead Letter Office” that’s total B.S., mail only goes there if it cannot be returned to sender because there is not return address on the package. [Reply] Matt says: September 22, 2015 at 10:44 pm I found this thread because of the huge problems I’ve been having with USPS and Amazon. The packages get in a weird place where they never arrive anywhere, they leave Amazon never to be seen again. Fortunately, Amazon has been good and sent the items next-day FedEx (when I ALWAYS get them!) Can’t be cheap for Amazon! In fact, last time, they even comped the item and sent it next day. I think Amazon is starting to see the light. USPS is having problems. My magazines were always a few days late (weekly magazines). Now they are weeks late. Sometimes multiple weeks of a weekly magazine will show up at the same time. [Reply] Boss says: October 8, 2015 at 9:23 pm With respect to all of you, I have to disagree for some of the issues. In Rural America USPS is still best option to get packages whether from Amazon, Ebay, or anyone else in the world. Billions of packages are being processed trough different distribution USPS facilities. Every package dropped to local Post Offices have to be delivered same day. Also Holiday and Sundays delivery are available. Amazon premium packages are delivered by unmarked vehicles mostly rental and these guys are blowing up stop signs and traffic lights like crazy. Worst and dangerous delivery services ever. When it comes to magazines again is distribution facility. If you have problem with USPS you should not post it here; call consumer affair, Congress or Senate Offices and your problem will be solved 100%. No one likes to have bad feedback but Amazon delivery packages are bad for customers not for USPS. USPS is still most trusted federal agency. All USPS employee went to extended background check. Best wishes and better delivery to all of US. [Reply] schnauzer says: October 27, 2015 at 2:44 pm I have a one for all of you. I ordered an item that was supposed to be delivered on Sunday, 10/25/2015. Well, it never made it, but that is par for the course when the USPS is involved. So I waited to see if it would arrive late. Today the USPS truck pulls into our driveway, and the driver TELLS ME she delivered it Sunday, to the WRONG address; then she asks me, if I eventually received it ok. While Amazon isn’t the problem here, the USPS is. I went in and cancelled all my future orders with Amazon, and I will buy from whatever website, or local retailer, where I don’t have to deal with USPS. Imagine that, delivered to WRONG address, the the USPS drivers ASKS ME if I received it ok. Hey – who is the delivery person here, anyway?! [Reply] Clinton Dawkins says: November 21, 2015 at 3:37 pm Bad info. The post office would be financially strong if they weren’t held to pension prepayments that no company is required to do. [Reply] Sammy says: November 29, 2015 at 9:44 pm I used to love Amazon. I have purchased over 800 orders from them over the last 10 years. USPS is so terrible. I have had numerous packages lost this year. I got 100% refunds, but it is such a pain now that I would prefer to have guaranteed commercial shipper NOT USPS. [Reply] Samuel says: December 2, 2015 at 2:24 pm Sorry to hear about your deliveries… I’m a carrier at USPS and I deliver all my packages day-of. And if they aren’t home I will text the customer and ask if it’s ok to leave with a neighbor or on their back porch. I notice the new help we hired really seems to bring back a lot of packages and mark them “dog.” Umm, bro, they don’t have a dog… [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:48 pm OK So I go to the Amazon Website, Purposely pay more for an item because it says if you want it tomorrow order within the next 3 hours and pick next day delivery. Pay extra for the delivery and then the next day they show estimated arrival of By 8:00PM. At the same time and on the same page there is no tracking info and they sow it as being in process of shipping. I chat with their rep at 3:00PM and am told the item is on the way and will arrive at 8:00PM (Note: My office closes at 5:00PM) so I wait for the item to arrive. At 8:18 no delivry, no update on the website so I chat with the again and am told it is in the warehouse being prepared for shipment?? I ask when it will arrive and they do not know?? I think Amazon has gotten too big and is forgetting who their customers are and how to treat them. I asked that all of my pending orders be cancelled as I will source my items alsewhere and was told they could only cancel two of five and guess what. The one item I’m waiting for is not one of them??? [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:52 pm USPS has made every excuse in the world not to deliver. They lost a printer (obviously it was stolen). They claimed my address did not exist?? When calling the postmaster about the address issue I was told “It was the Amazon Driver” Yes, the special Amazon delivery person that works for the USPS…? I’ve been told of delivery attempts that never happened as you don’t come near my house without my dogs barking. USPS has tried to stick me with Postage Due… Bad Move, Amazon. [Reply] Me says: December 5, 2015 at 11:28 pm This year every freaking UPS package has had issue and been delayed. They got re-scanned and delayed one business day when they showed out for delivery at 6am (NW Houston) all my USPS packages have been early or on time. Every now and then they put small packages in my mailbox. Most the time they drop them at my front door ring or knock at the door. Not sure why you guys are having issues with USPS but it’s services has been better than UPS for me. [Reply] Me Reply: December 7th, 2015 at 10:57 pm UPS just delayed again out for delivery. I was home all day working, they never showed up and went back to the center again. No reason listed, just delayed. UPS is crap. [Reply] Wayne in NC says: December 11, 2015 at 7:12 pm I need to say I have never worked for USPS and neither has any member of my family or any friends. I detested SmartPost and SurePost where UPS or FedEx turned over packages to USPS for delivery because the packages were usually late. Of course, I am an Amazon Prime member and have been since it was introduced. For the last year USPS has delivered almost all of our Amazon packages (there have been over 200). Everyone has been either on time or early. The postal delivery person brings packages to our front door if hey do not fit in our mailbox. They also deliver on Saturday AND Sunday. USPS has been at least as reliable as UPS with our Amazon Prime deliveries. Even large and heavy package are delivered to our front door on time by USPS. I have not been a fan of USPS for many years and I doubt whether the service needs to exist at all. But I must give them credit for their 100% on time delivery of over 200 Amazon Prime packages during the last year. They have also delivered packages from other online store on time 100% of the time. [Reply] JW says: December 12, 2015 at 6:02 pm This situation is also very bad for me as the USPS does not deliver to my address. This is what I see when I try to track a package from Amazon that gets transferred to USPS. But the address isn’t incorrect. The USPS just doesn’t deliver to it. UPS and FedEx deliver to it though. 9:05 AM Undeliverable – Incorrect Address Elgin, TX, US 7:04 AM Package arrived at a carrier facility Elgin, TX 6:23 AM Package has been transferred to the USPS and will be delivered by your local postal office Elgin, TX 2:43 AM Shipment departed from Amazon facility San Antonio, TX, US [Reply] Greg A says: December 23, 2015 at 3:19 pm I live in West metro Atlanta and since they started using the USPS more, I’m ordering A LOT less from Amazon! Our postal delivery in my area is nearly third-world level. Horrible drivers and delivery people. It’s common for stuff to be delivered very late (5:30pm+) if you’re lucky – on some days, my street gets no mail delivery at all. I for sure am NOT going to be renewing my Prime membership. [Reply] Mark says: December 25, 2015 at 10:49 pm UPS is the worst company and their employees that work in the hubs have worked Sundays for years and been away from their families for years because of the Amazon volume which UPS handles less than adequately both in delivery and the treatment of packages. The best thing for Amazon would be to leave UPS for good! [Reply] Puddy says: December 26, 2015 at 4:32 pm I have stopped using Amazon. I lived on a private road and usps does not travel on private roads. We did get one delivery to our door 2 years ago. The postal lady was complaining because she said usps signed a contract with Amazon that 2 day was 2 day, even on a private road. They must have Un-signed it because I thought it would neat to have some bulk items sent to our door 2 weeks later. I got a slip in our kiosk and had to make a 40 mile round trip to pick up my package. Also, if you notice, in rural areas, postal employees have to use their own cars. They use the smallest and most economical so half the time a big package won’t even fit in their car. And to think the post office used to be great! How the mighty have fallen. Nothing to do with Amazon, but let me say this is Saturday and a Christmas package was mailed to us this past Monday, with 2 other packages, from the same address. 2 packages made it and the 3rd, a box with an Xbox one and $100 Amazon card still shows it sitting 2 states away. It was scanned late Monday evening and seems to have disappeared. [Reply] Cliff Claven says: January 2, 2016 at 6:26 pm I’ve read this entire comment thread, largely siding with USPS workers. They, like our public schools and prisons, have to serve everyone, yet they are maligned and derided without thought given as to how difficult a task that is. However, I was promised an Amazon package today, for delivery to my PO Box. It’s Saturday, and the post office closes at 3PM. The package made it there, but according to the lady at the counter, after the cutoff for distribution to PO Boxes. So my goods will sit in a local post office all day Saturday and Sunday. I can go in and pick them up Monday (but not until after 10AM), 48 hours after I was promised them. My order arriving at the post office and my order arriving in my hands are two very different things to me, but apparently not to Amazon. [Reply] Tristan says: January 13, 2016 at 9:20 am Then why has my package sat for over 24hr with no progress on weekdays? [Reply] Stephen Matrese says: January 14, 2016 at 3:14 pm I am disabled and use online shopping frequently. Amazon has cancelled my (and several family member) account(s) today because I dared to report EVERY package that wasn’t delivered (I have observed a 25% on-time delivery rate with USPS and a 80% ever eventually receive it rate from Amazon).

I got a text from Amazon saying that delivery was attempted and the receptacle was blocked and the carrier left a notice. I was home and the receptacle was not blocked and there was no notice. My daughter was watching out the window for a friend at the time they claim to have attempted delivery. They never came. Now today tracking states “carrier delay has occurred.” I’m never paying for Prime again. [Reply] wow says: January 21, 2016 at 10:34 pm holy crap.. how unbelievably lazy does this article make you sound. unreal. [Reply] NoPrime NoMore says: January 31, 2016 at 3:10 am Like the author, I loved Prime because of rock solid reliable delivery. My stuff was always where I expected it when I expected it with accurate online tracking. This was especially important to me because I work 100 miles from my home, so I’m only home on the weekends. I could order stuff on Tuesday and be sure it would be on my porch by Friday night when I got home. Similarly, I could order on Thursday and have it be at my “work crash” on Monday or Tuesday. Now, with the weird combination of using USPS directly and allowing UPS and Fedex to drop work on USPS at the last second (“last mile handoff”) the reliability has gone to pot. Tracking will look good, say delivered, and the item was not there. Turns out it was delivered to the post office — 40 mile round trip from the home. The USPS does their best, but they won’t deliver to my doorstep, only to the mailbox out by the highway (1/4 mile away). Anything bigger than a breadbox ends up getting a “attempted” note. Even when delivered, it’s an extra day or two. That extra day often meant an extra work week before I got my stuff. Since this USPS change I feel that the two day shipping commitment was not just broken, it was utterly shattered. I’m sure things are better in the burbs, but in my rural area it’s a dismal development. It’s not because of bad USPS people, the local folks are doing their best. It’s just a bad idea. Prime became so unpredictable that I cancelled it and just used the money to help pay for a spot at a mailbox store near work. I now only order free shipping stuff from Amazon, have it delivered there, and I order a lot less from them. I’m ordering more from their competitors as well. I’m actually mostly OK with that, since more of my money is going to local small business instead of the Seattle yuppie. Still, I miss getting my stuff reliably delivered to my doorstep. All the other prime stuff doesn’t matter when your best connection is sub-1-mbit DSL. Prime was worth it because of the shipping, only the shipping, and always the shipping. Not any more. [Reply] Dean P says: February 11, 2016 at 12:31 am I rarely have problems with FedEx, UPS, or USPS, they are all good around here. Amazon is a different story though, I’m not a Prime member, never have been, never will be. Amazon’s order processing is my complaint, in my experience it slowed down very much from what it was a few years ago. The slowdown was gradual but increased until it seemed like Amazon was just sitting on almost every order for days, then for days and days before getting them processed and out their doors. Finally I just gave up and only use them for research and the very occasional order. eBay has become my go-to shop, I carefully peruse reviews on Amazon then go look up the item on eBay, after checking out seller ratings and such, I order. I usually get free shipping but with no minimum purchase required, and yes, I compare prices with and without shipping costs so I know if I’m getting a better deal or just equal to Amazon. I usually do better on eBay. Mind you, you absolutely HAVE TO check out seller ratings to buy from good people, I don’t like any seller with less than 99% positive, it seems like I have problems with lesser ones. Amazon can take a flying leap at a fast train for all I care. And eBay is starting to have buyer reviews too, not many yet, but it’s coming. [Reply] Daniel Lewis says: March 16, 2016 at 5:31 am The USPS situation is very aggravating. I sure do miss the days UPS would leave the package on my porch if I didn’t happen to be home or get the door in time. Now I, like many other Americans, am faced with the dreaded “Delivery Attempted” Pink Slip. The current mailman, who is supposed to deliver parcels in the morning now comes to our house with his Pink Slips pre-filled out and doesn’t even make an attempt to deliver any package over a certain size/weight determined by him! Well I got tired of it. So tired in fact that I took the morning off on the day that I knew there was a package to arrive. I filmed his deed and the conversation I had about it with him. The recording has been accepted by his boss who also gave me the number for the Postal Inspectors (PI) who he said would be able to handle it with a heavier hand. Apparently postal workers get away with a lot and their immediate supervisors’ chidings go on deaf ears. I’ve complained to the boss a few times and he’s fed up too, thus the PI involvement. You don’t have to put up with the poor service by lazy postal workers. Stand up to the USPS and you’ll be surprised to learn that they are nothing more than another service industry. Granted, it is a lot harder to make a complaint that actually effects change, but postal workers like their jobs, especially in our current economy. If you push hard enough they will come around. [Reply] William` says: March 21, 2016 at 3:35 pm It is no surprise when a notice is received or you look on line and track your item with Amazon displaying that your order was delivered. Anytime you are dealing with the “USPS” it is a big maybe with luck that your order will be delivered on time. Amazon should step up to the plate and let you know that though they promise it’s delivery time of your order on a specific date, once the USPS get’s a hold of it, it becomes only a possibility of being delivered on the date promised. Time and time again at our corporate office individuals come up to me commenting that their order is showing that it was delivered, and I have to go through the tedious process of explaining it is probably hovering somewhere at the US Postal Service Office, and hopefully you will receive it in a day or two. Hey Amazon! stop making promises you have no control over. [Reply] Maria says: April 7, 2016 at 12:10 pm I am considering cancelling my Amazon Prime service due to issues with USPS. I don’t want to pay the Amazon Prime fee just to have to drive to the post office in Kingston, NY to pick my packages up because the carrier who delivers mail to the house is too lazy to get out of her truck. USPS is so unreliable and in this case, incompetent. This carrier even misdelivers other people’s Amazon packages to my house; I can’t even imagine where some of mine have ended up. They scan a package as delivered when the package is not delivered, and Amazon has to pay to replace your shipment. I’d rather pay an extra fee to have my orders shipped by UPS rather than deal with the guessing game of what’s going to happen when I place an order. AMAZON you are NOT saving money if you have to constantly replace people’s orders due to USPS bumbling and fraud, and at some point, your Prime members will go elsewhere. [Reply] Ellen says: May 27, 2016 at 3:47 pm I am having the same frustration. Amazon Prime used to be UPS, and regardless, the USPS in our town used to actually deliver packages to your door. After an incident where a mailman got into a fender bender, the regional office made a policy not to drive up driveways where they would have to back up. They only deliver if you have a large, circular driveway. Never mind that my house is about 10 yards from the mailbox. Now, as others have mentioned, Amazon Prime delivers by USPS, which will only leave a slip, not even load the package on the truck, which results in an at minimum one day delay picking up the package. And you have to take time off work. [Reply] Rick says: June 13, 2016 at 4:51 pm I just discovered last week that I had been changed from UPS to U.S.P.S. for Amazon Prime deliveries. I live in Murphy, NC which is a pretty small town. We moved into our home in late February. I have had approximately 24 deliveries form either UPS or FedEx, ironically sometimes they pull up at the same time but don’t talk to each other! My problem is U.S.P.S. will not deliver any mail to my home. My mailbox is about 6 tenths of a mile from my home at the bottom of a small mountain. There rule is if your mailbox is more than 1/2 mile from your home they will not deliver any parcels to your door. So now, every order I place with Amazon is not even attempted for delivery, they just stick the notice of delivery attempt ( what a joke ) in your mailbox. If you don’t pick up the item the next day it will be returned to Amazon. I have spoken with 2 Amazon CSR’s and 1 Amazon CSR Supervisor. Not one of them claimed to know about this agreement with U.S.P.S. I would surely hate to stop using Amazon, I have been a Prime member since 2007. It looks like Amazon has gotten too big for it’s britches. [Reply] Trent says: June 21, 2016 at 9:16 am The problem I have with USPS is not that I ever have to go to the post office to pick something up (never have, never will–Amazon will refund me before I do). The problem is USPS sucks. And sucks hard. I frequently get mail that belongs to my next-door neighbor. I have to wonder how often my own mail never reaches my own mailbox. Packages? Often, they’re supposed to be delivered, but the USPS driver overlooks it. I know this to be the case because there have been a couple times I’ve been working outside, seen the USPS driver pass my house, then drop a package right before leaving the neighborhood. I’ve also seen “Out for delivery” status change to “Delivered” even when they haven’t delivered it. This means they forgot. So far, I’ve gotten it the next delivery day. And right now, a package that was supposed to be delivered today was misdirected by USPS, and is in the entirely wrong state. No idea when I’ll get it. I get that USPS is cheaper than UPS, but there’s a bloody good reason for that. I’d GLADLY pay extra for UPS, Amazon. [Reply] AROD says: August 6, 2016 at 7:44 pm Management is at fault with most of what goes on in the post office. All they are worried about is the carrier street time and that the carriers should be back by 5:00 PM…atleast in NYC. All they do is rush, rush, rush. They are not concerned about the service some carriers provide. [Reply] Vickie White says: September 5, 2016 at 9:37 pm Wow I am overwhelmed by all the negative responses to USPS sunday and holiday delivery for Amazon. First off I want to comment on the mailbox situation. If you don’t have the very large mailbox that many small and medium packages fit in quit your bitching. Your mail carrier is not responsible for rain, theft or your dog that they cannot tell is a threat by the bark and beware of dog signs that are posted. There is no reason on GOD’S earth you need anything other than a prescription delivered on a Sunday or a holiday. Not to mention that by ordering on line you support other countries economic growth but not America’s. So get off your lazy asses and go to a store and support your community and shop there. No worries then about where your purchases end up or when they arrive at your home. Disgruntled postal worker. [Reply] mark rouse says: September 8, 2016 at 4:12 am I will take USPS over UPS any day. I have never had an item lost or damaged by USPS be it shipping or receiving. Cant say the same thing about UPS. [Reply] Dan Brown says: September 15, 2016 at 9:04 pm I think people are having differing experiences is because the work ethic and morale isn’t constant across the Entire USPS. Some major mail hubs are horrible. They also have different delivery tactics in different areas. One mail carrier will concentrate on just packages, and in more rural areas they will be handled by the regular mail carrier. The USPS is also starting to hire private contractors, especially in more rural areas, not always the best trained or qualified. Also, some mail hubs are better than others. Just track a package coming from NYC through New Jersey, or anything going through Allen Park Michigan. [Reply] Ellen in NH says: September 16, 2016 at 2:49 pm My experiences with USPS is horrible when compared with other carriers who deliver very well. My daughter is in an apartment in Burlington, VT with a suite of mailboxes. There are larger boxes used for packages – when a package arrives, a note is put in the mailbox to look in the package box. Works well except on days when more packages arrive than there are boxes available. Then USPS puts a redelivery notice in the mailbox and expects my daughter to pick up at Post Office – problem is there are two PO’s serving that zip – so yesterday she had two slips for going to two different POs for packages. She fills out the slip to have it redelivered to no avail. Doesn’t happen. There is management office upstairs with locked mailroom. All other carriers drop there and the office delivers. USPS won’t because the package is in daughters name, not Mgmt company (but all other carries do it). I’ve asked for a waiver to sign to say they can be delivered to Mgmt office if boxes are full; USPS won’t do it. Instead they take the package back with them and leave the redelivery slip that starts the cycle over for 3 times and then package returns to sender. Geez – I wonder why people are using USPS less and less – could it be the lack of common sense ? Just have students sign a waiver saying the Mgmt Office is OK to leave parcels at. Heck, Fedex and other companies don’t even need that. It is, after all, a locked mail room. Also – I sent a package to my nephew at Christmas. USPS is supposed to use a security code to put package in secure gated area – if they did, he would have received. They didn’t It was DC area, he never got. But heck, I shipped it express, it was insured, so no worries, right? Wrong. They said I needed to prove they didn’t leave in gated area – they didn’t pay. Really? Is that good customer service? I wish Amazon would allow me to pick a carrier. USPS would not be it. [Reply] Bob Fricker says: September 28, 2016 at 11:18 am Misery… USPS delivers to our community mail boxes with shared parcel (larger) boxes. They put the key to Box “F” in our mail box so we can get the parcel… Key Does Not Work! Can’t seem to catch the mail carrier when she delivers and she can’t see the notes we leave in our mail box it seems. Our items are sitting that parcel box 4 or 5 days now. Neither the USPS or Amazon make it easy to remedy the problem of “Delivered” be a misrepresentation of the facts. If you deliver it to some place that I can’t get to, that is not a proper deliver. I see part of the problem as one of poor customer service. USPS is hard to get help from. Try waiting an hour or more for someone to help you on the phone, for example. Try picking your way through their web site and not being able to find any menu or information that addresses your problem, for hours. I don’t tolerate poor service for long as both entities may soon discover. [Reply] Cindy M says: October 1, 2016 at 1:07 am USPS is refusing to deliver packages to my home. They mark my boxes as Vacation Hold and I have to go to the Post Office, wait 30 minutes in line and carry the box to my car myself. Today I picked up a box that was so damaged they gave it to me inside a big black garbage bag. They refused to ship the item back to the sender. I’m currently waiting for a refund from Amazon. As for the Vacation Hold, the postal worker told my that my letter carrier does not want to carry a heavy box, so he marks it as Vac Hold. That alone is unacceptable, but one of the boxes was small enough to fit in my mail box but he still marked as Vac Hold. UPS and Fed Ex are awesome in my area, simply the best. Since Amazon is using USPS I already canceled all my Auto Shipments and will not be renewing my Prime Membership. I will not be buying anything on Amazon until they stop using USPS. If I have to wait in line and carry the box myself, I’ll just shop at the brick and mortar store, at least they have shopping carts. [Reply] sam says: October 26, 2016 at 7:16 pm Get off your but and go shopping then none of this would be a problem. [Reply] Jeff says: October 30, 2016 at 3:58 pm I stopped using Amazon except for the smallest items that I know will fit into my mailbox. I’m going to get a refund on my Prime Membership too because they are not two days any longer. I’ve spent probably around 40 to $50,000 in 4 years at Amazon. That now is being cut down around 90%. The icing on the cake was, a package has been sitting at the post office since October 6 and the 3 times I went to pick it up, the line was 10+ people with one window open. So, I just notified Amazon to take it back. $150 item. Goodbye Amazon. It was great while it lasted. [Reply] Prime says: November 2, 2016 at 10:10 am I thought it was just me. No wonder why every customer service person I spoke to on Saturday wouldn’t answer my question of “why was my package sent via USPS?” They also didn’t respond to me when they’d say, “thank you for being a Prime Member” and I’d say, “I might not be after today.” I spent 45 minutes on the phone with customer service and had to drive to 2 different post offices to get my package. The post offices were open, but didn’t answer their phones. I brought that up to Amazon and the post offices when I went there in person, and no one would talk to me about that. Glad I found this article…….bye bye Prime. [Reply] Matt says: November 12, 2016 at 11:28 am I never had an issue with FedEX, usually don’t have an issue with UPS, but always have an issue with USPS. Either the package is marked delivered and its not or most times, it gets shipped back to Amazon as Package was undeliverable. I wish Amazon would display under an item that delivery is via USPS, so that I would not order the item to start with.

(Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) The Supreme Court of Canada ruled Friday the City of Edmonton can raise the property taxes of Capilano Mall. In 2011, the mall filed a complaint with Alberta's Assessment Review Board, seeking to reduce the city's assessment of its property value to $22 million, from $31 million, which it argued was above market value. But when a new city assessor took another look at the file while it was before the Assessment Review Board, it was valued at $41 million — $10 million higher than the assessment the mall had initially complained about. "It's quite a big shift in what they had expected," said Rod Risling, the city's manager of assessment and taxation. The mall took the case to Court of Queen's Bench and to the Court of Appeal, which ruled that the Assessment Review Board should not have upped the property value based on new information. The city then took the fight to the Supreme Court, which ruled Friday "the appeal should be allowed, the decision of the Court of Appeal set aside and the board's decision reinstated."  "We are just very pleased that the Supreme Court is interested in ensuring all property owners pay their fair share," Risling said. He said he thinks if the mall hadn't filed the initial complaint, the city might not have reassessed the value. "Thankfully the property was filed as a complaint by their tax agent and ultimately the error was found," said Risling, adding that the increase puts Capilano on par with similar malls in the city. Corrections An earlier version of this story incorrectly said the City of Edmonton had lost its appeal at the Supreme Court. The story has been updated to reflect the correct information.

Georgetown’s chapter of SFA coordinated with other university chapters, as well as the Coalition for Immokalee Workers (CIW), DC Fair Food, and the National Farm Worker Ministry. Protesters marched through the streets of D.C., beginning in Lafayette Square and ending at the Wendy’s Restaurant on New York Avenue, holding signs with phrases including “DC Boycotts Wendy’s” and “Justice for Farmworkers.” The marchers also chanted slogans, including “Up, up with the Fair Food Nation! Down, down with exploitation!” and “Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Exploitation got to go!”  Seven Georgetown students were in attendance through the university chapter of the SFA. The CIW, a worker-based human rights organization, organized the march, to pressure Wendy’s to join the Fair Food Program, a collaboration between farmers and buyers they introduced in 2011 to ensure humane working conditions. According to the CIW website, subscribers include Burger King, McDonalds, Subway, Walmart, Whole Foods Market, and Trader Joe’s. But, as Pamela Escalante Gonzalez (SFS ’17) says, “Wendy’s is the last of the fast food chain giants to sign onto the Fair Food Program.” The CIW boycott has been ongoing since March, according to a CIW member. Originally, Georgetown students supported the actions of the CIW through the Georgetown Solidarity Committee. “Georgetown Solidarity Committee has been involved for many, many years and have always brought down students to Immokalee [Fla., where CIW is based] during Alternative Break sessions or have brought them down to come to the encuentros which are large weekends for leadership development and strategy development,” said Carmen Mason, an organizer for DC Fair Food.  However, this year, a student group was formed on campus specifically dedicated to protecting farmworkers—the SFA. “The reason that [we]took an interest in this because we had worked with the CIW and the Alliance for Fair Food and other Student Farmworker Alliance members before, and we really liked what the CIW’s mission was and how they took in solidarity with students and other movements that affect student’s lives,” Gonzalez said, as one of SFA’s co-founders. Mason emphasized the impact of students. “It’s important to have student support because Wendy’s specifically targets youth and students,” she said. “So to have students on campuses like Georgetown’s who are boycotting sends a very strong and clear message.” Share This: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Rebecca Zaritsky Related Stories Panel discusses role of faith in election results Gas leak fixed outside front gates Murphy, Goldman, Schroepfer elected to ANC Leave a Reply Cancel reply Follow @georgetownvoice on Instagram Follow @GtownVoice on TwitterMy Tweets Popular on georgetownvoice.com Moving Forward: We Need to Understand by Nick Gavio No Pryor Knowledge: Transfer shines in victory over Upstate by Tyler Pearre Why Cooper is my Favorite Manning… And He Should Be Yours Too by Amanda Christovich An Open Letter to Asian American Hoyas by Meredith Peng A Love Letter to Leo’s by Ryan Miller Recapping a Monster Weekend in College Football by Santul Nerkar Pre-Game Primer: Maryland Terrapins by Nick Gavio Need Not Apply: Beatty’s Rules is Strange Fun by Brian McMahon Gas leak fixed outside front gates by Ryan Miller Murphy, Goldman, Schroepfer elected to ANC by Jake Maher Archives Archives Select Month November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 December 2004 November 2004 October 2004 September 2004 August 2004 April 2004 March 2004 February 2004 January 2004 December 2003 November 2003 October 2003 September 2003 August 2003 April 2003 March 2003 February 2003 January 2003 December 2002 November 2002 October 2002 September 2002 August 2002 April 2002 March 2002 February 2002 January 2002 December 2001 November 2001 October 2001 September 2001 August 2001 May 2001 April 2001 March 2001 February 2001 January 2001 Copyright © Georgetown Voice 2016.

There must be GOLD flakes in those greens!' @Radio1039NY added.  Meanwhile, @Luvvie called the side 'gentrified collard greens' when she tweeted about the extravagantly priced menu item.  A 32-ounce bag of Glory Collard Greens retails for only $3.97 at Walmart, but the wild markups didn't stop there.  Neiman Marcus' twice-baked potato casserole is going for $70, a side of candied yams is priced at $64, and a box of six apple blossoms costs $54.   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next 'One hour to go!'

Oh yeah, because I don't have $495,' Anica Padilla tweeted of the meal, which serves approximately eight people.  One of the least expensive items on the menu is the cranberry relish, but $42 is still well above the price of similar store-bought items.   'Neiman Marcus will have a Thanksgiving dinner for $495. really? what's next? IKEA's shredded turkey where you will have to put it together?' @Joxmar asked, and @ShekinahOG added: 'Thanksgiving dinner for $495 at Neiman Marcus? The dinner better give me eternal life and vision 20/20.'  A woman named Nique commented: 'Neiman Marcus is out of their minds for this Thanksgiving dinner they trying to sell smh lol.' Worth it? The store's baked beans and brioche sausage stuffing cost $80 and $85, respectively  Thanksgiving staples: While Neiman Marcus' candied yams are priced at $64, its aux delices butternut squash with pecans retails for $80 Traditional or vegetarian? Both the store's cornbread options cost a whopping $85  And @rekrap_leroy wanted to know who made the outrageously priced meal.   'Did @neimanmarcus at least hire a celebrity chef to cook their couture $500 #thanksgiving dinner?' she tweeted. According to the Dallas-based department store's website, the dinner is from Neiman Marcus chef Kevin Garvin, who co-authored the Neiman Marcus Cookbook in 2003, however, it seems doubtful that he is whipping up all of these Thanksgiving dinners by himself.  Veggies: The green bean casserole and Brussels sprouts with pancetta cost $52 and $54, respectively  Added additions: A set of six baked apple blossoms cost $54, while the $42 cranberry relish is one of the cheaper things on the menu  'Girl, bye!' Some Twitter users shared memes to show their disbelief over the pricey menu  Meanwhile, Kiana Tjerrel wasn't very impressed by the store's pricey offerings.  'So I just looked at @neimanmarcus' whole Thanksgiving spread and... I would rather go to @bostonmarket,' she noted.  However, some people thought the decadent meal was something to aspire toward.  'We only eating fly s**t for Thanksgiving... so if ya Collard Greens ain't from Neiman Marcus you ain't eating right,' @Jiggajay215 joked.  TWITTER REACTS TO NEIMAN MARCUS' THANKSGIVING MENU 'I can't wait till I'm rich enough to $66 [buy] greens,' @FancyFour commented, and ‏@imaginepeace528 agreed.   'I just want the money to shamelessly spend on $66 dollars worth of collard greens from @neimanmarcus,' he wrote. And while the public outrage over the pricing isn't exactly surprising, Neiman Marcus offers plenty of other expensive menus all year round.  It's 'Whole Hickory-Smoked, Spiral-Sliced Ham Meal' costs $420 plus shipping, while its 'Complete Breakfast Feast' is $200.
