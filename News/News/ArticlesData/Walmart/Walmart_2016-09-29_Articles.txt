By Steve Hartman CBS News September 30, 2016, 7:04 PM Oregon cowboy lassoes attempted bike thief Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email EAGLE POINT, Ore. -- Twenty-eight-year-old Robert Borba is one of the last of a kind; A real, honest-to-goodness, cow roping cowboy. Robert works at a ranch outside Eagle Point, Oregon. But he recently gained notoriety not for his prowess in the cow corrals, but because of what he did among the cart corrals of a Walmart parking lot. Robert Borba on his horse CBS News This past June, Robert says he moseyed over to the Walmart for some dog food, and on the way out he heard a woman screaming. “’Stop him! Stop him! He stole my bike! He stole my bike!’ And I kind of look around and all of a sudden this guy goes whizzing by me on a bicycle,” Robert said. As security cameras show, there was no way to catch him on foot. So the cowboy did what cowboys do. He saddled up to save the day, armed with little more than a lasso. “A couple swings and then I threw it at him, just like I would a steer,” Robert said.  “He’s like, ‘What are you doing, man? You got a badge?’ And I’m like, ‘No, I ain’t got a badge,’” he said. Robert called 911 himself, describing to the incredulous operator how he was able to detain the suspect. “We got a guy who just stole a bike here at Walmart. I got him roped and tied to a tree,” he said on the call. “What!?” the operator said. “I got him roped from a horse and he’s tied to a tree.” The cavalry arrived moments later, led by Eagle Point police officer Chris Adams. “I looked up and from the horse there was a rope connected to the ankle of a gentleman on the ground holding onto a tree,” Adams said. Robert Borba, right with lassoed suspect Lawns of Medford At the left in the above photo, you can see the suspect on the ground, roped and tied like steer headed for the pen. John Wayne couldn’t have it done better. “I’d take him by my side any day,” Adams said. “I told the cop, I said, ‘Man, you guys ought to pick up a rope and throw that gun away. You might have better luck with it.’ He started laughing,” Robert said. He said taking action to stop a thief was just the right thing to do. “If it was my wife or my little girl, I would hope somebody would help her if I wasn’t around,” he said. Heroes, like cowboys, are getting harder to find, especially modest ones like Robert, who want absolutely nothing in return. When it was, over police say all Robert asked for was his rope back. He coiled it up, tipped his hat, and then rode off into the sunset. To contact On the Road, or to send us a story idea, email us: OnTheRoad@cbsnews.com © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The Student Voice of MU Since 1955 Friday, November 18, 2016 Campus projects UNews Sports Opinion MOVE Blogs Classifieds Feedback Editorial Staff Work for Us Advertising Information Unlocking his potential: Crockett makes the most out of SEC opportunity Crockett’s mother, Vanessa Keener: “Damarea has always wanted to do this, so for him to have a chance at doing this, it’s just so emotional.” Freshman running back Damarea Crockett, 16, pushes downfield during the second half of the game facing Delaware State. Maneater File Photo By Peter Baugh Sept. 30, 2016 Tags Football Share via Facebook Twitter Google+ When he was 5 years old, Damarea Crockett never let go of his football. The ball was a gift to Crockett from his mother, Vanessa Keener. It had his name written on it, and he kept it by his side day and night. “Kind of like a little girl who has a doll that she likes to sleep with, Damarea slept with his football,” Keener said. One day, Keener drove Crockett to Walmart. When the car was parked, he darted out the door and threw his football in the air. Keener remembers her son scampering around, throwing his precious football in the air, running around parked cars. “Put the football back in the truck,” Keener called out to her son. “You can’t take it in Walmart. They’re going to think you stole it.” As the young boy hurried back to put the ball away, Keener remembers a “little old lady” stopping her. “Let him carry that football,” the woman said to Keener, “because that football may make him some money someday.” Crockett has let football carry him from Walmart parking lots to the Southeastern Conference. Now a freshman at Missouri, he has emerged as a potent running back for the Tigers’ high-flying offense. The coaches see Crockett’s potential, and he sees it too. He’s strong, fast for his size and has good feet. He’s had success in his first four games, rushing for 210 yards and three touchdowns, but he is not done developing. “There’s still a lot more in store,” Crockett said. Damarea Crockett poses for a picture for his youth football league. COURTESY OF VANESSA KEENER Finding the right school Keener received a text from her son earlier in the school year. “This is crazy,” it read. Keener was confused and slightly worried. “What’s wrong?” she typed back. No reply. “DAMAREA, IF YOU DON’T SAY SOMETHING, I’M GOING TO GO CRAZY,” she replied in capital letters. Finally, Keener received an answer. “It’s nothing, Momma. It’s just crazy how my life is changing.” Sometimes Keener thinks about how good of a kid her son is. She thinks of where he is and how well he’s doing. Sometimes these thoughts make her cry. “I’m so happy for him,” she said. Crockett is happy too. He’s playing the game he loves, and he’s thankful for the opportunity Missouri has given him. Crockett took an unorthodox road to Missouri. The summer before his senior year of high school, the Arkansas native committed to Boise State. He had received offers from a number of Division I programs but had relatively little interest from schools in the Power Five conferences. New Missouri coach Barry Odom began recruiting more aggressively in Arkansas as soon as he took the job in December 2015. Offensive coordinator Josh Heupel was key in recruiting Crockett. “He’s got the ability, when he matures physically, to be a physical back as well,” Heupel said. “He’s got great feet in the hole, had good vision … I thought he had the chance to be a real complete back.” Midway through his senior year of high school, Crockett flipped his commitment from Boise State to Missouri. By February, he had signed a letter of intent with the Tigers. Proximity was a factor in Crockett’s decision. In Columbia, his family can watch him play. “Had he gone to Boise, I probably wouldn’t have been able to make a game just yet,” Keener said. “Because a flight ticket is not inexpensive.” Crockett also considered high-level academic schools, including Yale, West Point and the Naval Academy. Those closest to Crockett have taken notice of his intelligence. When he was in ninth grade, he helped his mother do college algebra homework for a course she was taking. Jeff Weaver, Crockett’s high school coach at Little Rock Christian Academy, feels the running back could have done well at the academically rigorous schools he was considering. “Damarea is very smart,” Weaver said. “Our school is a very high academic school … he could certainly go to any of those schools, but I think he wanted to go where the brand of the football is a little bit better as well.” As Crockett was growing up, Keener stressed academics. “Sometimes he doesn’t apply himself as he should, which is where I come in,” she said. Keener tells her son that football is not a guarantee. Grades are important. The message seems to have gotten through to the freshman. “I’m a football player at heart, but I’m a student-athlete at all times … academics is going to take you a far way,” Crockett said after a win against Delaware State. “It’s going to be there when the football isn’t there.” Football abilities Jeff Weaver has seen Crockett take over a game. It was a cool Arkansas night in the fall of 2015. Crockett and the undefeated Little Rock Christian football team was trailing Greenbrier, a rival school, by 21 points entering the fourth quarter. In the final quarter, Weaver and the team relied heavily on their running back. Crockett would take direct snaps and run plays from the wildcat formation, and the Little Rock Christian offense got in a groove. There was nothing Greenbrier could do to stop Crockett. He finished with 295 rushing yards on 51 carries, and a late touchdown cut Greenbrier’s lead to 42-41. Instead of kicking a game-tying extra point, Weaver elected to go for a two-point conversion. “There was no doubt on our sideline that we were going for two and that [Crockett] was going to be the guy making the play …” Weaver said. “He wanted the ball, and we were not shocked at all to see him score.” Little Rock Christian ran a direct snap to Crockett, who scampered over the goal line to give the team a 43-42 lead. Weaver said the crowd was “insane.” Fans screamed as the team held on for what would wind up being the victory that sealed the conference championship. Keener remembers her son after the game. “My son was so beat down,” she said. “He was really tired.” Now, Crockett is going against bigger, faster and stronger defenses, and the transition from high school to college football has been far from seamless. The freshman had a costly fumble against West Virginia in week one, killing a Missouri drive. Crockett said playing in the SEC has been an adjustment. The hits are harder and the opposition is more athletic. “The game’s just much faster,” he said. “The guys are bigger and faster. You’re not the fastest guy on the field anymore at all times. So that’s just a big adjustment, and that’s what it’s like pretty much out there.” Odom said Crockett is still learning. His potential is clear, and he needs to work hard to achieve it. “There’s things in practice you see him do and you know he’s going to have a chance to be a really good player,” Odom said. “But he’s got to work, he’s got to understand that he’s not the fastest guy on the field anymore … he’s continuing to get better.” Against Delaware State, Crockett rushed for a season-high 115 yards and two touchdowns. The Tigers cruised to a 79-0 win. Though he knows it was not against a football powerhouse, Crockett said it was nice to have a big game. He had fun competing and being with his teammates. Though Keener said she was unsure about how much Crockett would see the field as a freshman, the running back said he expected to play immediately. “I try to work hard, do everything to the best of my abilities as hard as I can, do stuff right,” Crockett said. “I just try and follow the right path, so I kind of expected to play.” The freshman’s abilities have not gone unnoticed by his teammates. Sophomore offensive lineman Kevin Pendleton has been impressed by his new teammate. Since he and Crockett are both underclassmen, Pendleton is looking forward to playing with the running back in coming years. “Tough dude, tough guy and tons of energy,” he said. “It’s exciting to see what this kid can do.” Loving the game When Crockett was growing up, he and his mom would fight over the television on Saturdays. Crockett would want to watch SEC football, while Keener preferred her shows on Lifetime. Now, there’s no more fighting. Crockett is out of the house, playing in the games he used to watch. And even though she has the freedom to watch Lifetime on Saturdays, Keener watches football every week. For Keener, it’s special watching her son succeed. “As a mother, you always want your child to be able to have the desires of their heart,” Keener said. “Damarea has always wanted to do this, so for him to have a chance at doing this, it’s just so emotional.” As a 5-year-old in Arkansas, all Crockett wanted was to play with the football his mother got him. His dreams have grown, but his feelings for the game have remained constant. Damarea loved football then, and he loves it now.

Henning  BAY CITY, MI — A Bay City man has pleaded guilty to his latest felony stemming from the theft of some "The Walking Dead" DVDs from Walmart less than a month after he was paroled. David M. Henning, 23, on Thursday, Sept. 22, appeared in Bay County Circuit Court and pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree retail fraud. The charge is a five-year felony. In exchange, the prosecution agreed to dismiss a charge of unarmed robbery, a 15-year offense. Henning's trial was to begin Tuesday, Oct. 11. The charges stem from Bay County sheriff's deputies on the evening of July 21 responding to the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road in Bangor Township for a shoplifting complaint. Upon deputies' arrival, Walmart staff told them they observed a man and a woman stealing items. As they attempted to stop the culprits near the building's front doors, the male subject — Henning — shoved a male employee, court records show. The male employee grabbed Henning in a bear hug and another employee reached into a large, leopard-print bag Henning was carrying and retrieved numerous stolen items. The male employee eventually released Henning as Henning continued to struggle, court records show. Bay City man pleads guilty to misdemeanor in Xbox game theft, 15-year felony dismissed Henning then went to his 19-year-old female companion, took her car keys, ran outside, and drove away in her car, court records show. The woman remained at the store and gave a statement to police, saying she only knew her cohort as "John" and that she brought him to Walmart to steal property, court records show. She added her cohort had gone on other recent Walmart shoplifting expeditions — stealing a Nerf gun in one — without getting caught. Among the items the pair stole were bobby pins, five CDs, five "The Walking Dead" DVD sets, "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" and "Empire" DVD sets, "Insurgent," "Allegiance," and "Divergent" DVDs and blonde hair dye, all totaling $254.33, court records show. Police later located the woman's vehicle at Henning's Bay City residence and noticed a leopard print bag inside it, court records show. With the property owner's permission, police searched the home and found Henning hiding underneath a pile of clothes, court records show. Police allege Bay City man threatened to blow up food business After being read his Miranda rights, Henning initially declined to speak with police but soon changed his tune. He said he went to Walmart to steal items and struggled with an employee, though he knew he shouldn't have. He further told deputies he has a problem with impulsive stealing and goes to classes for it, court records show. Henning on Monday, July 25, appeared in Bay County District Court for arraignment on one count of unarmed robbery. The charge is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Lengthy criminal history Henning has quite a rap sheet, including other offenses that occurred at Walmart. In January 2015, he stole Xbox games "Grand Theft Auto IV" and "Sniper Ghost Warrior" from the Walmart at 3921 E. Wilder Road in Bangor Township. On his way out of the store, he engaged in a scuffle with a loss-prevention officer. He ended up pleading guilty to second-degree retail fraud in exchange for the prosecution's dismissal of an unarmed robbery charge. In February, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail with credit for 52 days served. Two months later, a Bay County judge sentenced Henning to three years probation on a conviction of malicious destruction of a building between $1,000 and $20,000 for a crime he committed on Jan. 5 of that year. In August 2015, Henning called Bay County Central Dispatch and said he was going to blow up T&M Bosco Distributing Co. at 407 11th St. Police searched the area and found no explosive devices. Police believed Henning had called in similar pranks threats the previous year. "I made the call," Henning told police. "I used an old Obama phone that I had before I went to jail. I told the person that I was going to blow up Bosco's. Once I realized it was 911, I hung up the phone. I don't know why I did it." Henning was charged with a four-year felony count of false report or threat of a bomb or harmful device. On Dec. 7, 2015, Henning was sentenced to 16 months to five years in prison on the vandalism conviction for which he previously received probation. The Michigan Department of Corrections paroled him on Tuesday, June 28. Bay County Circuit Judge Harry P. Gill is to sentence Henning at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 31 Most Read Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Active Discussions Get the latest updates Subscribe to our newsletters Like MLive on Facebook Follow MLive on Twitter About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Site Map Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 MLive Media Group.

Published Sep 30th, 2016 9:59 am ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Dustin Serio, a customer service manager at Walmart Store 100 in Bentonville, is happy the hourly bonuses are back. The five-year Walmart employee said it is a morale builder and is a welcome part of the retailer’s focus on better pay and training. As an hourly employee who has been with the company more than six months, Serio is eligible for Walmart’s My Share bonus program that recently doled out $201 million to more than 900,000 store workers like Serio in 99% of the retailer’s U.S. stores. The average second quarterly bonus received was $220, according to the retailer. This came on the heels of more than $200 million bonus pay handed out to 99% of Walmart stores in the first quarter, according to Kory Lundberg, Walmart corporate spokesman. Serio said store workers can check on their “My Share” bonus progress at any time throughout the quarter. He said there are several metrics on which the bonus pay is linked to Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran’s “Clean, Fast and Friendly” scores, and of course meeting overall sales targets. “I remember a few years back when they were opening all the Neighborhood Markets in Bentonville and that really hurt our store sales. We went several quarters without a bonus,” Serio said. “We look forward to the bonus pay and it does help overall morale in the store when we get them. … In my eyes I see Walmart investing more in its biggest asset, its people. I can’t speak for every store but here we take the clean, fast and friendly program seriously. The overall payout is also based on how many hours you work. It could be as little as 10 a week or 40 hours a week.” Serio said he was offered a salary management job, but opted out of that now because he has a young daughter at home he needs to spend time with. Most of the jobs in a Walmart store are hourly. The salary positions, while they pay more, require longer hours. That would be jobs as shift managers or assistant managers. But without a college degree, Serio sees Wal-Mart as a good place to move up when the time is right. He has his sights set on a position at the corporate office across the street from Store 100 in five years or so. Lundberg said the $201 million in quarterly bonus pay was not part of the retailer’s $2.7 billion investment in higher wages and training over last year and this year. When Walmart U.S. announced it would raise the starting pay to $10 per hour in January, the retailer was praised by the media and analysts agreed that getting the store labor counts right and keeping turnover down would be positives for the long term for the retail giant. But not everyone who works at a Walmart store earns a minimum of $10 per hour. Lundberg said it’s only after the worker completes the Pathways training that they become eligible for the $10 hourly rate and the bonus pay. Pathways began in February and workers have 18 months to finish the training. Serio said the training could be finished on average in 3 to 4 weeks time. He likes the training requirement because workers on the floor can’t learn everything they need to know from a supervisor. Lundberg said while store turnover is down, on any given day the retailer still has between 15,000 and 50,000 job openings in the company and there are always newer employees who have not completed the Pathway training and are not eligible for the $10 hourly pay rate or bonus pay. “As we have talked about before our training provides associates with the skills they need to succeed and advance, while creating a better and more consistent customer experience. Skills’ training increases productivity, confidence and knowledge which leads to greater job satisfaction, personal and professional growth. … Skills developed include core retail knowledge, such as merchandising and understanding product labels and soft skills needed for confidence and success in all workplaces, such as: punctuality, teamwork, communication, customer service and on-the-job problem solving,” Lundberg said. Not everyone is convinced Walmart’s My Share bonus program is a big deal. The union-backed group, Making A Change at Walmart, says it’s not enough. “Walmart is happy to boast when they decide to give workers a very small share of one of the world’s largest company’s earnings, but when it comes down to facts, Walmart continues to mislead,” said Jess Levin, communications director for MCAW. “What Walmart doesn’t tell you is that in order to get this bonus, workers must complete a months’ long training program that is often implemented with buggy and outdated technology. In fact, in order to also receive the $10 an hour minimum wage that Walmart promotes, completion of this tedious program is required. We hear from Walmart workers every day that have been making less than $10 an hour for months. These workers will also be excluded from the quarterly bonus, and we believe they deserve better.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 3shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Ruth Whitney Volunteering should be part of the business plan Michael Tilley Riff Raff: A Veterans Day remembrance Justin Allen Marijuana and the constitutionality of ‘Shall means shall’ Randy Zook Issue 3 will mean jobs for Arkansas Michael Tilley Riff Raff: 3 concerns with Issue 3 Special Sections Home Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Magazine Opinion © 2015 Talk Business & Politics.

Holiday giving: How to raise charitable kids amid my own questionable philanthropy Sonja Haller , The Republic | azcentral.com 9:04 a.m. MST September 30, 2016 Giving season is upon us. (Photo: Getty Images) He was super-chipper, a tad pushy. He ambushed everyone walking in or out of Walmart. I couldn't avoid him. He hit me with his pitch. “No,” I told the guy wanting $20 to fill kid backpacks with needed school supplies. “Not today.” Not even for a Tootsie Roll. Halloween soon will be over, and then it’s onto Salvation Army bell ringers, turkey-shortage pleas and stepped-up church and work food drives. The upcoming charitable season has unnerved me, and this Walmart guy is the reason. Not yet out of chipper guy’s earshot, my 10-year-old asked: “Mama, why didn’t you give that guy $20 bucks?” I told her it was the day before pay day. Money was tight. It should be enough, but it’s not for this inquisitive child who once during a family toast exalted me “because I always give people on the freeway money.” (Not even close to being true.) AZCENTRAL Things To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device First, reflection on my generosity  It’s not enough for me, either, because I realize in that moment, I have no giving protocol. Sometimes I give, sometimes I don’t. With the holidays approaching, I’ll be confronted with countless opportunities to give. I should know my giving standards, if not for my three girls, at least for myself. So, thanks, Walmart guy, for nudging me into a hard two weeks of self-reflection on my own generosity, or lack thereof. It's hard to resist giving to someone who looks as if it took every bit of courage they had to approach you. (Even if they refused to get in the photo.)  (Photo: Sonja Haller/The Republic) I gave to a guy at Fry’s who was fundraising for people with intellectual disabilities because rather than pushy he seemed shy, thus he declined to pose for a picture. More to the point: It was pay day. Takeaway: I give when I feel I have it to give.  I have a soft spot for writers, naturally, especially ones who profess to work for coffee money.  (Photo: Sonja Haller/The Republic) I gave a bike-riding guy $20 bucks, or coerced my husband to, because he trailed us in a restaurant parking lot hawking his framed, original poems. We chose the one on the virtue of a smile. As a writer, I appreciate the work to craft anything coherent, even if this poem did have a few grammatical errors. Takeaway: I give when I feel moved. Giving feels good.  (Photo: Sonja Haller/The Republic) I doubled the church offering this past Sunday. It may or may not have to do with the pastor remarking on "The Rich Man and Lazarus" (Luke 16: 19-31). If you don’t know that one, they both die. The rich King, who never gave any food or otherwise to poor Lazarus, goes to Hades. Lazarus, for which "the dogs came and licked his sores,“ went to a more pleasant place after death. It does feel good to give in the moment, no matter what happens later. Takeaway: Giving is good for your soul, at least on some level. 3 reasons to give I can tell my kids The two weeks gave me a better handle on my own giving philosophy. I give when I feel moved, have the resources to give, and am, selfishly perhaps, looking for a little soul boost. Not quite the elevator speech on philathropy I had envisioned for my kids, but it may be enough to get me through this holiday season and spark an interest in their own giving one day.

People fed me. A Mesa firehouse did when I was a starving college student interning for the newspaper and happened to drop by as a way of developing reporting sources, and it happened to be fish fry Friday. Actually, I’m fuzzy on what was served, I just recall that if you arrived around dinner, the firefighters fed you. I showed up a lot. Friends donated furniture, utensils and a futon bed for my first apartment. I borrowed money to make rent, make car repairs, keep my electricity from being turned off and to get a soda from the work vending machine. And then there was the time I was a $1.50 short in college to pay the Phoenix Zoo admission, and the man in line behind me offered to make up the difference. (I heart you, generous guy who probably led me to paying it forward far more than anyone else has.) I'm not comparing myself to the truly needy and the organizations that help them. But we might all find ourselves “less fortunate” at times in our lives. Maybe it will be my children. That seems worthy of some self-reflection on generosity. And maybe paying someone's way into the zoo. Reach the reporter at sonja.haller@arizonarepublic.com. Follow at twitter.com/sonjahaller.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Helena Andrews-Dyer September 30 Follow @helena_andrews Singer Patti LaBelle at a tasting for her desserts on Capitol Hill hosted by Walmart. (Dan Swartz) Patti LaBelle is running late. But no one here seems to mind. The crowd of staffers, members, Walmart execs and the lucky legislative aide who happened to get “the email” are too busy rubbernecking the passed trays carrying slices of sweet potato pie to notice that the woman of the hour is missing. The event, “A Reception and Tasting with Patti LaBelle celebrating her featured desserts sold exclusively at Walmart,” was set to start at 3 p.m. on Thursday. By 3:02, the room on the third floor of the Longworth building was packed. “I can’t wait to taste one,” announced one staffer as waiters carrying samples of pie, peach cobbler, vanilla poundcake and chocolate ganache cake are swarmed. Not familiar with the fame trajectory of Patti’s pies? After a hilarious video of a fan named James eating said pie went viral last year, LaBelle’s desserts quickly became the Furby of the bakery aisle. After waiting for about 45 minutes and listening to a steady stream of LaBelle’s solo hits (“On My Own” and “Somebody Loves You Baby”), she arrives with her entourage in tow. The crowd, most with mouthfuls of pie, isn’t too stuffed to cheer, “Hey Patti!” During a brief explanation of the origin of the Grammy-winner’s lucrative relationship with Walmart (apparently the superstore’s bakery division was already in the market for a sweet potato pie when it reached out to the singer and cookbook author), LaBelle made sure to note that her desserts were “selling double before James did his video. People all over had feelings.” After that it’s on to pictures, and the congressmen, of course, get to cut the line. In the house were Reps. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Joe Wilson (R-S.C.). It’s during the selfie cattle call that LaBelle reveals to us that despite performing for the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Saturday, she still hasn’t seen the museum, which includes the risque rhinestone costumes worn by her ’70s funk group LaBelle. “I haven’t seen them yet,” she whispered, “but I’m coming back for at least four hours.” No word if she’ll be bringing pies with her on this future trip, which might disappoint the young staffer headed back to his member’s office with not one but two plates in his hands. “Oh my god, this pumpkin pie,” he announced to the elevator. “Sweet potato. It’s sweet potato pie,” corrected this reporter. “Ah,” he said. “Maybe that’s why it’s so good.” lifestyle reliable-source false Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Aaron Marsh/Fleet Owner Related Media 'The biggest data explosion in transportation history' Survey: Need for big data in logistics keeps growing Q&A: Cleaning up trucking's data garbage Data, data, data and more data — it's coming from everywhere in today's business of trucking. Maybe it can be harnessed to tell you very useful things and give your fleet significant advantages. Except... maybe not. At the TMW Systems-PeopleNet in.sight conference earlier this week, Mindy Curnutt, vice president of information management at TMW, explored that point in describing the company's work in data services and market intelligence. What about all that data trucking companies are compiling? She likened it to a night sky unadulterated by city and street lights — a beautiful, virtually endless expanse that can leave the viewer feeling overwhelmed and tiny as a gnat. "It's mind-boggling. It's really hard to get your head around how much data we're talking about here," Curnutt said. "Data is now constantly coming in from all different sources — dispatch, drivers, devices, sensors, GPS, phones, tablets, check-ins, emails, on and on," she noted. "Every week we've got some new device that's spewing it." "Spewing" might be most accurate: fleets and trucking companies are generating and collecting all manner of data, but may not be doing much more than gathering clutter due to errors and confusion in the information. More data doesn't mean good data "This amount of data creates all new possibilities. It's really a beautiful thing," Curnutt told listeners. "Or is it? Maybe it's not a beautiful thing; maybe it's a rat's nest. Maybe it's a tangled ball of twine." Curnutt used samples from a few TMW customer databases regarding a location she'd expected would be common: a Walmart distribution center. One database had the distribution center "with three different company IDs, three different names, two slightly different addresses and a lat-long that actually doesn't represent physically where the Walmart was," she said. A second TMW customer had the location under different names, non-matching addresses and phone numbers and different — and no more accurate than the first customer's — latitude-longitude GPS coordinates. Taking a larger "scoop" of customer data on this Walmart's location and entering the positions on an ALK Technologies map, Curnutt had to zoom out a ways to show all the red dots in perhaps a 10-mi. spread here, there and everywhere within that radius. "This is a problem," Curnutt stressed. "How are we supposed to get industry-wide business intelligence and do things like trending and aggregates and averages and analyze behavior for things like average time off of ETA if we can't even agree on what this is called and where it is for something as big as a Walmart distribution center?" Consider, now, data for much smaller, less-frequented locations, and the information your drivers may be getting on their way to deliveries. The fix — and a changed world "The good news is that there's a way to resolve all this," Curnutt told the audience, and that is to "create a master list of defined things" or reference data set. "We want to define things like location and turn this messy blob or rat's nest or lump of coal into a gem, into a diamond," she added. The goal is to generate industry-wide analytics and market intelligence from the mass of data commotion. She referenced the launch in July of Niantic's Pokemon GO, the augmented reality game that lets users track down and interact with fictional, animated Pokemon creatures on a smartphone or other camera-equipped mobile device. "How do you think Pokemon GO went from nothing to having more users than Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter in two weeks and didn't go down? You think they did that with their own data center? I don't think so," Curnutt contended. "You call Amazon and say, 'I need more power,' and they give it to you just like that." "The world has changed," she continued. "This is now possible with recent things like scale computing, machine learning, the concept of having a data scientist on staff and scaling up." For trucking, the idea is to create a reference data "de-duping and mapping engine," she said, that wouldn't have to do anything to customers' individual databases. Regardless of what a given customer entered in name, location and so on for something like the Walmart distribution center in her example, this conceptual master data engine could recognize what the correct entries should be. "And there can be more benefits," Curnutt added. "What if when you were onboarding a new location you'd never delivered to and started entering it, the application said, 'Do you mean this,' and if you said yes, it just populated the rest of the data and you didn't have to type anything?" As a future-looking possibility, she described how such a master data engine could provide actionable business intelligence — things like optimizing a delivery to a new customer for least possible dwell time. "You've never delivered there before, you enter it as a new location and something like this could pop up," Curnutt described the concept, showing a mock-up dwell time comparison chart. "You'd be able to know, if you were going to be delivering here on a Saturday between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m., that the average dwell time there is 70 minutes. "Maybe if I came in between 2:00 and 5:00 a.m., the dwell time is 10 minutes," she said. "That'd be an hour savings, and you'd instantly know that without having to have had years of understanding and working with this location." That's the kind of industry intelligence and functionality TMW is working on, according to Curnutt. "You'd spend less time entering data; you'd have more accurate data; you'd have immediate access to powerful, industry-wide analytics; you could make better, well-informed decisions," she said. "So keep that in your thoughts on TMW and the Big Data opportunity before us."     Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

   Click on the logos above to read our digital editions Home Sports Community News Agriculture National Provincial Opinion Faith About Contact Menu Home Sports Community News Agriculture National Provincial Opinion Faith About Contact Dollars and sense Details Published on Friday, September 30, 2016 Share Tweet By Kate Jackman-Atkinson Neepawa Banner/Neepawa Press In the United States, there’s a powerful debate raging over minimum wage. Across the country, low-wage workers are protesting, demanding the minimum wage be increased to $15/hour. Currently, for states that have a minimum wage, the rates are between $5.15 and $10.50 an hour. We are seeing the same debate in Canada, although not to the same extent.  It’s not hard to see their motivation, the US economy has seen recessions and a decline in well-paying middle class jobs. We’re seeing more inequality and increasingly, we are seeing college and university-educated employees working at low paying retail and service jobs, without a clear path towards the prosperity they so badly want. This might not be a problem if it weren’t set against the backdrop of large corporate profits.   According to Forbes, the 10 most profitable companies in the US made $210 billion in 2015 alone. Included in that top 10, among Apple and oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, is minimum-wage employer Walmart. It’s hard when you struggle to put food on the table and gas in your car to see your employer post a $19.2 billion profit. To their credit, Walmart has moved to offer better compensation, now paying at least $2.75 over minimum wage. While Walmart is the largest, the Forbes top 500 list is full of employers whose staff aren’t making much over minimum wage. It’s hard not to feel for the little guy. The problem is that while these large businesses do employ a lot of people, the majority of businesses are in fact small.  In the US, the Small Business Administration says that 99.7 per cent of the country’s businesses are small and in Canada, the statistics are the same.  While Walmart, or Home Depot, or McDonald’s may be among the most profitable companies in the US, that’s not the case for most of the smaller businesses paying minimum wage. The challenges facing low-income workers are real and should be addressed, but a higher minimum wage isn’t the answer. No matter how much proponents say it won’t happen, a rise in the minimum wage can only mean one of two things: a rise in prices for all goods, including the necessities purchased by minimum wage earners, or a decrease in the number of jobs.  The decrease in jobs can happen in one of two ways; first, some employees will be let go and the work will be spread among the remaining staff; second, human jobs will be replaced by automation and self serve, something we are already seeing at retailers and fast food restaurants.  The statistics back this up. In 2008, an extensive study of decades worth of minimum wage research found a one to two per cent decrease in employment for teenagers or very low skilled workers for each 10 per cent increase in minimum wage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office did their own calculation and found that an increase in the federal minimum wage, from its current rate of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour, would result in the loss of about 500,000 jobs. The same trends are true in Canada as well. Perhaps we could justify the job losses for these workers if overall, low wage earners would be helped from poverty, but the statistics show that the relationship between minimum wages and poverty is actually quite weak. Work done by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that higher minimum wages can actually increase poverty. In March 2016, Statistics Canada released their own report about minimum wage in Canada and the report noted that there is no consensus about how the minimum wage affects poverty and inequality, but added that the association with employment is well-documented – an increase in the minimum wage seems to be associated with a decrease in employment among teenagers, the group most likely to be paid at this hourly rate. The issue of poverty reduction and the ability of working people to earn a living wage are extremely important to our society, but an across the board raise in minimum wage isn’t the answer. Fewer jobs and further erosion in purchasing power isn’t the answer. Despite this, it’s clear that governments like these policies, they shift the responsibility to private entities and while some of them can absorb the costs, many of them aren’t so fortunate.

(View our Privacy Policy) The Morning Watch: Walmart hasn't stopped selling expired food — and how third-party candidates could decide the election Times staff Tampa Bay Times Friday, September 30, 2016 8:50am Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Here's a look at what we'll be watching for around the bay area today: Related News/Archive In tight race, Florida's third-party voters could again decide election 1 Month Ago How to watch for a wave this Election Day 3 Weeks Ago Walmart stores around Tampa Bay found selling expired products, including baby food 2 Months Ago EXPIRED FOOD AND BABY FORMULA REMAINED ON WALMART SHELVES For three weeks after a front-page Tampa Bay Times story about expired baby formula and other goods at a local Walmart, our reporters browsed the aisles of Walmarts around Tampa Bay. We continued to find expired baby formula, sour cream, baby food, supplements and prenatal vitamins at Walmart Supercenters and Walmart Neighborhood Market stores in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties despite the media coverage that revealed the problem at local stores. Dozens of Times readers also wrote and called in with stories and photos about buying expired goods from Walmart stores in Brandon, Brooksville, Wimauma, Clearwater, Ruskin, Sebring and elsewhere. IN A TIGHT RACE, FLORIDA'S THIRD-PARTY VOTERS COULD DECIDE ELECTION — AGAIN Gary Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico, is the Libertarian Party nominee. Jill Stein, a Massachusetts physician and activist, represents the Green Party. Neither have much chance of winning the Nov. 8 election, experts say, but both could have an outsized effect on the outcome — especially in Florida. This is a crucial swing state and a near must-win for Republican nominee Donald Trump, and it could come down to who loses the fewest votes to third-party candidates. I-75 AT FOWLER REOPENS AFTER MORNING WRECK An unidentified man was killed around 3:20 a.m. when two cars struck him as he stood in the center lane of Interstate 75 south of Fowler Avenue in Tampa, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The clash closed southbound lanes until 7 a.m. Tony Dungy, Jeff Foxworthy and Michael W. Smith will be at a fundraiser at the Straz Center in Tampa next week. TONY DUNGY VISITS IN ADVANCE OF TAMPA CHARITY BENEFIT The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach and current NFL commentator, who earned his Super Bowl ring with the Colts before retiring from coaching, still spends his days coaching, he says, only now it's dads he's drilling. As a father of 10 with seven still living at home, Tony Dungy knows the challenge of carving out family time. "I've got a job where I'm gone 18 weekends in the fall," he said. "But I'm here during the week and I have summers off and the boys are getting old enough I can take them up to the NBC studios with me on the weekends." Comedian Jeff Foxworthy and singer Michael W. Smith will join former Dungy in a benefit for Family First at 7:30 p.m. Thursday at the Straz Center.

Downs drivers remains at least a year away. According to Jim Hudock, technical services director for Hillsborough County Public Works, construction along the road will continue until summer 2017. It all adds up to rows of Acme Barricades, changing traffic patterns and intermittent delays for commuters and worries for businesses along the route. [BRENDAN FITTERER | Times] Willie Fifer of AMAX Welding & Fabrication works on the installation of the first decorative "Welcome to Brooksville" silo recently at the corner of E Jefferson Street and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. SILOS PROVIDE A WARM WELCOME TO A RURAL, FRIENDLY PLACE Brooksville just got a brand: The silo. The first of five identical grain storage units to be placed at the entrances to the city was installed last week. They are smallish Florida silos — 18 feet high, according to Rick Pearson of Proud Pelican Construction, the general contractor for the project — not the towering concrete cylinders usually associated with the term, but the idea is they'll convey a big message to drivers: That they have arrived at a friendly, tranquil place surrounded by a scenic countryside, a good town to enjoy a relaxing visit and, maybe for some, to live.

Sauter and Thomas C. Frohlich September 30, 2016 1:35 pm EST Print Email Tweet Wal-Mart, the world’s largest company and private employer, recently raised the minimum wage of its employees to $10 an hour. Since the company’s announcement last year, several of the corporate giant’s competitors, including Target and TJX, announced similar base minimum wages for their employees. A $10 per hour wage is $2.75 an hour higher than the federal minimum wage. Wal-Mart and its competitors are often criticized for paying their employees low wages and for treating them poorly. Many claim the wage increases are a public relation move and that these companies can afford to pay much more. Even at $10 an hour, these companies’ workers would still be paid far less than the typical American. The average hourly earnings of all U.S. workers is $23.23. Wal-Mart and Target have raised wages, others in the retail and service industry continue to pay front line workers $9 and $8 an hour. Some often just pay the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the largest American companies paying their workers very low wages. Click here to see the companies paying Americans the least  Millions of workers in the United States are currently earning minimum wage or just a few dollars above. David Cooper, senior analyst at left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute, discussed the difficulties these low-wage workers face with 24/7 Wall St. “At $7.25, a minimum wage worker with one child is going to be below the federal poverty line even if they’re working full-time, year-round,” Cooper said. “There is a federal bill to raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020. But the reality is that in many parts of the country, you would need more than that minimum wage target in order to have a decent quality of life. In most cities in the U.S., you would probably need at least $15 an hour in order to have a basic decent income.” Cooper explained that because of the nature of the service sector, companies employing these low-paid workers tend to view them as exhaustible resources. This explains the low pay and high turnover that can sometimes reach nearly 100% in a single year. Further, these companies have a high share of part-time workers. Indeed, a massive share of frontline workers in the service industry is employed part time. Of Dollar Tree’s 167,800 employees, about 112,00, or two-thirds, are employed in a part-time capacity. Of the 140,000 workers employed by Kohl’s, 77% are part-time workers. Companies, he explained, do this to be cost-effective, as part-time workers allow for greater flexibility, and also typically do not need to be paid benefits like health care. In addition to missing out on these benefits, Cooper explained, these workers face other problems. Such workers are typically forced to find another job to make ends meet, but if their employer requires them to be flexible, maintaining a second job can be impossible. Cooper added it can also hinder professional development. “if they’re constantly shifting from job to job, they’re also never really focusing on building their skills.” The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour does not apply to tipped employees. While fast food companies on this list, including McDonald’s and Yum! Brands, do not employ tipped workers, fast casual dining companies such as Darden, which is on this list, do. Companies that employ tipped workers are only required to pay them $2.13 an hour if workers earn the federal minimum wage through their tips. The companies paying their workers so little are mostly not struggling — they pay executives very high salaries and often report large and increasing profits. Wal-Mart raised its minimum wage at U.S. stores to $10 an hour, but it would take 952 full-time employees working year round to match the salary of CEO Douglas McMillon. The profits of most of the companies on this list rose last year. Even among the companies that reported lower net income, most still posted hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in profits. Low- and minimum-wage workers involved in last year’s fast food strike point to these figures when demanding an increase in wages. Opponents of raising wages in the service sector explain that asking companies to raise wages is counterproductive for employers and employees alike. allowing companies to set the wages they prefer to pay allows them to hire as many workers as possible. This will likely be more common argument as automation becomes an increasing factor in low-skill work, and employers need to weigh higher salaried employees with potentially cheap and more effective machines. minimum-wage jobs, it has been argued, also create opportunities for young adults or college students entering the workforce for the first time.

Jacob was shot yesterday at Townville Elementary School. pic.twitter.com/qM3Nq2YVwR — Nigel Robertson (@thetopstoryWYFF) September 29, 2016 They gathered in the Walmart parking lot Thursday night, dozens of sniffling and sorrowful believers, calling to God in desperate pleas. “Lamb of God,” one woman cried. “Hallelujah!” said another. “We live in a broken, broken world today,” a pastor told the crowd. “This is why we’re here.” Twenty-four hours before, an armed teenager had driven a pickup truck to Townville Elementary in South Carolina and fired bullets at a door as it was heaved open for recess. One of the three people shot, 6-year-old Jacob Hall, was struck in the leg and carried away. The bullet pierced his femoral artery, his family said in a statement, causing him to bleed and bleed, to require resuscitation twice and to undergo lifesaving surgery. The gunshot wound leeched him of so much blood, his family said, that the boy sustained brain damage. “Jacob is in very critical condition,” the family’s statement said, “and we are hanging on every second.” They asked the community to keep praying. So in the Walmart parking lot, as Jacob fought for his life in a hospital room five miles away, the believers, clumped in a circle, helped in the only way they could. Tim Marcengill, an associate pastor at Townville’s Oakdale Baptist Church, read from the third chapter of Ecclesiastes. “He has made everything beautiful in its time,” Marcengill said. He paused. “Jacob is a beautiful little boy.” The first-grader remained in critical condition late Thursday night, Keith Webb of Greenville Health System’s Children’s Hospital, said in a statement obtained by WYFF 4. Jacob lost so much blood that he went into cardiopulmonary arrest. “He has undergone surgery and a number of procedures to try to stabilize his condition,” the doctor said in the statement. Rep. Alan Clemmons, a state lawmaker, posted a photo of Jacob to Facebook the day of the shooting, calling on the entire state to pray for the boy. It has since been shared more than 9,400 times. Jacob is the nephew of Clemmons’s friends and former neighbors, Dave and Sheila Williams, in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Clemmons wrote that the boy was revived twice, once during medical transport and again during surgery. “PLEASE join me in fervent prayer for little Jacob’s recovery,” the representative wrote. As of early Friday, a GoFundMe page set up for Jacob’s family had raised about $77,000. The two others shot Wednesday — a first-grade teacher and another student — were both released from the hospital. The teacher was shot in the shoulder; the child was shot in the foot. At the Walmart prayer vigil Thursday night, family members told the crowd Jacob was a fighter. “We’re waiting and hoping for a miracle,” Gerald Gambrell, one of Jacob’s older brothers, told the Greenville News. Jacob, who has light-brown hair and wears dark-rimmed glasses, was described by Gambrell as smart, “the top of his class in first grade.” Jacob attends Oakdale Baptist Church, where Marcengill preaches on Sunday mornings. At services, Marcengill told the crowd, Jacob always appeared with a smile, full of warmth. Several weeks ago, the pastor said, Jacob’s grandfather prayed with the boy to “receive the Lord.” “Six years old,” Marcengill said. “But he knew. He knew.” Then the pastor turned his attention to comforting the believers. He reminded them what the Bible says about eternity, and what will happen if their hopeful prayers aren’t answered. “If Jacob were here, he’d tell you that Jesus loves you,” the pastor said. “And that he loves you.” More from Morning Mix: A teen took a gun to his middle school.

The post quickly went viral. Related News/Archive Walmart stores around Tampa Bay found selling expired products, including baby food 2 Months Ago For some low-income workers, retirement is only a dream 2 Weeks Ago Little known 'saver's credit' helps low-income taxpayers save for retirement 8 Months Ago The Tampa Bay Times wrote a front page story about it and a local television station covered it. At the time, Walmart said employees were working fast to fix the problem. They pledged to do better. For the next three weeks, Tampa Bay Times reporters browsed the aisles of Walmart stores around Tampa Bay looking for more expired goods. We continued to find expired baby formula, sour cream, baby food, supplements and prenatal vitamins at Walmart Supercenters and Walmart Neighborhood Market stores in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties despite the media coverage that revealed the problem at local stores. Dozens of Times readers also wrote and called in with stories and photos about buying expired goods from Walmart stores in Brandon, Brooksville, Wimauma, Clearwater, Ruskin, Sebring and elsewhere. We checked out Walmart's competitors, like Aldi, Save-A-Lot, Winn-Dixie and even stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General, to see if they had expired goods, too. We didn't find any. We also found that the Walmart Supercenter stores and Walmart Neighborhood Market stores that serve neighborhoods that are low income and ethnically diverse seemed to have the most expired goods on their shelves. For example, the Walmart Neighborhood Market located at 1794 22nd St S., in St. Petersburg, where the original complaints went viral, serves a neighborhood where nearly half the homes sold over the last six months were less than $100,000. Compare that to the Walmart Neighborhood Market at 6850 22nd Ave. S., in South Pasadena, which serves more middle and upper class neighborhoods. Times reporters did not find any expired goods at this store, which is in a neighborhood where only 13 percent of homes sold over the last six months were under $100,000. Read more: Walmart stores around Tampa Bay found selling expired products, including baby food Walmart acknowledged the problems: "We want to apologize for what's been brought to our attention. This is unacceptable, and we've worked hard to remove all out-of-date products from our store shelves. We'll continue addressing this matter to make sure our customers have access to the freshest products, and we encourage them to speak to a manager about concerns they may have," said Charles Crowson, spokesman for the retailer. It appeared Walmart was making progress as time went on. Times reporters noticed fewer expired items on shelves over the three-week period. By the end, most stores no longer had expired goods at all. Phil Lempert, editor at SupermarketGuru.com, wondered if Walmart had a distribution problem. He said new technology could fix problems like this fast. "The answer lies with barcode technology," Lempert said. "New technology wouldn't allow a cashier to sell a product that was expired. The barcode would flag it for the cashier. The problem is, retailers aren't using this yet. It's a complicated issue." Troubles with stores in low income neighborhoods is common, according to recent study shows that Walmart stores nearest to low-income or diverse neighborhoods often have the worst online reviews. A study published in Contexts, a publication of the American Sociological Association, analyzed thousands of Yelp reviews of Walmart stores nationwide and found that the higher the percentage of Black or Latino residents in a specific ZIP code, the worse the Yelp reviews were for that corresponding store. Crowson described the study as "flawed" and "meritless." "Our customer traffic is up, we're hearing positive feedback from more satisfied shoppers and we remain focused on getting better," he added. Most of the specific complaints in the study had to do with too few employees working in the stores and dirty store conditions. "While there's no excuse for anyone to go into these stores and find expired goods, this sounds like a staffing problem," Lempert said. "People want to pay the cheapest price possible" so often times retailers like Walmart employ less people to make up the difference. "They can't afford to staff stores properly," Lempert said. Crowson said that staffing at Walmart stores depends on a variety of factors, including the time of the year and store sales. "We recognize the critical role our associates play in our success, and that's why we're investing $2.7 billion on education, training and wages. Those opportunities help to strengthen our associates, their families and the communities we proudly serve," he added. Staffing seemed to be a common issue among all discount grocery stores visited by Times reporters over the last three weeks. Often times there was only one or two employees working at Aldi, Save-A-Lot or Walmart Neighborhood Market stores we visited. "You never hear of this happening in chain-oriented environments," said Jeff Green, a retail analyst with Jeff Green Partners. "But Walmart is known for having especially few staffers." James Miller with the Florida Retail Federation said that sometimes retailers end up with a greater surplus of one brand of product if it doesn't sell well. "Maybe a store simply made an error in not removing that item or not reordering merchandise in a timely fashion," Miller said. "I think what you ran into with the expired food is highly unusual and were a few isolated incidents, not at all indicative of the company or industry." But this isn't the first time Walmart or another grocer has sold expired food and perishable goods. In 2008, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against Walmart, Target and a local grocery store chain over selling expired infant formula. Target settled the case for $375,000. Walmart settled two years later for $775,000. "What's the point of the expiration date? To give consumers the best, and most fresh product they can for their money," Green said. "While we can't say this was done intentionally, it's certainly not best practices, which is what Walmart usually prides itself on."

Expiration date explanations Best if used by: This is the suggested date from the manufacturer that guarantees the best flavor and quality of a food product. The product is safe for consumption after this point, but the taste may be compromised. Use by: This is the date the manufacturer has recommended for use of the product. The food product is safe for consumption after this date, but the flavor or quality may not be as good as when it was initially produced. Sell by: This is the date that tells retailers when the manufacturer thinks the food product should be removed from the shelves. Infant formula: Federal regulations require a "use by" label on infant formula under FDA inspection. If stored too long, the formula can separate and clog. The "use by" date is selected by the manufacturer or distributor of the product. Do not buy or use baby formula after its "use-by" date.

This Citibank credit card has an EMV chip Credit: Blair Hanley Frank More like this Visa moves to streamline chip-card processing certifications Chip card lawsuit to move forward against Visa, Mastercard, others MasterCard joins Visa in streamlining chip card processing Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware The rollout of smart-chip cards and chip reader in-store payment terminals in the U.S. hasn't been easy -- to put it mildly. Saturday, Oct. 1, marks a full year since banks and card companies mandated that retailers install new, more secure chip-based credit and debit card readers -- and adopt related new payment processes -- to avoid liability for fraudulent card payments. After a year of software and equipment certification backlogs, consumer angst and some mid-course corrections made by card companies in June, slow progress is being made toward a full rollout to replace insecure magnetic stripe cards and readers, all sides agreed in a series of interviews. Their collective best guess is that it will take another 18 months to three years for massive adoption of chip cards and readers to succeed in the U.S. "I would describe the chip technology rollout as making progress, but it's been a pretty bumpy ride for the past year as we worked through...issues that have come up," said Randy Vanderhoof, director of the U.S. Payments Forum, in an interview. The Forum, formerly called the EMV Migration Forum, includes members from a broad swath of card companies, banks, merchants and others. "Chip-card acceptance numbers are continuing to climb each month and that's encouraging," Vanderhoof said. "The sun will come out tomorrow, but we're not there yet." All told, around a third of card readers in the U.S. are now chip-enabled, although the numbers differ between Visa and Mastercard, for instance. Consumers today are still apt to see small retail stores that haven't installed point-of-sale terminals able to accept chip cards. At others, customers encounter newer payment terminals that have tape covering the slot where a chip card could be inserted, forcing the customer to rely on the old magnetic-stripe reader instead. Steps that major card companies took in June to speed up certifications of chip-reader software and other improvements have helped significantly. Among those changes: It now can take less than 3 seconds to make a chip-card payment, down from as high as 12 to 17 seconds, depending on the store. Big retailers like Walmart were well ahead of the game and seem to have streamlined the chip-card payment process. Analysts agree that many retailers -- other than the largest like Walmart -- got a late start on the chip-card reader conversion prior to the Oct. 1, 2015 deadline, partly because equipment was costly and installations were complex. Then, in early January, merchants began facing long backlogs to get the equipment and software certified. "The bottom line is that this process has been very challenging, but progress is being made," conceded Mallory Duncan, general counsel for the National Retail Federation, which represents 18,000 retailers. He spoke in an interview earlier this week. "Retailers are still very upset at the behavior of the card companies and banks -- for different reasons. The whole conversion process was conceptually flawed from the beginning," he said; in fact, some NRF members still have not completely bought into the idea. The conversion has spawned several lawsuits against card companies by retailers that are long-time enemies over "swipe fees" -- the charges merchants pay card companies for each card transaction. Home Depot sued Visa and Mastercard in June, similar to a Walmart suit in May, primarily over whether the inconvenience and expense of installing new chip reader technology will truly result in technology that's secure enough. Retailers generally want banks and card companies to require chip-and-PIN (Personal Identification Number) credit card security to buy something, not just chip-and-signature. Having a PIN atop chip security would help guard against the theft of a card from a purse or gym locker and improve online payment security, Duncan said. NRF estimates the cost to install equipment and software needed for card readers will reach $30 billion to $35 billion in the U.S. "It's a $30 billion Edsel," Duncan said. "And our customers are putting up with it." Card companies have defended using signatures instead of PIN partly for customer convenience, since many customers would have to keep track of the PIN specific to a particular card, atop all the other PINs and passwords that modern consumers with smartphones and computers must remember. Card companies cite progress For their part, both Mastercard and Visa have denied virtually all the arguments used against them by retailers in their filings in the recent lawsuits. While noting that much of the rest of the world has moved to chip-card technology, both card companies recently said the chip-card and payment-terminal rollout is making significant progress in the U.S. Still, both admit there have been problems. Visa said this week that nearly 1.5 million businesses are chip-reader enabled, representing about 37% of the dollars spent with Visa cards in stores. Visa also said that counterfeit fraud, in terms of dollars lost at stores that have chip-card technology, had dropped 47% in May, compared to a year earlier. Earlier in September, Mastercard reported similar results, saying that chip-active terminals had reached 2 million business locations on the Mastercard network, about one-third of all U.S. merchants. Also, Mastercard said counterfeit fraud costs had declined by 54% in April, compared to a year earlier, for stores that have chip card terminals. Mastercard added that 87% of Americans commonly use chip cards now, up from 49% in 2015, according to a survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers. This number takes into account consumers with all credit cards, not just Mastercard. Even so, another survey of 1,000 U.S. shoppers conducted in early September found 83% of shoppers were confused about whether retailers will accept chip cards or not. The survey, by Research Now on behalf of payment technology provider Cayan, also found that if a chip card transaction takes more than five seconds, it will jeopardize a shopper’s loyalty to a store brand. Both card companies have cited the complexity of the rollout in the U.S. A Mastercard blog focused on consumers, for example, notes that "figuring out whether to insert or swipe your card at any given store is frustrating, but more and more stores are updating to new terminals." The blog adds that paying with a chip card will take a few seconds longer than with a mag-stripe card. "The process will feel more natural in time, but as with anything new, there is an adjustment period." "We know things won't change overnight," said Craig Vosburg, president of North America for Mastercard, in a statement. Visa sounded a similar tone. "From a consumer perspective, this is a process. It's certainly going to be some time before things stabilize," added Stephanie Ericksen, vice president of risk and authentication products at Visa, in an interview. "There have been some lessons learned. There's going to be a different experience at different merchants and the dialog continues about how to best do this." She added: "Based on the complexity of the U.S. environment and the number of participants in the payment system, we think things are going well and are on track. We're already reaping benefits." The card companies use a metric known as "chip on chip" to measure the overall impact of the rollout, which refers to the percentage of a card company's total payment volume that is recorded from chip cards using chip-reader terminals. For Visa, that value in the U.S. has reached about 30% after a year of rollouts, Ericksen said. That puts the U.S. in a good light when compared to earlier rollouts of chip technology in Brazil, Canada and Australia -- where it took about three years to reach 60% of domestic payment volume of chip on chip. "We've focused to move to [chip technology] as quickly as possible," she added. Other industry assessments vary While the discomfort and confusion for consumers will continue a while longer, security experts believe the change to chip cards will be worthwhile. One security company, Trustwave, regularly performed forensic investigations of credit card theft for Australian companies in 2011 before that country's shift to chip-card technology. "Now, post-chip, we do no investigations like that," said Michael Petitti, senior vice president of global alliances for Trustwave, in an interview. "We will see that trend in the U.S. as well." Petitti agreed to some extent with merchants about the need for chip and PIN. "Chip and signature is a step in the right direction, but customers still need to be vigilant. Chip and signature is not as a secure as chip and PIN." Analysts who study payments in the U.S. have generally been critical of the chip technology rollout and are outspoken about it. "Chip compatibility today varies widely from merchant to merchant, creating a horrendous experience," said Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research. "There is simply no way for a consumer to know what to expect prior to arriving to the point of sale." He predicted that it will take another 18 months, in the best case, before the chip technology rollout "resembles anything close to a coherent, uniform process in the U.S." McKee said chip technology has made "some nominal improvement" to reducing card fraud "but until merchant acceptance becomes ubiquitous, we won't see meaningful results." By ubiquitous, he means over 90% merchant implementation. James Wester, an analyst at IDC, said in an interview that he's had to tone down his comments about the rollout, but called the rollout "largely unsatisfactory" in a July report. He blamed the card companies for implementing a rollout plan with "very little input from important stakeholders, namely merchants." But he also spread the blame. "The fault for the mess...can be shared by many parties," he said, including card companies, banks, intermediaries called "merchant acquirers" and merchants themselves. "The rollout of chip cards into the U.S. market has been a mess," Wester added. "The good news is that issues will be ironed out over time." Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates, said, "Most consumers in the U.S. see chip cards as a pain ... and it has made some stores say, 'Why should I install something that makes my customers unhappy?' " Worries over chip cards at gas pumps linger While consumers slowly learn to accept chip cards at sales terminals in stores, there's hope that the transition in coming months to chip cards for use at ATMs and gas station self-service pumps will go more smoothly. Mastercard has imposed a mandate of this Saturday -- October 1, 2016 -- for its chip cards to be used at ATMs, while Visa has imposed its ATM mandate for Oct. 1, 2017. Analysts widely agree that ATM chip-reader rollouts, especially for ATMs in bank branches, will go smoothly. However, chip-card payments at gas pumps could be thornier. "The possibility of potential problems at the pump is real," Wester said, but at least the retail experience has shown where the biggest problems could be and how best to educate consumers. Self-service pumps must function in all types of outdoor conditions, and conversions will be expensive. The chip card rollout at the gas pump "still has a long way to go and there are real challenges because of some of the complexities in the infrastructure with pay at the pump," Vanderhoof agreed. Gas pumps must accept chip cards by Oct. 1, 2017, or dealers without an upgrade will assume card fraud liability. The transition is bound to happen, even with all the bumps. Like most any new technology, Gold said, "the longer chip cards are in use, the more consumers will get used to using them despite delays in checkout."

For $20 or less, you and your significant other can be the life of any party with a DIY couples costume that's easy and cheap to put together. Check out these ideas to find the perfect couples costume for your Halloween celebration. 1. Shaggy and Velma From 'Scooby-Doo' Estimated cost: $17 How long it takes to make: 10 minutes What you need: For Shaggy, you’ll need a green T-shirt, a pair of jeans or dark pants and black tennis shoes. For Velma, you’ll need an orange shirt, red skirt or dress, red shoes and orange knee-high socks. Where to get supplies: Many of the supplies needed for this costume are probably already in your closet. If you don’t have a green shirt for Shaggy, try visiting your local thrift store. And if you have a green shirt with a logo on it, you can always turn it inside out. For Velma, you can find an orange T-shirt for about $5 at Walmart, a red skirt for as little as $9 on Amazon and orange knee-high socks for about $3, also on Amazon. DIY instructions: This costume is pretty simple, requiring no do-it-yourself work. Collect the necessary costume pieces, and you will be good to go. Read: DIY Halloween Kids Costumes for Under $10 2. Wilma and Betty From 'The Flintstones' Estimated cost: $14 How long it takes to make: 2 hours What you need: For Wilma, you’ll need a white dress and fake pearl necklace. The Betty costume requires a blue dress and blue bow. If you’re super crafty, you could create your own Wilma and Betty dresses using white and blue fabric and one of your existing dresses as a pattern. Where to get supplies: If you don’t already have white and blue dresses in your wardrobes, head over to a fabric store and purchase inexpensive fleece or cotton. Use leftover blue fabric to create Betty’s big blue bow and buy a cheap necklace from Forever 21. DIY instructions: You’ll likely need to purchase 1.5 yards of fabric for each dress. Use a pencil and paper to trace a pattern around one of your existing dresses, leaving a few extra inches at the bottom to add in the Flintstone-signature zig-zag design. Once you’ve cut the dress patterns, use a sewing machine — or a needle and thick thread — to stitch it all together. 3. Marty and Jennifer From 'Back to the Future' Estimated cost: $20 How long it takes to make: 10 minutes What you need: For Marty, you’ll need a flannel shirt, red puffy vest and jeans. For Jennifer, you’ll want some type of blue vest — puffy or denim works fine — a collared white shirt and light pink pants or leggings. Where to get supplies: Your closet probably already boasts a flannel shirt, collared white shirt and jeans. Go to your local thrift store for a red puffy vest, and keep an eye out for a blue denim vest and pink pants. The light pink pants will probably be the hardest to find, so if you don’t have luck at the thrift shop, check out Amazon to find the best deals. DIY instructions: This one’s easy: find the supplies, and you’re done. 4. Stick Figures Estimated cost: $20 How long it takes to make: 1 hour What you need: This costume requires two pairs of white sweatpants, two white long-sleeved T-shirts, black tape, white paper or paper plates and a black marker. Where to get supplies: Find inexpensive white sweatpants for less than $8 at Walmart or a thrift store. If you don’t own a white T-shirt, check out deals for packs of white long-sleeved tees on Amazon. There's a good chance you have black electrical tape in your junk drawer. DIY instructions: Start by drawing your face on a white paper plate or piece of paper and use any type of string — even a shoelace — to tie the mask around your head when you’re ready to hit the town on Halloween. For the body, place your white tee and white sweatpants on the floor and draw out stick-figure limbs using the black tape. 5. Pokemon Team Rocket Estimated cost: $20 How long it takes to make: 30 minutes What you need: Create an all-black outfit using black pants and a black shirt, a black skirt and top or black dress. You will also need white or black gloves, red tape, white paper and a black marker. Where to get supplies: Raid your closet for black clothing, hit your local Dollar Store or Dollar Tree to find gloves and purchase red tape at Walmart, Target, Staples or Office Depot. You’ll find the best deals on black hats at your local thrift store or on Amazon. DIY instructions: Start by using a black marker to draw giant exclamation points on the white paper. Next, use the red tape to draw a letter "R" on each of your shirts. Finish the outfit by cutting the tips of the fingers off your gloves.

Juno and Bleeker From 'Juno' Estimated cost: $13 How long it takes to make: 10 minutes What you need: For Bleeker, you’ll need gold gym shorts, a burgundy T-shirt, white socks, white tennis shoes, a gold sweatband and matching gold wristbands. For the Juno costume, find jeans, a zip-up hoodie, a striped orange T-shirt and a brown skirt. Where to get supplies: First, search through your wardrobe or ask your friends for pieces. If you can’t find an article of clothing, explore your local thrift store. The most difficult item to find will likely be Juno's striped orange shirt, but you can purchase one on Amazon for around $10. You’ll also be able to find a gold sweatband and wristband set for less than $3 on Amazon. DIY instructions: Get all your supplies together, get dressed and you’re done. 7. Black and White Characters Estimated cost: $16 How long it takes to make: 30 minutes What you need: You’ll need black hairspray and low-cost costume makeup to create a grayscale effect on your skin. Additionally, you'll want to pick up black eyeliner and black and white clothing. Where to get supplies: You’ll easily find cream makeup and hairspray at stores like Party City or your local Halloween pop-up shop. DIY instructions: Wear as much clothing as possible (think long sleeves and pants) to minimize the amount of gray costume makeup required and save money. Ideally, you should only be using the makeup on your face, neck and hands. Before applying the makeup, spray your hair with the black hairspray, so you won’t get any residue on your finished skin. Don your black and white garb, use a sponge to apply the makeup and finish it off with black eyeliner. 8. Ice Skaters Estimated cost: $17 How long it takes to make: 10 minutes What you need: Your costumes will require black spandex, a tight black shirt and a leotard. Where to get supplies: Stop by your local thrift store to see if there are any fun leotards on the rack. If you can't find anything appropriate, visit Amazon online to find a plain leotard for as little as $5. Use stockings or pantyhose that are already in your wardrobe to finish the woman’s costume. Check out ASOS for men’s black spandex, and use a black shirt already in your closet. DIY instructions: Assemble your costume, and you're ready to party. 9. Tina and Jimmy Jr. From 'Bob’s Burgers' Estimated cost: $11 How long it takes to make: 10 minutes What you need: For Tina, you’ll need a black skirt, blue shirt, white socks with red stripes and a pair of glasses. For Jimmy Jr., pick up a yellow shirt, jeans and large headphones. Where to get supplies: Find a black skirt and jeans in your closet. If you don't have T-shirts and socks in the appropriate shades, check out Walmart and Amazon for deals. Many of us have black-framed glasses and large headphones lying around the house, but you can also find these items at your local thrift store. As a last resort, buy a cheap pair of black-framed sunglasses at the drugstore and pop out the lenses. DIY instructions: This costume is perfect for couples who tend to procrastinate; it doesn’t require any DIY crafting. 10. Bunnies Estimated cost: $13 How long it takes to make: 30 minutes or less What you need: You’ll need white and pink clothing, and either two sets of bunny ears or two headbands, construction paper and tape. Where to get supplies: Use whatever white and pink clothing you have in your closet — and consider adding an inexpensive tutu for extra flare. Find bunny ears in the Halloween section of your local dollar store, Walmart, party store or Halloween shop. You can also make your own bunny ears with headbands and colored construction paper from a local craft store. DIY instructions: You’ll only need to get crafty for this one if you opt to create your own bunny ears. In that case, draw four ears on white construction paper and cut out the patterns. Next, draw four smaller ears on the pink paper, and cut them out. Glue or tape the pink ear on top of the white ear. Then use tape or glue to secure the ears to the headband. If you have trouble keeping the ears up, try adding a pipe cleaner or straw to the back of each ear for support. Related: 10 Outrageously Expensive Halloween Costumes for Pets 11. Wayne and Garth From 'Wayne’s World' Estimated cost: $18 How long it takes to make: 10 minutes What you need: This costume requires ripped jeans, T-shirts, a flannel shirt, a black hat and an optional blonde wig. Where to get supplies: Most of these items are probably already in your closet. If you don’t have ripped jeans, find an old pair you never wear and rip them at the knees. Unless you both have long hair, you might want to consider getting wigs. We found a Garth wig and glasses set online for just $10.31, and a Wayne wig and hat for only $6.95 at Ziggos Party. DIY instructions: This one is self-explanatory; assemble the pieces and get dressed. 12. Deer and Headlights Estimated cost: $15 How long it takes to make: 30 minutes What you need: For the deer costume, find some brown clothing and pick up a set of antlers or a brown headband and pipe cleaners. For the headlights, you’ll need all-black clothing, yellow tape and two wireless stick-on LED lights. Where to get supplies: If you can’t find deer antlers — some are already on shelves for the holiday season — head to your local craft store for a headband and brown pipe cleaners. You can also pick up yellow tape or inexpensive yellow fabric while you’re there. Next, search around for wireless stick-on LED lights; Amazon has a set of three for less than $6. DIY instructions: For the deer antlers, twist two brown pipe cleaners around your headband and add pipe cleaners as necessary to create the look of antlers. For the headlights, use yellow tape to create dotted lines on your black outfit and add two wireless stick-on LED lights, using extra tape on the back of the lights to keep them secure. 13. Old Married Couple Estimated cost: $20 How long it takes to make: 10 minutes What you need: Out-of-style clothing, glasses and optional gray hairspray are all you need for this couples costume. Where to get supplies: Find old-fashioned clothes at your local thrift store, or see what your relatives might be willing to let you borrow. You can buy gray hairspray at your local party store or Halloween shop and borrow some big-framed glasses from a friend. DIY instructions: If you opt to spray-paint your hair gray, be sure to avoid getting the spray on any items of clothing, especially if they’re borrowed. 14. Minions Estimated cost: $18 How long it takes to make: 10 minutes What you need: This costume requires yellow shirts, overalls or jeans and suspenders and googles. Where to get supplies: If you don’t already have a yellow shirt or sweatshirt, shop for the best deals at either Walmart or Amazon. Borrow two pairs of overalls from friends — they made a style comeback recently, so someone is bound to have them. Buy two sets of safety goggles at your local Walmart or home improvement store. DIY instructions: This one doesn’t require any instructions other than putting the outfits on. 15. FBI Agents Estimated cost: $0 How long it takes to make: 10 minutes What you need: This costume requires two pants suits, two skirt suits or one of each. Where to get supplies: Find suits in your closet or your parents' closet. Next, purchase a badge or scrounge up some markers and white paper. An index card will also do the trick. DIY instructions: Search for FBI badge images online and use the pictures as reference when creating your replicas.

Barclays believes that Wal-Mart stock can rise by more than 20% from current levels, and the thesis doesn't sound at all unreasonable. Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 29, 2016 at 7:00PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) stock is doing remarkably well lately; shares of the retail juggernaut have gained almost 20% year to date. Even better, the stock still has a lot to offer to investors, at least according to Barclays. The bank recently upgraded Wal-Mart from an "equal weight" to an "overweight" rating, increasing its price target for the stock from $70 to $87 per share. This implies an attractive upside potential of more than 20% versus current price levels. Investors should always take Wall Street recommendations with a grain of salt; professional analysts can make mistakes just like everyone else, and they often do. However, there is nothing wrong with taking a look at Barclays' bullish thesis for Wal-Mart to find out whether it makes sense. The tide is turning The discount retail industry has always been notoriously challenging and competitive, and things are getting even more difficult for brick-and-mortar retailers due to asphyxiating competitive pressure from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). The online retailer is focused on providing aggressively low prices and a high-quality experience to customers, even when these come at the expense of its own profitability. Competing against a company such as Amazon, which is willing to put market-share gains over profits, can be a daunting challenge, and this is having a negative impact on retailers across the board.  But Wal-Mart is fighting back; the company is increasing its investments in people and technology to improve service quality and accelerate online growth. In addition, Wal-Mart has recently formed an alliance with Chinese e-commerce operator JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and the company has invested $3.3 billion in the purchase of online retailer Jet.com. According to Barclays, these initiatives are generating improving performance at Wal-Mart. As quoted by CNBC, the Barclays note to clients says: "We believe the tide is turning [for Wal-Mart]. Investments in labor appear to be resonating with the employees and therefore the customers, the quality of the product offering is improving, and service and execution has improved." The company doesn't disclose its internal customer satisfaction figures, but management is talking about consistent improvements in customer satisfaction and service over the past several quarters. Specifically, CEO Doug McMillon said in the most recent conference call: "Our customer satisfaction scores have continued to strengthen and our in-stock has gotten better. Our associates are responding and I'm proud of them." The company is making sound progress in key areas such as mobile payment technologies. Its digital payment app is now available in the more than 4,600 Wal-Mart stores nationwide. According to the company, four out of five customers would recommend using Walmart Pay, and 88% of transactions come from repeat Walmart Pay users. These numbers speak well of customer satisfaction scores in mobile payments. While the company still has substantial room for improvement, revenue figures are pointing in the right direction. Global revenue excluding currency fluctuations grew 2.8% last quarter, and comparable sales in the U.S. exceeded the company's guidance, with a year-over-year increase of 1.6%. Wal-Mart has delivered positive comparable sales in the U.S. over the past eight consecutive quarters, while traffic has increased for seven quarters in a row. About the price target Wall Street analysts are estimating that Wal-Mart will make $4.34 in earnings per share over the current year. Of course, earnings forecasts are subject to errors and adjustments, and analysts have, in fact, increased their earnings estimates for Wal-Mart over the past several months. Just 90 days ago, Wall Street was expecting $4.26 in earnings per share from the company, so estimates are increasing as a reflection of positive business momentum. Based on current earnings expectations, Wal-Mart stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio in the area of 16.5, while a price target of $87 per share would put the stock at a P/E of around 20. As a reference, the average company in the S&P 500 index is currently trading at a P/E in the neighborhood of 19.3. Similarly, Wal-Mart pays a dividend of $0.50 quarterly per share; this represents a dividend yield of 2.8% at current prices. The $87 price target from Barclays would mean a dividend yield of 2.3%, which is the average dividend yield currently offered by companies in the S&P 500. An $87 price target for Wal-Mart would mean a valuation roughly in line with the average stock in the S&P 500. The company operates in a difficult segment, and growth rates will probably remain below average over the medium term, so Wal-Mart needs to continue delivering improvements to justify an expansion in valuation ratios. However, as long as management keeps leading the company in the right direction, Barclays' price target for the company doesn't seem unreasonable at all. Andrés Cardenal owns shares of Amazon.com.

Bloomberg Call it the Great Grocery-Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs by 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Albertsons recently advertised a deal you don't normally see on your finer cuts of meat: "buy 1 get 1 free" specials on "USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak." And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, New Jersey, you could pick up a dozen eggs at Wal-Mart. (OK, the price was actually $1.14.) A mile away, check out Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck -- 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago you would have paid, on average, three times that price. In a startling development, almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. It's the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 -- with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out; grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. Eggs and beef have have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn't only an American phenomenon: In England, Aldi recently offered its prized 8-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 -- a little more than the price of a pint of beer. "The severity of what we're seeing is completely unprecedented," said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years. "We've never seen deflation this sharp." Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston had fallen almost 5 percent over the past year. He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Wal-Mart in Secaucus, New Jersey, to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but has recently noticed the steals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of "Angus steak burgers" fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound.     ▲ Shoppers push carts through the grocery department at a Wal-Mart in Chicago on Nov. 25, 2015. (MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Daniel Acker) — Bloomberg Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Wal-Marts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. "Wherever I find the good deals -- that's where I'm at," Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. "It starts to border on irrational pricing," said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins." Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi's German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market -- famously derided as "Whole Paycheck" -- is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce. In recent years, Kroger -- the largest grocery store chain in the U.S., with nearly 2,800 stores -- cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company's stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don't even notice. "The other thing that's always hard is getting your message out, because it's fascinating - in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money," McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen's lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer's budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly.     ▲ A customer walks through the parking lot of a Whole Foods Market in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 1, 2016. (MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Luke Sharrett) Bloomberg At the same time, restaurant food can still be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin' Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, 63, a retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, New Jersey. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 -- one of the great food deals of recent memory.

The project will be available exclusively at Walmart on Nov. 18. Strait Out of the Box: Part 2 will be made up of three discs, featuring a total of 56 tracks: 36 hit singles (including 26 No. 1s and his newest single, “Goin’ Goin’ Gone”), 18 album cuts and two brand-new tunes. A complete track listing has not been revealed, but all of the songs contained in the collection were curated by Strait himself, according to a press release, from music released between 1996 and 2016. Strait Out of the Box: Part 2 picks up where Strait Out of the Box, Strait’s 1995 box set, left off. That four-disc collection features music released by Strait between 1976 and 1995, and has, to date, sold more than 8 million copies, making it one of the best-selling musical box sets of all time. Strait’s newest single, “Goin’ Goin’ Gone,” comes from his most recent new album, Cold Beer Conversation, released in September of 2015, just days after Strait announced the project while sharing plans for his Las Vegas shows. The record is part of a five-album deal that he signed with longtime label MCA in 2013. Strait Out of the Box: Part 2 is available for pre-order via Walmart.com. Strait’s next concerts in Vegas are scheduled for Dec. 2 and Dec. 3, 2016. He will also be performing in Sin City on Feb. 17 and 18, 2017. Test Your George Strait Knowledge!

The most visible spurt of innovation comes in the dessert category, explained senior category director for Walmart's bakery operations Laura Rush in an interview. The world's largest retailer is fresh off an early September debut of five new desserts in concert with Grammy-winning artist Patti Labelle: berry cobbler, apple cobbler, peach cobbler, apple pecan cake and sweet potato loaf. More recently, it debuted French brioche sliced bread, and an enhanced crumb cake that has frosting and an apple pie that is 75% apples as opposed a mixture of apples and slurry. Rush pointed out that more than half of Walmart's bakery items are now prepared in store.

In the most recent quarter, the company shared earnings per share of $1.07, $0.05 higher than the analysts’ estimates. On the sales front, the company’s revenue came in at $120.90 billion, a surge of 0.6 percent year-over-year. On the other hand, Wal-Mart’s foremost competitor, Target, reported revenue of $16.17 billion, a drop of 7.2 percent year-over-year. Due to the recent developments, Oliver Chen, an analyst from Cowen, has changed his ratings for both Wal-Mart as well as Target. In the case of Wal-Mart, he upgraded his rating from market perform to outperform. On the contrary, he lowered his rating on Target from outperform to market perform. This downgrade doesn’t really seem surprising as Target has posted year over year revenue declines for three successive quarters, and the deficits are hastening. Comps sales are destructive, and Chen details that recent initiatives to fortify pharmacy and grocery are not resonating with shoppers. Chen also reported that Target is losing market share to Wal-Mart. As a matter of fact, if Target is mislaying share to Wal-Mart and other online retailers, it is likely a great thing that Wal-Mart is buying Jet.com to make its presence robust in the dot-com game. Image by MichaelGaida / Pixabay And this is the main reason why Chen changed his stance on the world’s largest retailer. Apart from this, a few days earlier, Wal-Mart started online grocery pickup in four stores in Minneapolis, with a fifth outlet to start two months later. The start of service in Minneapolis is prominent with the stores not far from the headquarters of Target. Furthermore, the company detailed that approximately 30,000 Wal-Mart items are adequate for online grocery pickup, and the minimum eligible amount per order is $30. In contrast, earlier this year, Target decided to place emphasis on its Instacart partnership in place of a store pickup service. Sales at Wal-Mart are much better than Target, as U.S comps have been positive for eight successive quarters, and the crowd is also increasing. Looking ahead, I expect this trend to continue. I think Wal-Mart is a much better buy than Target at this point in time. Given the growth trends, I expect Wal-Mart to continue outperforming its smaller rival, which is impressive given Wal-Mart’s huge size. Hence, I think investors should dump Target in favour of Wal-Mart. Published on Sep 30, 2016 By Akshansh Gandhi Copyrighted 2016. Content published with author's permission. Posted in ...

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Wal-Mart fire suspect faces mental health evaluation Thursday Sep 29, 2016 at 8:41 AM Sep 29, 2016 at 9:43 PM Brian Lee Telegram & Gazette Staff @BLeeTG DUDLEY - The lawyer for a Wal-Mart cashier who is accused of setting three fires, damaging most of the Sturbridge store’s inventory, said Thursday that his client reported hearing voices at the time of the alleged crime. Maiya A. Cruz, 20, of 261 Ashland Avenue, Southbridge, was ordered held until an Oct. 4 dangerousness hearing in Dudley District Court. Ms. Cruz will be evaluated by a court clinician, as called for in prosecutor Joseph A. Simmons’ motion, which was allowed by Judge Gerald A. Lemire. Ms. Cruz is charged with three counts each of burning building contents and malicious destruction of property valued at more than $250, and a count each of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. Defense lawyer Thomas W. Brosseau asked that Ms. Cruz be committed to a state hospital for an evaluation pursuant to a hearing to determine her competence to stand trial. Outside the court, some of Ms. Cruz’s family members and supporters were tearful. Those who spoke to reporters said that Ms. Cruz is a good person who needs help rather than incarceration for her mental issues. Her grandmother, Maria Brayman, said that Ms. Cruz should answer to the allegation, and she hoped her granddaughter could now get the help that she needs. Ms. Brayman said her granddaughter’s behavior had been escalating, but she did not say how it had been escalating. Dan Davis said that his son is in a relationship with Ms. Cruz and the couple live with him. Mr. Davis said Ms. Cruz had returned to working at Wal-Mart about three weeks ago after taking a leave of absence. Mr. Davis said the couple had been saving money to get their own place. He said the recent loss of a wallet, as the couple struggled to save money, might have pushed her over the edge. According to a police report by Sturbridge Officer Joseph Ballotte II, police decided to charge Ms. Cruz because she was observed on surveillance video in the immediate area of all three fires, and she had left the parking lot following evacuation of the store, and prior to the end of her shift. Officers were sent to Wal-Mart, 100 Charlton Road, just before 5:30 p.m. Tuesday. There was a reported fire in the jewelry area. Police said several men used a fire extinguisher to spray about 30 purses that were piled in an aisle. One of the men had been shopping and told police he became alarmed when he smelled something burning. He said he saw flames to the ceiling. As police spoke to the men, the store’s assistant manager said there were two other fires. There was a burned metal trash can by the women’s restroom in the rear of the store that had been put out. In the seasonal section, police said a burning piñata that was on a shelf had been moved and extinguished in the garden section. The store manager said the suspect used what appeared to be hand sanitizer, which is alcohol based, as an accelerant, police said. The Fire Department arrived a short time later and finished extinguishing the purses. They also “aired out” the building, which was filled with smoke and dust from the extinguishers. A view of surveillance video showed Ms. Cruz running from the purse section after the fire. While she ran, it was evident customers weren’t yet aware of the fire, the report said. The customers stared at Ms. Cruz as she passed. Police said footage showed that the suspect was a dark-skinned, slender woman who, throughout the episode, wore a red sweater and held a distinct black purse with a gold emblem. The sweater and purse were in Ms. Cruz’s work locker. Police said they looked inside the purse and found at least five cigarette lighters. After two Wal-Mart employees identified Ms. Cruz on the video footage, police went outside to speak to her, but another employee said Ms. Cruz had left the parking lot because she said she needed to use the bathroom at the nearby Stop & Shop. Police said they did not find Ms. Cruz in Stop & Shop, but they spoke to an employee of the grocery store who had spoken to someone who looked like Ms. Cruz and who had gone to the bathroom. The employee told police the woman had said there were three intentionally-set fires in Wal-Mart. They said she knew the exact location of each fire, and had compared them to recent fires that destroyed a brick building in Southbridge on Main Street and damaged an apartment building on Benefit Street. A Stop & Shop worker told police the Wal-Mart employee had been picked up in an older model Saturn. Southbridge police went to her home but no one was there. Officer Sean Paine said he called Ms. Cruz’s cell phone to tell her that Sturbridge police needed to speak to her about the store fires. But she told him she was in West Boylston and hung up. Her cell phone’s GPS indicated she was in Southbridge, police said. Officers eventually located a dark-colored Saturn in front of her mother’s home in Southbridge. But her mother Magaly Medina, refused to let officers inside, police said. She locked the doors and told investigators to get a warrant. Investigators said Ms. Cruz turned herself in to Auburn police around 9:15 p.m. Wednesday, following the daylong search. The store will have to be closed at least seven days to dispose of nearly everything inside the store, which was damaged by smoke and dust from fire extinguishers. Management told police the Sturbridge health department ordered the store to throw away all food. A Subway restaurant inside Wal-Mart was also ordered to destroy its food.  Police said it is impossible to estimate the amount of damage. Wal-Mart requested 24-hour police details until further notice to watch the store as it removes inventory and cleans the store. The state police Fire Marshal's office is assisting with the investigation.  About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Register/Subscribe Subscriber Services T&G E-Edition Worcester Living E-Edition NIE Business Matters Coupon Values FAQ Photo reprints (non-commercial use) Commercial photo licenses Advertising Advertising Contacts Propel Marketing - Digital Marketplace Media Kit Place an Ad Jobs Real Estate Pets Legal Notices News Contact Us Letters to the Editor Submit a Press Release Events Copyright/Terms of Use Marketing About Us Visions Contact Us The Item The Banner Reprints & Licensing Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

"Dick too big, might kill someone." By Diana Bruk Sep 29, 2016 Some bad news: that "I'd Rather Be Snorting Cocaine Off a Hooker's Ass" slogan T-shirt you wanted for your birthday is no longer available at Walmart. As first noted by Mashable, that and a whole slew of other offensive men's tees were available on Walmart's website, somewhat undermining the company's wholesome, family-friendly image. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Mashable reached out to Walmart, and the company responded by saying that the shirt "obviously has no business being on our site" and that they are "removing it ASAP." Too late, you'll have to spend your $19.95 elsewhere! "We apologize to anyone who was offended," a Walmart spokesperson added. It turns out the shirt wasn't sold directly by Walmart but by a third-party site called Hollywood Thread. When Walmart works with third-party retailers, the spokesperson explained to Mashable, it gives them a detailed list of policies for what they are allowed to sell. Once the item is uploaded onto the site, it goes through a filter that's supposed to flag down any banned words. Except that obviously didn't happen with a number of Hollywood Thread's products. Like these ones: Walmart Walmart There's also a "MASTER BAITER" fishing pun (get it?) and an "I <3 BREASTFEEDING" design, for when you're feeling particularly classy. The oversight is particularly noteworthy considering that Walmart famously banned a shirt in 1995 that featured a Dennis the Menace character saying, ""Someday a woman will be PRESIDENT!" Why? Because the concept went against the store's "values" at the time. NICK KAPUR/TWITTER I think that's what the kids call irony. Follow Diana on Twitter.

Troopers initially identified 32-year-old Pablo Jackson through video surveillance after he and 25-year-old Joshua L. Bryant used credit cards reported stolen from vehicles parked outside houses in the 1300 block of S. State St. and the 1700 block of Windswept Court at two area Walmarts, said Master Cpl. Gary Fournier, a spokesman with Delaware State Police. The men took items like cash and purses from the vehicles and started making purchases at the Cheswold Walmart and Camden Walmart totaling more than $3,400, Fournier said. Arrest warrants were written shortly after their identities were confirmed, he said. On Wednesday, a trooper and probation officer assigned to the State Police Kent County Governor’s Task Force were patrolling the area of South DuPont Highway and Lochmeath Way when they saw Jackson walking northbound on the southbound shoulder of U.S. 13, Fournier said. When they made a u-turn to stop Jackson, police watched him look into vehicles near the South Side Baptist Church, Fournier said. STORY: Woman who set deadly Wilmington blaze was angry, court documents show STORY: Few clues before killing of 3-year-old boy in Felton Jackson then took off running from the officers, dropping a backpack he was carrying along the way, he said. Police told him numerous times to stop, but he refused, Fournier added. The trooper was eventually able to stop him and arrest him, Fournier said. Inside his backpack, police found 24 bags of heroin, as well as drug paraphernalia, he said. Joshua Bryant  (Photo: DELAWARE STATE POLICE) Jackson was charged with resisting arrest, possession of a controlled substance (heroin), and two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia. He was also charged with 18 counts of identity theft, five counts of attempted identity theft, 18 counts of unauthorized use of a credit card, five counts of attempted unauthorized use of a credit card, two counts of theft under $1,500, 10 counts of theft by false pretense under $1,500, conspiracy and two counts of criminal trespass. He was taken to Sussex Correctional Institution near Georgetown on a total of $93,600 cash bail.  Bryant, of Cheswold, has not been located and is wanted for numerous counts of identity theft and other associated charges, as well as multiple court capiases. Anyone with information on his whereabouts should contact Detective A. Goode at (302) 698-8517. Tips may also be provided to Delaware Crime Stoppers at 1-800-TIP-3333, at delaware.crimestoppersweb.com or by texting to 274637 (CRIMES) using the keyword DSP.

Scott Bennett, who was appointed to the position in 2015 against Republican challenger Mike Madigan, a member of the Urbana City Council. Madigan and Bennett will appear at 7 p.m. Oct. 5 in a candidate forum sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Champaign County, the NAACP and The News-Gazette. It will be held at the Champaign City Council chambers, 102 N. Neil St., C. Scott Bennett Democrat, Champaign 1. What in your opinion is the primary problem with Illinois state government at this time and what, as one legislator out of 177, do you think you can do to help solve it? There is a division between both parties right now. During my short time in office, I have done my best to make decisions that are in the best interest of the 52nd District. I have shown my independence from party leadership with my vote against the unbalanced "Madigan budget" in May and have continued to fight against cuts to the University of Illinois, Parkland Community College and Danville Area Community College. I have taken pride in my ability to work with legislators on the other side of the aisle. I worked with Sen. Chapin Rose on protecting the Mahomet Aquifer and Rep. Tom Bennett on educating new parents on preventing SIDS. We need to put our political games aside and do what is best for our constituents and that is something I will continue to do. 2. Do you have an idea how the state's unfunded pension liability problem can be eased, or should the state merely continue to cover pension costs as it has in recent years? The underfunding problems have resulted from the state's past failures to meet its obligations. In the process, past decisions have allowed our pension liabilities to grow. During my time in the Senate, I have voted to pay all of our pension obligations and if I'm elected to represent the 52nd District this November, I will continue to do so. We didn't arrive at this predicament overnight and this problem can't be solved overnight. It is clear after the Illinois Supreme Court's decision on the 2013 pension reform that we cannot make unilateral decisions. Whatever decision we reach has to be with all parties at the table to find a compromise that is beneficial for existing retirees and Illinois' long-term financial prospects. 3. Faced with the need to raise taxes to help balance the budget and pay down the backlog of bills, what taxes would you be willing to impose and/or increase, and what taxes would you not want to impose and/or increase? We should not talk about raising taxes until we make sure we explore every possible alternative. We cannot afford to balance the budget on the backs of Illinois' families. We need to update our existing tax codes and reduce corporate loopholes for large businesses like Walmart. Walmart receives about $100 million yearly in tax breaks from Illinois, that means over the span of 10 years taxpayers are giving Walmart executives $1 billion to stay in Illinois. This is unnecessary. Corporate loopholes like this need to be explored and reformed before there is talk of instituting any type of tax on working families. I'm also against taxing retirement income. Our retirees have made life decisions based on a contract made with the state. People often forget that retirees such as our retired teachers do not receive Social Security. At a time in their lives that they cannot go back to work or alter their past financial decisions, it is unfair to tax their fixed income. 4. Are there any parts of Gov. Bruce Rauner's remaining Turnaround Agenda items (term limits; removing the ability of legislators to draw legislative districts; property tax relief including allowing local governments to opt out of prevailing wage and collective bargaining agreements) that you would be open to considering in 2017? I'm a strong supporter of term limits for legislative leadership. I'm a sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 3, 18, 19 and 21. We can't afford to have the state run by career politicians. I'm a firm believer that no one should make a career out of being a politician. I'm committed to passing this ethics reform to move our state forward and taking the power out of the hands of one or two legislative leaders who have been in power for long periods of time. This type of leadership fosters an environment of partisanship and division, instead of what is best for the people of the 52nd Senate District. I also signed the Independent Maps petition and support its goals. The success of the Independent Maps movement has shown the people do want a less partisan redistricting process and we need to do what our constituents want us to do. We need to have an open and transparent map process. Legislative maps shouldn't be drawn in secret backrooms but in an accessible and truthful manner. 5. Would you support the legalization (not just decriminalization) of marijuana in Illinois? I supported the decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana. Prosecuting these cases was not an efficient use of taxpayer money and the consequences of a young person having a permanent criminal record for small amounts of marijuana use can have negative life changing consequences. We need further medical and social research on the challenges and unintended consequences now encountered by the states that have already legalized small amounts of marijuana before the state legislature engages in the legalization debate. 6. Are there state programs, departments, institutions that you would like to eliminate or seriously downsize in order to save money? I'm in favor of eliminating the lieutenant governor's office (and was a sponsor of the measure). Illinois is one of the few states that still has this office. After the elimination of the lieutenant governor's office I would like to explore the consolidation of the Illinois comptroller and Illinois treasurer's office. Illinois has about 7,000 units of government and I'm open to exploring ways to consolidate and eliminate redundant forms of government to save money and increase government efficiency. However, I don't think the state government should be making decisions on how we run local governments. Any form of government that is eliminated or consolidated should be a decision in the hands of local taxpayers. The decision should be made by a voter referendum. 7. What kind of criminal justice reforms do you think the state needs to make to save money and reduce corrections costs? The focus needs to be on public safety, reducing the prison population can save Illinois money while still serving justice and deterring crime. Over-populated prisons can be expensive, unnecessarily punitive, and sometimes counter-productive against the greater goal of maintaining public safety. Nonviolent drug offenders can be diverted into mental health or drug rehab programs and kept from reoffending through electronic monitoring, home confinement and strict enforcement of probation requirements. Almost half of ex-offenders return to prison within three years. We need to provide more and better programs that help reintegrate released prisoners into their communities as well as better community programs that help stop individuals from initially turning to crime. We need to stop the revolving door. 8. Do you think the state's school funding formula needs to be rewritten? If so, what should be the goal and what should be done about unusually small school districts? Should consolidation be a necessary part of school funding reform? I would like to improve the way our state funds public education. This means reforming the 48th worst K-12 funding system in the country by requiring scarce state funds to be allocated in a new needs based formula. I was encouraged earlier this summer when Gov. Rauner created his own bipartisan school financing commission to build on the Senate's work last year. I do not support further consolidation of our local school districts by the state government. If there is any decision to consolidate our local school districts it should be made via voter referendum by taxpayers. 9. Should the state do anything to keep two Exelon nuclear power plants (at Clinton and Quad Cities) open, or is this strictly a private enterprise issue? Would you be willing to commit constituents to higher electric rates to keep the two plants open? Retaining and developing electricity and energy production in Illinois is an important economic goal, but the legislation as currently written would force consumers to pay higher utility costs without requiring Exelon to keep the Clinton Power Plant open and the people of the 52nd Senate District employed. 10. Would you back a constitutional amendment to shift from a flat income tax to a progressive income tax in Illinois? Why or why not? I support voters having the opportunity to decide if a graduated income tax makes sense. Mike Madigan Republican, Urbana 1. What in your opinion is the primary problem with Illinois state government at this time and what, as one legislator out of 177, do you think you can do to help solve it? Currently, state government is largely controlled by two people, Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton. The House and Senate Rules are set up to put power firmly in their hands. The legislative maps have been drawn to protect their majorities. Campaign finance laws were written to give them even greater power over their members. My opponent supports Speaker Madigan's and Senate President Cullerton's continued grip on power. As a State Senator I can and will make governmental reforms a priority. Hopefully my election, as well as the election of other Republican Representatives and Senators will bring greater balance to the General Assembly and force more compromise. I will sponsor legislation to reform government, starting with the Fair Maps initiative. Most importantly, I will try to bring a spirit of cooperation to the General Assembly. In my 16 years as a legislative staff member I was able to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and I will continue to do that as a state senator. With more balance and the willingness of members from both parties to work together, we can work toward meaningful reforms. 2. Do you have an idea how the state's unfunded pension liability problem can be eased, or should the state merely continue to cover pension costs as it has in recent years? First, we have to stop the bleeding. The first, small step would be to eliminate the General Assembly Retirement System for newly elected officials. I will not accept the General Assembly pension and I will fight to eliminate it for all new lawmakers. I will also fight to reduce benefits for current lawmakers going forward. Serving in the General Assembly was meant to be a part time public service. The pensions for these positions should reflect that reality. We then should establish a defined contribution system for most new state employees. I would make an exception for public safety employees. Unfortunately, we have a state government that constantly makes promises that they then break. Only with a defined contribution program can we eliminate politicians from the pension process and provide a retirement program that is fair to both state employees and taxpayers. Once we move new employees to a defined contribution program, we can amortize our remaining pension liability over the long term. While obligations would increase toward the beginning of that period, over time our pension obligations would be reduced. Pension benefits for those who have retired must be honored. For current employees, future pay raises should be contingent upon agreed-to limits on what part of those pay raises is used for the employee's pension calculation. 3. Faced with the need to raise taxes to help balance the budget and pay down the backlog of bills, what taxes would you be willing to impose and/or increase, and what taxes would you not want to impose and/or increase? The career political class in Springfield routinely touts new taxes as the first solution to our budget problems. That's unfortunate, as we are losing productive citizens and businesses each day to other more tax- and business-friendly states. Until we stop that trend, tax hikes will only make this problem worse. Our first priority for revenue must be creating a business environment that encourages creation of new jobs that generate additional tax revenue while reducing the costs of welfare, Medicaid, and other state services. For more than a decade now, Speaker Madigan and President Cullerton have resisted almost every reasonable effort to improve Illinois' business environment. If elected, I will help change that. Worker's compensation reform and a regulatory overhaul must happen quickly if we are to renew our state and return it to its former status as an economic engine for the country. Once business reforms have been established and their effects determined, I am willing to consider ways to broaden our tax base that do not put us at a competitive disadvantage with other states. 4. Are there any parts of Gov. Bruce Rauner's remaining Turnaround Agenda items (term limits; removing the ability of legislators to draw legislative districts; property tax relief including allowing local governments to opt out of prevailing wage and collective bargaining agreements) that you would be open to considering in 2017? I support those elements of the governor's agenda. Governmental reform through fair maps and term limits is critical. It will be incredibly difficult for us to move our state forward with the polarization that is the natural result of a single party holding on to power through the redistricting process and then allowing a single legislator, Speaker Michael Madigan, to put an iron grip on the legislative process. 80 percent of Illinois citizens want these reforms and it's long past time for the General Assembly to allow them to vote on them. I am the only candidate in this election who supports, and will fight for, these reforms. I support a property tax freeze, relief from many state mandates on local governments, and consolidation of the more than 7,000 local taxing districts. I doubt that Mayor Laurel Prussing and Governor Rauner would find much common ground on public policy. But on the issue of reforming the binding arbitration process they do agree. This is not a partisan issue or an anti-union issue. Rather, it's an issue of common sense and fairness that has bipartisan support. We also need to reform worker's compensation, a critical part of the governor's agenda. My own small business, Hickory River Smokehouse, is one of thousands in this state that is burdened by one of the highest worker's compensation rates in the country. While my brick and mortar restaurants won't be leaving, many businesses that can move are doing so and it's hurting our economy, costing us jobs, and reducing tax revenues. If a worker makes a workers' comp claim, it is only fair to the business that it was a "major contributing cause" of the injury, instead of the current "no fault" system. This and other reasonable reforms should be made to re-establish Illinois as a state that is fair to both workers and businesses on this issue. 5. Would you support the legalization (not just decriminalization) of marijuana in Illinois? I think decriminalization was a proper step to take. As this new legal framework moves forward it will be important to determine its impact on public safety and employment opportunities. Once we know the impact of the new law, we can consider modifications. 6. Are there state programs, departments, institutions that you would like to eliminate or seriously downsize in order to save money? First, we need to look at how to make the programs we most need, operate better. For example, the governor has begun to revamp our technology systems which are antiquated and inefficient. I support this effort. Coordinating and modernizing technology across state government will allow us to build a system that makes business and citizen interaction with their government much less burdensome. Many of our surrounding states, including Indiana, have done this already and they are reaping the benefits of it. We need to follow suit. Second, we have to make sure that the core functions of state government: education, transportation, public safety and caring for those who truly cannot care for themselves are funded properly. Everything after that needs to be reviewed for its necessity. That includes most programs created in the last decade. Under Govs. Blagojevich and Quinn, Illinois state government spent money that they didn't have and created new programs that we simply couldn't afford. Reversing those bad decisions should come first. 7. What kind of criminal justice reforms do you think the state needs to make to save money and reduce corrections costs? I support a reducing the sentences of nonviolent offenders. This can reduce prison populations without endangering people. More importantly, we need to reduce recidivism by having stronger rehabilitation and work programs for those in prison and better support when they leave prison. Of course, the most important factor in reducing recidivism is more job opportunities. Illinois has the highest unemployment rate in the country. That fact alone lends itself to higher recidivism. This is just one more area impacted by the lack of progress in Springfield on improving our business environment. 8. Do you think the state's school funding formula needs to be rewritten? If so, what should be the goal and what should be done about unusually small school districts? Should consolidation be a necessary part of school funding reform? The school funding formula needs to be modified and I generally support the current efforts to do that. I believe that Sen. Jason Barickman's proposal, SB 1403 is an excellent framework for reform. A number of proposals, including the one passed by the Senate fail to properly address our problems. First, they give more money to Chicago schools than is justified. Second, the funding reduction for Champaign schools in particular will likely increase property tax rates in Champaign and Savoy. Our goal should be to provide a quality education for every child in Illinois regardless of where they live and their income level. I grew up in a small school district and will forever be thankful for the wonderful teachers I had and how they prepared me for college and work. At the same time, my community in rural Champaign County came to understand that we could provide greater opportunities for our children through consolidation. The state needs to do more to encourage that, including capital construction considerations that often are a barrier to consolidation efforts. 9. Should the state do anything to keep two Exelon nuclear power plants (at Clinton and Quad Cities) open, or is this strictly a private enterprise issue? Would you be willing to commit constituents to higher electric rates to keep the two plants open? The state of Illinois has a role in the utility industry that includes protecting consumers from monopolies and helping to ensure the long term stability of energy production for homeowners and businesses. As a small businessman, I am very much aware of the cost of energy and the need to keep it as low as possible. Regarding the Clinton nuclear plant, I think it's important for Exelon to come to the General Assembly with a bill that addresses only the specific issues that impact their nuclear plants. The proposal currently being considered has other non-related elements in it that make it difficult to pass and perhaps would further increase costs to consumers. I would support a fair bill if it can be demonstrated that closing the plants would destabilize the power grids they serve, and if it has only very nominal impact to consumers. 10. Would you back a constitutional amendment to shift from a flat income tax to a progressive income tax in Illinois? Why or why not? I do not support a progressive Illinois income tax. Currently, we have a progressive tax structure through the federal income tax. Adding another layer of taxation at the state level is just an invitation to drive people and their tax dollars and consumer spending out of the state. We should keep our flat tax as it is one of our only competitive tax elements. Sections (2):News, Local Topics (1):Politics and Government Tags (1):Election 2016 More Local What's In A Name?

grants awarded to 11 national non-profits by Walmart and the Walmart Foundation News provided by Children’s Hunger Alliance Sep 29, 2016, 07:00 ET Share this article COLUMBUS, Ohio, Sept. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Children's Hunger Alliance is one of 11 organizations that share the commitment to fight hunger with Walmart and the Walmart Foundation and earlier this year received $1.5 million grant funding to help expand access to nutritious meals for Ohio children living in food-insecure households. With the USDA reporting that in 2015, 42.2 million people in America, including more than 13 million children lived in households at risk of struggling with hunger, the Walmart and the Walmart Foundation grants are helping provide meals to those who need them the most and helping students access the nutritious food they need for focused minds - both in and out of school. Continue Reading Children's Hunger Alliance has given the Newark City Schools a $25,000 grant to help increase student access to school breakfast. Pictured in the photo from L to R: Todd Gallup, Food Service Supervisor, Newark City Schools, Doug Ute, Superintendent of Newark City Schools, Erin Flynn, Senior Vice President, Development, Children's Hunger Alliance, and Mandy Monaco, Manager, School and Summer Nutrition, Children's Hunger Alliance Children's Hunger Alliance is working with partners throughout the state to expand school breakfast participation and awarded 36 grants to local school districts totaling nearly $200,000. The Walmart Foundation funds were regranted by Children's Hunger Alliance to the following local school districts to help tens of thousands of children access school breakfast:   Newark City Schools in Licking County - $25,000 award Black River in Ashland County - $15,990 award Southwest Licking Local Schools in Licking County - $15,000 award Southern Local Schools in Columbiana County - $10,000 award Fremont Local Schools in Sandusky County - $10,000 award Washington-Nile Local Schools in Scioto County - $10,000 award Northwest Local Schools in Stark County - $10,000 award 29 other local school districts received awards ranging from $1,000 to $9,000. "No child should be trying to learn on an empty stomach. We share Walmart and the Walmart Foundation's commitment to fighting hunger and were excited to put the grant funding to work in Ohio," said Mary Lynn Foster, President and CEO of Children's Hunger Alliance. "Schools at times need financial support to supplement their resources so they can offer every child the chance to enjoy a healthy breakfast. Thanks to our work with the Walmart Foundation we've been able to consult with local school districts and support the implementation of best practices that allow more students to participate in school breakfast." Beyond helping to expand school breakfast, the $1.5 million grant went toward supporting a number of additional initiatives that will ensure more children in Ohio receive access to nutritious meals. Children's Hunger Alliance conducted a proprietary statewide childhood hunger assessment to guide the agency's strategic expansion into areas where children experience low food security. Children's Hunger Alliance also began offering the USDA's Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) to daycare centers throughout Ohio. The organization already sponsors nearly 900 in-home child care providers through its CACFP program. Finally, in an effort to sponsor additional childcare providers and afterschool programs, five community outreach coordinators were hired to increase awareness of program availability and drive community engagement around reducing childhood hunger throughout the state. "These philanthropic investments are the latest examples of our long-standing commitment to hunger relief and dedication to ensuring every family has access to healthy and affordable food in the times and places they may need it," said Karrie Denniston, Senior Director of the Walmart Foundation. "Collaboration and dedication are key to making a positive impact on the issue of hunger in the U.S. and we're proud to work with Children's Hunger Alliance and our ten other nonprofit partners to support hunger relief and nutrition education for families in need. Thanks to the programs our partners have implemented, millions of children and families will have access to the healthy food needed to support a successful school year and beyond." The grant awarded to Children's Hunger Alliance is one of 11 grants awarded to national nonprofit organizations totaling more than $33 million to fund nutrition education and meal programs for youth, and increase families' access to fruits and vegetables through state and federal nutrition assistance programs. Other school districts that received funding from Children's Hunger Alliance through the Walmart grant to increase school breakfast participation include: Lima City Schools in Allen County Tri-County Career Center and Federal Hocking Local Schools in Athens County Carrollton EV Schools in Carroll County Graham Local Schools in Champaign County Greenon Local Schools and Clark-Shawnee Local Schools in Clark County Bucyrus City Schools in Crawford County Richmond Heights Schools, Warrensville Heights Schools, Cleveland Metropolitan School District and Euclid City Schools in Cuyahoga County Lancaster City Schools in Fairfield County South-Western City Schools in Franklin County Edison Local Schools in Jefferson County NorthPointe Schools in Lucas County Marion City Schools and River Valley Local Schools in Marion County Meigs Local Schools and Eastern Local City Schools in Meigs County Lewisville Schools in Monroe County Kettering Middle School in Montgomery County West Muskingum Local Schools in Muskingum County Tri-County North Local Schools in Preble County Newcomerstown Schools in Tuscarawas County Van Wert City Schools in Van Wert County Marietta City Schools in Washington County In October of 2014, Walmart announced a commitment to create a more sustainable food system, with a focus on improving affordability by lowering the "true cost" of food for both customers and the environment, increasing access to food, making healthier eating easier, and improving the safety and transparency of the food chain. The commitment includes a goal of providing four billion meals to those in need by 2020. For more information about the grant awarded to Children's Hunger Alliance visit ChildrensHungerAlliance.org.

By: Reuters | Mumbai | Published:September 29, 2016 4:44 pm A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in talks to buy a minority stake in India’s largest e-commerce firm Flipkart, two people familiar with the matter said, as the world’s biggest retailer aims to break into a fast growing but highly competitive online retail market. One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company’s overall valuation. Watch what else is making news A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc , which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year.

For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India. Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm, said it was natural for Wal-Mart to want to partner with Flipkart. “India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive,” he said. If a deal is agreed, Wal-Mart would join other foreign strategic investors in India’s online players. China’s Alibaba Group Holding, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp and Taiwan’s Foxconn last year led an investment of $500 million in Flipkart’s smaller rival Snapdeal. Alibaba is also the biggest shareholder in India’s One97 Communications, which operates payments services and an e-commerce market place under the PayTM trade name. The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. CUT-THROAT COMPETITION Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country. Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart. But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centres. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015. The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then. Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc , down from as much as $15 billion earlier this year. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China’s JD.com Inc, giving the U.S. firm a ringside seat in JD.com’s bitter rivalry with Alibaba Group.

Drones could be the next arms race as retailers unleash the potential of this growing technology. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Sep 29, 2016 at 6:30AM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the best example of a traditional retailer trying to revamp and revitalize its business via e-commerce. One major aspect of those efforts is delivery, getting goods to customers as quickly and cheaply as possible. Though Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) boasts an expansive network of fulfillment centers that put it within a 20-mile reach of 40% of the U.S. population, it is still dwarfed by Wal-Mart's store footprint. In this segment from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Motley Fool analysts Vincent Shen and Sarah Priestley discuss the advantages this footprint gives Wal-Mart and how effective drones could actually be reducing the cost of last-mile delivery. And all of this begs the question: How much are consumers really willing to pay for shipping? A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sept. 20, 2016. Vincent Shen: When you look at, what I consider to be one of the biggest examples, it's the biggest example of a traditional retailer, like Wal-Mart, it's obviously been focused a lot in terms of its e-commerce efforts. We've talked previously on this show about its Jet.com acquisition and other efforts. I think for the most recent quarter, it's been able to return to more robust levels of growth for its e-commerce efforts. And they are really pushing their shipping option. They have their Shipping Pass package, now, I think it's $50 per year, comparable to Amazon Prime. Something I thought was really interesting is, Piper Jaffray research analysts estimates that Amazon has successfully built out its network of fulfillment centers at this point to be within 20 miles of 44% of the U.S. population. Back in 2010, that penetration level was just 5%. On the other hand, we know that Wal-Mart has a ton of stores. What's their penetration level? Sarah Priestley: They have a store within five miles of 70% of the population. Shen: So, what do you see in terms of shipping, the drone opportunities, how do you see that playing out? Because Amazon, obviously, with about 44% penetration within 20 miles, that seems, potentially, in the future, as the technology develops, as the flight times improve, for them to be able to really deliver and expand what is right now a limited 40 markets for Prime now, essentially, your delivery within one or two hours. What do you think? Priestley: I think there's a lot of hurdles for them to overcome, not just regulatory. I think it's going to be a societal change, too. How much do you really need to get it within 30 minutes? And, obviously, price will affect that. But, as you said, Wal-Mart's distribution of retail locations is a huge advantage. I don't think people realize, when you talk about drones, the idea is that it will essentially be a single-package short delivery. Then, this opens up a whole secondary question over how cost-effective is this actually going to be? A lot of people have made the argument that this could be, in fact, cents per mile. The last mile of the delivery is where the opportunity is for retailers. I think the last mile adds 28% of the cost of delivery. So, if you just take this last mile and think about how much cost benefit there is going to be for a drone. And there are some analysts that are pegging this out to be ridiculously cheap, $0.88 for the final delivery. Some of them are pegging it to be $10 to $17 per delivery, depending on what you factor in. So, there's a whole host of issues. There's a whole timeline when we need to find out what the price point is for people; if they actually want this, how much they're willing to pay for it. Deloitte surveyed last year 4,000 shoppers around the holiday season, and a quarter of them were unwilling to pay for next-day delivery. You can see that expectations are rocket-high from consumers already from what they're expecting. Sarah Priestley has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Wal-Mart, with a market cap of $215.7 billion, earlier made an entry into India through Bharti Enterprises in 2007 and burnt its fingers with India’s still-evolving rules on foreign investment, an internal bribery probe and a faltering partnership, according to Reuters. Flipkart screengrab Even as the news of a likely Wal-Mart, Flipkart deal is doing the rounds, Amazon too has upped its ante. The Seattle-based company is learnt to be planning to pump in an additional $2 billion into Indian operations, according to this report in the Hindu Business Line. If this materialises, Amazon's total investment in India will be $7 billion as it has already committed $5 billion. Some analysts find the $1 billion that Wal-Mart is investing in Flipkart an insignificant amount. What is $1 billion for Flipkart in the times of poor valuation and fund crunch, they ask. “I don’t believe in the news that Wal-Mart will invest $1 billion in Flipkart,” said an analyst, requesting anonymity. “Why would the behemoth invest a ridiculous amount of a mere $1 billion in Flipkart? Wouldn’t it make sense to invest a large sum and buy out a significant stake in the company?” Be that doubt as it may, the fact that Wal-Mart wants to invest in Flipkart makes sense, say others. For starters, Wal-Mart’s online sales are far behind Amazon. Sanchit Gogia,  Chief Analyst & CEO of Greyhound Research, says “Wal-Mart is finding ways to compete with Amazon in the US and beyond. In order to increase the share of online sales, they are looking for assets that they can build on top of their recent acquisition of Jet.com in the US and the deal with JD.com in China. In India, Wal-Mart is struggling to scale up due to regulations, and investing in Flipkart may give them significant presence in the online retail market," says Gogia. According to a report by Kotak Institutional equities, Indian e-tailing market could reach $28 billion by 2019-20, registering a compounded annual growth rate of 45 percent over the next four years. Despite the strong growth estimates, gross merchandise value in the June quarter dropped 7 percent to $13 billion as against 21 percent rise to $11.5 billion in the same quarter last year. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch Report pegged Flipkart as the leader with over 43 percent market share. It forecast that in 2019 Flipkart would be able to retain the share at 44 percent, with Amazon gaining 37 percent and Snapdeal's share falling to just 9 percent. In 2015, Amazon had 21 percent market share and Snapdeal 14 percent. “However, a $1 billion investment may not solve Flipkart’s problems and this might be a case of negotiating with multiple investors to get the best valuation post the holiday season, on which Flipkart is counting on heavily to gain momentum,”  says Satish Meena, forecast analyst, Forrester. The sum of $1 billion may seem small, but it could be a case of testing waters, says another analyst. “The Wal-Mart investment in Flipkart should not be viewed purely from a valuation perspective. Wal-Mart may be looking at it as a strategic investment but in the short term,” he says. If Wal-Mart succeeds with the investment in Flipkart and the beleaguered Indian e-commerce giant is able to make further headway and leave Amazon far behind,  it may increase its stake. Wal-Mart has been trying to make inroads into online in every country. In India, there is no better way of doing that than through Flipkart, which is the leader in the category, an analyst says. Ganesh Krishnan, serial entrepreneur and investor says rather cautiously (there is no confirmation on the development from both the companies) that if the media reports of Wal-Mart's investments are true, then the amount of $1 billion cannot be swiped off aside as a minor amount. On the contrary, it is a significant amount, he reiterates. “Wal-Mart is testing waters, but it is like the first round of a poker game. You put in a small amount and when you win, you up the stakes in the subsequent rounds. It also makes business sense for Amazon to invest more money in India. The big names currently in the e-commerce space in India have only scratched the surface. However, it is wrong to pit Flipkart with Amazon or with Snapdeal and then look at its investments," says Krishnan. "This news of Wal-Mart investing in India, if true goes to prove what I have been saying for a long time now -- that the e-commece market will be dominated  by serious players only," says Ankur Bisen, Senior Vice President of the Retail & Consumer Products division at Technopak Advisors. Private equity funds that have stake in Flipkart would want to exit the business at some point in time. That will not be the case with Wal-Mart which may look at that company as a building block to make a strategic move into India, he says. Wal-Mart and Amazon are competitors in the global arena with the former trailing the latter in the online space. How the Flipkart partnership, if true, will pan out depends on how it is structured. But one thing is for sure: Wal-Mart investing in Flipkart will prove to be an extremely positive move for consumers who deserve a level of service that online companies have so far set standards in India. With its experience and quality of service, technology, Wal-Mart will only further redefine that space.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Sturbridge police seek Wal-Mart worker who allegedly set store fires Wednesday Sep 28, 2016 at 12:36 PM Sep 29, 2016 at 8:54 AM Craig S. Semon Telegram & Gazette Staff @CraigSemon STURBRIDGE - A Wal-Mart employee was being sought Wednesday in connection with three fires set in the store Tuesday evening. Maiya Cruz of Southbridge is wanted by police. She is accused of setting fires in the store on Charlton Road (Route 20). She faces three counts of burning a building contents, three counts of destruction of property over $250, disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. A fire in the jewelry section of the store was reported at 5:25 p.m. Tuesday. When Sturbridge police and fire personnel arrived, they determined three fires had been set throughout the store. Each was extinguished by store employees and customers. Investigators studied surveillance tapes and soon narrowed the investigation to Ms. Cruz, according to the Sturbridge Police Department. She was seen fleeing the parking lot in her car, after which investigators called her cellphone. She hung up on them, police said. Wal-Mart expects to suffer a total loss of all its food stacked and displayed on the store floor as a result of the fires. Sturbridge interim Health Agent Jamie Terry said that all food that was exposed to smoke and chemical contamination must be removed from the sales floor. Wal-Mart management, the Sturbridge fire chief and town health officials made the decision to remove food from the floor. “Walmart has determined that it’s going to have a total loss at the store,” Ms. Terry said. “As far as the food products go, none of the food products will be remaining in the store.” Ms. Terry said air-exchange on the food-storage refrigerator units showed evidence of pulling in chemical materials from the fire extinguishers. “They have crews in there right now. They’ve been working since the Fire Department cleared them to be in the building,” Ms. Terry said. “And I believe they are going to be working around the clock to try to get reopened for their customers as quickly as possible.” Ms. Terry said the Subway sandwich shop located inside the department store also lost all of its food. In addition to significant smoke damage throughout the building, further contamination was found throughout the store, Ms. Terry said, from the release of the chemical fire extinguishers. “There was a fine mist from those chemical extinguishers throughout the establishment,” Ms. Terry said. Ms. Terry said some items may be resold to salvage for possible resale after cleaning and refurbishment, as long as those items are clearly marked as smoke/chemical damaged. Other items will need to be removed and permanently discarded without use, she said. Interim Fire Chief Paul D. Ford said crews were at the store for several hours to vent the building. No injuries were reported, he said. Members of the Southbridge, Brimfield, Spencer and Charlton fire departments helped ventilate the building and ensure it was safe for employees to enter. “Thankfully, the fires were very small,” Chief Ford said. “It is an active investigation. It certainly has been determined that it was set.”  "We're upset that someone would do something so reckless and dangerous in our store,” said Erica Jones, senior manager of corporate communications for Wal-Mart corporate headquarters, in an email Tuesday. "Thankfully, we were able to evacuate and no one was injured. We are grateful to the Fire Department for their quick response." Ms. Cruz’s whereabouts remains unknown. Officials are asking anyone with information to call Sturbridge police at (508) 347-2525 or the state fire marshal’s arson hotline at (800) 682-9229. The store remains closed.  About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Register/Subscribe Subscriber Services T&G E-Edition Worcester Living E-Edition NIE Business Matters Coupon Values FAQ Photo reprints (non-commercial use) Commercial photo licenses Advertising Advertising Contacts Propel Marketing - Digital Marketplace Media Kit Place an Ad Jobs Real Estate Pets Legal Notices News Contact Us Letters to the Editor Submit a Press Release Events Copyright/Terms of Use Marketing About Us Visions Contact Us The Item The Banner Reprints & Licensing Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc, which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year. Wal-Mart operates 21 wholesale stores in the South Asian country, but is discouraged from setting up its own bricks-and-mortar shops by rules that limit foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers to 51 percent and the cost of setting up shops in a country as large as India. For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India. "India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive. So the road ahead is either a Flipkart or an Amazon," said Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm. "Which is why it is natural for Wal-Mart to look at Flipkart as they cannot acquire Amazon." The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. Cut-throat competition Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country. Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart. But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centres. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and smaller rival Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015. The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then. Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc , down from as much as $15 billion earlier this year. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China's JD.com Inc, giving the U.S. firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

"India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive," he said. If a deal is agreed, Wal-Mart would join other foreign strategic investors in India's online players. China's Alibaba Group Holding, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp and Taiwan's Foxconn last year led an investment of $500 million in Flipkart's smaller rival Snapdeal. Alibaba is also the biggest shareholder in India's One97 Communications, which operates payments services and an e-commerce market place under the PayTM trade name.

As Walmart talks to Flipkart, Amazon may invest $2 bn more in India Firstpost 29-09-2016 © Provided by Firstpost The war between the two US online and offline retail giants - Amazon and Walmart - is getting bigger and bigger by each passing day. This is becoming very much evident in terms of their rising fund commitment towards the potentially growing Indian market in a bid to outdo each other. Amazon, the Jeff Bezos-controlled US online retail giant, has said it will invest another $2 billion in its Indian arm as competition intensifies in the country's e-commerce sector, a BusinessLine report said. The fresh fund commitment is in addition to the $5 billion capital the company has already earmarked for the country. "We continue to look at India as a key growth region and are committed to invest aggressively with a long-term horizon, and transform the way India buys and sells," BusinessLine reported quoting Amazon India spokesperson. This comes a day after news reports said Walmart, the US-based and world's largest retail behemoth, is in advanced negotiations to invest $1 billion in India's largest online retailer Flipkart in return for a small stake in the latter. The crucial committments by the two US-based firms come ahead of the start of the festival sale offers by India's top online marketplace companies, including Amazon India. The top three ecommerce firms - Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal - have committed to spend heavily on advertising and marketing, besides promising big incentives to their top suppliers against discounts likely to be offered by them on several products during the upcoming festive sale offers. Amazon, which operates through Amazon.in in India, will flag off its 'Great Indian Festival' sale from 1 October, with total spend on its marketing and advertising likely to be more than two-three times of its rival Flipkart. The marketing and advertising budget of Amazon India is expected to be around Rs 125-130 crore. In order to woo customers, Flipkart said it will be spending Rs 30 crore on marketing and advertising of this year's Big Billion Day sale. In fact, the biggest spend for rebranding activities has come from Snapdeal, which said has invested Rs 200 crore on this exercise. Both, Flipkart and Snapdeal will host their sales between 2 and 6 October. Besides these three players, other marketplace entities such as Alibaba-backed Paytm and Shopclues, too, will be holding their big-bang festival season sales alongside their large peers in the first couple of weeks of next month in order to cash in on the growing enthusiasm of online buyers in recent years. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch Report pegged Flipkart as the leader with over 43 percent market share. It forecast that in 2019, Flipkart would be able to retain the share to 44 percent, with Amazon gaining to 37 percent and Snapdeal's share falling to just 9 percent. In 2015, Amazon has 21 percent market share and Snapdeal 14 percent. According to a report by Kotak Institutional equities, Indian e-tailing market could reach $28 billion by 2019-20, registering a compounded annual growth rate of 45 percent over the next four years. Despite the strong growth estimates, gross merchandise value in the June quarter dropped 7 percent to $13 billion as against 21 percent rise to $11.5 billion in the same quarter last year.

This is becoming very much evident in terms of their rising fund commitment towards the potentially growing Indian market in a bid to outdo each other. Amazon, the Jeff Bezos-controlled US online retail giant, has said it will invest another $2 billion in its Indian arm as competition intensifies in the country's e-commerce sector, a BusinessLine report said. The fresh fund commitment is in addition to the $5 billion capital the company has already earmarked for the country. “We continue to look at India as a key growth region and are committed to invest aggressively with a long-term horizon, and transform the way India buys and sells," BusinessLine reported quoting Amazon India spokesperson. This comes a day after news reports said Walmart, the US-based and world's largest retail behemoth, is in advanced negotiations to invest $1 billion in India's largest online retailer Flipkart in return for a small stake in the latter. The crucial committments by the two US-based firms come ahead of the start of the festival sale offers by India's top online marketplace companies, including Amazon India. The top three ecommerce firms - Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal - have committed to spend heavily on advertising and marketing, besides promising big incentives to their top suppliers against discounts likely to be offered by them on several products during the upcoming festive sale offers. Amazon, which operates through Amazon.in in India, will flag off its 'Great Indian Festival' sale from 1 October, with total spend on its marketing and advertising likely to be more than two-three times of its rival Flipkart. The marketing and advertising budget of Amazon India is expected to be around Rs 125-130 crore. In order to woo customers, Flipkart said it will be spending Rs 30 crore on marketing and advertising of this year's Big Billion Day sale. In fact, the biggest spend for rebranding activities has come from Snapdeal, which said has invested Rs 200 crore on this exercise. Both, Flipkart and Snapdeal will host their sales between 2 and 6 October. Besides these three players, other marketplace entities such as Alibaba-backed Paytm and Shopclues, too, will be holding their big-bang festival season sales alongside their large peers in the first couple of weeks of next month in order to cash in on the growing enthusiasm of online buyers in recent years. also see Demonetisation: Both Flipkart, Snapdeal now allow cash on delivery to improve sales Rs 500, Rs 1000 crackdown impact: Amazon, Flipkart, Shopclues stop Cash-on-Delivery Rs 500, Rs 1,000 note ban: Amazon's cash on delivery orders back on track A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch Report pegged Flipkart as the leader with over 43 percent market share. It forecast that in 2019, Flipkart would be able to retain the share to 44 percent, with Amazon gaining to 37 percent and Snapdeal's share falling to just 9 percent. In 2015, Amazon has 21 percent market share and Snapdeal 14 percent.

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint Taipei: That hoped-for Snapdeal Flipkart merger may be some time. Back in July, I discussed how the two Indian e-commerce companies, both burning through cash, should team up to take on Amazon, especially given the US giant’s far deeper pockets. Enter Wal-Mart with a $1 billion can of kerosene to pour on the fire. The world’s largest retailer is in advanced discussions to take a minority stake in Flipkart, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. It’s hard not to view that development as bad news for India’s e-commerce war of attrition. Sure it looks great for Flipkart—who wouldn’t want cash from a rich and powerful benefactor? Yet, that money would take total funds raised by Amazon India, Flipkart and Snapdeal beyond $10 billion, according to data from CB Insights and public statements by Amazon. Also Read: Flipkart, Wal-Mart in talks for $1 billion investment For Wal-Mart, the deal makes total sense. It’s a brilliant move for a company that’s struggled to catch Amazon in the US online shopping market, forcing it to acquire Jet.com for $3 billion. Buying into India this early in the country’s development would give Wal-Mart a far better shot at tackling Amazon there than it’s managed in America. There’s a precedent for unprofitable competitors to consolidate despite having plenty of cash. One of the best examples is Didi Chuxing, formed last year after China’s two top ride-hailing companies merged. That deal will go down as one of the most successful in history, paving the way for Apple to buy in and for Uber to be defeated. Also Read: Wal-Mart India evaluating ‘food-only’ retail model The problem is, large wads of cash also tend to make even sane people go a little crazy, and India’s e-commerce players were already charting high on that crazy scale. Nothing tightens the belt like a little hunger in the belly. With this fresh injection of funds, the incentive for Flipkart to come to the negotiating table with Snapdeal is diminished. It’s possible Wal-Mart is asking Flipkart to explore merger options as part of the US company’s investment, in which case this deal would be great. But given Alibaba’s earlier investment in Snapdeal, each now has a large foreign e-commerce firm behind them. Against that backdrop, it’s hard to imagine Wal-Mart won’t be ready to pony up more money when Flipkart next holds out its hand. And that’s likely to incentivize Alibaba to continue writing checks for Snapdeal. The question is whether Wal-Mart wants the role of father figure, or sugar daddy.

Walmart may invest $1 billion in Flipkart to battle Amazon The Financial Express 28-09-2016 FE Online Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is in advanced discussions to invest as much as $1 billion into Flipkart. According to Bloomberg, Walmart would take a minority stake in Flipkart, final terms of the deal have not been worked out and negotiations are still underway, a person familiar with the matter said. According to a research firm CB insights, Flipkart's most recent valuation was $16 billion. The deal would help the two companies battle Amazon.com. Last week Flipkart crossed the 100-million registered users mark, becoming the first e-commerce company in the country to hit the milestone. The Bengaluru-based company has doubled its user base over the last year and added 25 million users in the past six months alone. © image One of the most valued start-ups in the country, Flipkart has Tiger Global, Accel Partners, Morgan Stanley and T Rowe among its investors. The company has raised over $3 billion in funding so far and has acquired companies like Myntra, PhonePe, and LetsBuy. It has also invested in start-ups like Cube26, NestAway, and BlackBuck. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch Report pegged Flipkart as the leader with over 43 per cent market share. It forecast that by 2019, Flipkart would increase its share to 44 percent. On the other hand, Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. The company had entered into an equal joint venture with Sunil Bharti Mittal's Bharti Enterprises. However, in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. Walmart operates 21 Best Price wholesale offline stores in nine states in India.

I didn’t report the assault because of the circumstances (underage drinking, etc.). I am now 23, and although I am fine, I run into him every once in a while — at the college I attended, at Walmart, at a local restaurant and he recently came through the drive-thru at my workplace. I always do my best to stay as calm as possible and to not pay him any attention, although it is very challenging to not break out into a full-blown panic attack. I think it’s too late or a lost cause to report it at this point, but I have to do something, so it doesn’t eat at me every time I see him. My question for you is — should I confront him? If so, what do I say? If not, what do I do about running into him? — Stuck at 17 Dear Stuck: I can’t tell you to confront this person — or to avoid him. I can only tell you that you must do what is best for you. It is not too late to report this assault, and it is not a “lost cause.” Your cause is never lost, because you are here, struggling mightily to cope. You have survived a sexual assault. And although you say you are “fine,” I don’t think you are fine. I think you’re unsure, hurting, and anxious — all very natural reactions. I shared your question with a spokesperson at the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN.org), the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization. They want to assure you that there is no one right answer for how a sexual assault survivor should cope to move forward. You can call and talk to a counselor at the National Sexual Assault Hotline at (800) 656-HOPE (4673); they can listen to your story, review your options now and also connect you with a local counselor and support group. RAINN also has an online “chat” feature available, 24/7. It is vital that you receive help and support. An answer for what you should do concerning the man who assaulted you will emerge through talking about it. Please don’t bury this or discount what happened. Dear Amy: My son recently got married, and although I hosted a nice reception dinner and was appropriately dressed for the wedding, I was not invited to participate in any of the wedding photos. Not a single one. I was herded away to the reception room with the rest of the guests and it was only afterward that I realized the photos had been taken without me. My son claims he was so nervous he never noticed I wasn’t there. My new daughter-in-law seems indifferent about the whole thing and acts like I am making a big deal out of nothing. Recently they delivered a big fat wedding album to my house full of photos of the bride, groom, and all of her parents and family, which I politely declined to accept. I had not met the bride’s family prior to the wedding, but this just seems an incredibly cruel thing to do to me. Am I wrong? — Mother of the Groom Dear Mother of the Groom: Whether your son and his wife were deliberately exclusionary, or merely incredibly thoughtless when it came to photos, your reaction — to feel hurt and angry — is completely justified. They owe you a sincere apology. I assume if you received one, you would accept it and do your best to move on. Your son’s explanation is almost — but not quite — believable. This is also a rough way for your daughter-in-law to kick off a relationship with her new mother-in-law. After outright refusing to receive this album (an understandable, but not really generous reaction), a gentle conversation where you honestly describe your feelings is called for. I hope they find a way to flip this script. Dear Amy: “Protective Daughter” described her concern over her mother’s decision to become a caregiver to an abusive ex who now has cancer. I am a therapist who has had clients ready to leave an ex-partner who has faked cancer to get the partner back. It only worked for a while, but caused chaos in the well person’s life. I say, confirm this diagnosis on paper, but better yet: RUN! — Siri Dear Siri: Great point. An unscrupulous person could use a cancer diagnosis to emotionally manipulate a caring individual. I agree that “Protective Daughter” should urge her mother to confirm the prognosis.   Tags:  Ask Amy Amy Dickinson Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off blog comments powered by Disqus More in Ask Amy Ask Amy: Woman caught between boyfriend and mother November 17, 2016, 1:00 am Dear Amy: My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half.

Police arrest suspect in Phoenix Walmart fireworks fire Jerod MacDonald-Evoy , The Republic | azcentral.com 4:43 p.m. MST September 30, 2016 Tristen Demani Bailey, 20, was arrested Sept. 26, 2016, on suspicion of setting fire to a fireworks display in a west Phoenix Walmart in June, officials said. (Photo: Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) Phoenix police arrested a man Monday who they say started a fire at a fireworks display in a west Phoenix Walmart in June, officials said. Tristen Demani Bailey, 20, was arrested and booked into the Fourth Avenue Jail on suspicion of one count of arson of an occupied structure, according to a statement from the Phoenix Fire Department. At 8:22 p.m. June 15, Phoenix fire and police officials responded to a Walmart near 51st Avenue and Indian School Road and discovered someone had set fire to a fireworks display in the store.

Advertisement We’ve all heard about recent retail store closings at successful companies such as Kohl’s, Macy’s and Walmart. A major reason for this is the shift from brick-and-mortar stores to the growth of e-commerce as a result of omni-channel marketing and distribution. In fact, according to an NFI Industries article entitled, The E-Commerce Effect on the Commercial Real Estate Industry, “In 2014, e-commerce sales for United States retailers surpassed $300 billion for the first time, reaching $304.9 billion, which was a 15.40% increase in comparison to the previous year and is the fifth year in a row that web sales growth has been close to or above 15%.... With companies offering same-day delivery, gift wrapping, ship-to-store and other e-commerce advantages, consumers are opting to do more of their shopping online. As e-commerce continues to grow, industries like commercial real estate are adapting to offer more ideal solutions to support e-commerce goals. E-commerce has shifted what companies look for in their real estate facilities and has evolved what is now expected in today’s fulfillment centers.” Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency Tesla Seals $2 Billion SolarCity Deal One doesn’t often think about the intersection of supply chain management and real estate, but the relationship goes back a long way in the distribution and warehouse function, and now with the shift towards e-commerce, it is more important and visible than ever before. In fact, regional distribution facilities are the most common property type in the U.S., comprising well over 60% of the U.S. industrial inventory and the majority of industrial REIT portfolios, according to an article in Wealth Management Magazine. The article goes on to state that e-commerce retailers use logistics real estate in ways that require more space. Many activities that were typically carried out within stores are now consolidated into logistics facilities, and e-commerce customers just need more room… as much as three times as much logistics space—or more—as their brick-and-mortar counterparts. So, as the NFI article points out, and is true in general, the “location decision” now more than ever is a strategy that shouldn’t be taken lightly and can be looked at in terms of: Sourcing —An organization must decide if they plan to fulfill e-commerce orders from the store, a distribution center (DC) dedicated to fulfilling e-commerce orders with a separate DC dedicated to their stores, or one DC that fulfills both the e-commerce orders and replenishes store inventory. In many cases, companies may choose to have a combination of these methods. Location—In many cases with e-commerce, it is important to reach most consumers in the least amount of time due to the requirements of overnight or even same-day shipments. So there has been an increase in the amount of retailers headed toward urban hubs like New Jersey, Lehigh Valley and southern California which are near major metropolitan areas. It is also critical to consider labor availability in the area, especially during the holiday season. Develop or Adapt—The type of facility you choose can depend on your business objectives and specific current and future needs (often customized), which may push the decision towards either a new building or finding an existing building. Design—E-commerce has specific and different requirements than traditional DCs such as they may be more automated but still require a vast amount of labor for “pick and pack” vs. “pallet in, pallet/case out” traditional DCs with a high variety of items. Each company needs to determine its own needs for capital investment, length of commitment and anticipated rate of change in its business to determine their particular e-commerce real estate strategy, but there is no denying that e-commerce is driving the need for industrial real estate and is now a critical part of the competitive and location strategy of many companies today.

Hong, File) A Walmart apologized after employees didn’t make a “Blue Lives Matter” cake in the latest cake-related controversy to befall the retail giant. Employees at one of its stores refused to bake the cake, which also depicts the “thin blue line” frequently mentioned by law enforcement, for the daughter of a retiring police officer, reported the Macon Telegraph. One of the employees told the woman, who remained anonymous, that “the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake.” When asked to place a blue line on a chocolate background, the employee said she didn’t “feel comfortable” with that either. Walmart later apologized.

But sometimes we misstep,” the company said in a statement, according to a local ABC affiliate WTVM. “We’ve reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies.” Related Coverage ‘Sorry-I-Tased-You’ Cake Doesn’t Cut It for Florida Woman Franklin Allen, Chief of the Jonesboro Police Department, said the refusal to design the cake represents a larger issue. “It’s really heartbreaking, because officers go out and put their lives on the line for people, regardless of color, creed, sex, or national origin. It doesn’t matter to us,” said Allen. On Facebook, a person who claims to know the woman said the manager at the Walmart “offered to make the cake (which had already been taken care of by Kroger) and apologized for the mistake.” Last year, Walmart was slammed when one of its stores in Louisiana stores refused to bake a cake with a Confederate flag on it, but agreed to bake a cake with the ISIS flag design for the same person, according to ABC News.

(NYSE: WMT) to offeran  update on its tactics for e-commerce during the October 6 Annual Meeting. The retailer is also expected to offer more lights on its investment on labor. However, the firm pointed out four reasons for initiating a Buy rating and $82 price target. In the last four quarters, the company's EPS provided positive surprise. The company's top-line beat in the most recent quarter surprised the Street analysts, who started to look back at the stock. Related Link: Sustaining Top-Line Momentum Is Key For Wal-Mart The brokerage listed five key factors to support its investment thesis: Expects online sales growth to accelerate on the back of $13 billion achieved in 2015 Jet.com acquisition to help create a powerful online platform supporting long-term e-commerce growth Slowing square feet growth is a positive factor since the retailer could reallocate such capital to e-com The biggest retailer's current dividend provides 3 percent yield and $20 billion share buyback program Continued momentum in comp "The WMT U.S. segment has delivered 8 straight quarters of positive comp sales growth and 7 with positive traffic. The segment last delivered 8 consecutive positive comps from 2Q07-1Q09, during the Great Recession. We believe it is easier to keep momentum than it is to get," the brokerage said in a note. Guggenheim sees Wal-Mart in-line with the expectations of delivering revenues of $485 billion for 2016.

Last week, at a Walmart in Texas, a female bystander spotted a man pushing a shopping cart with a crying child’s hair wrapped around the handle. The woman intervened, and eventually called the police for help. The incident set off a debate on when bystanders should say something about another parent’s discipline . But what happens when safety is not at stake? Is there ever a right time to tell someone you don’t agree with a parenting decision? Gretta Keene, a Brooklyn psychologist, had a friend who was adopting a child and was insistent on never telling the child. Having dealt professionally with patients on the sensitive subject, Ms. Keene was aware of potential issues up ahead. This was a close friend, so she offered free advice: “I thought there were other ways of handling the situation and just said her choice might have unintended consequences,” she recalled. How was this received? “She reacted by cutting off our longtime relationship.” John Jacobs, a psychiatrist and associate professor of family therapy at N.Y.U., said, “You are always taking a gamble when discussing others’ lives, especially when it comes to their children. It’s a dangerous place to go and usually doesn’t end well.” Two couples I know in New York reached a tense standoff when one couple’s son decided to cancel a planned spring break with the other boy. Why? Because he got a “better” offer. The boys remained friends, though the parents did not. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Similar conflicts also play out onscreen. NBC’s limited series “The Slap” dealt with the repercussions of one child’s misbehavior at a party. The incident led to cruel accusations among the adults, broken friendships and eventually, a lawsuit. The premiere of this season’s “Blue Bloods” featured the paternal paragon, played by Tom Selleck, saying to an old friend, “I would never try to tell you how to show your love to your own son, but maybe you could try seeing him for what he’s become.” The response? “Go to hell, Frank!” In the recent film, “Captain Fantastic,” Viggo Mortensen’s character is raising five kids in such an unorthodox way that the children’s grandparents fight for custody. Indeed, the most daunting emotional tightrope involves questioning the parenting of our own children-turned-parents. With the number of “grand-boomers” growing every year, this problem is not going away. Theirs, after all, is the generation that not only thinks it will be forever young, but too often feels it is forever right. “It’s a huge issue for them to deal with their own kids’ raising of children,” said Meryle H. Gellman, a Los Angeles therapist. “Each family has to find the way because the last thing you want is disconnection.” I recently had breakfast with three relatively new grandmothers who all acknowledged how often they hold their tongues. One feels her grandson is distant and could make eye contact more. But she is scared to mention it to her generally defensive daughter. The second asked her husband to speak with their son about his 4-year-old’s “meanspirited” behavior. The third said she had to withhold vocal disbelief when her daughter took her 3-year-old to an occupational therapist because she wasn’t eating fruit. “I did suggest that she might be panicking too soon, and that she herself only ate grilled cheese sandwiches for one year,” she said. “When the therapist also told her that some long-term perspective was necessary, my daughter said to me, ‘O.K., but you don’t get to butt in on this a second time.’ So now we have something we call the ‘one-time only’ rule.” Of course, there are times when some interference may be called for. Sandy (who did not want her full name used) thought her son was coasting through his first year of college until she received what she thought was an annoying call from the mother of his roommate. “She started asking me if I’d talked to my son lately, if I had any worries and so on,” Sandy told me. “I was ready to hang up on her when she said that, apparently he had not been attending any classes and was spending most the time in the dorm room. I called the school but because of a law, they are not allowed to say anything without the student’s consent. We finally went to Michigan and found our very lost and confused son. Suffice to say, in the end, I was grateful for that phone call.” Though every child’s life has its own trajectory, and every family its unique dynamics, there is some general advice that fits all. “Parenting is a learned skill and like any other, might need some peer or educational counseling,” said Donna Naftalis, a grandmother who worked in early childhood development. “Support groups that offer guided instruction are valuable in forming new friendships for the new parents, and can offer nonjudgmental feedback from others who have been through it.” Dr. David Anderson, senior director of the ADHD and Behavior Disorders Center at Manhattan’s Child Mind Institute, suggested: “Share your own possible shortcomings and soften any comments by first pointing out the person’s strengths.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story My own mother was exemplary as both mom and grandmother, but it was not until her memorial service that a friend of hers told me, “Your mother said one of the great surprises of her life was how good a parent you turned out to be.” I wish I’d heard it from the original source. In the meantime, tread gently and consider the words of the children’s book author and grandparent Judith Viorst. She wrote a book about what happened when her adult son Alexander — yes, the one who had that famously terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day — temporarily moved back into her extremely tidy home with his wife and three kids. She notes that advice about other people’s parenting always ends up sounding like criticism, “no matter how charmingly expressed.” “Here’s my thought on offering unsolicited advice,” Ms. Viorst said. “Don’t.” Continue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

"Walmart's investments in store experience, e-commerce and eventually price are helping drive sustainable market share gains, and we think earnings are poised to inflect positively," wrote equity analyst Edward Yruma in a research note Friday. "The company has posted positive comps for eight consecutive quarters, which validates recent investments. We think that the company can opportunistically use price investments as a lever to drive the targeted incremental $45B-$60B in sales over a three-year period," read the note.

News Sports Things to Do Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive West Utica grocery store almost a reality Friday Sep 30, 2016 at 12:01 AM Sep 30, 2016 at 9:52 AM The Utica Urban Renewal Agency, at its Oct. 13 meeting, is expected to approve the sale of city-owned property in the area of Lincoln Avenue and Roberts Street to Compassion Coalition, which has operated the 1,200-square-foot Your Bargain Grocer store at 506 Columbia St. for 17 years. S. Alexander Gerould @OD_Gerould UTICA — When Shelley Robbins needs to go pick up some groceries, she hops in her car and usually heads to Wal-Mart in North Utica. But while the West Utica resident can get around easily, she knows others aren’t so lucky. “I have a vehicle, but there’s a lot of people that don’t have vehicles that are on foot,” said Robbins, who lives on Court Street. “I’m sure it’s a little difficult for them to get to a grocery store.” There is good news coming for some of the neighborhood’s residents and others. The Utica Urban Renewal Agency, at its Oct. 13 meeting, is expected to approve the sale of city-owned property in the area of Lincoln Avenue and Roberts Street to Compassion Coalition, which has operated the 1,200-square-foot Your Bargain Grocer store at 506 Columbia St. for 17 years. Compassion Coalition offered $100,000 for the property that now serves as a construction staging area for the North-South Arterial project. The coalition will be relocating from its current location to the new site, where they hope to build an 11,500 square-foot grocery store along with a commercial kitchen for cooking classes. “We’re already (in the neighborhood)," said Charlie Sweet, the coalition’s vice president of business development and external affairs, "so all we’re doing is we’re going to a larger venue so that we can offer more product and healthier choices and also have the education end to it with the kitchen and cooking and such.” According to a 2015 Observer-Dispatch article, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's website indicated that the West Utica neighborhood and other parts of the city could be considered food deserts, which are defined as a census tract with a substantial share of residents who live in low-income areas that have low levels of access to a grocery store or healthy, affordable food retail outlets. There are 1,292 low-income residents within the census tract containing a portion of West Utica who are more than 1 mile from the nearest supermarket, according to the USDA. That compares to around 649 low-income residents who are more than one mile from the nearest grocery store within the census tract containing most of Commercial Drive in New Hartford. West Utica residents have limited smaller options for shopping for food, including Stewart's at 425 Court St. and the West Utica Foodland at 912 Court St. In June, a farmers market offering fresh produce, local products and other items opened near the Boilermaker headquarters at 805 Court St. The new Compassion Coalition store, meanwhile, is expected to carry more items and product lines such as more fresh, organic produce and meats. Sweet said they also are making a big push toward offering more organic products and locally produced and grown products by working with local farmers and others. “So, all we’re basically doing is taking what we’ve done very well with these past 10 to 11 years," he said, "and going to a larger scale so that we can better serve the community that we’re within." Brian Thomas, executive director of the Urban Renewal Agency, said that the West Utica neighborhood has been asking for a grocery store for a long time and that city officials have been working diligently to bring something to the neighborhood. “They bring a high level of activity with their current store where they are to the downtown,” Thomas said of the Compassion Coalition, “and it is definitely good news that they will remain both in the city of Utica and specifically in the downtown.” Robbins, meanwhile, said the proposed store will be good for the neighborhood. The neighborhood also might see an influx of new people as a result of projects in the area such as Indianapolis-based KCG Development plans transform the three-building Globe Mills complex at 811-827 Court St. into about 131 apartments. “I am positive it will because you have a lot of young people from Kennedy Plaza, even older people that don’t drive,” she said. “I see that there’s a lot of young couples and stuff in the neighborhoods around here and they always walk. I mean there’s going to be people around here that might not have the transportation to go places, so it would be very beneficial, I believe.” Follow @OD_Gerould on Twitter or call him at 315-792-4995.  About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscriber Services Classifieds Submit Announcements & News Market Place Classifieds Real Estate Your Community News Blotters Herkimer County Oneida-Verona New Hartford Rome Utica Oneida Indian Nation Whitestown Blogs - Living - Sports Sports: Anne Delaney Sports: John Pitarresi Sports: Ron Moshier Boilermaker College Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

(AP) — A Massachusetts Wal-Mart employee charged with setting three fires in the Sturbridge store has pleaded not guilty. Twenty-year-old Maiya Cruz was arraigned Thursday in Dudley District Court on charges including of destruction of property and burning a building's contents. Firefighters responded to the Wal-Mart around 5:25 p.m. Tuesday after someone reported a fire in the jewelry section. Three fires were discovered at the scene. No injuries were reported, however the store's food needed to be thrown out because it was exposed to smoke and chemicals from fire extinguishers. Investigators identified the Southbridge woman as a suspect after reviewing surveillance video. Cruz was ordered held without bail pending a dangerousness hearing. Members of Cruz's family say she has mental health issues and her lawyer said she had been hearing voices. Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

Despite seemingly little in common, the two hit it off when they first met, when Obama was still a junior senator on the rise, and in response to the death of Peres Obama released a statement that was unusually long and personal. The U.S. delegation will also include members of Congress from both political parties as well as former President Bill Clinton. • Perhaps a surprising guest at the funeral will be Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, who announced Thursday that he would attend the funeral, putting him in proximity to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel when the two have been jousting over who is to blame for their failure to sit down and talk. •After a difficult season, Rays starter Chris Archer can at least say he won't be a 20-game loser. Archer avoided the 20th loss he didn't care much about and reached the 200-inning milestone he did in the Rays' 5-3 rain-delayed win over the White Sox on Thursday. • A Super Bowl-sized audience tuned in Monday night to watch two presidential candidates duke it out on a debate stage inside an auditorium on Long Island. Two more presidential candidates were locked out, forced to watch it on television like regular voters while the mass media pretended they didn't exist: Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. Neither have much chance of winning the Nov. 8 election, experts say, but both could have an outsized effect on the outcome, especially in Florida. Read Josh Solomon's story this morning on tampabay.com. • As debate about free speech on campus heats up at colleges across the country, Eckerd College in St. Petersburg is stepping into the fray. The school has adopted a statement that underscores a commitment to free speech in a time of tumult, when students concerned about injustice and inclusion are making waves for voicing their demands. • Hurricane Matthew strengthened into a strong Category 2 storm overnight, and is battering the Caribbean islands with heavy rains and whipping winds. The storm is forecast to continue west before taking a northerly turn, but its current path could still have it skirting South Florida. • Three weeks ago, Walmart got some bad publicity in the Tampa Bay area when people began sharing on Facebook that they found expired goods — including baby formula — on local store shelves. Walmart said the items would be removed, but Tampa Bay Times reporters kept checking in on local Walmarts to see how they did. The results weren't always positive. Read business reporter Justine Griffin's full column this morning. • It was a night for deeply personal revelations, as candidates seeking state House seats representing parts of Pinellas County spoke at a forum on substance abuse and mental health. Then political newcomer Jennifer Webb, a Democrat challenging Republican incumbent Rep. Kathleen Peters, told the packed room at the Operation PAR campus why she decided to run for the District 69 seat. • From the Times Editorial Board: Bernie McCabe, the longtime state attorney for Pinellas and Pasco counties, is not a prosecutor to whom a "soft on crime" label would ever stick. He never before had appeared at a parole hearing in favor of the convicted. But in Timothy Kane, a Pasco man imprisoned for life at age 14, he saw an exceptional case that prompted him to take an exceptional step.

Business columnist Robert Trigaux ranks the latest in business scandals in a column that will publish late this morning at tampabay.com/business. See what scandal he ranks the worst of the bunch. • He was the point guard on a USF basketball team that beat a nationally ranked Florida State team two decades ago. Today, he is a major bank's regional president who is an emerging ambassador for Tampa Bay and a business leader on the rise. Read an in-depth profile of USF alum and business sparkplug Brian Lamb, which will be published around 8:30 a.m. at tampabay.com/business. • It helps that Tony Dungy has famous friends because the former Bucs coach is bringing comic Jeff Foxworthy and Christian superstar Michael W. Smith to Tampa next week to help out his favorite charity at a benefit at the Straz Center. • Busch Gardens Howl-O-Scream turns down the lights tonight and turns up the scares. We sent our intrepid reporter into the fog to let you know what to expect at the scare fest this year. • The world's fastest powerboats return to Clearwater Beach today for the eighth annual Super Boat National Championship and Festival running this weekend. We've got a preview here of the coming parties, fireworks and of course the big race on Sunday, where thousands will ine the beach to watch these racing machines — some costing more than $1 million, and capable of speeds in excess of 150 mph. • Here are the top things to do today in Tampa Bay, including the Florida Orchestra opening its season with a crowd favorite: Beethoven. President Barack Obama, after receiving the Presidential Medal of Distinction, raises a toast along with President Shimon Peres of Israel at an official state dinner in Jerusalem on March 21, 2013. Despite seemingly little in common, the two hit it off when they first met, when Obama was still a junior senator on the rise, and in response to the death of Peres released a statement that was unusually long and personal.

(Photo: Austin Humphreys/The Coloradoan)Buy Photo 95 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE If you shop at the Timnath Costco or Walmart Supercenter on Harmony Road, you might start shelling out a little more at the register come January. This election, Timnath voters will decide whether to raise the town's sales tax from 3 percent to 4.35 percent, and its tax on food for home consumption from 2.25 percent to 3.6 percent. According to a Coloradoan analysis of area sales tax rates, the increase would give Timnath the highest city tax for non-food goods and services sold in Northern Colorado, while the town's tax on food for home consumption would trail only Windsor's 3.95 percent tax rate. SHOPPING:  Skip the checkout and buy your groceries online Being that it's a local tax issue, only people registered to vote in Timnath, a town of about 4,500, get a say in the sales tax. But passage would impact thousands of shoppers from Northern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming who stop to shop at Timnath's Costco and Walmart. Mayor Jill Grossman-Belisle said the increased sales tax, estimated to provide Timnath $4.13 million in additional revenue each year, would fund infrastructure projects such as widening Harmony Road, parkway construction and pedestrian crossings, to help the town meet the needs of its rapidly growing population. The town has previously estimated that it would grow to 30,000 residents by 2040. The U.S. Census Bureau pegged Timnath as Colorado's fastest-growing town in 2013, when it grew 32 percent in one year to 1,543 residents. "(The tax increase is) just additional revenue that's sorely needed to get this infrastructure as we're growing so rapidly," Grossman-Belisle said.

Timnath voters in will decide in November whether to increase the town's sales tax rate to pay for municipal improvements.  (Photo: Austin Humphreys/The Coloradoan)   Timnath has long-term goals that span the next 25 years, but in the immediate future, Grossman-Belisle said the town wants to focus on the next phase of Harmony Road by extending four-lane travel to a point just east of Three Bell Parkway, a main entrance to the Timnath Ranch community. The town is also working toward building a north-south parkway east of Larimer County Road 5. That corridor would ultimately be a four-lane road that would help divert traffic from County Road 5, which runs through neighborhoods and has developed regular rush-hour congestion as the town has grown, Grossman-Belisle said. ON THE BALLOT:  Larimer Co. voters to decide on arts, culture tax Sewer improvements in Timnath's oldest areas and another phase of widening Harmony are also on the short list of projects the town wants to tackle. Even if the sales tax increase passes, the money it brings in will not pay for all the planned improvements. Other funding can come from property taxes and development fees. Projects within Timnath's commercial district, including the Costco development, are also eligible for URA funding, said Robert Rogers, a contract attorney for the town. Although the town has a few other retail outlets, including a boutique in Old Town, by far and away the majority of its sales tax revenue comes from the Costco and Walmart. "If it passes, we'll still be a little short and have to push a few things out," Grossman-Belisle said of infrastructure improvements. By the numbers Timnath's proposed sales tax increase Tax on "the sale of tangible personal property at retail or the furnishing of services and the current town use tax rate" Current: 3 percent Proposed: 4.35 percent Tax on "food for home consumption" Current: 2.25 percent Proposed: 3.6 percent Source: Larimer County sample ballot for Nov. 8 election   95 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://noconow.co/2dr2xyt TOP VIDEOS LIVE: Reporter Jacy Marmaduke explains how to measure snow 1:33 Fort Collins weather: The first snow is here 0:27 RAW: First snow of season in Fort Collins 0:15 First seasonal snow on CSU campus 0:17 Northern Colorado weather forecast: Snow on the way 2:03 Watch these Colorado chickens play the xylophone 0:19 CSU coach Mike Bobo on facing snother option team 2:09 Greeley flight attendant has plane sing to mom 1:14 CSU coach Mike Bobo on offensive progress 2:03 QB Nick Stevens on CSU's offensive growth 2:23

On Wednesday, 29-year-old William Murray and 36-year-old Antony Kanazeh seemingly thought they were meeting drug users but it ended up being undercover agents. Kanazeh and Murray are just two of the six suspects Delaware County detectives arrested Wednesday on drug-related charges. “If you’re looking for drugs in Delaware County, we’re purchasing everything. If you’re going to sell drugs in Delaware County, we’re going to purchase it from you. We’re going to arrest you,” said an undercover informant with the Delaware County Sheriff’s Department. Investigators tell FOX59 they previously caught Kanazeh selling drugs to an undercover officer at a gas station.  During that arranged drug buy, Kanazeh supposedly brought his 8 and 10-year-old children with him. “It’s a cycle, the war on drugs. Everyone asks, ‘How are you going to beat them?’ You aren’t going to beat them but we are just going to keep tackling them,” explains an undercover informant with the Delaware County Sheriff’s Department. With the price of heroin increasing, detectives are seeing an influx of crystal meth. Kanazeh allegedly was selling both. “It’s here and everybody’s talking about it and we want to stop it. We are trying to find the source.  We believe the source is from Indianapolis but we are trying to find the source here,” explains an undercover informant with the Delaware County Sheriff’s Department. This isn’t the first time the Muncie Wal-Mart on East 29th has had drug activity.  Last March, a meth lab was discovered in the store’s bathroom. “It’s apparently the place to go buy and sell drugs, maybe utilize bathrooms to get high,” said an undercover informant with the Delaware County Sheriff’s Department. When questioned, Kanazeh didn’t admit to selling drugs.  According to court documents, when investigators showed him pictures of the drug deal where his kids were present, his “head sank between his shoulders.” DCS was notified.  Both Kanazeh and Murray several drug related charges. So far this year, Delaware County has opened nearly 200 drug cases.   Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Google Pinterest Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

(Contributed photo / The Fuller family) Frank WarnerContact ReporterOf The Morning Call 'Just us being silly': Clown on hearse near Phillipsburg is tracked down by police POHATCONG TOWNSHIP — A clown rode on a hearse Tuesday night through the Walmart mall parking lot just east of Phillipsburg. Someone didn't think it was funny and called police. Pohatcong Township police tracked down the clown and hearse after the 9 p.m. appearance in the mall along Route 22 in the township. Police said the clown will be cited for riding on the vehicle's hood. The clown showed up at the mall just a day after other people in clown costumes reportedly chased children in Phillipsburg and Wilson. To some at the mall, the clown was fun. To others, he was suspicious. "There have been many inquiries about the incident from concerned parents," police said Thursday after their investigation. "There was no contact between the man and shoppers in the area. … At this time, there is no reason for concern." The clown was Sean Fuller, 18, of Alpha, owner of the hearse. Driving the vehicle Tuesday was his father, Matt Fuller, 42, also of Alpha. Matt Fuller said the hearse ride was simply to spread some good cheer. He and his son rode in the open at the mall and did nothing to scare anyone, he said. Creepy clown sightings across the U.S. Creepy clown sightings have been taking the nation by storm. Florida is the most recent state to experience multiple appearances. Creepy clown sightings have been taking the nation by storm. Florida is the most recent state to experience multiple appearances.

The car moved about 2 mph, and the ride through the parking lot lasted about 5 minutes, Fuller said. "We stopped to wave to people while they were snapping pictures and smiling and laughing, realizing it was a joke," he said. "But then someone found it to be scary or offensive and called police. The police followed me to my house." The police were polite, he said, but they told the Fullers they ought to be more careful. South Whitehall police: Creepy clowns not a worry here yet Frank Warner SOUTH WHITEHALL TOWNSHIP — The clown reported acting suspiciously late Tuesday in a South Whitehall neighborhood was nothing to worry about, township police said.

"They said, 'Hey guys, you don't need to be doing this kind of stuff.' " The hearse is his son's "play toy," Fuller said. "I had one years ago and he [Sean Fuller] wanted one," he said. "He saved his money and he bought it a few months ago." Pohatcong Mayor James Kern said he was happy the police quickly identified the clown and the hearse driver, and found they were not up to anything nefarious. "It wasn't a major threat or a major concern, like we've seen elsewhere," Kern said, "but with everything going on, people are on edge. Any reasonable person would be concerned. "This ended up being a harmless copycat situation, but it came the same day there were reports in Phillipsburg of clowns chasing children," he said. "This was bad timing."

Published Sep 29th, 2016 5:19 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Here we go again. With multiple media reports suggesting Wal-Mart Stores may make another big ecommerce and buy Indian-based Flipkart, retail industry watchers say the deal would be good for the world’s largest retailer. Bentonville-based Wal-Mart has moved in recent years to grow its ecommerce business to compete on the world stage with Amazon, Alibaba on other online merchants. Part of that move included the recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. It’s the highest price ever paid for an internet retailer, and respected Jet.com CEO and co-founder Marc Lore was included in the deal and will lead Wal-Mart’s ecommerce division. Bloomberg News reports that Wal-Mart may invest between $750 million and $1 billion in the online startup FlipKart. Wal-Mart nor FlipKart have confirmed the talks are taking place. Even so, the retail world is already considering what a possible deal might mean for the retail giant looking grow its e-commerce business in a country of 1.2 billion consumers. FlipKart is the brainchild of two former Amazon employees and was launched in 2007. The website sells a variety of products from home goods, food, health & beauty aids, apparel and electronics with approximately 44% of the market share in India. Amazon is knocking on that door with about 30% of the market share. India has been a tough market for Wal-Mart to crack with respect to physical stores. Last year Walmart International CEO David Cheesewright told Talk Business & Politics that wholesale was the way the retailer planned to go in India. He said it is valuable market long term and the plan at that time was to gradually add more cash and carry stores that service the mom and pop businesses throughout the country. But that was before Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced in June plans to invest $3 billion in India on the heels of $2 billion already spent rolling its Prime service out in the populated country. Dr. Annibal Sodero, assistant professor of supply chain at the University of Arkansas, said there are several things to consider in trying to assess how Wal-Mart might benefit from a deal with FlipKart. “First there is the Indian market. It is very important for Wal-Mart, while some of the BRIC countries are in turmoil … Brazil and Russia, and with China slowing, India holds opportunities. Amazon is also playing very heavy in that market,” Sodero said. He also noted that brick and mortar did not go so well for Wal-Mart in India and if they are going to have a shot at winning share in India it’s going to have to be via e-commerce and most likely that’s going be through acquisition. “Look at how Wal-Mart ultimately chose to grow e-commerce share in China against Alibaba. They partnered with JD.Com to run their Yihoadian business because that was the best way to participate in a larger share of the business,” Sodero explained. Secondly Sodero said Wal-Mart U.S. sales are flattening and its best long term growth opportunities are outside the United States. He said growing through acquisition is the best way for Wal-Mart to expand its international footprint and a Flipkart deal makes sense following that strategy. Thirdly, he said FlipKart’s expertise in “slash sales events” is a different business model than Wal-Mart. But it has not been without issues, especially when advertised products sell out quickly leaving customers frustrated. Sodero said FlipKart is also vertically integrated in that it has its own electronic brands. He said this is an interesting play for Wal-Mart who is a seller of other electronic brands. A deal for Flipkart won’t be without challenges, Sodero said. The geographic barriers are huge and the business model is vastly different. But that doesn’t mean it won’t work. He said Jet.com was vastly different and that deal was made. “Wal-Mart is not going to find a perfect glove to fit their hand so they have to make strategic plays when they can do so,” Sodero said. “One thing for certain is that Wal-Mart is going to have to invest in acquisitions to grow e-commerce share against the likes of Amazon and Alibaba. I don’t when it will happen but I wouldn’t be surprised to see them shopping in Latin America as well for an e-commerce play.” Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail, agreed with Sodero’s assessment of the alleged deal with FlipKart. “Some global markets are better scaled through digital and that certainly describes India. Just as Walmart’s recent acquisition of Jet.com girds its digital presence in the U.S., partnering with Flipkart is an efficient way to make a meaningful move in India,” Spieckerman said. Continuing, she noted, “Walmart has set its sights on achieving true ‘global e-commerce’ — so has Amazon. By partnering with an established and familiar digital leader like Flipkart, Walmart can immediately go toe-to-toe with Amazon in India. Flipkart benefits from Walmart’s scale and expertise, which will only accelerate through Walmart’s other digital acquisitions. Walmart is well on its way to creating a synergistic, global, digital ecosystem.” Analysts say FlipKart and its competitors continued to lose money last year because infrastructure investments and deep price discounts on goods eroded margins. It’s hard to imagine that would be an acceptable practice by Wal-Mart, who would no doubt leverage its scale and international expertise to fatten up the margins and still compete with Amazon. Wall Street values FlipKart at around $11.5 billion, which is more than 10 times the alleged investment reported at $1 billion. Wal-Mart could be considering a minority stake in FlipKart like it did with a 5% investment with J.D.com (5%) in China.

Photo by Wes Woods II/Los Angeles Daily News By Wes Woods, Los Angeles Daily News Posted: 09/29/16, 8:27 AM PDT | Updated: on 09/29/2016 # Comments The pursuit ended near Walmart in Panorama City, according to media reports. (Image via Google Earth) A police pursuit ended with a stolen Toyota Prius crashing in Panorama City Thursday and the driver being taken into custody, authorities said. The chase started at 7:30 a.m. and ended about an hour later, said Officer Liliana Preciado of the Los Angeles Police Department. At various points, the pursuit snaked onto the 5 and 118 freeways as well as surface streets in Arleta, Van Nuys and Panorama City. The chase began in the San Fernando Valley after police officers spotted a black Toyota Prius driving erratically. They ran the vehicle’s license plates and determined the car was stolen, said Sgt. Greg Bruce of the LAPD. As officers followed the Prius, the driver sped away and let a female passenger out of the car, Bruce said. At one point, the driver hit another vehicle at an intersection, NBC Los Angeles reported as its news helicopter followed the pursuit from the air. A Los Angeles police cruiser then rammed the side of the Prius. But the man behind the wheel kept going. He drove onto the sidewalk and almost hit a couple of pedestrians before crashing into a planter near a tree at Willis Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard in Panorama City, according to police. The man was “uncooperative” and “combative,” and officers used a Taser to subdue him, Bruce said. Witnesses watched as the arrest unfolded. John Yoo, 37, was with friends across the street from the accident location in Panorama City and said he came outside after hearing helicopters. “I saw him in custody,” Yoo said of the man. He said the intersection of Willis and Roscoe has accidents nearly once a week, so “it’s always something.” Near the crash site, a woman was treated for a medical emergency unrelated to the chase, Bruce said. During the pursuit, the woman was standing in the grass next to the sidewalk, and was protected by the large planter and jumped back. A second woman was on the sidewalk with a stroller and baby when the pursuit ended. The woman and child were able to escape unharmed, Bruce said.

General Electric, where my mother worked for almost 18 years, helped put five siblings through school, food on the table, clothes on our backs, and provided a pension for my mother who is now in her 70s. It gave access to health resources for a sister with cancer, allowed brothers to thrive, and a single mother to be triumphant in economic hard times. Now GE is gone and Walmart has a proposal to clean up whatever is underneath the slabs of concrete that have been empty for many years. Let's do some fact-checking: — Waterstone will invest $14 million to rehabilitate the site with a DEP-mandated stormwater system. — Major upgrades are promised, adding trees and landscaping, and a light at the Tyler/Dalton/Woodlawn intersection. — Total investment is approximately $31 million, all of it private sector money, not Pittsfield tax dollars. — Walmart is already here and is part of the "Cop On Top" fundraiser that in 2014 raised $52,000 for the Special Olympics. Since it arrived in 2010 it has amassed more than $400,000 for the Special Olympics. — Approximately $500,000 in property tax revenue will be generated annually for the city — Approximately 350 construction jobs over two years will be provided in addition to 85-100 new full- and part-time jobs for a total of 300 jobs. — There will be easy access to comparable pricing on food, clothing, eye care, prescriptions, and automotive needs. But, what really makes me a believer in this center is the fact that Al Maiorino from Public Strategy Group Inc. stopped by my house to see me, look across the vast space, and ask what my concerns were and what ideas could I give to him to utilize and help make the center right for Tyler Street business. That in essence told me that Walmart, Woodlawn Crossing, and Public Strategy Group want what's best for my neighborhood, the place I call home, and the place I want to see grow and provide a prosperous future for us all and the next generation.

Walmart Worker Accused Of Setting Multiple Fires Inside The Same Store Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Worker Accused Of Setting Multiple Fires Inside The Same Store Image courtesy of Great Beyond September 29, 2016 1:23 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk bad consumers crime fire firestarter retail walmart Things got a bit heated at a Walmart in Massachusetts recently, after a employee allegedly set three fires inside the store. Police responded to the store around 5:25 p.m. on Tuesday after a report of a fire in the store’s jewelry section, MassLive.com reports. When they arrived they found it wasn’t just the one fire — there were three set throughout the store. “All three fires had been extinguished by Walmart staff and several customers who used the fire extinguishers that were located throughout the store,” police said, adding that no one was injured. After officials determined that the fires had been deliberately set, the suspect seen on a surveillance video was identified as an employee. She had been seen fleeing the scene in a car, police said, so investigators called her to ask her to come back to the store. She hung up on them, but turned herself in the next day and was arrested. She’s now facing three counts of burning a building’s contents, three counts of destruction of property over $250, and one count each of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. The store had to close to deal with smoke and fire damage.

(MGI) &amp; Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 14, 2016 Posted on September 29, 2016 by Bronstein, Gewirtz and Grossman, LLC in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / September 29, 2016 / Bronstein, Gewirtz &amp; Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a securities class action has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on behalf of those who purchased shares of MoneyGram International Inc. (“MoneyGram” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: MGI) pursuant and/or traceable to the secondary public offering completed on or around April 2, 2014 (the “Offering”). This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The Complaint alleges that MoneyGram allegedly made false and misleading statements and omissions regarding Walmart’s possible entry into the money transfer business and the likely effect it would have on the Company. On April 17, 2014, two weeks after the Offering, Walmart publicized that it was initiating its own money transfer service on April 24, 2014. Following this news, MoneyGram’s stock dropped close to 30%. No Class has yet been certified in the above action.

The original incidents occurred during the nighttime hours between Thursday September 22, 2016 and Saturday September 24, 2016 when two separate vehicles were broken into located in the 1300 block of South State Street and the 1700 block of Windswept Court.  The suspects, who were later identified as Pablo Jackson, 32 (Homeless), and Joshua L. Bryant, 25 of Cheswold, removed items such as cash and purses from the vehicles.  The two then began making credit card purchases from the Cheswold Walmart as well as the Camden Walmart totaling more than $3,400.00.  Detectives were able to identify the two suspects through store surveillance and Theft and Identity Theft warrants were obtained for their arrest. On Wednesday September 28, 2016, a trooper and probation officer assigned to the State Police Kent County Governor’s Task Force (GTF) were actively patrolling the area of South DuPont Highway (US13) and Lochmeath Way, when they observed Pablo Jackson walking northbound on the southbound shoulder of US13.  As the task force members made a U-turn in an attempt to make contact with Jackson, he was observed looking into vehicles near the South Side Baptist Church (4904 South DuPont Highway).  When the trooper and probation officer began to exit the patrol vehicle in the driveway, in which Jackson was walking out, he turned and began running away from the two and discarded the backpack he was carrying.  The trooper gave numerous commands for Jackson to stop, but he continued to flee until the trooper caught him and took him into custody without further incident.  A search of Jackson’s backpack revealed 24 bags of heroin (0.36 grams) along with drug paraphernalia. Joshua Bryant Pablo Jackson was transported back to Troop 3 where he was charged with Resisting Arrest, Possession of a Controlled Substance (Heroin), and two counts of Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.  He was also charged with 18 counts of Identity Theft, five counts of Attempted Identity Theft, 18 counts of Unauthorized Use of a Credit Card, five counts of Attempted Unauthorized Use of a Credit Card, two counts of Theft Under $1500, 10 counts of Theft by False Pretense Under $1500, Conspiracy 2nd, and two counts of Criminal Trespass 3rd.  He was arraigned at JP2 and committed to Sussex Correctional Institution on a total of $93,600 cash bond.

The nearly 152,000-square-foot store, located at 1750 Nottingham Way, will house a full line of groceries as well as other merchandise and a full pharmacy. "Everyone has been working so hard to make sure our store is ready to meet our community's needs," store manager A.J. Riaz said. "We hope that once our customers see... what's to come, they'll be as excited as we are." This will be the fourth Walmart in Mercer County and the second in Hamilton. Walmart opens hiring center "Many factors go into the decision to choose a location for a new Walmart store, but the main consideration is meeting the needs of our customers," Phillip Keene, a Walmart spokesperson, said. "We look for areas where we can offer customers a greater selection of merchandise, convenience and affordability than they had before. "We have a great customer base in the area, and we are looking to provide them with even more convenient shopping options," Keene said. With new business comes new employment opportunities as well. Keene says that this supercenter — like almost all others — will employ approximately 300 full- and part-time associates.

One of the sources said the US retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against US rival Amazon.com, which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year. Wal-Mart operates 21 wholesale stores in the South Asian country, but is discouraged from setting up its own bricks-and-mortar shops by rules that limit foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers to 51 percent and the cost of setting up shops in a country as large as India. For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India. "India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive. So the road ahead is either a Flipkart or an Amazon," said Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm. "Which is why it is natural for Wal-Mart to look at Flipkart as they cannot acquire Amazon." The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. Cut-throat competition Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country. Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart. But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centres. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and smaller rival Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015. The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then. Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a US regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc , down from as much as $15 billion earlier this year. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China's JD.com Inc, giving the US firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:35 PM, September 28, 2016 Updated: 6:20 PM, September 29, 2016 MUMBAI/HONG KONG - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in talks to buy a minority stake in India's largest e-commerce firm Flipkart, two people familiar with the matter said, as the world's biggest retailer aims to break into a fast growing but highly competitive online retail market. One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc, which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year. Wal-Mart operates 21 wholesale stores in the South Asian country, but is discouraged from setting up its own bricks-and-mortar shops by rules that limit foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers to 51 percent and the cost of setting up shops in a country as large as India. For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India. Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm, said it was natural for Wal-Mart to want to partner with Flipkart. "India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive," he said. If a deal is agreed, Wal-Mart would join other foreign strategic investors in India's online players. China's Alibaba Group Holding, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp and Taiwan's Foxconn last year led an investment of $500 million in Flipkart's smaller rival Snapdeal. Alibaba is also the biggest shareholder in India's One97 Communications, which operates payments services and an e-commerce market place under the PayTM trade name. The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. CUT-THROAT COMPETITION Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country. Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart. But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centers. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015. The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 29 September 2016 | MYT 12:29 PM Wal-Mart in talks to buy stake in Flipkart Looking East: WalMart is looking to invest between US$750mil (RM3bil) and US$1bil (RM4.1bil) in Flipkart. — Reuters HONG KONG/MUMBAI:  Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in talks to buy a minority stake in India's largest e-commerce firm Flipkart, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the world's biggest retailer aims to get a slice of a fast-growing online retail market. One of the sources said the US retailer was looking to invest between US$750mil (RM3bil) and US$1bil (RM4.1bil) in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the company's overall valuation. He added Wal-Mart and Flipkart were also contemplating a collaboration that would see them leverage each other's expertise in retail and supply chains in India. Both sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against US rival Amazon, which has been expanding rapidly in the South Asian country's retail market and is now Flipkart's biggest competitor. Wal-Mart only operates wholesale stores in India. "With Amazon slowly taking a lead over the Indian players, all these unicorns including Flipkart and Snapdeal are out there in the market to raise funds," the source said. "Companies like Wal-Mart would be more long-term investors, but there aren't too many like them to write such big cheques." Flipkart has been valued at about US$11.5bil (RM47.2bil), local media reported last month, citing a US regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc. The company was valued at as much as US$15bil (RM61.7bil) earlier this year, but cut-throat competition, reduced private funding, and elusive profitability is putting pressure on e-commerce players in India. Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. Flipkart and smaller rival Snapdeal have been looking to raise fresh capital to compete with deep-pocketed Amazon in an industry that relies on steep discounts on products and heavy spending on marketing, technology and delivery networks to lure customers. The Economic Times newspaper, which first reported the talks on Tuesday, said a meeting between the two sides was scheduled for this week. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5% stake in China's JD.com, giving the US firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Nasscom cuts IT services sector growth forecast for FY17 US FCC drops planned reform of business data services market Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Beware!

I didn’t report the assault because of the circumstances (there was underage drinking at the party, etc.). Amy Dickinson  I am now 23, and although I am fine, I run into him every once in a while — at the college I attended, at Walmart, at a local restaurant and he recently came through the drive-thru at my workplace. I always do my best to stay as calm as possible and to not pay him any attention, although it is very challenging to not break out into a full-blown panic attack. I think it’s too late or a lost cause to report it at this point, but I have to do something, so it doesn’t eat at me every time I see him. My question for you is — should I confront him? If so, what do I say? If not, what do I do about running into him? Stuck at 17 DEAR STUCK: I can’t tell you to confront this person — or to avoid him. I can only tell you that you must do what is best for you. It is not too late to report this assault, and it is not a “lost cause.” Your cause is never lost, because you are here, struggling mightily to cope. You have survived a sexual assault. And although you say you are “fine,” I don’t think you are fine. I think you’re unsure, hurting and anxious — all very natural reactions. I shared your question with a spokesperson at the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN.org), the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence organization. They want to assure you that there is no one right answer for how a sexual assault survivor should cope to move forward. You can call and talk to a counselor at the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-HOPE (4673); they can listen to your story, review your options now and also connect you with a local counselor and support group. RAINN also has an online “chat” feature available, 24/7. It is vital that you receive help and support. An answer for what you should do concerning the man who assaulted you will emerge through talking about it. Please don’t bury this or discount what happened. DEAR AMY: “Protective Daughter” described her concern over her mother’s decision to become a caregiver to an abusive ex who now has cancer. I am a therapist who has had clients ready to leave an ex-partner who has faked cancer to get the partner back. It only worked for a little while but eventually caused chaos in the well person’s life. I say, confirm this diagnosis on paper before you do it, but better yet: RUN! Siri DEAR SIRI: Great point. An unscrupulous person could use a cancer diagnosis to emotionally manipulate a caring individual. I agree that “Protective Daughter” should urge her mother to confirm the prognosis before she re-enters a relationship with an abusive ex.

Today, the whole gaggle of them are pretty much gone, but because Nature tends to abhor a vacuum, they’ve left the field clear to economists. There are those who insist that economics is a science. But whereas actual scientists all agree about such things as the existence of gravity, the distance to the moon and such laws as the one that holds that things in motion tend to remain in motion, economists can’t agree about anything. Back in the late 1980s or early 90s, a woman was divorcing an economist. In the settlement, she made sure it contained a codicil granting her half the money if within the coming decade, her ex-husband was to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. Eight years later, he copped the Prize and she got her $500,000. While it was he who went to Stockholm and got to give a speech, I would argue that his ex-wife should have copped the honor. Although I can’t claim to be a professional economist, I think that President Trump could do worse than to give me a cabinet position and put me in charge of recharging the economy, a job I am far better-equipped to handle than Hillary’s choice, Bill Clinton. That’s because I have a sure-fire solution. I call it shampoo economics because I can’t claim full credit for it and wish to acknowledge the role that the shampoo industry played in my coming up with the brainstorm. My sole contribution was in recognizing the huge effect those few words on every bottle of shampoo could have on our economy: “Shampoo. Rinse. Repeat.” It’s that “Repeat” that caught my attention. Imagine the audacity of it. You use a product specifically created to wash your hair, and once you’ve done the job, you’re told to do it all over again! Think of the effect it could have on our economy if we brought that policy to bear in every area of commerce. Buy a loaf of bread…and now buy a second loaf. Buy a 64-inch TV…and now buy another. Buy a new Chevy…and now go out and buy a second. Think of the economic boom if every farmer, every fast food outlet, every manufacturer, was compelled to double the supply of goods to meet the demands of an insatiable public. Whereas Trump talks about an annual 4% economic growth, the Prelutsky plan promises 8%, but the sky’s the limit because if the economy shows the slightest downward curve, we simply change to a three-peat plan. That is why I insist that my plan is Head & Shoulders above all the others. Frankly, I’m surprised that people like John Maynard Keynes, John Kenneth Galbraith and even Alan Greenspan, academics who weren’t also writing three or four articles a week, writing books and movie scripts, never thought of it. But perhaps they were so involved with that single job, it never even occurred to them to think outside the box or to read the instructions on the shampoo bottle. Actually, it’s rather ironic that it took a bald guy to beat them at their own game. If a cop, even a black one, didn’t occasionally shoot a black criminal, I wonder what black mobs would find to riot about. In a way, I suppose the riots are simply an example of a different economic theory in action. I mean, when one black man shoots another black man, as has happened over 500 times in Chicago thus far in 2016, it merely provides Obama, Mrs. Clinton, Loretta Lynch and their stooges in Congress and the media, an excuse to once again try to nullify the Second Amendment. But if that first black man happens to be wearing a police uniform, it results in an entire neighborhood being outfitted with new Nikes. After all, nothing says social justice quite as much as looting a Walmart’s. The notion that the so-called black community only wants jobs is proven a hoax once you realize that the black unemployment rate when George Bush left office stood at 12%, whereas today it’s 17%. Nevertheless, blacks gave Obama 97% of their votes and a similar percentage are anxiously awaiting the opportunity to do the same for Hillary Clinton. A reader recently wrote to reminisce about William F. Buckley’s TV show, “Firing Line.” Although I admired Buckley’s work on behalf of conservatism, I never thought he was at his best on the tube. For one thing, he was so dedicated to displaying his pedantry that he would never stoop to using a couple of six-letter words if he could possibly wedge in one with 12 letters. I found his debates with uberliberal Gore Vidal especially excruciating. Vidal always came across as an uberfruitcake while Buckley, a mad gleam in his eye, would inevitably lean forward, looking like Snoopy portraying a vulture, while tapping his pencil incessantly against his front teeth. At times, it seemed as if he were channeling Lionel Hampton playing “Flight of the Bumble Bee” on his xylophone. In discussing words and phrases now out of favor, another reader voiced confidence they would never disappear from the scene, but I disagreed. I wrote: “One can hope, but none of the kids are using them these days, although they are far more likely to have been exposed to ‘hunky dory,’ ‘swell,’ ‘knee-high to a grasshopper,’ ‘jumping Jehoshaphat’ and ‘pshaw!’ than their kids or grandkids will be. "Besides, they are addicted to communicating 140 characters at a time and using Ur, 4 and LOL, in place of actual words. Yet another generation of jibbering idiots. Is it any wonder they lined up behind a pinheaded Pied Piper named Bernie Sanders? I wonder if they even know what slang is, let alone use it. "I hate to be the very personification of a cliché — the old codger who sees America going to the dogs — but thanks to a fifth-rate education system, a 10th rate media and demographics that are destroying the character of the nation — I see little reason to feel hopeful for our beloved nation’s future. Regards, Burt” Oh, and did I forget to mention that at Brown and Cornell, they will now be dispensing feminine hygiene products in what in a bygone age were known as men’s rooms? It is one small step for mankind, but one giant leap for lunacy. The CEO of Wells Fargo, John Stumpf, under whose stewardship the company created two million phony accounts that led to 5,000 employees being canned, told a congressional committee that he is taking full responsibility for the crime. By which he means he is not resigning or giving back the enormous bonus he received for all those fictitious new accounts. Although I can sympathize with a guy having to go through life with a name ending in “pf,” that’s still no excuse for him not to spend the next two million years in the slammer. Gloria Steinem, who used to be an attractive young bubblehead and is now, decades later, a bubblehead with wrinkles, has recently declared: “Forced childbirth is the single biggest cause of global warming.” In case you’re confused as to cause and effect, she went on to say: “I’m glad the Pope spoke out about global warming, but does he know he’s causing it?” My interpretation of her theory is that if we didn’t have so many people, we wouldn’t have to expend so much energy in feeding, clothing and housing, them. As you may have noticed, whenever liberals complain that not enough blacks or Hispanics have influential, high-paying jobs, they never offer to sacrifice their own, and when, like Ms. Steinem, they complain about over-population, they never offer to kill themselves in order to make room for someone else. My own response is to say: “Don’t tell us Gloria, tell your pals Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. They’re still blaming coal.” Meanwhile, down in Florida, perennial candidate Charlie Crist got the kind of laughs I can only dream about when he said, “I believe Hillary Clinton is steady, I believe she is strong …and” (wait for it!) “I believe she is honest.” It brought down the house. Damn those amateurs! A quote Brit Hume shared on his Fox broadcast and attributed to someone named Larry Hardiman, but which I suspect has been around for quite a while, made me chuckle: “The word ‘politics’ is derived from the word ‘poli” meaning many and the word 'ticks,’ meaning blood-sucking parasites.“ Finally, I keep hearing that Hillary Clinton is out-spending Donald Trump by a margin of 5-1, in some states by 10-1, when it comes to TV advertising. So why am I getting email from him and his kids six or seven times a day dunning me for campaign contributions? It leads me to wonder if he’s using the money to get himself elected president or whether, come November 9th, we’ll discover that we’ve financed a new golf resort in Ireland.

clock menu more-arrow Los Angeles Living the Pizza Dream, One Delivery at a Time How Dough Box Pizza manages to keep so many people happy with so little by Farley Elliott Sep 30, 2016, 3:59pm PDT Photos by Farley Elliott tweet share pin Los Angeles is not, on its face, a food delivery town. That’s surprising, given the amount of time everyone in Southern California spends in their cars, or stuck at one destination awaiting the slow recess of yet another traffic wave. But give people what they want — access to quality ingredients, a fair price, and a story — and, eventually, they'll pick up the phone and call. That’s when it’s time to get to work. Dough Box Pizza is that none-too-rare L.A. business model success story you usually only hear about in the Arts District or Silver Lake. Fine-dining chef turns taco cart into street food sensation (read: Guerrilla Tacos). Promising jam maker turns forlorn storefront into America’s breakfast obsession (read: SQIRL). It’s a story told on gourmet food trucks every day, and dreamt about during morning prep sessions in kitchens across the city. But with Dough Box, the upstart Chicago-style deep dish pizza pick up and delivery-only company, its commissary kitchen space in City Terrace did not immediately seem like the right sort of micro neighborhood for their needs. Pushed into a windowless building with no signage and ringed by tow yards and salvage lots, young owners Alexandra Gonzalez and Tony Hernandez saw an opportunity that speaks to the unique economics of a delivery-only restaurant in Los Angeles. Yelp "From the beginning, I looked at it as a necessity," says Hernandez. "We didn’t start with a bunch of money." The partners had experience on their side — Tony is a carb wizard with a background at places like Proof and Bread Lounge, while Alex spent time at Hollywood Pies making deep dish herself for years. "It was pretty amazing how little we started with," she says. Rather than present their financing challenge as a hurdle to be cleared, the two looked at the track they were on and decided to play a different game altogether. By keeping their plans focused on delivery and take out orders, Dough Box could run as a lean operation with almost no overhead and minimal start-up costs. "I like how controlled it all is," says Gonzalez, working dough from one of the two prep tables inside their 225-square-foot kitchen space. "It’s going to be difficult if we ever have to move to a different space, with all those people we have to take care of." Maybe the best Chicago style pizza in Los Angeles People, indeed. Labor costs are among the single highest expense for any restaurant, hovering anywhere from 25% to 45% of total overhead, depending on the business model. The lower that percentage is the healthier the bottom line, which is precisely why chain restaurants (and giant corporations like Wal-Mart) spend millions of dollars to study workflow patterns, track employee efficiency, and employ a host of other strategies to manage the cost. At Dough Box, labor cost is about as close to zero as you’ll find. Sure, both Hernandez and Gonzalez need to pay their own rent, eat food, put gas in their car, and just generally survive, but practically any small business owner will tell you that most of the money spent on their personal salary actually stays right inside the business. The pair employs a phone guy who sits on a small stool right up by the entrance to the kitchen and takes orders for five hours a night. They pay out their delivery drivers, of course. But the vast majority of the work happens before anyone else who requires a paycheck even shows up, and comes from just four hands. What’s the trade-off for not having a sign, or a picnic area or a bathroom or napkins or light fixtures or chairs or any of the endless other fixed-cost items that come with opening a brick-and-mortar restaurant to lure in customers and get them to spend more money? Overhead costs that sit around $4,000 a month, all in. That’s boxes, ordering pads, credit card fees, the lights, the gas, the real estate they stand on. The building even pays for their water and trash removal. You just have to know the game and play it well to survive And then there's permitting, a consistently arduous and often expensive dance with various municipal bodies that can sink the most even-keeled financial model. Restaurants in this town and anywhere else in America have gone broke, either literally or at least functionally, before even opening their doors thanks to cost overruns associated with code compliance, the health department, or the DWP. That’s not to say those organizations offer any malicious intent; you just have to know the game, and play it well, to survive. Many first-time restaurateurs find that out in just about the hardest ways possible. Dough Box has their certifications, an A rating from the health department, hanging on a small cork board right above the head of the guy who takes those calls. At the top of that board is a single string that stretches across the room (it isn’t far), holding clips of orders for the night to come. Forget the need for an ADA-compliant bathroom, or for a POS system. You’re never more than three feet from the only other person you could possibly need to ask a question to. Back at Dough Box HQ, the afternoon is fading and the two-person team has a night of cooking ahead of them. Because each deep dish pizza takes about an hour to cook all-in, the timing for getting orders in and out of their mid-sized oven in the corner needs to be precise. It’s an older model that came from Craigslist thanks to a guy in Santa Clarita who closed his own pizza shop. The refrigerator is another Craigslist find, and both sat in storage until this commissary kitchen space became available. Now they’re humming along in prep for another evening turning out what may be the best Chicago-style pizza anywhere in Los Angeles. Eventually they will break, and need to be replaced. Eventually the guy with the headset to his ear will want more money, a better chair, or will move on to some other job somewhere else. Eventually he, and anyone else on the official payroll, will need to be paid at least $15 an hour. And eventually, if all goes well, Gonzalez and Hernandez might even leave their little City Terrace hideaway for some sit-down restaurant with table cloths and window shades and 1,000 other items that someone will have to pay for. But for now, it’s just Dough Box. Two people in a warehouse off the 10 freeway, available only by phone while answering to nobody. And for them, business couldn’t be better.

With 26 kittens abandoned in boxes in the Shuswap area within less than a week, the BC SPCA is letting the public know that there is a much better option: surrendering any unexpected or unwanted animals to the BC SPCA, said a BC SPCA press release. Two kittens were found by a Tim Hortons, near Walmart, dumpster last Friday, three-week-old kittens were found in two boxes in Enderby last Saturday, four kittens left on the top of a hiking trail (two of which are still missing), Shuswap SPCA staff are hoping to see an end to the sudden spike in kitten abandonment, the release said. "We get boxed kittens all summer but this is just a spree of them," Shuswap BC SPCA Branch animal care attendant Barb Gosselin, who notes the shelter helps manage the abandonment or surrender of litters with the help of foster guardians. “We’re asking the public to please, come and surrender any unwanted animals to the BC SPCA – it’s important for us to get background information about the animals, like their age and health, in order to provide them with the best possible care,” said Gosselin. The kittens are in good shape now, but Gosselin said when they were found, the kittens on Mt. Ida were starving. The situation is not uncommon, with the SPCA getting boxes of abandoned kittens throughout the year, but Gosselin said it's unusual that so many kittens have been found within the last week. It's better for the animals if people bring them to the SPCA, rather than abandoning them, she said. "When kittens are abandoned or just dumped in a box somewhere, it puts the animals’ health in jeopardy, and we lose the opportunity to gather the information necessary to rehome that animal. We urge people who feel they must surrender their animals to please do so in a responsible way so that we can all work together to give these animals the best possible chance to live a happy life.” The best thing to do to prevent these instances from occurring is to spay/neuter your pet. She recommended the Kamloops Spay Neuter Clinic which has low rates. Foster guardians for animals are always needed at the SPCA, and Gosselin encourages anyone thinking of becoming a foster fur-parent to contact the branch today. With the abundance of felines across the province, the BC SPCA is hoping an upcoming adoption promotion, presented by Hill’s Science Diet, will encourage British Columbians to consider adopting an adult cat companion – or even two. “We’ve currently got more than 1,700 cats and kittens (in B.C.) in foster care and in our shelters, with more waiting to come in each day,” said BC SPCA director of regional operations Jane Talbot. From Oct. 1 to 14, all BC SPCA branches are offering 50 per cent off the usual adoption fees for all adult cats. “Kittens are always in high demand, but the goal during this event is to find fantastic homes for as many felines as possible,” Talbot said. Adopting an adult cat instead of a kitten has many benefits, she notes, as they’re calmer and more settled, litter trained, fully grown and their personalities are already developed, so potential adopters know exactly what they’re getting. Each year, the BC SPCA rescues more than 15,000 cats and kittens. To adopt an adult cat this weekend, visit your local BC SPCA branch during business hours, or visit spca.bc.ca/adopt to search for adoptable cats.         We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

(Rob Andrews/CleverPet/TNS) The Furbo Dog Camera has streaming video, two way audio and interactive treat tossing mechanics. (Furbo/TNS) We love our four-legged pals to pieces, crave time with them, feel terrible when we’re apart. Thank heaven (for little girl and boy animals) that a growing crop of innovators is working in the pet-tronics and pet-care space, helping to reassure us that Fifi and Fido are doing well even when we’re many miles from home. Smile for the camera. Surveys suggest that “checking in on the pets” is a core reason for purchase and use of web-connected home-security cameras. Most video snoopsters also have a built-in speaker, so app-linked viewers can remotely coo words of comfort or bellow, “Get off the couch!” Even better, I’ve found, are specialty video cameras that also distribute treats, such as the Furbo Pet Cam, the Petzi TreatCam, and the Feed and Go Smart Pet Feeder. – Furbo ($119 at www.furbo.co) has the sleekest design and an easily popped-off lid for dropping in refills of your dog or cat’s favorite yummies. Furbo’s Barking Alerts feature pushes a message to your smartphone when your high-strung pal is complaining, encouraging a quick response in your most calming voice. – The Petzi ($151.37 at Walmart.com) has the Pavlovian response mechanism down pat. Remotely wake up Petzi through your phone or tablet app and a yellow light glows next to its lens, telling whomever, “You’re on Candid Camera.” Other app-taps remotely cue Petzi’s pleasant musical-jingle alert, capture, and then send your voiced communications and – most important – pump out a handful of dog or cat treats (better crunchy than soft, no longer than one inch). Petzi’s secure holding tank won’t spill stuff if your smart guy knocks the box over. As with Furbo, remote video views of the darlings can be snapped, shared, and compared on social media – in color when there’s strong room light, otherwise captured in black and white. – The Feed and Go ($249 at Amazon.com) sits apart by serving full meals, with six rotating compartments that each hold up to 8 ounces of dry or (if you dare) wet food. An SMS or email message is pushed when the feeding starts. And you’ll get a warning if there’s a system failure. – Coming soon, the Gosh easyFeed will increase the options with portioned food and water refilling, too. It will even reorder pet food from Amazon automatically when sensing the storage bin is running on empty. Due in November, it’s now a $155 early-bird special on Kickstarter. – No pictures, just treats. Too far removed or lacking the gear to connect remotely with your pooch? CleverPet serves as a surrogate babysitter, engaging your pal with paw-at-the-blinking-lights games that reward pattern recognition with treats. Get a demo and make an order ($299) at www.clever.pet. – Exercise this. WonderWoof is a cute, connected Bluetooth bow tie that attaches to your dog’s collar, then reports (to an app) if your pal is doing enough running, sleeping, playing, and walking. $95 at www.wonderwoof.com. For dogs that like to play “fetch” longer than you do, there’s PetSafe’s Playtime Anytime Automatic Ball Launcher. A tennis ball shoots out, adjusted to fly between eight and 30 feet away. Poochie hustles after the ball, doubles back, drops it into the device’s top hole, and then . boom! . the ball launches again. A rest feature guarantees a cool-down every 15 minutes. A Launcher costs $149.95 at www.petsafe.net, where you’ll also find the Train ‘n Praise Potty Training System, $110 and up. High-rise animals’ best friend, this thing dispenses a treat every time your pet uses its indoor/outdoor pee pad with fake (washable) grass, a large holding tank, and optional liners. – Plush accommodations. Spend half your day cleaning animal fur off the furniture? EnchantedHomePet.com offers an amazingly diverse and pretty line of pet sofas/beds that both lure your critters and blend with your home decor. Sized for either small pups or big bruisers, these snooze spots feature washable plush or pleather upholstery and storage for toys and bones, priced from $89.99 to $599.99. Also available online from Amazon, Wayfair, Target, Kohl’s, Bed Bath and Beyond, dog.com, and petco.com. – EnchantedHomePet’s Pet Therapeutics brand resting mats are prominent on the same websites. Placed atop a grownup sofa, a TheraWarm Sofa Bolster and Furniture Protector ($59.99) captures and radiates a pet’s natural body heat. Conversely, the TheraCool Gel Cell Cooling Pad ($82.99) absorbs and dissipates excess body heat. Both have memory foam, which help ease joint and arthritic pain, it’s claimed.

AUSTIN Rio Grande Valley farmers have reacted angrily to the news that Mexican President Vicente Fox will not be announcing his countrys water payback plan this week after all. Miguel Monterrubio, a spokesman at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, said Wednesday that Fox needs more time to discuss certain aspects of the proposals with Cabinet colleagues and governors from the six Mexican states bordering the United States. But Valley farmers and irrigation district managers say they fear the holdup is due to Fox demanding increased U.S. funding for major irrigation system upgrades in Chihuahua and other northern Mexican states. Id like to say we are surprised by this latest delay by Mexico, but how can we be? said Tommy Garcia, a McAllen farmer who has just written off 300 acres of decaying grain sorghum due to lack of irrigation. We have been skeptical of President Foxs announcement from the start, and I think it proves that Mexico is going back on its word again. We are very much again-st our government helping modernize Mex-icos irrigation system at this time. Monterrubio said he felt sure that Foxs announcement was only being delayed a couple of days and that it could come early next week. Monterrubio said he had no knowledge of Fox asking for increased U.S. funding to help pay for a $420 million irrigation system upgrade for the states of Chihuahua, Tamau-lipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon. Its not really a delay at all, Monterrubio said. The presidents announcement has been put back just a few days so that some members of the different secretariats involved can meet with the government to discuss details on some aspects of the proposals. There are just a few more things that need to be ironed out. Monterrubio said Fox was working with five different Cabinet members on the issue, along with the Mexican National Water Commission and the governors of the six states along the Mexico-U.S. border. According to the International Boundary and Water Commission, Mexico is likely to owe the United States 1.7 million acre-feet of water by Sept. 30, the deadline for the current five-year repayment cycle. Mexico says it is still technically in compliance with a 1944 international treaty that requires the release of an average of 350,000 acre-feet of water from the Rio Conchos Basin to the Rio Grande every year. Fox said on May 15 that he would confirm within the next 15 days a detailed schedule on how and when the water repayments would be made. Fox made the statement the day after telephone discussions with President Bush on American involvement in a $420 million water conservation plan for the northern Mexican states of Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon. Sam Sparks, a Mercedes grower of sugar, cotton, and grain sorghum, said Foxs delay in announcing a water payback plan would push more Valley farmers towards supporting the abolition of the 1944 treaty. This postponement shows that we are not going to get any water any time soon. It is another delaying tactic, Sparks said. Weve got to scrap the treaty and tell Mexico that we are going to keep our water and they can keep theirs. Most of our vegetable production has already been lost to Mexico anyway. Ray Prewett, executive vice president of Texas Citrus Mutual and a founder member of Texans for Treaty Compliance, dismissed talk of the dispute being irreconcilable. We play up the negative too much. If the state of Chihuahua had released just 10 percent of the 12 million acre-feet it has used since 1992, we would not be where we are today, Prewett said. We do not want to box ourselves in a corner over this. We must not think this dispute is un-resolvable. Gordon Hill, general manager of Bayview Irrigation District, said Valley farmers and growers should be just as upset with the IBWC as Fox after the binational agency failed to send a representative to a Rio Grande Regional Water Planning Group meeting in Zapata on Wednesday. Im furious. IBWC Commissioner Carlos Ramirez met with State Department officials in Washington last week to discuss the water debt and no one was here to tell us how that meeting went. Once again we are being kept in the dark, Hill said. I think its time Valley farmers stopped pussy-footing with Washington, the State Department and the IBWC and start looking at developing alternative, dependable, water sources, he added. Hill said his proposals to divert Mexico-bound water from the Hoover Dam to the Rio Grande had been favorably received by many Region M members at the Zapata meeting. Hill said he was also pleased Region M members had agreed to consider a resolution at their next meeting that calls on the U.S. government to block any financial aid for Mexican water conservation projects until the 1944 treaty is complied with. Sally Spener, IBWCs public affairs officer, said Principal Engineer Carlos Marin had confirmed in advance his absence from the Zapata meeting. Spener said both Ramirez and Marin were scheduled to attend the next Region M meeting. The meeting is scheduled to take place June 26 in McAllen.

While it doesn’t entail commemorating a notable figure from history, or carry religious significance, it does involve celebrating two things that many genre fans can get behind: Star Wars and toys. Although it almost seems greedy for me to celebrate both “National Drink Beer Day” and Force Friday in the same week, such is the case with today’s new annual tradition of unveiling a bantha poodoo-load of Star Wars toys and collectibles. Specifically, today’s release targets merchandise for the standalone film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, opening Dec. 16. Obviously there is no need to have a shortage of Star Wars toys in your life, but from 3.75” figures, to vehicles, to Nerf guns, to collectible Black Series figures, Funko Pop Vinyls, and more, there are dozens of new items hitting shelves today. Instead of listing all of them, I’ve selected these five standout items I am dropping some cash on -- you know, in the spirit of celebrating the holiday. K-2SO Star Wars Black Series figure The Star Wars Black Series 6-inch figs are always a win in my book because the sculpts are so incredibly detailed, but they are ultimately still action figures. For Rogue One, I’m already a big fan of the liberated Imperial Droid K-2SO, or “Kaytoo.” Performed via mo-cap and voiced by Alan Tudyk, the droid not only seems to have a pragmatic attitude -- that sets him apart from C-3PO -- but the look strikes me as steampunky. He’s tall and lanky, with oversized hinged joints, and slightly hunched over. The Black Series version of him ($20) is going to look great on my desk. The other Rogue One Black Series figures include Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, the Imperial Death Trooper, and an Imperial Hovertank fig (exclusive to Toys ’R’ Us).   Funko Pop Vinyl Exclusives Funko continues its world galaxy domination of collectibles with 18 new Rogue One Pops! hitting the market, as well as three Wobblers. Although last year saw a dearth of Rey toys and collectibles, there’s plenty of Jyns out there to make fans happy, including three Pops and a Wobbler. But I’m more interested in the Dark Side of things. Specifically, chrome Imperial Death Trooper ($9), available exclusively at Walmart, has caught my eye. It looks the shiny new toy I need – and one that is going to be hard to get. Speaking of exclusives, the Bistan aka “Space Monkey” Pop is going to be my chase item at New York Comic Con next week. Developed by Neal Scanlan’s creature shop, and unveiled at Star Wars Celebration in July, the character (who is of the Iakuru species) is a gunner on the new U-ship craft. There’s just something about him that reminds me of an Original Trilogy cantina creature, or a background character from Jabba’s Palace. Frankly, I want to hang out with this guy and get him cackling like mad over jokes about Ewoks. But I’ll settle for having him in Pop form.   Stormtrooper replica mask Introduce a little Star Wars roleplay into your life with Hasbro's Stormtrooper Black Series talking helmet ($80; available at retailers in classic white, or in Shadow Trooper black exclusively at Amazon). The helmet includes a voice changer so you can make certain to avoid being identified by rebel scum.  A Death Trooper half mask with voice changer and lights is likewise available for $30 at other retailers.   Nerf Blasters They light up, make noise, and, best of all, unleash hell in the form of a barrage of foam darts. The Nerf blasters are amongst my favorite of Hasbro’s Star Wars toy line. In fact, I currently have a pump-action First Order Stormtrooper one at the ready by my computer in case I encounter a surly commenter (don’t feed the trolls; blast them). The Rogue One character blasters include Jyn ($50), Cassian ($20), and a Death Trooper ($35). I’m split between the Jyn and Death Trooper versions. On one hand, Jyn’s has a nice weight to it, and fires off six darts in rapid succession. However, design-wise the Death Trooper blaster has an edge. It can easily be held in one hand, and the blaster sounds and are incredibly satisfying. It holds three glow-in-the-dark darts, and the muzzle lights up as you pump and fire.   Remote-controlled AT-ACT vehicle Not to be confused with the classic AT-AT (All Terrain Armored Transport) vehicles, the new AT-ACTs (All Terrain Armored Cargo Transport) introduced in Rogue One are bigger, with different blaster mounts, and a more trapezoid grill. The Hasbro toy version unveiled at San Diego Comic-Con for the 3.75” figures, is remote controlled (via smartphone) with the ability to fire four Nerf darts at a time. It moves its head, lights up, and makes a variety of sounds. There is also a detachable cargo hold that can be connected to the main vehicle with a zipline, and comes with three figures: Jyn, an Imperial Astromech, and a driver. There is a steep price of $300 for all this awesomeness, but let me restate: It’s a remote-controlled AT-ACT. I mean, this thing looks sweet, and might even fetch me my slippers and newspaper. As a notable mention, I have to bring up the LEGO Death Star set that is not technically a new Rogue One toy, but is still a new item available today. For $500, the 4,000-piece set is pretty epic in both detail and size, and comes with 23(!) mini-figs.   Let me know in the comments below if you plan on picking up Rogue One toys before the movie comes out, and what's topping your list of Force Friday items. And before I leave you, take in the nerdy splendor below of me in my new half-mask and blaster pose. It's basically my version of a Christmas sweater on Force Friday.

Attention Walmart Shoppers: Self-Driving Cart in Aisle 3 By Beth Stackpole on September 20, 2016 SHARE ARTICLE: Beth Stackpole Retail giant seeks patent on robot carts to streamline the shopping experience.   Talk of self-driving cars is everywhere lately, and now Walmart wants to take the whole autonomous operation concept to a shopping cart. Really? Apparently, the company has filed a patent for a self-driving robot cart that would address some of users’ pain points with maneuvering through crowded aisles and with the whole shopping experience in general. According to a Popular Science article, the robot cart design takes aim at common problems such as employees being unavailable or untrained to adequately support customers, aisles made messy by abandoned carts and displaced inventory. Popular Science explains the patented technology as putting a Roomba-like robot under the cart, which enables it to be driven around the store as directed by the shopper. There was discussion of a track system to enable carts to easily travel around the store to pick up other carts or locate products, and obviously, a tie in to the sensor-rich environment that is Walmart’s store and supply chain system. Seems a bit like overkill to me, but as we’ve seen from popular Internet memes, anything can happen in a Walmart store. Here’s the Popular Science piece with more details, including a visual.>>> IT Delivers on Automation’s Promise Sign up to receive timely updates from the editors at Automation World and download this FREE Special Report on the transformative power of data in manufacturing.

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP photo) By Mercury News Readers PUBLISHED: September 30, 2016 at 2:45 pm | UPDATED: October 4, 2016 at 10:15 am Thank you to the editors of The Mercury News for endorsing Yes on Prop 56 and exposing the deception in the Big Tobacco ads against the measure (Editorial, Sept. 29). The tobacco industry ads are now also even more outdated, thanks to the action of Gov. Jerry Brown signing Assemblyman Chris Holden’s AB 1696. This new law takes effect in January of 2017 and makes tobacco cessation services a defined benefit for Medi-Cal patients, who smoke cigarettes at a much higher rate than the general population.  The revenue from Prop 56 will improve timely patient access to both Medicaid providers and these new tobacco cessation and counseling services across California, and thereby reduce the deadly harm from tobacco products in our state. John Maa Secretary, San Francisco Medical Society   ‘Phantom’ performance was transcendent I attended Wednesday’s performance of Broadway San Jose’s “The Phantom of the Opera” with a bit of trepidation given Karen D’Souza’s review.  I needn’t have worried; my daughter and I were completely blown away by the performances, the orchestra, and especially the amazing engineering of the set design.  The whole thing was frankly transcendent.  Who would have thought of using rubber glass for the exploding chandelier?  I even brought a few bits home as a memento.  Hurry and see it. Donna Hobbs Boulder Creek Part-time workers issue requires federal action The strategy of employing people for half time by large employers such as Wal-Mart and fast food companies has been going on for years. From a profit perspective, these companies are simply doing right by their stockholders. I have also seen local school districts and governments employ this strategy. This is a national problem and should be addressed through our tax system, not in a county/state patchwork manner. The real issue here is that mega-employers are using this tactic to transfer health care costs to taxpayers. When these part time employees, many of whom have multiple part time jobs become ill, they use Medicare, paid for by taxpayers. The simplest solution: Require all employers who use part time workers to pay a pro-rata share of employee health care cost into an Obamacare type fund. If a person has multiple part time jobs and is working 40-plus hours, they will have full access to health care benefits. Anne Arjani Los Altos Hills Vote ‘no’ on Cupertino’s Measure C In a remarkable ruling by the Santa Clara County Superior Court, a judge ruled Cupertino’s Measure C ballot arguments contained three false and misleading statements. This decision marks a step toward protecting the integrity of ballot arguments, and I am very happy justice was served. Voters have the right to know the truth of the initiative on which they are expected to vote. Now many Measure C proponents are crying foul, claiming they were “innocent civilians” preyed upon by “money hungry developers.” Don’t be fooled. This was a ploy by politically motivated individuals who were caught trying to mislead the public and are now playing the blame game. The truth of the matter is that Measure C proponents are running a misleading, no growth measure, suing the city, attempting to recall the mayor, campaigning against the school districts and running for city council to further their causes. We must put a stop to their games. Vote no on Measure C in November. Ram Gopal Cupertino Elect Tseng to Los Gatos-Saratoga school board I would like to go on record as endorsing Katherine Tseng for re-election to the Los Gatos-Saratoga High School District Board of Trustees.  Katherine brings excellent credentials to this position as an actuary with extensive experience in analysis and risk management, not to mention her strong commitment to community engagement.  I have known Katherine for almost 16 years and have had the pleasure of working closely with her at the Argonaut Elementary School PTA, Redwood Middle School PTA, Saratoga High School PTSO and Saratoga High School Sports Boosters.  I truly admire Katherine for her selfless volunteer work on behalf of the students and families in our community.  Our students have benefited from Katherine’s commitment to academic excellence as well as her commitment to their emotional well-being.  Katherine exemplifies honesty, fairness and thoughtfulness.  Please join me in supporting her for re-election to the LGSUHSD Board of Trustees. Diane Clement Los Gatos Multiple polls show Trump won debate Your staff news report on the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton debate (Page 1A, Sept. 27) cited that the CNN poll declaring Clinton as the clear debate winner. But you would expect that from CNN.  When listening to various radio reports on the debate results, CNN was the only poll declaring Clinton the victor. Other polls from USA Today, Drudge Report, CNBC, Breitbart, Time, ABC and who knows how many others had Donald Trump as the apparent winner. So it appears that the majority of polls are for Trump on this first debate. Once again the Mercury News persists in being deficient in objectivity and accuracy in their reportage. Tony Favero Half Moon Bay Trump’s position on taxes is frightening So, Donald Trump actually bragged at the debate about how smart he is to not have paid his taxes, huh? Well, I guess that makes the rest of us a bunch of idiots. Personally, I know my tax dollars make a difference to many, and I can live with that. I live in this country, live in California, and use many resources with gratitude. I’ve had friends who have come from countries where there were few of the wonderful resources we usually take for granted. I learned a long time ago the money has to come from somewhere, so I pay my fair share of taxes as most responsible citizens do. Trump’s attitude of entitlement should scare many more than it apparently does. That is frightening in itself when you think he may be elected to lead our country.

And I will admit, albeit begrudgingly, I somehow still do. But when I sit down to remember the 21st night of September, wherein I piled into UT Austin’s Frank Erwin Center along with over ten thousand other eager concertgoers for the Saint Pablo Tour, I can’t help but feel salty. And it’s not hard to understand why. The Life of Pablo (TLOP) is an incredible album. As someone who has spent her life observing and adoring Kanye West, it was the culmination of so many of his other creative techniques from the gospel roots of The College Dropout (2004) to the electro-punk stripped-down minimalism of Yeezus (2013). TLOP is a truly raw, spiritual experience from start to finish. Not being pleased with the Saint Pablo tour itself is, then, in no part due to any problem I have with the content of the album he’s touring. So why exactly am I disappointed and frustrated with his performance in Austin last week? Maybe it was the fact that Kanye ended up starting the show about 2 hours late, a move so incredibly unprofessional I felt insulted by how little he valued the time of his loyal fans, many of whom drove hours to come see him. Maybe it was the fact that he performed for barely an hour for us in Austin, after giving Houston a 2+ hour extravaganza the night before. Maybe it was the fact that his merch was composed of $95.00 long-sleeve Gildan t-shirts – you know, the same brand of shirts that cost $2.00 at Walmart – sporting designs that could’ve been devised in Microsoft Paint. Maybe it was the fact that I bought tickets way back in June as part of the Tidal Presale, tickets which put me out more than a couple of Benjamins. Maybe it was the fact that I felt like I did more vocals at the show than Kanye actually did, as he severely overused the “stop singing and hold the mic out to the crowd” move. I’m sure my saltiness is due, in no small part, to the previous concert experience I had with Kanye: the Yeezus tour, an earth-shatteringly magnificent auditory and visual spectacle that has proven impossible to forget. While all of those things collectively were enough to make me feel disrespected and ripped-off, I also was confused by the setlist. Yes, we got some key throwbacks like Stronger, Heartless, Touch the Sky and Can’t Tell Me Nothing, which energized the crowd and helped me feel a little bit less angry at Ye. Considering this was indeed the Saint Pablo Tour, however, there were more than a handful tracks of that were conspicuously absent. Both 30 Hours, my personal favorite track off TLOP, as well as No More Parties in L.A., a unanimous fan favorite, were not performed. Highlights and FML were also no-shows. Perhaps most strange was the lack of the actual tour namesake track, Saint Pablo, a six minute masterpiece we all had expected to hear at the show. I assume that the gaps in the setlist were a result of the show starting about 2 hours late, which just frustrates me even more. Kanye had an arena full of people who support his lifestyle out of our own pockets, and he couldn’t even be grateful enough to his fanbase to give us the show we paid for. As someone who has seen over fifty individual acts live, none of which were in festival environments, that’s something I have never before encountered and hope to never encounter again. Don’t get me wrong; it wasn’t all bad. I did have fun dancing my face off, and what songs he did play sounded pretty fantastic on the Erwin Center’s sound system. The small square stage that levitated above the general admission crowd, which was a pulsating mosh pit that looked like the sickest party since T-Pain at Trinity last fall, was cool. The rest of the stage set up seemed like an impressive feat of engineering. The red lasers during Ultralight Beam were trippy and gorgeous. Yet having been spoiled by Yeezus, the minimalism Kanye was going for on this tour really seemed to fall flat, as jaw-dropping visuals have come to be a key part of the big concert venue experience. I’m sure if I was a wee-bit more obedient of a fan, I would call it “art” and refuse to criticize it, but I’m not that blindly adoring anymore after having been ripped-off by the West’s offensively short performance. Yet if I’m being completely honest, I’m still a sucker. If Kanye came back to Austin or San Antonio tomorrow,I would drop everything and go. I love and respect him as an artist that much. But my experience at Saint Pablo made me feel like maybe I shouldn’t love and respect him that much, considering it isn’t mutual. Despite being a lifelong fan who thinks his music has only gotten better with each creative project, I’m left feeling like I really do miss the old Kanye.

The service puts Google in competition with Uber’s UberPool and Lyft’s Line services, but with some key differences in the business model. While the aforementioned Uber and Lyft services are basically swapouts for taxis that let you split the cost of your trip with another rider headed in the same direction, Google said it intends to have the Waze app match drivers and riders already looking to move in the same direction. The driver is only reimbursed for mileage driven at a maximum of 54 cents per mile — Google says it doesn't believe drivers need to report any payment as income because it is considered gas money. Coordination, communication, and payment are automatically handled through the mobile apps. According to an account by a Wall Street Journal reporter taking a trip from San Francisco’s financial district to Oakland — roughly a 20-minute ride — Google paid the driver $6.30 and charged the rider just $3 — factoring in a discount for the service’s launch. The same ride outside of rush hour would cost $23 to $30 on Uber or Lyft, according to the companies’ apps. Those in the San Francisco Bay Area can register via the original Waze app, but riders must make requests via the separate Waze Rider app. For now at least, drivers aren't subject to a background check, nor are they required to provide a photo ID, they are just required to provide Waze with a schedule overview in addition to their home and work addresses.

Banks are recovering from a sharp drop as Deutsche Bank tries to reassure investors about its financial health. Strong earnings from Costco are giving consumer stocks a lift and energy companies are also trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,343 as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time. It lost 195 points the previous day. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 22 points, or 1 percent, to 2,172. The Nasdaq composite rose 52 points, or 1 percent, to 5,321. DEUTSCHE BANK: Banks made the largest gains Friday as investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation. The German bank has struggled for years to turn its business around and the Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities. “(A fine of) $14 billion basically wipes out their earnings for the year,” said Nathan Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. If the bank agrees to a smaller payment, it would be a big relief to investors. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.70, or 14.8 percent, to $13.18. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. BANKS REBOUND: Financial stocks had tumbled Thursday afternoon as investors again worried about the Deutsche Bank’s health following reports that some hedge funds are moving their business out of the bank. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are worried not just about its stock price, but the effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank runs into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are problems to worry about, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and increased regulation, there’s little reason for investors to buy bank stocks. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added $1.13, or 1.7 percent, to $66.78 and Citigroup gained $1.60, or 3.5 percent, to $47.40. BIG SALE: Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.85, or 4 percent, to $153.34 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.47, or 1.7 percent, to $89.70 and Wal-Mart rose $1.64, or 2.3 percent, to $72.37. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices have surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. While the gains for oil prices have slowed, investors were still optimistic that energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.95, or 1.9 percent, to $103.22 and EOG Resources rose $1.88, or 2 percent, to $96.93. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.51 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. COGNIZANT: Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it’s investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it’s looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. It named Rajeev Mahta, the former head of its IT Services business, as its new president. The stock fell $6.40, or 11.6 percent, to $48.60. CHIPPING IN: Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors continued to climb on reports the companies might combine. The Wall Street Journal said Qualcomm is in talks to buy its rival, and NXP gained $6.36, or 6.6 percent, to $102.49 and Qualcomm picked up $1.38, or 2 percent, to $68.83. NXP surged 17 percent Thursday and Qualcom rose 6 percent. TECH TRIUMPHANT: Major stock indexes set records this quarter, and tech stocks were by far the biggest reason. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 13 percent over the last three months. Apple surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Apple is the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world and Microsoft, the second-largest company on the S&P 500, is up 13 percent this quarter. Another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 15 percent. BONDS: Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. That sent stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate companies, lower than the rest of the market. METALS: Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.37 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1233 from $1.1216. OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX climbed 1 percent and France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent. banking Business dow jones finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchanage NEWS stocks 2016-09-30 Associated Press tweet Tagged with: banking Business dow jones finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchanage NEWS stocks Previous: Audit: Take back $3.4M in FEMA money from Mississippi school Next: Cattle prices falter despite good news About Associated Press More Stories Like This FAA grant to help repair Vicksburg airport drainage problems November 18, 2016 Tupelo works to provide utilities to annexed areas November 18, 2016 Mississippi joins fight for legal sports betting November 18, 2016 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 30, 2016 at 1:40PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. There are many reasons to buy and own shares of Citigroup (NYSE:C), but the best reason right now is its valuation. Valuing bank stocks Bank stocks aren't generally valued in the same way that other stocks are. Most investors look to the price-to-earnings ratio to gauge how cheap or expensive a stock is. The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the valuation, and vice versa. For instance, shares of Wal-Mart trade for a P/E ratio of 15.6. This means that you have to pay $15.60 for every dollar of the company's earnings. Amazon.com, by contrast, trades at a P/E ratio of 208.6, a higher multiple that reflects the e-commerce giant's growth potential. The P/E ratio is a helpful way to gauge bank stock values as well, but investors in the industry tend to prefer the price-to-book-value ratio. This is the metric that allows you to see the best thing about Citigroup's stock. Citigroup's stock is cheap There is no hard-and-fast rule to determine whether a bank is fairly valued. That's because the industry's profitability and thus share prices tend to fluctuate with the business cycle. When times are good, bank stocks trade for high multiples to their book values -- two times book value or more. But when the economy is under pressure, so too are bank stock valuations, often dipping below one times book value. You can see this in a chart of Citigroup's valuation over the past decade. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the New York-based bank was valued at more than twice its book value. But now its shares trade for a 35% discount to book value. C Price to Book Value data by YCharts. To put all of this into perspective, the average bank stock on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen of the nation's biggest banks, trades for a price-to-book-value ratio of 1.16 -- a 16% premium to book value. Of the 23 banks on the index, in fact, Citigroup's stock is the cheapest. Why Citigroup is cheap There are reasons, of course, that Citigroup's shares are valued at less than other blue chip bank stocks. The most important is the fact that Citigroup is far less profitable than it once was. Over the past year, Citigroup's return on equity, the primary profitability metric in the bank industry, was 7.3%, according to YCharts.com. That's meaningfully below the double-digit range that investors like to see at a bank like Citigroup. Unless the bank earns a return on equity of roughly 12%, it's said to be destroying shareholder value, after an investor factors in the opportunity cost of not investing his or her money elsewhere. Until Citigroup passes that threshold, or is expected to do so, there's little reason to think that its share price will eclipse book value. The point here is that Citigroup's stock is cheap, which is the best thing about it. At the same time, however, it's cheap for a reason. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

U.S. sales were hurt in part by Costco switching its store credit card to Visa from American Express in June.  (Daniel Acker / Bloomberg File Photo)   By Shannon PettypieceBloomberg Fri., Sept. 30, 2016 Costco Wholesale Corp. reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates, even as falling grocery prices cut into its sales growth. Profit amounted to $1.77 (U.S.) a share in the period, which ended Aug. 28, the Issaquah, Washington-based company said in a statement. Analysts had estimated $1.73 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Costco has been working to control costs after wage increases and food deflation put more pressure on its bottom line. Chains are locked in a price war, especially over staples such as meat and dairy. But Costco has weathered the challenges better than some rivals, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. Through Thursday’s close, the stock had gained 2.6 per cent over the past 12 months. The chain’s same-store sales — a closely watched measure — rose 3 per cent when gas and foreign-exchange fluctuations are excluded. U.S. sales were hurt in part by the company switching its store credit card to Visa from American Express in June. Credit cardholders complained they hadn’t received the new card or faced long wait times to activate it. Article Continued Below Total revenue amounted to $36.6 billion, just shy of the $36.9 billion that analysts estimated. Costco, with a membership fee, tends to cater to slightly higher income customers. While those shoppers have fared better during the economic recovery, there have been some signs this year they are pulling back over concerns about the election and volatility in the stock market. But Costco continues to open additional locations. The company plans to add nine of its warehouse-style stores, including a relocation, before the end of 2016.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 30, 2016 at 1:40PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. There are many reasons to buy and own shares of Citigroup (NYSE:C), but the best reason right now is its valuation. Valuing bank stocks Bank stocks aren't generally valued in the same way that other stocks are. Most investors look to the price-to-earnings ratio to gauge how cheap or expensive a stock is. The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the valuation, and vice versa. For instance, shares of Wal-Mart trade for a P/E ratio of 15.6. This means that you have to pay $15.60 for every dollar of the company's earnings. Amazon.com, by contrast, trades at a P/E ratio of 208.6, a higher multiple that reflects the e-commerce giant's growth potential. The P/E ratio is a helpful way to gauge bank stock values as well, but investors in the industry tend to prefer the price-to-book-value ratio. This is the metric that allows you to see the best thing about Citigroup's stock. Citigroup's stock is cheap There is no hard-and-fast rule to determine whether a bank is fairly valued. That's because the industry's profitability and thus share prices tend to fluctuate with the business cycle. When times are good, bank stocks trade for high multiples to their book values -- two times book value or more. But when the economy is under pressure, so too are bank stock valuations, often dipping below one times book value. You can see this in a chart of Citigroup's valuation over the past decade. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the New York-based bank was valued at more than twice its book value. But now its shares trade for a 35% discount to book value. C Price to Book Value data by YCharts. To put all of this into perspective, the average bank stock on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen of the nation's biggest banks, trades for a price-to-book-value ratio of 1.16 -- a 16% premium to book value. Of the 23 banks on the index, in fact, Citigroup's stock is the cheapest. Why Citigroup is cheap There are reasons, of course, that Citigroup's shares are valued at less than other blue chip bank stocks. The most important is the fact that Citigroup is far less profitable than it once was. Over the past year, Citigroup's return on equity, the primary profitability metric in the bank industry, was 7.3%, according to YCharts.com. That's meaningfully below the double-digit range that investors like to see at a bank like Citigroup. Unless the bank earns a return on equity of roughly 12%, it's said to be destroying shareholder value, after an investor factors in the opportunity cost of not investing his or her money elsewhere. Until Citigroup passes that threshold, or is expected to do so, there's little reason to think that its share price will eclipse book value. The point here is that Citigroup's stock is cheap, which is the best thing about it. At the same time, however, it's cheap for a reason. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Keris Alison Lahiff Sep 30, 2016 12:13 PM EDT U.S. stocks moved higher Friday thanks to a Deutsche Bank  (DB) rebound on the final day of the month and third quarter. The S&P 500 is expected to close the quarter with gains, but September remains in the red. Walmart (WMT) was the top performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after being initiated with an OVERWEIGHT rating and $90  price target at Keybanc. The firm said investments by the retailer should eventually lead to sustainable market share gains. Consumer sentiment in the U.S. improved at a faster-than-expected pace in September. Confidence among high-income households was particularly high, driven by lower inflation expectations. Cognizant Technology (CTSH) tumbled after disclosing an international investigation into whether it had violated U.S. law over a number of payments related to facilities in India. The company has notified the Department of Justice.
