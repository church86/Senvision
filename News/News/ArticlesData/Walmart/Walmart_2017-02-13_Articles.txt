 Warren Buffett just dropped Walmart and signaled the death of retail as we know it Ashley Lutz Feb. 14, 2017, 5:55 PM 925,542 facebook linkedin twitter email print Billionaire investor Warren Buffett.Bill Pugliano/Getty Images Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold off $900 million of Walmart stock, choosing instead to invest billions in airlines. The sale, which leaves Buffett with nearly no shares in Walmart, comes as the US's largest traditional retailer has been rushing to catch up to Amazon and other online competitors. Amazon's market value is now $356 billion, compared with Walmart's $298 billion. Last year, Buffett acknowledged that traditional brick-and-mortar retailers were struggling in the face of competition from the e-commerce giant. "It is a big, big force, and it has already disrupted plenty of people, and it will disrupt more," Buffett said at his annual shareholders' meeting in 2016, according to Bloomberg. Buffett has been paring his stake in Walmart since. He first bought shares in Walmart in 2005. He said Amazon's competitors, "including us in a few areas, have not figured the way to either participate in it or to counter it." Since the end of 2014, Walmart shares have fallen 21%, compared with a jump of 119% in Amazon. Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Yahoo Finance Former Walmart CEO Mike Duke said in 2012 that his biggest regret as CEO was not investing more in e-commerce to better compete with Amazon. "I wish we had moved faster. We've proven ourselves to be successful in many areas, and I simply wonder why we didn't move more quickly. This is especially true for e-commerce," Duke said at the time. "Right now we're making tremendous progress, and the business is moving, but we should have moved faster to expand this area." While Walmart has since invested billions in e-commerce, it holds a tiny share of the market compared with Amazon. Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, compared with Amazon's $107 billion. Walmart is still ahead in overall sales with $482 billion, more than four times as much as Amazon's revenue. Walmart Buffett's retail instincts have proved correct before — he predicted the downfall of Sears and Kmart in 2005. "Retailing is like shooting at a moving target," Buffett said at the time. "Turning around a retailer that has been slipping for a long time would be very difficult. Can you think of an example of a retailer that was successfully turned around?" Sears has since closed hundreds of stores and seems to be headed for bankruptcy. Macy's and JCPenney are also closing hundreds of stores across the US. While Walmart's footprint hasn't shrunk, many analysts say the US is still over-stored. The US has 23.5 square feet of retail space per person, compared with 16.4 in Canada and 11.1 in Australia — the next two countries with the highest retail space per capita, according to a Morningstar report from October.

Ragan Dickens, director of national media relations for Walmart’s corporate communications office, replied to an inquiry with the following statement: “We have not yet been served, but we take these claims seriously and will respond appropriately with the court.” The lawsuit notes that craft beer typically costs $2 or $3 more per six-pack than “macro-brewed or mass-produced beer.” But plaintiff Matthew Adam suggests in the lawsuit that the beers sold as craft beverages by Walmart are brewed by Genesee Brewing, in Rochester, New York. “Defendant’s craft beer has never been a ‘craft beer,’ nor has it been produced by a craft brewery,” the lawsuit alleges. “Rather, it’s a wholesale fiction created by the defendant that was designed to deceive consumers into purchasing the craft beer at a higher, inflated price.” Adam asks the court to declare the lawsuit a class-action that would represent all Ohio residents that purchased craft beer at Walmart. The suit, filed by Cincinnati attorneys Brian Giles and Bryce Lenox, seeks punitive damages, a declaration that Walmart violated the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, an injunction barring Walmart from marketing its beers as craft beers and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuit is pending in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court.   © 2017 Cox Media Group.

Navy Base Woman Chained in Container Describes What Captor Did Russia Has Reportedly Violated Major Nuke Treaty US / Walmart Go to Grid|Next Story Walmart Sued for Allegedly Selling Craft Beer That Isn't Chain is collaborating with Trouble Brewing, which doesn't exist By Michael Harthorne,  Newser Staff Posted Feb 14, 2017 3:49 PM CST 26 comments Comments Walmart is being sued for selling craft beer that allegedly isn't.   (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez) (Newser) – Sensing the way the beer winds were blowing, Walmart started selling its own line of craft beers early last year, the Washington Post reports. Now the retail giant is being accused of selling fake craft beers in order to trick customers into paying more in a lawsuit that calls Walmart's craft beers "wholesale fiction." Walmart says it's working in "collaboration" with Trouble Brewing to brew four styles of craft beer. But here's the catch: There's no such US brewery. Government filings say the beer is actually made by WX Brands, and the address listed is for Genesee Brewing, which is based in Costa Rica and makes "cheap college-party staples." So it's little surprise one taste-tester describes Walmart's Red Flag Amber as "good for flip cup." The four Trouble Brewing craft beers are stocked at more than 3,000 Walmarts in 45 states, where Consumerist reports they're placed on shelves with other craft beers. But the lawsuit alleges the beers—whose packaging gives no evidence Walmart has anything to do with them—don't meet any of the standards for craft beers listed by the Brewers Association, according to Courthouse News. Those standards include being less than 25% owned by a non-craft brewer and making fewer than 6 million barrels of beer per year. An attorney believes WX Brands/Genesee Brewing makes 6 million barrels of beer for Walmart's Trouble Brewing brand alone. The lawsuit, filed in Ohio, is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for anyone in the state who's purchased a Trouble Brewing beer.

The trendy mindless are like sheep and follow any trend the other mindless trendies follow. Craft beer, craft cheese? Most all come from the common supplier. Like brands of gasoline it's all the same with coloring and additives added to make it appear different. (this comment typed on by organic computer.) Ezekiel 25:17 Feb 15, 2017 1:41 PM CST Reminds me of deflating my friend who often boasted about liking his new imported beer, Blue Moon. Yes, straight from Belgium its good with an orange slice. Then came the deflation. I told him his much coveted beer was made in Golden Colorado and the orange hue came from antelope piss. He argued with me and then he hit the internet and found out I was right, well about the Golden Colorado thing. He has not drank a drop since then. My Walmart moment came with the new deli counter at the front. They had made up one of those circular refrigerators like you see at fine stores like Kamp's or Whole Foods. I bit on it and went and picked up what said, "Wisconsin Cheese". Well, in the fine print it then read, "Wisconsin style cheese made in Texas." It would be great to see all of the crap they do sell that is poser food.

(File photo)  Curtis Anthony Walton, 53, shortly before 5:40 p.m. Jan. 30 entered the Wal-Mart, 3722 Easton-Nazareth Highway, Lower Nazareth Township. He then was seen by a Wal-Mart loss prevention officer removing the items from a shelf and then heading to the customer service counter. Nazareth-area teen had stolen gun at cemetery, cops say Walton obtained a store gift card for $538 before being stopped by the officer. Officers responded to the store and arrested Walton. Walton on Jan. 30 was arraigned before District Judge John Capobianco on theft charges. The judge set bail at 10 percent of $7,500. In lieu of bail, Walton was sent to Northampton County Prison, where he remained Tuesday. Pamela Sroka-Holzmann may be reached at pholzmann@lehighvalleylive.com. Follow her on Twitter @pamholzmann.

Image Credit: Walmart faces lawsuit for luring in hipsters with fake craft beer By Alex Orlov February 14, 2017 SHARE TWEET PIN Looks may be deceiving when it comes to the beer aisle at Walmart. A lawsuit filed on Friday alleges that the retail giant has been misleading customers by selling mass-produced beer marketed as craft beer, Courthouse News reported.  Filed in Ohio, the lawsuit states that Walmart's "craft beer" is "a wholesale fiction" that's "designed to deceive consumers" into buying it at a "higher, inflated price." The complaint said the company has violated the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. According to the Brewers Association — a not-for-profit trade association — a craft brewer is defined as "small, independent and traditional." The Walmart beers in question: four brews created by Trouble Brewing for Walmart that have hipster-friendly names like Cat's Away IPA, After Party Pale Ale, Round Midnight Belgian White and Red Flag Amber. Walmart began selling the beers in 2016, the Washington Post reported. A variety pack sells for $13.86, and a six-pack is $7.96 — much more affordable than a six-pack of craft beer, which could set you back $12.  I ran into trouble, a pack of trouble. Red Flag amber, Round Midnight belgian white, After Party pale ale and Cat's Away IPA. Nice variety pack from Trouble Brewing. #troublebrewing #redflag #redflagamber #roundmidnight #roundmidnightbelgianwhite #afterparty #afterpartypaleale #catsaway #catsawayipa #craftnotcrap #craftbeerlover #craftbeerlove #beer #beerlover A photo posted by post shared by oHo (@chilimies) on Oct 22, 2016 at 6:21pm PDT Here's what Cat's Away IPA looks like, compared to a beer from Stone Brewing, one of the largest craft brewers in the U.S. Cat's Away IPA on the left, Stone Ripper from craft brewery Stone Brewing on the right. Source: Alex Orlov/Instagram Craft beer is currently big business in the U.S., so it's no wonder retailers like Walmart would want to siphon off some sales. In 2015, the craft beer industry grew 12.5% while the overall beer industry fell 0.2%, according to the Brewers Association. The craft beer market in 2015 was estimated to be worth $22.3 billion. What is craft beer anyway?  To maintain the small, independent and traditional craft brewer status specified by the Brewers Association, a brewer needs to limit annual production to 6 million barrels, not be owned by an "alcohol industry member" and it should use "innovative brewing ingredients."   According to Teresa Budd, a senior buyer for Wal-Mart Stores' adult beverage team, the company wanted to mimic the style of popular craft brewers. “We were intentional about designing a package that conveyed a look and feel you’d expect of craft beer,” Budd told the Washington Post, explaining that the company does not put its name on other private label products like cat food.  But other private label brews like the "Josephbrau" line from Trader Joe's make explicit reference that the brew comes from the retailer, the Washington Post pointed out; "Joe" is even in the beer name.  Had a #beertasting session last night and these were the three winners, all from #traderjoes #josephbrau You'll find these and more at our soiree tomorrow night. Come toast with us and #celebrate the beauty of being a woman with @ccbeautymark @luxeboutiqueag and #barelynothings There will be #giveaways - a fabulous #raffle - #makeup demos - clothing and #lingerie for sale and more!!! A photo posted by post shared by The Vixen Den Boudoir Studio (@thevixenden) on Feb 10, 2017 at 10:42am PST "Personally as a beer lover, I feel transparency in brand ownership and giving the beer lover the ability to know who brewed their beer is beneficial and valued," Julia Herz, craft beer program director at the Brewers Association, said in an email.  "It’s clear beer lovers want to support independent craft brewers," Herz said, noting that a recent Nielsen study found 63% of craft beer lovers said knowing a beer was made by a small and independent brewer was important to them.  The complaint against Wal-Mart Stores alleges that the company stocks the Trouble Brewing beers next to other craft beers, which perpetuates "the myth that it's a craft beer."  Stocking an allegedly fake craft beer next to other craft beers seems different from stocking store-brand cat food next to Fancy Feast. Consumers probably aren't trying several new types of cat food each month, but they might try new and different types of craft beer each time they head to a retailer like Walmart. Craft beer drinkers buy an average of 3.6 different brands of beer in a given month. Since craft brews are independent by nature and likely much less recognizable than big name brands for other products like cat food, a consumer might not be able to distinguish between true craft beer and a private label.  What is Trouble Brewing, and what's its relationship with Walmart?  Here's where things get murky: The complaint alleges that there's no "Trouble Brewing" brewery. When filing with the government, Wal-Mart listed "Winery Exchange Inc." — which is now known as WX.  The address on Wal-Mart's paperwork is the Genesee Brewing's office address in Rochester, New York, the Washington Post reported. Genesee Brewing is owned by North American Breweries, which owns and operates several breweries across the U.S. They're behind several beer brands — including Magic Hat, Portland Brewing and, naturally, Genesee.  "Along with its own brands, North American Breweries contract brews dozens of beers and malt beverages for other companies," the North American Breweries website states.  If North American Breweries is actually behind Walmart's "Trouble Brewing" beers, said brews are most certainly not craft beer. North American Breweries is owned by Florida Farm and Ice Co., a Costa Rican food and beverage company. In other words: "Trouble Brewing" doesn't seem like an independent entity.  The moral of the story is Walmart could be pulling a fast one over hipsters, duping them into buying six-packs with cheeky names and a distressed label.  WX did not immediately respond to Mic's requests for comment.  North American Breweries declined to provide a comment on the record.  Like us on Facebook: SHARE TWEET POST Alex Orlov Alex is a food staff writer.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business MWC 2017     NES Classic Reseller Prices On The Rise On Rumors That Nintendo Stops NES Production Posted: Feb 15 2017, 3:13pm CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The NES Classic reseller prices on the rise. Updated. What a difference a two days make. The NES Classic offers on the reseller market on Amazon.com have dropped on Sunday to $99. Today the lowest priced NES Classic console is $131.99 plus $3.99 shipping. What has happened? Don't Miss: The Funniest Super Bowl 2017 Commercials There are rumors circulating that Nintendo would stop production of the NES. There is no reason to believe this. Nintendo has not made any announcements. These rumors are not new. They always surface on a NES supply drought. The main reason why prices are rising again is that Target, Walmart, GameStop have almost no NES inventory this week.  Updates: Feb. 15: Prices have slightly increased again on the Amazon market place. The cheapest NES Classic is offered for $122.99 plus $3.99 shipping. There are only about 15 NES offers that are priced under $130. Supply is still very limited, with no new noteworthy NES sales. Only exception is the Walmart online store, which had the NES in stock for 2 minutes on Valentine's Day. Last week the situation was very different. Many NES hunters reported success in scoring the retro console. There was also online availability at GameStop. The result was that at the end of the week there was a surplus of NES in the reseller market that drove down prices. Now prices are up as  The profit margin for resellers have strengthened again. The regular price of a NES is $59.99. Reseller make about $60 (after fees) on a resale of a NES console now. Before the Holidays some people paid well over $200 for a NES Classic. Nintendo has not yet swamped retailers with NES units. It is a steady stream with stores of major retailers receiving a handful of units every couple of days. This might change in March. Amazon Germany gives a clue when a major shipment of the NES Classic is expected. The NES Classic is back-ordered and due stock March 15. Amazon is offering to pre-order the NES at the regular price for a mid-March delivery. The NES Classic reseller business might be over by the end of March, when Nintendo finally is able to satisfy the demand for the NES Classic. Nintendo has only sold through 1.5 million Nintendo NES Classic consoles since the launch in November of last year. Nintendo announced the number in the earning calls on February 1, 2017. The company plans to increase production. 1.5 million is just way too low and just shows how badly Nintendo predicted the demand.  Nintendo says that the procurement of parts is holding the ramp up of the NES Classic production back. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest version of hakchi2 allows NES owners to install over 800 NES games. There is also a new hack that allows to run SNES games via an emulator on the NES. We are tracking NES Classic stock for several stores that have received new NES Classic inventory in the past weeks. The list of stores that are getting supplied by Nintendo is rather short. Besides Walmart, Best Buy, GameStop, Target and ToysRUs only the Nintendo flagship store in New York had the NES in stock.

Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On launch day Nintendo said: "The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check availability." Nintendo did not make any further comments about the NES Classic supply situation since then. Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime tried to explain last week in an interview why the NES is suffering a shortage.  "When we looked at that proposition what we believed was the adults, 30-40 years old, who grew up playing NES as a kid, 10 years old or so but had stepped away from the gaming category--that was going to be the buyer," Fils-Aime said to GameSpot. "As we thought about that, that led us to a certain level of supply. The reality, however, was that the lapsed gamer and the "more active gamer" bought the NES Classic." This is a poor excuse. Nintendo apparently does not do focus groups ahead of console launches. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. The NES Classic demand is still strong amidst ongoing shortage. In about one months the new Nintendo Switch will go sale and Nintendo fans brace for the worst. The Nintendo Switch pre-order are sold out. The supply situation might no be as bad as for the NES, but it will be difficult to get a Switch at launch for customers who have not pre-ordered the Switch.

Currently installed in a store near the chain's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, the tower is one example of how the chain is responding to the rise of ecommerce. The self-dispensing tower -- also known internally as the 'automatic pickup machine' -- is essentially a giant vending machine for online orders. Installed last fall, the machine is located right inside the store's entrance and features an easy-to-use touchscreen on the outside. Customers simply type in the order number for the product they have purchased online and the machine will automatically produce the item. The automated pickup station helps to meet the rising demand for instant delivery, while also improving the in-store customer experience.

Ashley Williams Facebook When Ashley Williams isn’t singing in church, she’s delivering singing telegrams like the one that has turned her into a viral star. Everyday LaVan Photography Send A Song Today Singer Ashley Williams created a love match at an Alabama Wal-Mart over the weekend while delivering a singing Valentine. Screengrab 1 of 3 i By Lisa Gutierrez lgutierrez@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story So you walk into your local Wal-Mart to pick up a few things, and a woman greets you at the door and begins serenading you with “Stand By Me.” She keeps singing — beautifully — as she leads you through the store by the hand. Along the way people wearing one-word signs hand you heart-shaped balloons. You have no idea what’s going on. The look on your face says as much. That happened to a woman in Alabama over the weekend. The woman who grabbed her hand was Ashley Williams, who delivers singing telegrams. On Saturday she delivered a singing Valentine to a woman in a Wal-Mart in Decatur, Ala. She posted video of that delivery to her Facebook page, where it’s been viewed more than 5 million times since the weekend. “They have been friends for 2 years and he being a GENTLE GIANT asked her WILL SHE BE HIS GIRLFRIEND,” she wrote. Williams has been singing in church since she was 3, according to her website. She “knew at an early age that she wanted to change (people’s) lives through her songs. She loves making people smile through the sound of her voice,” her bio says. Wal-Mart isn’t her first retail performance — she’s sung outside Little Caesar’s, Big Lots and gas stations, too. She’s posted other videos of her singing telegrams on Facebook.   The woman she serenaded as they walked through Wal-Mart seemed shocked, but happy, to see her male friend at the other end of the store. This guy wins Valentine’s Day, declared viral video website The FW. “The woman gave the man a big ol’ wet one on the lips, so we’re guessing she’s totally cool with dating him,” the website noted. “If she wasn’t, man, this video could’ve had a much more awkward ending and may have gone viral for totally different reasons. “But, hey, you’ve gotta put yourself out there in matters of love and the heart and it paid off for this guy.” Related content Singing telegram helps create a love match in an Alabama Wal-Mart LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story National Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:23 One arrest as protesters block DeVos from D.C. middle school Pause 0:54 Royals Daily: Travis Wood is officially a Royal 4:16 The vicious debt trap of payday loans 1:37 Trump wants to speed up NAFTA renegotiation 2:31 Library program welcomes and informs homeless 0:54 Surveillance shows altercation on RideKC bus that ends with shooting 0:32 Graphic content: Listen to K-State students chant '(expletive) KU' during recent game 0:47 Blue Valley students hold prayer vigil for coach Eric Driskell 1:32 Press Secretary says press should focus more on leaks than Flynn's resignation 6:06 Sen.

The company saves $1 billion a year on its improved fleet efficiency alone: Walmart met its goal to double fleet efficiency in 2015, compared to a 2005 baseline. And two years prior, Walmart met its goal to reduce emissions by 20 percent, according to 2005 baseline, which also saves the company money on electricity bills. “There’s a very strong business case for that,” Fred Bedore, senior director of sustainability for Walmart, said in an interview. “It’s logic. When you turn off a light when you leave a room, you’re not consuming electricity. If you’re rerouting your trucks to make sure you save fuel, you’ll save on the bottom line. From an efficiency perspective, there’s tons of rational.” Also in 2015, Walmart moved beyond simply setting environmental sustainability goals. At COP21 in Paris Walmart pledged to set emissions targets for its business operations and supply chain in line with what scientists say are needed to keep global average temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A year later, Walmart became the first retailer to have its emissions-reduction plan certified by the Science Based Targets initiative. Specifically, Walmart will: Power half of its operations by renewable sources by 2025. Reduce its absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions 18 percent by 2025, from 2015 levels. Work with suppliers to reduce CO2e emissions from upstream and downstream scope 3 sources by 1 billion metric tons (1 gigaton) between 2015 and 2030. Walmart says the majority of its scope 1 and 2 emissions come from operating its buildings and fleet, so it’s focusing its efforts on continued improvements to its trucking fleet technology and improving energy efficiency to power stores and facilities while expanding renewable energy use. “There’s a similar business case for renewables,” Bedore said. “With renewables, you are taking more about cost over the long term and reduction in risk and variability. For any business, if you’re talking about fuel, if you can reduce variability, that makes planning that much easier. When you know what that’s going to be over time, you can plan for it.” Achieving these Science Based Targets isn’t an easy task, and Bedore has tips for other companies following in Walmart’s footsteps. “Two clear things stand out,” he said. “One is the need to test and pilot, and to retest and repilot. Very much like traditional business issues.” Targets and investments in efficiency and new technologies have to meet a pay-back period, and they have to be scalable. “Scale things that matter, and stick with it,” Bedore says. The second key piece is collaboration. “It’s this idea of working upstream and downstream,” Bedore said. “When you’re looking at things like [Science Based Targets], a number of variables have to come into play: aligning supply and demand, having trusted business partners, knowing what technologies are coming out and IDing which ones have the greatest potential.” This is especially true when it comes to addressing supply chain, or scope 3, emissions, which represent about 95 percent of Walmart’s overall carbon footprint. The company’s pledge to work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 gigaton by 2030 will require major collaboration with a huge number of other companies. “That was probably the hardest part about setting the Science Based Target was the scope 3 emissions because the breadth and depth of the supply chain we have is so massive,” Bedore said. “But it’s also fun to solve big problems.” When it comes to scope 3 emissions, Walmart is asking its suppliers how they can continue — and expand — emissions reduction initiatives they already have in place. These programs are also saving suppliers’ money: a CDP report published last month found Walmart and other major companies’ supply-chain emissions reduction initiatives saved suppliers a combined $12.4 billion in 2016. Bedore points to Walmart’s fertilizer optimization program, which works with suppliers to increase nutrient use efficiency while improving crop productivity and cutting emissions, as an example. By 2020, Walmart expects this effort to eliminate about 9 million metric tons of GHG emissions. Its original goal was to reduce fertilizer on 14 million acres of farmland by 2020. “Now we’re beyond 20 million acres,” Bedore says. “We know there’s huge paybacks in environmental and economic saving for the farmers because you’re applying the fertilizer at the right time, you’ll get more productivity from that plant, you’re not going to get runoff and have to mitigate that, and you won’t have to reapply fertilizer, so there’s cost saving there.” The initial program focused specifically on row crops. “Is there a similar application in other types of crops? Other geographies? You start to look at how you can build that ripple effect,” Before said. “This stuff works when there is a draw for it and there’s a draw for it when there’s either a product a customer wants, allows you to get more efficiency out of the supply chain, and the environmental savings go along with that, too.” Categories Air, Environmental Management, Feature, Supply ChainTags Science Based Targets, Walmart One thought on “Walmart’s ‘Very Strong Business Case’ for Cutting Emissions” lynn February 13, 2017 at 6:50 pm | Reply good Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Walmart U.S. recently began closing a few Neighborhood Market stores. The retailer said it gives notice to local media in the affected areas and does not plan to make a public announcement of pending closures which are part of the company’s efforts to evaluate the feasibility of every store it operates. Store closures in St. Petersburg, Fla., Denver, Chicago, Charlotte, N.C., and Marietta, Ga., have been reported by Walmart U.S. in early 2017. Wal-Mart Stores will report fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 21. Grocery accounts for just over half of Walmart U.S. sales. As the nation’s largest grocer, Walmart’s grocery sales are closely watched by the industry and often seen as a barometer on consumer spending habits. At the other end of the grocery spectrum, Whole Foods Market recently reported plans to close three of food-production facilities in Maryland, Georgia and Boston as it streamlines operations and reduces costs amid competitive pressures. The production facilities furnished prepared foods sold at the retailer and account for about 19% of overall company sales. Last year Whole Foods management outlined a plan to slash expenses by $300 million by the end of this year. In November, CEO John Mackey said the company was more than halfway toward that goal. Industry analyst Jay Jacobowitz of Retail Insights said Whole Foods has to reduce overhead and will likely outsource operations such as bakery rather than bring them in-store. He said it’s not uncommon for food retailers to outsource prepared foods operations as Kroger did in 2015 when Sysco began supplying sandwiches and salads. Wal-Mart Stores has also began leveraging procurement responsibilities for food and commodities into a centralized global effort given the retail giant operates in grocery around the globe. Streamlining the operations made sense according to Walmart International CEO David Cheesewright who spoke on this issue in June 2016. Cheesewright and Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran have touted the benefits of working together in this area to take costs out of the system and get more of private label goods for customers. FOOD DEFLATION REDUCES REVENUE Analysts expect grocers will continue to tweak operations to save overhead costs as food price deflation and competitive pressures weigh on top line revenue and squeeze margins. The latest Consumer Price Index Food at Home report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (January) indicated deflationary food prices in beef, eggs and produce. The Index reading declined 0.2% in December, which was the eighth consecutive monthly drop. The Food at Home metric, a barometer for grocery prices, fell 2%. “Deflation at the grocery stores continues to moderate – though it’s doing so at a very slow pace,” noted Deutsche Bank analyst Shane Higgins. Falling meat prices (-5.4%) in 2016 are the main catalyst for food deflation related to an oversupply of protein relative to demand. Eggs, also a source of protein, are priced 33.8% lower year-over-year. Grain prices are lower and that has resulted in modest deflation in cereals and bread products year-over-year. First Data’s SpendTrend Growth report based on point-of-sales indicates grocery store sales saw a 0.5% growth rate in December, considerably less than 3.5% rate predictions. Grocery store sales in 2016 rose just 1.5% compared with 3.2% in the prior year. ONLINE GROCERY GROWTH A recent report from NPD Group looked at the rise of online grocery which is a threat to grocers not already playing in this growing field. NPD’s survey found 52 million U.S. consumers are doing some of their grocery shopping online. The NPD report said about 20 million consumers (current, lapsed or new to online) plan to increase their virtual grocery shopping behaviors over the next six months. Walmart U.S has bet heavy in this area by expanding grocery pick-up services to more markets last year. Ravi Jariwala, corporate spokesman for Walmart.com, recently told Talk Business & Politics that customer response to the service continues to be strong. He said the service gets high customer satisfaction scores and high repeat user rates. “The strong customer response is one of the reason we’ve grown from 5 markets last year to more than 100 this year,” he said. NPD said even though online grocery shopping lags other e-commerce industries in terms of development, the fundamental shift of the country’s demographics is one reason behind greater adoption of grocery shopping online. The report said Millennials and Generation Z consumers who were born in the tech era gravitate to online grocery. Millennials who often appreciate global cuisine can find what they need online and they see grocery shopping, prep and eating as an experience rather just sustenance. NPD said more than 60% of consumers who shop for groceries online are completely satisfied by the experience, with just 6% neutral or dissatisfied. NPD said convenience is the top reason consumers like the online experience, but others cited delivery options and shipping deals, like Amazon Prime. “Food and beverage manufacturers should monitor the quickly changing landscape with respect to grocery delivery services and online retailers to ensure their products are part of the assortment where it matters,” said Darren Seifer, NPD food and beverage analyst. “Brick and mortar retailers also need to adjust to ensure they’re not losing out with younger tech savvy consumers. Now is the time to start developing e-commerce programs or to expand your current services. Whether a manufacturer or retailer, now is the time to act while shoppers are experimenting and there is significant growth on the horizon.” Comments comments Previous post Money Talk: Regional Federal Reserve Executive in Little Rock promoted Next post College tuition on the rise at most of Arkansas’ public universities Newsletter Sign up to get latest from TB&P in your inbox!

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 6  −   =  four Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Over 15 major U.S. companies laid off workers in 2016. For example, Macy's Inc. (NYSE: M) let 4,000 workers go last year. And Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) laid off 2,800. Unfortunately, this trend is likely to continue into 2017, thanks to declining sales, poor foot traffic in brick-and-mortar stores, and the increasing popularity of e-commerce. Here's a look at more U.S. companies letting large portions of their staff go in the coming months… U.S. Companies Laying Off Workers in 2017 Mass Layoffs in 2017 No. 1, Macy's Inc.: The iconic department store got rid of more than 5,000 jobs last year in an effort to save money and offset "disappointing" sales results, according to CNN Money in January 2016. One year later, the retailer is looking to repeat this move. Macy's announced it would be shutting down 68 stores and cutting 10,000 jobs in a press release on Jan. 4 in an effort to "streamline costs." Mark Cohen, a professor at Columbia Business School, told CNN Money on Jan. 4 that this is not the last time Macy's would make this type of announcement. "It's very hard for the folks involved obviously, but I would also say it's inevitable," Cohen said. "And there is definitely more to come." Mass Layoffs in 2017 No. 2, Sears Holdings Corp. (Nasdaq: SHLD): After reporting dismal sales earnings, Sears announced on Jan. 6 it expects to shutter 180 stores by April – 108 Kmart locations and 42 Sears stores. Holiday sales at Kmart and Sears stores in November and December were down by more than 12% from 2015 – fueling the need to cut costs, wrote CNBC. Apparently, the retail giant has seen these stores struggle for quite some time… "Many of these stores have struggled with their financial performance for years and we have kept them open to maintain local jobs and in the hopes that they would turn around," said the company in a statement on Jan. 4. While we don't know the exact number of jobs that will be lost as a result of these closures, we do know that the store closings reflect 10% of Sears and Kmart locations. Mass Layoffs in 2017 No. 3, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT): The "everyday low-price" store will be slashing over 1,000 jobs in January, as reported by USA Today on Jan. 11. "We are always looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively," Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt said in a statement. "Like any organization, we make decisions based upon what's best for our business and the customers we serve." Wal-Mart is struggling to compete with online rivals like Amazon.com Inc. (NYSE: AMZN) as consumer preference for convenience continues into 2017. According to a December report by Slice Intelligence, retailers are hard-pressed to keep up with the e-commerce giant. Amazon accounted for 30% of sales during the recent holiday season, while Wal-Mart only brought in 4.1%. Though some companies, like this next one, are taking steps to compete with retailers like Amazon, they're still making mass layoffs in the process… Mass Layoffs in 2017 No. 4, Lowe's Companies Inc. (NYSE: LOW): Lowe's announced on Jan. 13 it would be eliminating almost 3,000 positions in order to shift to a new store shopping model. Trending Now: Retail Companies on "Death Watch" for 2017 The new model will be implemented nationwide and is aimed at freeing up resources to boost face time with customers as the retailer adapts to evolving customer needs, as reported by CNBC on Jan. 13. CNBC also reported that the home-improvement company is planning to allocate 45% of its spending in 2017 to developing a new online shopping model in an effort to attract and retain customers. Mass Layoffs in 2017 No. 5, General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM): The car manufacturer told Fortune that it would be shutting down five of its plants in 2017 – eliminating some 1,300 jobs – primarily to cut oversupply of sedans, which have fallen out of favor among U.S. consumers. These cuts are in addition to the 2,000 workers GM announced would be let go in November 2016, also to take place in January. Mass Layoffs in 2017 No. 6, Pandora Media Inc. (NYSE: P): Even U.S. companies that deal entirely with e-commerce are struggling to cut costs. Today (Jan. 13) Pandora announced that it would be eliminating 7% of its workforce in a move to save nearly $40 million in operating costs. The music-streaming company had 2,219 employees as of Dec. 31, according to Benchmark Monitor. The Oakland-based media company blamed increased competition and lack of sales for the cuts, wrote Bloomberg on Jan. 13. Perhaps the most interesting facet about Pandora's massive cut is that company CEO Tim Westergren publicly viewed its workforce as no longer a priority. "With our strategy fully crystallized, new products launching, and promising momentum in the core business, we are prioritizing the highest-value opportunities and deprioritizing others," he wrote in a statement about the layoff to shareholders. Mass Layoffs in 2017 No. 7,  Fitbit Inc. (NYSE: FIT): The wearable fitness tracker company announced in a press release on Jan. 30 it would be slashing 6% of its workforce, or 110 employees, as part of a greater restructuring of the business. The corporate restructuring comes as a result of lower than expected demand for its products in mature markets like the United States, Yahoo reported on Jan. 30. "To address this reduction in growth and what we believe is a temporary slowdown and transition period, we are taking clear steps to reduce operating costs," James Park, chief executive of Fitbit, said in the release. Fitbit's stock plunged more than 13% after the news – from $7.22 down to just $6.28 a share.

After Trump had twitter-shamed Carrier and Boeing into making public concessions—one on jobs, the other on the price of Air Force One—automakers Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and Hyundai, technology companies Amazon, Sprint, and Softbank, pharmaceutical multinational Bayer, and retail giant Walmart all quickly announced plans to hire or invest in the United States. Many immediately got a tweet-on-the-back: “Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!” Trump tweeted in January. At the time, on these pages, I wondered out loud how many more companies will give Trump a honeymoon on jobs? ADVERTISEMENT It’s clear the honeymoon is over (if ever there was one). One of the most remarkable developments of this already remarkable period has been how quickly the CEOs of major U.S. companies have turned on Trump. The proximate cause was Trump’s executive order banning all refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States.   In response, Lyft donated $1 million to the ACLU, Airbnb offered free housing to refugees left in limbo, Starbucks defiantly pledged to hire 10,000 refugees, and 97 technology companies including Apple, eBay, Facebook, and Google filed an amicus brief against the executive order. Just a few weeks earlier, the CEOs of many of these same technology companies had joined then-President-elect Trump’s technology summit at Trump Tower. What has happened—and this is the underlying cause of many CEOs’ about-face—is the realization that business is political, that it cannot go into hiding, and that companies must increasingly take sides. In a thought-provoking article published last Friday, Andrew Sullivan writes that “[o]ne of the great achievements of free society in a stable democracy is that many people, for much of the time, need not think about politics at all.” Similarly, many American CEOs, especially the entrepreneurs powering Silicon Valley, have long felt they could choose to be apolitical, to avoid taking sides on contentious issues. “[B]ecause we live under the rule of law,” Sullivan continues, “we can afford to turn the news off at times.” If CEOs have quickly learned that they cannot turn off the news, that not thinking about politics is not an option, then the credit largely goes to business’ two most important stakeholders: its customers and its employees. Uber’s travel ban debacle powerfully illustrates the point. For CEO Travis Kalanick and his company, it seemed to make political sense to join Trump’s business advisory council. After all, the incoming administration might get to write the rules for autonomous cars on which Uber has so much riding. It may have also made business sense for Uber to drop surge pricing and try to get market share when the New York Taxi Workers Alliance announced its drivers would stop driving to John F. Kennedy Airport in solidarity with anti-Trump protesters there. But the strategy dramatically backfired when #DeleteUber began trending on Twitter. Nobody knows how many customers deleted the app or how much brand damage this unforced error inflicted, but we know the effects on Uber’s strategy: Kalanick resigned from Trump’s council, sought to reassure his employees that the company stood with its many immigrant drivers and progressive urban customers, and pledged financial and legal support for any Uber driver affected by the ban. And of course, Uber joined the amicus brief. Uber’s u-turn fueled already growing efforts to mobilize customers against companies that progressives see as political or business associates of Trump and his family. Nordstrom was the next big win for the “resistance movement” when the company announced plans to drop Ivanka Trump’s fashion line from its stores and website. The company maintains that sales of the younger Trump’s products had fallen dramatically during the campaign and that it had communicated the decision to Ivanka more than a month ago. But it is hard to explain Nordstrom’s public stance in recent days without the efforts of #grabyourwallet and similar platforms channeling progressive resistance to Trump into consumer boycotts. Even Tesla, long the darling of urban progressives, has seen customers take to Twitter to publicly announce they are canceling their orders because of Elon Musk’s membership in the same business council that Travis Kalanick was forced off of by the #DeleteUber backlash. You don’t need a crystal ball to predict that boycotts of Trump-affiliated businesses will continue. After all, they are working. Shannon Coulter, co-founder of #grabyourwallet tweeted on Feb. 10 that more than half of the 15 companies that have so far been dropped from the boycott list (for “complying” with Trump opponents’ demands) have done so in the past 10 days. As importantly, at least some boycotts are clearly getting under Trump’s skin: his Twitter blasting of Nordstrom not only sent shock waves through government ethics watchdogs, it also let the company’s share price soar. What does all of this mean? It means that companies have multiple stakeholders. Trump and the federal government more generally are a clear one. Indeed, for many companies, the administration is a very important stakeholder. But it is far from the only one. Equally important, and for many companies in fact more important, are their customers and employees. As much as even Silicon Valley CEOs might want to play nice with Trump at least for the time being—lower taxes, less regulation, and more infrastructure spending is a winning formula in most boardrooms—policies such as the immigration ban that are direct attacks on the diverse workplaces many of these CEOs have carefully nurtured, and the growing resistance to all things Trump among particularly affluent urban customers, are forcing more and more companies to take sides. As CEOs find themselves increasingly between a rock and a hard place, between Trump on the one hand side and other key stakeholders on the other, the days when business could choose not to think about politics—when turning off the news was seen as an option—are clearly over.

A Walmart employee matched the fraudulent gift cards to video of the transactions and alerted the Salem Police Department on January 25. Police arrested Greisis De La Paz Ochoa and Miguel Martinez Gonzales. Court records say they hit Walmart stores up and down I-65 from Salem to Corydon, Seymour to Scottsburg, and the Bashford Manor store in Louisville. U.S. Secret Service agents have joined the investigation, believing this same team may be tied to skimmers and stolen credit and debit card information throughout the region, including those recently reported in Greenville and Henryville. WSLM Radio (wslmradio.com) reports that SPD Major Detective Scott Ratts says that Gonzales committed the crimes "because he has kids in Cuba and needed the money." Police believe there was a team stealing anywhere from four thousand to seven thousand dollars a day. According to a probable cause affidavit, on or about December 30, 2017, Alisha Mills, general manager at the Salem Walmart, contacted the Salem Police Department to report that two Hispanic males and one Hispanic female used a stolen credit card to reload a Walmart gift cards through the Walmart self check-out. Mills advised that she could determine that the credit card number used to purchase the Walmart gift cards was stolen because the numbers had been flagged by the credit card companies as belonging to stolen cards and had received reports from victims stating their credit cards had been fraudulently used at the Salem Walmart. Mills was able to run the Walmart gift card numbers loaded at the Salem Walmart and determined using the Walmart electronic inventory system that the same cards had been reloaded at other Walmart stores including Corydon, Seymour, Scottsburg, and the Walmart at the Bashford Manor Mall in Kentucky. At the Bashford Manor Walmart, the gift cards were used to transfer money to a pre-paid credit card. Mills advised that Walmart security video confirmed that the same individuals returned to the Salem Walmart several times over the following few weeks conducting the same activity. On or about January 25, a Hispanic male and a Hispanic female entered the Walmart store, and employees recognized the male and female as individuals who had previously been in the store using stolen credit card data to purchase gift cards. Walmart security employees observed the female use stolen credit card data to purchase gift cards. Reports run later indicate that the Hispanic female used stolen credit card information to purchase $5.09 in physical items and transferred $60 to a gift card. The Hispanic female also ran an additional card number, but it was declined, so no purchase or transfer was made. Cameras indicated she then left the store and waited in a silver Lincoln sedan. The male proceeded to use stolen credit card data to make purchases and monetary transfers. The Hispanic male did the following: Charged $63.21 to a credit card number belonging to Christopher Welch. This charge involved the purchase of a t-shirt for $3.21 and $60 loaded to a Walmart gift card. Charged $61.34 to a credit card number belonging to Kevin McGill. $1.34 for a lemonade, and a $60 monetary transfer to a Walmart gift card. (fraud) Made eight attempted transactions on credit card numbers that were declined. During this activity, Walmart employees contacted the Salem Police Department. Ratts says he approached the Hispanic male and placed him into custody. At that time, he observed the silver Lincoln sedan speed away. Salem Police Department Detective, Ronnie Mays, later stopped the silver Lincoln sedan on State Road 56 in Salem. In a search incident to the arrest of the male, Ratts retrieved his wallet, which was full of Walmart gift cards. The Hispanic male was advised of his rights through an interpreter and arrested. The Hispanic Male had multiple identification cards with what appeared to be his photograph, but with different names. The Hispanic female presented an identification card she claimed was hers. The photograph on the identification card does not appear to be the Hispanic female we have in custody. All of which gives me probable cause to believe that the Hispanic female has committed one count of fraud, as level 6 felony, one count of attempted fraud, as Level 6 felony, and one count of corrupt business influence, a Level 5 Felony. The Hispanic male committed eight counts of attempted fraud, a level six felony, one count of fraud as a Level 6 Felony, and one count of corrupt business influence, a Level 5 Felony. Salem Police ran the electronic fingerprint check of both subjects and the male came back a positive ID to Miguel Martinez-Gonzalez from Cuba and the female was identified as Greisis De La Paz-Ocha from Cuba. A search of the vehicle she was driving revealed several cloned credit cards and several Walmart gift cards.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 68.69 +0.03 +0.04% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 842.70 +6.31 +0.75% Vendors contacted by Wal-Mart about the change told Reuters the store and online buying teams of the world's largest retailer currently operate independently. Wal-Mart has told some vendors it is seeking to make the buying process more efficient for itself and vendors, and improve coordination between its buying teams. It also wants to apply its bricks-and-mortar expertise in securing the lowest possible prices to its e-commerce business, according to the vendors, who spoke over the last few days. They declined to be identified for fear of disrupting business relations with Wal-Mart. The move is part of a broader push by Chief Executive Doug McMillon and new e-commerce chief Marc Lore to narrow the gap with Amazon and boost Wal-Mart's competitive standing in U.S. e-commerce. Lore, who joined Wal-Mart when it purchased the company he founded, Jet.com, last year, has been charged with revitalizing Wal-Mart's online business and has introduced changes such as free-two day shipping. The company has told vendors it plans to disclose the change at a meeting with suppliers later this week, the vendor sources said. Wal-Mart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez on Monday would say only that the company wants to create "a more efficient process that accelerates how we bring the full assortment of products in stores to Walmart.com." He did not elaborate. The company expects Walmart.com's buying team to focus on expanding the online assortment, Lopez said. Going forward, Wal-Mart's store buying team based at Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters will place combined store and Web orders with suppliers who sell on both platforms. Under the new system, an item available for sale in the store will also be approved for sale online, the sources added. "The way it operated until now was extremely inefficient for us and them," a large consumer goods supplier told Reuters. "For example, they would buy 5 million cases a year for stores and 500 cases (for) online and then make us go through a different buyer for online. It was a nuisance." Wal-Mart's buying team in San Bruno, California, will still deal with suppliers that make products that sell only on Walmart.com, the vendors said. Store suppliers who have items they sell exclusively online will also have to go through San Bruno, they added. The strategy is designed to leverage Wal-Mart's powerful Bentonville purchasing operation, where dozens of vendors have set up offices solely to facilitate sales to Wal-Mart. The move will also help Wal-Mart make items at its nearly 4,600 U.S. stores available online. Many store suppliers still do not sell online because of low sales volumes, the sources said. Wal-Mart has been trying to expand its online assortment. It grew from 8 million items at the start of 2016 to more than 20 million items at the end of last year. This compares with more than 300 million items available on Amazon. The joint buying operation is also designed to address the dichotomy in which suppliers who focused on demands from Wal-Mart's traditional store buyers paid less attention to their online counterparts. "It is hard to make their online buyers a priority. I would get to them when I had a chance," another large consumer products supplier said.

REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski 1/2 left right A customer pushes a shopping cart at a Walmart store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. November 23, 2016. REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski 2/2 By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) for the first time will combine its own buying for products sold at its stores with purchases it makes for its website, sources said, a significant move to stamp out duplicate efforts as it consolidates buying operations to better fight Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Vendors contacted by Wal-Mart about the change told Reuters the store and online buying teams of the world's largest retailer currently operate independently. Wal-Mart has told some vendors it is seeking to make the buying process more efficient for itself and vendors, and improve coordination between its buying teams. It also wants to apply its bricks-and-mortar expertise in securing the lowest possible prices to its e-commerce business, according to the vendors, who spoke over the last few days. They declined to be identified for fear of disrupting business relations with Wal-Mart. The move is part of a broader push by Chief Executive Doug McMillon and new e-commerce chief Marc Lore to narrow the gap with Amazon and boost Wal-Mart's competitive standing in U.S. e-commerce. Lore, who joined Wal-Mart when it purchased the company he founded, Jet.com, last year, has been charged with revitalizing Wal-Mart's online business and has introduced changes such as free-two day shipping. The company has told vendors it plans to disclose the change at a meeting with suppliers later this week, the vendor sources said. Wal-Mart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez on Monday would say only that the company wants to create "a more efficient process that accelerates how we bring the full assortment of products in stores to Walmart.com." He did not elaborate. The company expects Walmart.com's buying team to focus on expanding the online assortment, Lopez said. Going forward, Wal-Mart's store buying team based at Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters will place combined store and Web orders with suppliers who sell on both platforms. Under the new system, an item available for sale in the store will also be approved for sale online, the sources added. "The way it operated until now was extremely inefficient for us and them," a large consumer goods supplier told Reuters. "For example, they would buy 5 million cases a year for stores and 500 cases (for) online and then make us go through a different buyer for online. It was a nuisance." Wal-Mart's buying team in San Bruno, California, will still deal with suppliers that make products that sell only on Walmart.com, the vendors said. Store suppliers who have items they sell exclusively online will also have to go through San Bruno, they added. The strategy is designed to leverage Wal-Mart's powerful Bentonville purchasing operation, where dozens of vendors have set up offices solely to facilitate sales to Wal-Mart. The move will also help Wal-Mart make items at its nearly 4,600 U.S. stores available online. Many store suppliers still do not sell online because of low sales volumes, the sources said. Wal-Mart has been trying to expand its online assortment. It grew from 8 million items at the start of 2016 to more than 20 million items at the end of last year. This compares with more than 300 million items available on Amazon. The joint buying operation is also designed to address the dichotomy in which suppliers who focused on demands from Wal-Mart's traditional store buyers paid less attention to their online counterparts. "It is hard to make their online buyers a priority. I would get to them when I had a chance," another large consumer products supplier said.

 Amazon's $10 bras are a shot at Walmart and Target — not Victoria's Secret Eugene Kim Feb. 13, 2017, 2:24 PM 17,112 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook/Victoria's Secret Amazon's rumored plan to start selling its own $10 bras was seen as a play against Victoria's Secret, one of the leading companies in the market, which typically sells bras for around $40. But according to a note published by Morgan Stanley, Amazon's pricing strategy suggests it's actually going after big box retailers, like Walmart and Target — not Victoria's Secret — with its budget bras. The note points out Walmart and Target already sell low-price intimate apparel, and yet, Victoria's Secret continues to own roughly 27% of the market. That means the people who shop at Victoria's Secret are unlikely to be swayed by low prices, and find value in other things, like service and product quality. Instead, Amazon's strategy looks almost the same as what Walmart or Target are doing. "Given Walmart and Target's similar price points to Amazon's supposed $10 offering (Walmart $8-15, Target $10-20, vs. Victoria's Secret's ~$35) as well as a similar ‘no to little service’ model, we suspect these retailers are likely to be more negatively impacted than Victoria's Secret should Amazon persuade consumers to start buying intimates on its site," the note said. Given big box retailers account for roughly 50% of the US intimate apparel market, Amazon is certainly tapping into a huge market. But at the same time, Morgan Stanley notes, intimate apparel products have to meet stringent fit requirements, high quality standards, and multiple style needs (bras typically come in 5+ cup sizes, 4+ band sizes, and 5-10 difference colors), making it a tough category to win. Intimates is also the second least popular apparel category on Amazon, according to Morgan Stanley's survey, which suggests that it's an uphill battle to sell bras online: Morgan Stanley Get the latest Walmart stock price here.

When they ran out of paper towels to sop up the grease, Abbey suggested they hang the bacon strips like laundry and let the grease collect below. Together, dad and daughter fashioned T-shaped racks out of wooden dowels and bits of plastic hangers, and attached them to a pink plastic plate. It worked. At the time, Jon, a former heavy truck salesman who had invented an aerodynamic truck wheel cover that flopped, was facing bankruptcy. He saw the bacon cooker as a way out of his financial ditch, and he saw Abbey’s story as a great marketing tool. After researching microwave-safe plastic, he found a factory in St. Croix Falls, WI, that would make the dish, which they named Makin Bacon. Jon struck a deal with Armour to promote the dishes on its bacon packaging, selling them for $6.99 to customers who sent in proof of two purchases. The dishes cost $2 each to produce. Meantime, after reading the book Guerilla Marketing by Jay Levinson, Jon sent samples of the bacon dish along with Abbey’s picture to every human interest writer and producer he could track down. Abbey told her story to Oprah, David Letterman and Maury Povich and Parade magazine named it the best new food product of 1994. Late that year the Flecks struck a deal with Walmart, which has since sold more than 2.7 million Makin Bacons. © A young Abbey Fleck, co-founder of Makin Bacon. A young Abbey Fleck, co-founder of Makin Bacon. Still, the Flecks kept their ambitions modest. In 2010 Jon took another crack at designing an aerodynamic wheel cover and this time he was successful, striking a deal with trucking giant Schneider. In 2016, Makin Bacon grossed $800,000 while the wheel cover brought in $2.2 million. Today, the little company, A de F Ltd., is owned entirely by the Fleck family, and has no employees besides Jon, 53, who lives outside Minneapolis. Abbey, now 33, and her husband Jeff Benson, pitch in part-time from Los Angeles. In 25 years, the Flecks have raised the price of the plate only once, at Walmart’s insistence. “We thought, why rock the boat? Why get greedy?” says Abbey. Jon notes that the price of plastic has fallen over time. Today, the Flecks sell the plate for $4 and Walmart retails it for $9.97. Shortly after agreeing to sell the plate at Walmart, the Flecks began offering Makin Bacon on Amazon through a third-party seller who took care of getting the plates from the factory to Amazon’s warehouses. Customer satisfaction stayed strong. Makin Bacon’s Amazon ratings were consistently in the high 90s, says Abbey. Then last fall, its Amazon score started to slip and the Flecks got a disconcerting email from an unhappy customer. “They said our dish melted, but we knew that was impossible,” says Abbey. By Christmas, the email complaints about plates melting in microwaves had turned into “a barrage,” she says, as Makin Bacon’s Amazon rating plunged into the 60s and sales started to dry up. According to the Flecks and to Jeff Rosenfeld, a lawyer they hired in January, Makin Bacon is the victim of an attack by Chinese counterfeiters that the Flecks fear will wipe out their business. In addition to decimating their Amazon sales, which quickly fell by 50%, the Flecks say the fake plates are hurting them at Walmart because customers who buy melting plates on Amazon think Walmart is carrying the same defective product. “It’s really frustrating and scary,” says Abbey. She and Jon ordered several of the fakes from Amazon and were startled to find that they appeared identical to their own product, with packaging that included Abbey’s picture, Makin Bacon’s bar code, and the Flecks’ contact information. “It’s even stamped ‘made in America,’ which it’s not,” she says. Amazon spokesman Erik Farleigh, who handles media relations for the company’s third-party sales, declined to comment on the Flecks’ specific claims, instead emailing a 300-word statement. “Amazon has zero tolerance for counterfeit,” it says. “We remove suspected counterfeit items as soon as we become aware of them, and we suspend or block bad actors suspected of engaging in illegal behavior or infringing others’ intellectual property rights.” Rosenfeld, the Flecks’ lawyer, says that Amazon’s policy complies with U.S. trademark law, which requires Amazon to block a seller once it knows the vendor is offering counterfeit merchandise. Amazon has no legal obligation to police products offered by vendors in advance of sales. “The case law fairly vigorously shields the marketplace,” he says. In Makin Bacon’s case, however, he says Amazon agreed in early February that it would sell Makin Bacon plates only from four third-party sellers authorized by Makin Bacon. But Jon Fleck says counterfeiters know how to keep sales going. Instead of labeling the product Makin Bacon, they call it by another name like “Bacon Cooker Tray Rack.” It looks identical to Makin Bacon’s dish, down to a Makin Bacon label stamped into the white plastic. He and Rosenfeld notify Amazon each time they see a new fake offered on the site and Amazon has blocked dozens of sellers. That doesn’t deter the counterfeiters, who simply sign up as new third-party sellers. Jon uses a piece of $10-a-month subscription software called Visual Ping that scans the Amazon page of Makin Bacon’s main third-party seller and alerts him when the “compare with similar items” number ticks up, alerting him that a new fake has been posted. But the fakes are so numerous, he says, he can’t keep up. “It’s a glorified whack-a mole game that is extremely expensive for small business,” he says. In the last month he’s paid more than $15,000 in legal fees and he spends at least an hour a day researching fakes and reporting them to Amazon. “Policing this yourself is laughable,” he says. Amazon spokesman Fairleigh wouldn’t comment on several CNBC stories that have reported a sharp increase in counterfeit products offered on Amazon at a time when the site’s third-party seller business has grown to represent fully half of Amazon sales. “Jeff Bezos believes in an open marketplace,” says Fairleigh. “Amazon can’t possibly stock every item. It’s good for local business and the economy when other sellers have success on Amazon.” But it can be devastating to a small company like Makin Bacon when counterfeiters attack. “The credibility of our product has been so substantially undermined,” says Jon, “to the point where we may not have a business going forward.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Monday, February 13, 2017 by: Jude Henry Tags: food, health, Health Ranger, nutrition (Natural News) Walmart might be one of the last places that many people would expect to find wholesome organic food. But in certain locations, the standard “Welcome to Walmart” greeting can now be altered a bit to introduce guests to a healthy eating experience. That’s because Ray Allen, star NBA player for the Miami Heat, and his wife, Shannon, have founded Grown, the healthy fast food restaurant that is opening a location in the Orlando, Florida Walmart Supercenter. No longer is “fast food” only associated with mystery meat, trans fats, artificial colors, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and tons of grease. This follows the opening of the first Grown locations at the Miami Dolphins’ Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. The popular Orlando restaurant has 69 seats plus a drive thru designed with customers’ speed and convenience in mind. They serve a delectable variety of menu items that consist of certified organic, local, gluten-free food. This includes slow-roasted grass-fed brisket and Love Greens juice (a powerhouse combination of cucumber, apple, celery, pineapple, ginger, spinach, kale, and parsley). Other juices, along with smoothies, entrees, soups. and salads are on the menu all day. GMOs, hormones, sugar, and preservatives are not on the menu. Sharon, along with Todd Kiley, a chef from Boston, developed the menu. Customers can pick up food like they would do with typical fast food but without all the serious health risks associated with the greasy, toxin-laden choices. Ray and Sharon started Grown out of a difficult situation. Their son had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, and they were looking for healthy options that were also quick for busy families. There were unhealthy options at every turn, but this was just not an option for someone like their son. They showed great creativity and initiative in deciding to take matters into their own hands, rather than being passive and waiting around for someone else to open a healthy restaurant. High-volume seller has tremendous power and influence It might come as a surprise to many people when they discover that Walmart is actually the second-biggest seller of organic food in the United States. So it is already a place people go to pick up healthy food. What’s unique is that in addition to buying this type of food that they take home and prepare in their kitchens, shoppers can purchase ready-made food at Grown in the same way they would buy unhealthy fast food. Also, because Walmart is such a high-volume seller of food, they have the power to push down prices of organic, healthy food. This dramatically changes the food-buying climate for consumers and makes healthy eating more affordable. This is especially significant, given that many people say they would like to eat healthier and buy more organic food, but the high prices prevent them from doing so. More restaurants like this are needed Allen deserves kudos for promoting the same food that helps him excel on the basketball court. As discussed by The Health Ranger recently, other star athletes like Tom Brady fuel their high performance by following healthy diets consisting of bountiful organic food such as vegetables, superfoods, and healthy protein. Let’s hope the trend of opening healthy fast food restaurants takes hold and more locations of Grown open at additional Walmart stores and at other spots in various areas. For that matter, it would be great if other restaurants of this type develop throughout the United States. People are always looking for healthy options that are also convenient and affordable. Restaurants like Grown fill that need.

Many RILA member companies have corporate clean energy goals, and according to the survey, Alabama is the most difficult state in the country to meet those goals.  Alabama's cumulative score on the index was 1.82. The next-lowest score was a 13.60, given to both Idaho and Wyoming. Alaska scored a 15.56.  "Retailers are at the forefront of the growing trend to procure clean energy to power their operations," Adam Siegel, Senior Vice President of Research, Innovation and Sustainability at RILA said in a news release. "This index will help them focus on the states that are conducive to doing business. "We urge state governments to look hard at steps they can take to promote customer choice for renewable energy so that they can open the doors to new investments." The top-ranked state was Iowa, which got a 74.73. The Hawkeye State got more than 31 percent of its electricity from wind farms in 2015, and Iowa utilities continue to build more wind projects. One Iowa power company has pledged to get 100 percent of its power from renewable sources.  (Retail Industry Leaders Association)   Andrew Rector, a market analyst for technology firm Clean Edge and one of the lead contributors of the report, said the index weighted equally the policies in place in each state and the deployment of renewable projects in the state. Alabama ranks low compared to other states in terms of installed solar and wind capacity, and Rector said Alabama was missing several policy factors that can help grow solar and wind power. "They don't really hit on some of the things that we took into account, things like allowance of [power purchase agreements] for distributed generation, as well as leases or community renewables, or things like that," Rector said. "That's kind of where Alabama stands and why they ended up where they are in the rankings." Solar power purchase agreements or PPAs, allow third-party developers to pay for the upfront costs of a solar installation on a customer's property. The developer then receives payments from the customer for energy generated from the system, typically at a lower rate than the local utility would charge. The customer would also receive credits from the utility for excess electricity generated by the panels that was sold back to the grid. PPAs let the developers make the large upfront investments and make their money back over time, while saving the utility customer money immediately. The developers are usually responsible for the maintenance and performance of the system, making it much easier for the home or business owner. Alabama Power spokesman Michael Sznajderman said the company was not asked to participate in the survey, and that the authors did not account for all the programs the utility has in place concerning renewable energy and only awarded points for specific types of programs.  "Based on their selective criteria, we don't think we would ever score very high," Sznajderman said.  The utility has made deals with Walmart to build a 72 megawatt solar facility in Chambers County, and with the U.S. Army to build solar arrays at Anniston Army Depot and Fort Rucker.  "We do have customer choice for certain large commercial and industrial customers, who can choose to purchase their power from us or from rural electric cooperatives," Sznajderman said. "Also, we do have a green tariff and have a large customer on that tariff right now." The report identifies so-called green tariffs -- rate structures that allow certain customers to purchase all or part of their electricity from locally generated renewable sources -- as a key factor in allowing companies to meet their clean energy goals. Some customers prefer the green tariff option to purchasing renewable energy certificates, which may go to subsidize wind farms in Oklahoma, but don't necessarily encourage development of local renewable resources.  According to the World Resources Institute, five states now have green tariff policy framework in place, with three more debating the idea. New Mexico's green tariff policy was seen as a key in attracting a Facebook data center to the state last year. The report cites Alabama Power's deal with Walmart, but as a direct utility purchase rather than a green tariff, because it was a one-time deal and not a lasting framework that other companies can use to easily create similar projects.  "Generally, where they are offered, [green tariffs] are broadly available to large [commercial and industrial] customers, utilize a company's existing relationship with its utility, and offer predictability and replicability to customers," the report states.  Sznajderman also said the report seems to give credit to Northeastern states that have higher energy costs overall, making renewables more competitive, and that it favors net metering, which he said "more states are moving away from because it unfairly shifts costs for renewables to the broader customer base and can raise costs for customers." A spokesman for the Energy Institute of Alabama, a policy group created to examine energy issues in the state, said the group has not reviewed the report in detail, but EIA chairman Seth Hammett issued a brief statement by email on Alabama's last place finish.  "It certainly merits serious consideration," said Hammett, who previously served as Alabama Speaker of the House and as chief of staff for Gov. Robert Bentley. "But we always have to take into account the importance of cost and affordability to the consumer." Corey Tyree -- a senior policy analyst at EIA and director of energy and environment, analytics and strategic growth for Southern Research -- said cost is a significant factor in determining how much renewables are utilized in a state.  "Of the top 20 states in the report, 14 of those states have higher electricity prices than Alabama," Tyree said. "And another four of those states (IA, TX, OR, and OK) have relatively strong solar and/or wind resources available. "The desire of individual states to put policies in place that keep costs low for consumers by taking advantage of their local resources is admirable. Like those states, Alabama consumers should expect solar power generating capacity in our state to grow if prices continue to fall and consumer demand increases as suggested by the CCEPI report." Alabama clean energy group disappointed, not surprised at survey For Daniel Tait -- CEO of non-profit group Energy Alabama, which advocates for renewable energy policies within the state -- the index results were disappointing but not surprising.  "We already knew this in terms of Alabama's performance relative to most of the rest of the country, even the Southeast," Tait said. "The Southeast is lagging behind the rest of the country but we're like the worst of the worst." Tait said the state's lack of policies allowing third-party ownership of solar panels or solar leasing options hurts efforts at business development and recruiting. "We're just kind of standing in our way," he said. "If a company wants to go solar, for example, and participate in these types of projects, they have to work really, really hard here and they're just going to go to a state somewhere else where it's going to be a much easier pathway for them to make these types of investments." Alabama was one of just four states to receive zero points in the index for allowing PPAs, along with Florida, Arkansas, and Kentucky. PPAs have shown to be effective and popular in other states. Colorado began allowing PPAs in 2010 and by 2012, 75 percent of new residential solar installations were completed through a PPA. Texas gets almost 2 percent of its total electricity generation from PPA-funded wind farms, with deals involving Google, Dow Chemical, Mars, and Walmart. "These are the market mechanisms we need to have to encourage investment in Alabama," Tait said. "That's what it boils down to and we don't have any of them." Tait said that instituting policies to address third party solar ownership or leases were not subsidies, but simply would provide a framework for businesses to make deals that work for them.  "We're not asking for subsidies, we're not asking for some favorable benefit, but companies -- and individuals for that matter -- want the ability to choose something different," he said "If they decide to go down that route, they should be allowed to." Another factor identified by Rector and Tait as hurting Alabama's renewable capacity was the fixed fee for solar deployment charged by Alabama Power. The state's largest utility charges its residential and commercial customers a monthly fee of $5 per kilowatt based on the size of their solar array.  It is the highest such fixed fee cited in the report. Alabama Power has said the fee, called the capacity reservation charge, covers the costs incurred by the utility for having power available as back-up for those customers when their solar panels aren't producing.  Alabama Power has developed and is developing a number of large solar projects, including the Walmart project and projects at military bases. Sznajderman said the company has received and is reviewing proposals for "about 200" additional renewable energy projects. But each project must be individually negotiated with Alabama Power and then approved by the Alabama Public Service Commission, which has approved a handful of solar projects, often without a ringing endorsement of their benefits. The PSC voted to approve the solar projects at Alabama's Army bases amidst fears "that our vindictive, liberal president would probably try to punish Alabama," if they voted no, according to commissioner Chip Beeker. That vote took place in 2015 before Donald Trump succeeded Barack Obama as president.  Tait said a different policy environment would allow smaller entities to take advantage of renewable energy.   "The policies are written in such a way that if you are a company such as Walmart or Microsoft, someone of that magnitude, we'll make sure there's a way to do it, but only in that one specific circumstance," Tait said. "That means you have to go direct through the utility and sign a direct contract with the utility. "While that's a good idea, and that fits the needs for some customers, corporate buyers of renewable energy is a huge market, and we need more than one way to service that market." The index comes as solar energy sector continues to experience strong growth in jobs and emissions-free energy output throughout the rest of the country.  According to advocacy group The Solar Foundation's 2016 Solar Jobs Census, the solar industry now employs 260,000 people nationwide, more than twice the number employed in coal mining operations and roughly equal to the number working in natural gas extraction.  The report found the solar industry grew by 51,000 jobs in 2016, accounting for 2 percent of all job growth in the country that year.  Alabama ranked 49th of 51 in the Solar Foundation's list of per capita solar jobs by state (including Washington D.C.), ahead of only Alaska and Arkansas. *UPDATED at 11:27 a.m. with additional comments from the Energy Institute of Alabama.  About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

(KRQE) – An offensive joke, bordering on a hate crime appeared at an Alamogordo Walmart for families to see. A customer took big letters meant for decorating and turned them into a message of hate. Ericka Smith saw a one worded message as she was strolling through the aisle of the Walmart Super-center. “I went to the crafts section and I was looking at the letters there, and I just noticed that it spelled out the word,” she said. KRQE News reached out to the Alamogordo Walmart to see what was being done. They told us their lost prevention department is looking into the security footage to see if they can find out who is responsible. Alamogordo Police said Walmart never informed them of the possible hate crime and they didn’t know about it until we told them. “We don’t approve of it and we condemn anybody putting out that type of, what I construe as garbage out for people to see,” said Deputy Chief Roger Schoolcraft. People we spoke with today said they’re just as disgusted by the display of hate. “I don’t think that’s right at all. Not one bit,” said Clarence Gatan. “Seems to be a lot of race issues. It’s just sad that our kids have to see that stuff,” said Raul Padilla. As for Ericka Smith, she said she’s upset things like this still happen, and has one message for the person responsible. “There’s a lot of hate in the world right now, and you just don’t need to be spreading that kind of stuff right now, it just needs to be more positive,” she said. At this time Alamogordo Police are not investigating the case. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

By Jeremy Bowman On 2/12/17 at 3:10 PM Close Donald Trump Signs Executive Order To Build Mexico Border Wall This article originally appeared on the Motley Fool. When Donald Trump was elected president, stocks rose as investor optimism grew that a united Republican government could deliver pro-business reforms such as tax cuts and reductions in regulations. Win an iPhone 7 Sign up to our daily newsletter for your chance to win. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> However, in his first week in office, Trump pushed forward the idea of a 20 percent tariff on goods imported from Mexico. Protectionism is generally anathema to Wall Street and the big business community, but seems to be a core component to Trump's economic policy. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said recently that the president had discussed the border tax with Congressional allies and would soon put forth a proposal. However, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle attacked the move, and Spicer stepped back from the idea, saying it was just one of many ways the country could make Mexico pay for the border wall Trump wants to build. At this point, it's unclear if the tax will be implemented, but Trump seems intent on fulfilling many of his campaign promises, which seem to include a trade war with Mexico in the form of stricter border controls, import taxes, and pressure on American companies to not outsource jobs. People passes by a sign welcoming a Wal-Mart store in Monterrey, Mexico, August 10, 2016. Reuters Even if the tax does not get enacted, the news has already had an effect as Mexicans have begun boycotting American companies and products. Let's take a look at a few of the companies that could be most affected.  1. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.  The nation's largest Mexican food chain may not have a direct relationship with Mexico, but it's still affected by economic policies around Mexico in one definitive way. Our southern neighbor is our biggest exporter of fruits and vegetables, accounting for nearly half of the fresh produce we import. Among popular fruits and vegetables that are widely imported from Mexico are mangoes, tomatoes, and, of course, avocados. Mexico is the world's biggest producer and exporter of avocados, and the U.S. imports two-thirds of the trendy fruit consumed here, almost all of which comes from Mexico. Chipotle would be one of the businesses most affected by rising avocado prices, which are already high as demand has built for the fruit. The company does not break out components of its food costs, but it spends about a third of its revenue on food. While commodity prices for meat and dairy have mostly fallen recently, management has complained about rising avocado prices. In its preliminary earnings report, the company said avocado dented profits, and an import tax would likely do the same. Though it may only push up food costs by as much as 100 basis points, Chipotle needs all the help it can get at a time when it's still struggling to recover from the 2015 E. coli outbreak. 2. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  Outside the U.S., no country is more important to Wal-Mart than Mexico. About one-fifth of the company's stores are located south of the border, and Wal-Mart's imports rely on many products imported from Mexico. The company was the subject of bribery investigations in Mexico a few years ago, and seems to be a principal target of the boycott being pushed against some Mexican companies. With 2,379 stores, Wal-Mart is only the largest retail chain in Mexico, but animosity seemed to be building against it, as seen on  Twitter  under the hashtag #Adios WalMart.  Groceries also make up the majority of Wal-Mart's sales, and agricultural trade across the border is strong. Mexico would likely implement a border tax, testing Wal-Mart's North American supply chain and causing higher prices. 3. Constellation Brands Finally, the company that would most be affected by an import tariff is Constellation Brands, an alcohol distributor that owns the U.S. rights to distribute Corona and Modelo beers, which are made in Mexico. Constellation Brands fell about 4% after Spicer announced the import tax, and the issue attracted attention from even Senator Lindsey Graham.   Before the Trump administration made that announcement, Constellation CEO Rob Sands had already put a plan in place so that the company wouldn't have to raise prices if an import tax passed. It's planning on buying more of its supplies in the U.S., such as natural gas and packaging, helping to offset the costs of the import tax. The company has even considered moving some production back to the US.; those plans are critical now. Corona and other beers imported from Mexico have been a fast-growing segment for the company, and make up more than half of its revenue. If the tax passes, Constellation shares could take a big hit.

Some of the retail giant’s largest competitors ranked in the top three spots. Amazon, Wegmans and Publix led this year’s rankings, respectively. Bentonville-based Wal-Mart ranked just ahead of General Motors and just behind AT&T in a new poll from Harris. The survey used a reputation quotient that examines six different elements from social responsibility, products and services, vision and leadership, emotional appeal, workplace environment and financial performance. Retailers overall scored well in this year’s survey besides taking top three spots. Four other retailers ranked in the top 25: No. 14 Costco; No. 17 L.L. Bean; No. 19 Lowe’s; and No. 21 Kroger. Scores above 80 were deemed excellent in terms of corporate reputation. The top three rankings and Costco and L.L. Bean scored higher than 80. Apple ranked No. 5 overall as Walt Disney ranked No. 7 overall. Lowe’s and Kroger scored slightly below 80 and were deemed to have “very good” reputations. Other retailers deemed to have “very good” reputations included Hobby Hobby at No. 32, Whole Foods at No. 34, and Walgreen’s at No. 36. Following are retailers deemed to have a “good” corporate reputation better than Wal-Mart: No. 28 Aldi No. 39 Kohl’s No. 41 eBay No. 44 Home Depot No. 45 Nordstrom No. 46 Best Buy No. 51 Macy’s No. 52 CVS Health No. 57 JC Penney No. 58 Target No. 68 Dollar General Wal-Mart ranked among those with “fair” corporate reputations at No. 78, and slightly ahead of Family Dollar at No. 81. Only Sears, at No. 94, ranked in the “poor” reputation category among retailers. Aside from retailers, suppliers also were ranked. Johnson & Johnson, 3M, Coca-Cola and General Mills all garnered “excellent” ratings. Nestle, General Electric, Kellogg, Mondelez, Sony, Kraft-Heinz and Samsung all received the “very good” rating. PepsiCo, and Procter & Gamble each pulled a “good” rating. Just one supplier, Monsanto, landed in the bottom with a “poor” rating. The Harris Poll noted the reputation scores also are impacted by political values. For instance, the researchers said Republican respondents ranked Chick-fil-A and Hobby Lobby ahead of Amazon and Johnson & Johnson. While Democrats highly favored Target over other retailers. “As companies struggle with questions around how prominent their values should be and whether their leaders should ‘speak up’ on society’s issues, the reputation quotient confirms both the reward and the risk of such choices,” the report said.

Appearing physically in Shiawassee County court for the first time since the shooting, brothers Anthony Holloway and Otis Smith Jr. stood before Shiawassee District Judge Ward L. Clarkson on Tuesday, Feb. 14, requesting forensic psychiatric examinations. In a hearing lasting less than two minutes, Holloway's lawyer, Douglas Corwin, told the judge that Holloway, 23, reported "anxiety, suicidal ideation, and hearing voices" and had just been released from in-patient psychiatric care at Pivot in Grand Rapids. In an equally short subsequent hearing, Smith's lawyer, Gloria Santrucek, noted the 31-year-old's previous four-month stay at a Grand Rapids mental health facility and requested an exam for her client. The third defendant in the case, Erin Mongar, 34, also appeared before Clarkson, and agreed to delay her case in order to stand trial with Holloway and Smith.

(Dan Swartz) Hey isn’t that … legendary diva and pie peddler Patti LaBelle having a late lunch with friends Monday afternoon? LaBelle, who is in town for a Valentine’s Day concert at the Kennedy Center, was spotted at Bourbon Steak in Georgetown just before 4 p.m. by a tipster. The “On My Own” singer was dining with two friends but was more than gracious when our wide-eyed source greeted the 72-year-old LaBelle with a familiar, “Hey, Miss Patti!” LaBelle shook hands with our star-struck spy and even invited the fan to have a seat at the table. The two then chatted briefly about how the Grammy winner, who we last spotted on the Hill promoting her dessert line for Walmart, loves the District and doesn’t mind being recognized by fans. Also look out for the star at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. LaBelle told us in September that she planned to stop by the newly opened Smithsonian museum on her next visit to Washington. Before heading for the door about an hour later, our tipster tells us, LaBelle made sure to hug her new friend goodbye. “I gathered my face from the floor, finished my wine and floated out,” our source recalled. lifestyle reliable-source true Please provide a valid email address.

Peter Mehring, CEO of Zest Labs, one of the sustainability companies owned by Rogers-based EcoArk, has spent the past four years testing how its proprietary technology can raise the bar for freshness with supply chain transparency from growers through distribution and into a store. Mehring said the problem is the misconceptions around freshness which are made by the assumption of a “best use by date” which is assigned to the product. He said this date is a guess at best based on limited information. The missing component from the data is how the product might have been handled or treated in the supply chain. Zest Labs has worked with produce growers and suppliers for the past four years testing its ZIPR technology which acts as a measure for how the product has been handled and any impact that handling might have on the product’s freshness. He said the company is preparing to launch its technology at retail on a national scale in the coming months, though he would not say which retailers are looking at the product. The largest grocers in the country — Walmart U.S., Kroger and a H-E-B — have all made “fresh” a major initiative in recent years and they often speak of the positive impact fresh is having on their grocery businesses. The flip side of that is the huge amount of waste associated with trying to deliver fresh products to the consumer. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates $161 billion annually is lost in food waste. Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran has said reducing shrink and improving freshness for consumers is a major goal. The retailer lowered sight lines and revamped fresh produce centers in its stores last year. More staff were added to produce departments and each received training on how to handle the produce, rotate and recognize “fresh” based on consistency patterns. The industry admits only 70% of the products meet the consistency requirements, which creates a 30% loss rate. Mehring said consistency is the primary key used in identifying freshness. But he said indirect benefits such as water reduction, transportation, and cooling times may also have an impact on how long a product stays fresh once it gets to the retailer. The retailers don’t have complete visibility all the way back to the grower and worker who might have picked the produce. He said Zest Labs freshness metric known as the ZIPR code is based on the specific product type, growing location and harvest and processing conditions that enable improved freshness management decisions. Zest calculates a ZIPR code for each tracked pallet, using patented methodology and sensors, ensuring inventory and shipping decisions are based on actual freshness. Mehring said the technology makes use of Internet of Things (IoT) cloud-based software which can be pushed out to workers in the field on handheld devices or viewed on a laptop or desktop further up the supply chain. Through RFID and Bluetooth technology growers and suppliers using the software can tag an entire pallet of bagged lettuce or crates of strawberries and track freshness through the supply chain. Everything possibly affecting a crop of strawberries can be seen upstream in real time. The software can notify workers at the grower levels about a potential problem and offer solutions to mitigate any damage to the product’s freshness window. That means there is less waste upstream when the products reach retailers. U.S. testing of the product has shown that using Zest with the ZIPR code can reduce that waste by roughly half, and improve the customer experience, Mehring added. California growers have been using the technology to monitor their winter crops in Mexico. He said the company owner described the ZIPR technology as “turning on the light.” He said without the visibility of ZIPR it was like working in the dark, but now that they have complete view of the supply chain they can do a better job extending freshness. Mehring said if a certain batch of berries is handled differently and the fresh window is going to be shorter, they know up the chain to distribute that batch to retailers close by and reduce transportation time. Retailers like Wal-Mart use a scorecard system that looks at the history of the product, but that system isn’t really helping them detect freshness or expand freshness given that industry-wide wastes are still roughly 30%. Mehring said growers and suppliers testing ZIPR are finding it takes about two to three months to get comfortable with the system, and the cost is about 1 cent per item. He said companies using the technology are finding savings about 10 times over the cost. When asked about future plans, Mehring said Zest Labs has 65 patents for the technology and 12 others in process. He said it’s been four years in the making, being tested along the way, not just by produce growers but also dairy producers, restaurants, fish distributors and some retail. He expects to see the technology being used more this year and continues to look for those opportunities. Mehring, a former hardware exec at Apple, said during his work for the late Steve Jobs, Apple insisted on a 99% production yield from its manufacturing line. He said anything less meant people lost their jobs. But in food production a 70% yield has become acceptable. “We think Zest Labs ZIPR technology can increase that to 90% now, and that’s a big savings for everyone along the supply chain,” Mehring said.

Offices as Streaming Flourishes by Nicole Piper More stories by Nicole Piper February 14, 2017, 5:00 AM EST February 14, 2017, 11:25 AM EST Landlords benefit from convergence of entertainment and tech Media tenants occupy region’s most office space this decade “House of Cards” needs more room. Netflix Inc., the streaming service that’s home to the political drama, last month leased an entire five-story office building in Hollywood, less than three months after signing a decade-long deal for adjacent stages and production offices, bringing its total space in the Sunset Bronson Studios complex to more than 500,000 square feet (46,500 square meters) -- roughly the size of five Wal-Mart stores. Shared office space in Playa Vista. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg The surge in online television viewing is spurring a wave of big real estate deals, as companies such as Netflix, Amazon.com Inc. and Google snap up space to cope with increased production demands. The amount of office space the entertainment industry occupies in Los Angeles County has climbed to the most this decade, with media tenants in 25.5 million square feet, up 2.99 million square feet from five years earlier, according to brokerage CBRE Group Inc. The space the streaming companies lease has evolved from the small offices of a few years ago to the giant production facilities typically associated with traditional Hollywood studios. “The sort of boom around those marketplaces has been specific to the digital media and the entertainment world converging with the technology world,” said Victor Coleman, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based  Hudson Pacific Properties Inc., Netflix’s landlord at Sunset Bronson Studios. The surge in leasing by entertainment companies reaches from downtown L.A. and Hollywood to Playa Vista, once a stretch of marshland between Los Angeles International Airport and Venice that’s become known as “Silicon Beach” because of an influx of media companies and digital startups. Entertainment-industry growth has helped an office market hurt by a years-long exodus of traditional users of corporate space, including hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp., both of which moved to Virginia. Like Netflix, BuzzFeed Motion Pictures set up offices in Hollywood, while Amazon Studios is in Santa Monica and producers of original shows for Hulu’s service have used space at Culver City’s historic Culver Studios, where classics such as “Gone With the Wind” and “Citizen Kane” were filmed. Netflix’s expanded Southern California facilities will be spread across multiple buildings at Sunset Bronson Studios, former home of Warner Bros. Studios, where “The Jazz Singer,” the movie industry’s first “talkie,” was filmed in 1927. “What’s going on in L.A. now is very similar to what we saw many years ago, when the cable companies were growing rapidly,” said Jeff Pion, a vice chairman at Los Angeles-based CBRE. Rising demand for digital content, and the additional production that comes with it, mirrors the era when cable subscriptions climbed and new TV channels brought viewers more options, he said. Read More: A QuickTake on the Streaming Revolution Hollywood isn’t alone in offering historic facilities to new-media companies. Playa Vista -- where companies including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Facebook Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. now have space -- is on land that once was an airstrip for pilot and movie producer Howard Hughes, an allure not lost on its current tenants. A Story “Everyone wants to work where Howard Hughes was,” said Alison Girard, Brookfield Residential’s director of marketing for Playa Vista. “They want to come to a place with a story.” The ’Spruce Goose’ hangar under renovation. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Google was one of the first companies to migrate south from Silicon Valley in 2003, initially setting up shop in Santa Monica before moving to Venice Beach. In 2014, it acquired 12 acres (4.9 hectares) in Playa Vista, including the hangar where Hughes built his “Spruce Goose” airplane. Google’s YouTube unit also has about 41,000 square feet next door under a long-term lease. Last week, real estate developer Tishman Speyer announced that it leased more than 50,000 square feet of creative office space in Playa Vista to Loyola Marymount University for its School of Film and Television graduate programs. Oscar Nomination Demand for space is being bolstered by both commercial and critical successes for the streaming services. Netflix signed up a record 7.05 million new customers in the fourth quarter, topping analysts’ estimates for domestic and international growth to cap the company’s first year as a global online-TV service. Its show “House of Cards,” an Emmy nominee for outstanding drama series last year, returns for a fifth season in May. Amazon, meanwhile, last month made history by becoming the first online-video service to receive an Academy Awards best picture nomination, for “Manchester by the Sea,” which secured a total of six Oscar nominations. Entertainment companies have very different demands from those of older L.A. tenants like Hilton, Northrop and Occidental Petroleum Co., which moved to Houston in 2015. In Playa Vista, offices are spacious and relaxed, with young people in leggings and beanies working on their laptops while lounging on couches, sunk into beanbag chairs or perched on bar stools. Neon signs with inspirational phrases hang on the walls, while sliding doors link indoor dining rooms to outdoor patios strewn with hammocks and foliage. Employees’ dogs run from room to room. “Our mom and dads’ office space is not the office space we want to work in today,” said Brookfield’s Girard, adding that the style once favored mostly by technology and media companies is catching on with traditional office tenants. “Now banks and lawyers want creative space too.” YouTube Proximity Fullscreen Inc. offices. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Streaming service and content producer Fullscreen Inc. moved into its Playa Vista offices almost two years ago, and CEO George Strompolos said the open floor plan and modern amenities fostered the kind of creativity that drives the company’s business model. Proximity to YouTube and other similar companies was also a big draw. “We kind of liked the idea of what was brewing with the Silicon Beach community,” Strompolos said. “We like our neighbors, most of which are collaborators, some of which are competitors. It keeps it interesting.” Read More: Disney Dumps YouTube Star for Anti-Semitic Content Cheryl Idell, West Coast lead of marketing firm MindShare, which moved from Santa Monica to Playa Vista in June 2015, also said the open spaces allow for collaboration and a more relaxed environment. CBRE’s Pion predicted that older media companies such as CBS Corp. and 21st Century Fox Inc. will start to retool their offices to offer the type of amenities millennials have come to expect, and some companies have already taken steps in that direction. Cheryl Idell Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Warner Music Group leased a 257,000-square-foot renovated Ford auto plant in downtown L.A.’s trendy Arts District, and Viacom Inc. has consolidated its West Coast operations, which were scattered across the region, from Burbank to Santa Monica, into one central Hollywood office building leased from Kilroy Realty Corp. New Model “You’ve got all the existing studio companies, which is Sony, Fox, Disney and Warner Bros., and they’re not just going to say, ‘OK, we’re going to stick to the old model,’” said Coleman, the Hudson Pacific CEO, whose company had 42.2 percent of its tenants in the tech industry and 13.6 percent in entertainment last year. The expansion of streaming companies’ office space has coincided with L.A.’s efforts to attract more production. Last year, revised incentives were introduced, which led to 6.2 percent more shooting days than in 2015, while the number of feature films shot in L.A. jumped 12 percent, according to FilmL.A. Inc., the official film office for the city and county. New media, however, has used few tax incentives, with only Hulu’s “Citizen,” Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why” and Amazon’s “Good Girls Revolt,” which has been canceled, receiving subsidies last year, said Philip Sokoloski, a FilmL.A. spokesman. Casual Attire The convergence of entertainment and tech has created new outlets for production while also leading to greater use of office space. Technological advancements have scaled down the number of people required to work on sound stages and boosted demand for offices as employees move behind computers. Still, not all buildings are benefiting. Traditional office properties are still coping with high vacancies, with younger workers expecting the catered food, open floor plans and ultra-casual dress codes that are rare in towers home to accounting and law firms.

Sign Up David Simon, executive vice president of Southern California for Los Angeles-based Kilroy, Viacom’s landlord, said some traditional office buildings “can be transformed” for companies seeking looser, more creative space -- as long as landlords have “the right vision and the right capital.” In the meantime, media and tech tenants will continue to seek space in places like Hollywood and the Arts District as they seek to produce content in the entertainment capital of the world. “They’re all looking, and they’re all coming,” Hudson Pacific’s Coleman said. “We’re in a pretty strong wind tunnel and we’ve got it blowing behind us.” Watch Next: Netflix's Decade of Streaming Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) has tightened its grip on e-commerce over the past few years, and even now retailers are feeling the squeeze. The likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY) have suffered more than most, losing market share to this e-commerce giant. However, there has been one standout that hasn’t caved to Amazon yet, and its stock is in fact hitting new all-time highs. Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) has been an industry leader for some time, helping to pioneer a low-cost wholesale or bulk-buying model for everyday consumer goods. At the base level, it appears that this business model is working the best against Amazon’s fierce competition. The company reported its January sales numbers recently as well. Costco saw its comps rise 7%, posting a gain across the board. In terms of the breakdown, U.S. comps rose 6%, Canada comps rose 11% and Other international sales rose 4%. The firm intends to report its next upcoming earnings in the first week of March. With Costco shares hitting a new high in Monday’s trading session, a few analysts took this opportunity to weigh in on this wholesale giant. 24/7 collected some of the key highlights from these reports and included them below. Macquarie was one of the first analysts out of the gate with a Neutral rating. The firm actually commented at the very beginning of February: Costco January comparable-store sales posted strong results, crushing consensus estimates. Headline and core comps accelerated to 7% and 5%, respectively, as traffic growth strengthened to just over 4%, and are a welcome departure from the consistently sluggish U.S. core comps over the previous seven months but are not so quick to think this is the new run rate. Clear and known catalyst remain (windfall from the new Citi Visa credit card arrangement, potential membership fee increase) and are more than adequately reflected in the current valuation (well above 5- and 10-year averages). Cowen has an Outperform rating. The firm went on to call Costco an attractive defensive stock that continues to show great execution. Wells Fargo has just a Market Perform rating, but it commented early in February: Improvement across most categories, deflation less of a headwind. January strength was led by sequential improvement in hardlines and food categories. Food and sundries were up low-single digits, as deli and food improvement offset tobacco declines of -19% y/y. Hardlines sales were up +high-single digits (vs. +MSD in Dec.) while softlines category sales were +mid-single digits. Despite continued deflation, fresh foods were up mid-single digits led by stronger volumes in meat, produce and deli categories. Deflation remains across the business but was less of an overall headwind, primarily impacting food and electronics categories, while nuts, proteins and oils returned to inflation. … Costco  called out the Northeast, Midwest, and Texas as its stronger U.S. regions. Shares of Costco were trading at $171.84 on Monday, with a consensus analyst price target of $175.46 and a 52-week trading range of $138.57 to $172.49. Amazon shares were trading at $841.19. The 52-week range is $511.66 to $847.21, and the consensus price target is $926.38. Shares of Wal-Mart were last seen at $67.89, in a 52-week range of $62.35 to $75.19. The consensus analyst target is $74.04. Best Buy was trading at $44.26, with a consensus price target of $45.45 and a 52-week range of $28.02 to $49.40.

Lawsuit Claims Walmart’s Private Label Craft Beer Is “Wholesale Fiction” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Lawsuit Claims Walmart’s Private Label Craft Beer Is “Wholesale Fiction” February 13, 2017 3:54 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk beer goggles beer craft beer walmart lawsuits legal craft breweries It can be hard to tell if that craft beer on the grocery shelf comes from the vats of a small, independent brewer, or if it is the product of a commercial vat. That’s the crux of a new class-action seeking lawsuit that claims Walmart is deceiving consumers with its private label “craft” beer brands in an effort to inflate prices. A beer drinker’s lawsuit [PDF] filed in the Hamilton Count, OH court of Common Pleas claims that calling the beverages — made in collaboration with Trouble Brewing under the names Cat’s Away IPA, After Party Pale Ale, Round Midnight Belgian White, and Red Flag Amber — craft beer is a “wholesale fiction,” because they’re actually mass-produced. According to the complaint, Trouble Brewing “doesn’t really exist,” echoing a recent Washington Post article that pointed out the applicant listed on filings with the Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is ‘Winery Exchange Inc.’, which has since turned into WX Brands. “WX Brands ‘develops exclusive brands of wine, beer and spirits for retailers around the world’ according to its website,” the lawsuit notes. “But under the ‘brewery address’ section of the TTB filings, Genesee Brewing’s business office in Rochester, NY, is listed instead. Genesee is owed [sic] by another company that brews Costa Rican lager among other industrial brands. Upon information and belief, Genesee produces well over the prescribe amount that would be considered ‘small.’” The complaint also points to the Brewers Association definition of a craft brewer as “small, independent, and traditional,” and a business that produces less than six million barrels of beer annually; is less than 25% owned or controlled by a non-craft brewer; and that makes beer using only traditional or innovative brewing ingredients. Walmart’s line of beers “is a wholesale fiction created by the defendant … designed to deceive customers into purchasing the craft beer at a higher, inflated price,” the lawsuit claims. “Defendant stocks its craft beer next to other ‘craft beers’ for sale in its stores, rather than with other mass produced beers, such as Budweiser, Miller, or Coors products,” the complaint reads. “Again, by placing the craft beer on its shelves with other ‘craft beers’, defendant is further perpetuating the myth that it’s a craft beer.” The lead plaintiff is seeking to represent a class of Ohio residents who have bought the beer in question, as well as compensatory and punitive damages for violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, fraud, and unjust enrichment, and an injunction preventing further false and misleading advertisements regarding the beer.

Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next AURORA, Colo. – Police identified Monday two people they believe stole a car belonging to a Walmart employee who tried to stop the theft by leaping on her car’s hood. Police say the victim was using her keys to open boxes during her shift at an Aurora Walmart in January. The two suspects found the victim’s keys when she set them aside as she continued working, police said via a Facebook post. The victim rushed to the parking lot when she realized her keys were stolen. Police say she tried to stop the suspected thieves by jumping on the hood of her car as the couple attempted their getaway. She eventually jumped off and was not harmed. The suspects are also accused of using the victim’s credit cards that were inside the stolen car. The car was later retrieved. Aurora Police posted images of the suspects on its Facebook page in hopes of identifying them. The post was later updated with information that investigators know who the suspects are, but they are not releasing their names at this time. --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

The move from the company comes after the Walmart-owned retail giant introduced ready meals based on the firm's diet plan. Asda introduced its Slimzone range of 13 frozen meals and meat products last month, the Derby Telegraph reports. And the supermarket chain, which operates a huge store in Estover, claims the products are free to enjoy in terms of calorie intake when following the Slimming World Extra Easy eating plan. Slimming World has its own range of products in Iceland, though, and has now taken action to ask Asda to remove Slimming World trade marks from the range. The firm believes the supermarket is using them "unlawfully".

"We believe that Asda are unlawfully using our much loved and much respected name and trade marks on their meals (that's Slimming World, Extra Easy and Free), and are trading on the back of our brand's reputation, which we've built and nurtured over 47 years. "We've worked hard over the years to earn the trust and confidence of our Consultants, our members and the UK and Irish public – and maintaining that trust and confidence is at the heart of our decision. "At the same time, we have decided that we won't be adding the Slimzone products to our official nutrition database." Read next: Sickness and vomiting bug sweeps through primary school The statement adds: "We are unable to give an accurate value for them and by our calculations from the very limited information we've been able to obtain, a number of the meals could not be designated Free. "Although we asked Asda to let us have a more detailed breakdown of the ingredients used, they have not supplied those details and we have put on hold any decision about whether or not to include the meals in our official database. "We know that this news will be frustrating to some members and we are truly sorry for the disappointment it will cause. The situation is beyond our control. "The case is now in the hands of a judge and we won't be able to comment further on the meals themselves until we know the outcome of the case." Read next: Are you ready for the new car tax rules that are coming into force? When Asda launched the Slimzone range it said it had identified a gap in the market to "make it both easier and cheaper for customers who want to keep themselves on track with a controlled weight loss programme". It is selling the frozen ready meals and products for £2.50 each – 50p cheaper than Slimming World's own brand in Iceland. Asked for a response to Slimming World's legal action, an Asda spokeswoman said: "Our customers have told us that saving money and leading a healthy lifestyle is a priority and that is why we developed our Slimzone range for them. "We're confident in Slimzone and our customers seem to love it too. "We've shared a full list of ingredients for the Slimzone meals to help our customers make up their own minds."

More from Most Innovative Companies Why Chobani Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Why Related Companies Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Why The Home Depot Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Why Resy Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Claire Dodson 02.13.17 6:00 AM Target The idea of a massive store that looks the same in every region is a thing of the past, at least for Target. In its place is a highly curated version tailored for dense urban areas. "How do we keep our store experience relevant?" asks Mark Schindele, Target’s SVP of properties. "We customize, we evolve, and we understand our guests." In 2017, Target will roll out 28 new flexible-format stores, double the number it opened in 2016. The company’s first small-store effort, City Target, which launched in six locations in 2012, averaged about 100,000 square feet, still too big a footprint for major cities. The company faced a challenge: how to condense even more while providing customers with a total Target experience. Flex formats shrink the size to as little as 12,000 square feet and tailor merchandise to specific neighborhoods. They also dropped the special moniker: All Targets, regardless of the size or shape, would be known as Target. Target will roll out 28 new flexible-format stores in 2017.[Illustration: Laura Breiling] Manhattan got its first flex-format Target in October, in the Tribeca neighborhood, which has been flooded with stylish young families. The two-story outpost emphasizes apparel, toddler, and baby sections. (It’s also the only Target so far to include a Chobani yogurt café in place of the now-standard Starbucks.) Target, which once stood for consistency and endless choice, now wants to be adaptable, streamlined, and quick—the company can research a new site and have doors open within a year. "We look at what needs aren’t being met by a neighborhood," Schindele says. "And then we meet them." Milestones: Target recently hired former Walmart exec Shekar Natarajan to fill the new role of SVP of network planning and operational design. He is tasked with harnessing tech to speed up Target’s supply chain. Challenges: Walmart attempted a similar curated-retail experiment with its Express stores but couldn’t nail the formula. It closed 102 of its smaller format locations in 2016. Buzz: Positive Moleskine's celebrated Timepage calendar app will work in conjunction with a new physical planner set to be released in 2017.[Photo: Celine Grouard for Fast Company] Moleskine The success of Moleskine’s classic notebooks in a digital age has been compared to the resurgence of vinyl records or Polaroid cameras. But Moleskine knows that its future hinges on its ability to work in tandem with digital technology. A year ago, Moleskine released its Smart Writing Set, a pen and notebook that converts handwritten notes seamlessly from the page to an app. The company is now taking that idea a step further, leveraging its celebrated Timepage calendar app to work in conjunction with a new physical planner set to be released in 2017. Users can take a snapshot of the day’s to-dos, which the software will recognize and integrate with Timepage. Eventually, the tech could operate like the Smart Writing Set. "We don’t see analog and digital as antagonistic dimensions in the lives of real people," says CEO Arrigo Berni. To that end, Moleskine continues to ramp up its physical presence. In addition to opening 40 new retail stores by the end of 2018, the company is working on building out its Moleskine Cafés, which it built in Milan in 2016 and in the Geneva airport in 2015. Inspired by the café littéraires of the 17th century, these storefronts are part art gallery and part meeting space, and they also sell Moleskine products. In addition, Moleskine is expanding the company’s limited-edition notebook selection, which features characters from Hello Kitty, Harry Potter, Marvel and DC, Game of Thrones, Toy Story, and more. Moleskine, being Moleskine, manages to give them a chic spin. "There’s an emphasis on design and creativity with everything we do," Berni says. "As a brand, we stand for the possibility of expressing yourself in all different forms." Milestones: Belgian vehicle importer D’Ieteren acquired Moleskine in 2016, giving it a new valuation of almost $600 million. Challenges: The brand will have to preserve its creative cachet as it grows so that it doesn’t lose its cult following—as when Starbucks lost the coffee diehards. Buzz: Positive Nokia Milestones: The Nokia brand is returning to phones after being licensed to HMD Global. The $26 Nokia 150 has a monthlong battery and doesn’t look too far off from the Nokia you loved in the mid-aughts. Challenges: Nokia/HMD is entering into an especially crowded Android marketplace, where many companies don’t ever reach profitability. In addition, the Google Play Store is currently not available in China, which is the new Nokia 6 smartphone’s first market. Buzz: Negative Nestlé Milestones: Scientists at Nestlé figured out how to cut sugar in choc-olate by 40%, by making it dissolve quicker to trick the taste buds. Products will roll out in 2018, with gradually reduced sugar so consumers don’t no­­tice a difference. Challenges: Eighty-three percent of Nestlé’s revenue comes from its slow-growing food and beverage divisions, compared to rival Unilever’s 43% in those sectors. Buzz: Positive First Solar Milestones: The solar energy systems maker is accelerating production of its cost-efficient Series 6 module by a year (it will begin in 2018) and scrapping a planned Series 5 edition. Challenges: The move is part of a restructuring that laid off more than 25% of its workforce in an effort to better compete in an overstocked market and recoup lost profits. Buzz: Neutral Blippar Milestones: Augmented-reality pioneer Blippar has added real-time recognition to its app, letting users scan more than 70,000 faces and pull up related info. It’s like Shazam for public figures. Challenges: Blippar must contend with heightened competition from open-AR apps like Vuforia Studio Enterprise, which simplifies AR for businesses. Buzz: Positive Zaha Hadid Architects is set to build the world’s first all-wood stadium.[Photo: courtesy of MIR] Zaha Hadid Architects Milestones: The London-based architecture firm is set to build the world’s first all-wood stadium for the Forest Green Rovers soccer team in Stroud, England. The sustainable structure will have the lowest amount of embodied carbon of any stadium worldwide. Challenges: Principal Patrik Schumacher recently came under fire for calling for the privatization of public spaces. The firm condemned the remarks, saying they were not consistent with the late Zaha Hadid’s way of thinking. Buzz: Negative Boeing Milestones: Boeing has reorganized its military and commercial support into a new unit, Boeing Global Services, and has hired former GE Aviation exec Kevin McAllister to lead its commercial airline business. Challenges: In December, Donald Trump tweeted that the order for Boeing’s new Air Force One should be canceled due to what he claimed was a $4 billion cost, causing its stock to slip 1.6%. Buzz: Neutral McDonald’s Milestones: McDonald’s is selling its operations in China to state-owned Citic. The move allows McDonald’s to reap franchise fees while Citic uses its expertise to better target Chinese customers. Challenges: The cost of labor is going up, and the chain’s revenue is still struggling to recover after drops in 2014 and 2015. It’s hard to keep McDonald’s franchisees happy when innovations like new digital kiosks come with a price tag of nearly $60,000 apiece. Buzz: Neutral Rent the Runway Milestones: In December, the clothing rental company raised a $60 million round of funding and became profitable with $100 million in 2016 revenue. It also launched its first flagship store in New York: 5,000 square feet with personal stylists and store associates who tap into user data to personalize the shopping experience. Challenges: Rent the Runway has partnered with Neiman Marcus to open RTR boutiques inside its department stores, which could be risky with Neiman Marcus’s recent revenue struggles, down 4.1% in 2016’s fourth quarter.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Walmart released a statement about the incident Monday. "Keeping our customers and associates safe is among our top priorities, and this weekend’s incident had nothing to do with our store. Since this is an ongoing investigation, we must refer all questions to local law enforcement." Police believe someone opened fire in the parking lot. Police are reviewing security camera footage from Walmart, as they continue to investigate exactly what happened, and why. At this time they believe two or more people were involved in the shooting after an altercation. Police say they also responded to the 2200 block of Memorial Parkway, just a mile down the road from the Walmart where they found a gun shot victim. Police tell WHNT News 19 the gun shot victim was at Walmart and involved in the altercation. Right now police are still investigating, and currently have no suspects in custody. Since multiple parts of the parking lot are blocked off by crime scene tape people aren't allowed to leave. Their cars are blocked off. pic.twitter.com/6PsJo3bblu — Aaron Cantrell (@AaronTheNewsGuy) February 12, 2017 Witness tells me she was walking into Walmart and heard gun shots in the parking lot.

Senate Republicans lining up against border tax politics | Feb 15, 2017 | By Martin Barillas Republican Tom Cotton of Arkansas went to the Senate floor today to say he has "grave concerns" about the GOP’s plan to border-adjust corporate taxes. He played it as a tax increase on shoppers at Walmart, which has expressed opposition to the proposal and that happens to be headquartered in Arkansas.    In his prepared remarks, Cotton said that he will not judge the proposal until he actually sees the bill. So far, that means that at least two Senate Republicans are opposed to the border adjustment. The other is Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), who has tried to bring together other critics of the proposals. He is a former CEO of the Dollar General retail chain. The Koch brothers are reportedly opposed to it as well.   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) is tagged with bringing about tax reform in the upper chamber and can lose but only two votes of the GOP caucus at most if the legislation is passed along party lines.   The Republican proposal would tax imported goods as part of cutting corporate tax rates, based on where the goods are sold. If passed, businesses would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of imported goods and services, but would no longer pay any taxes on revenues from exports.  Currently, American businesses are taxed on all profits, whether they are earned domestically or in foreign countries. House Republicans claim that the measure would mean job growth through increased manufacturing in the US while discouraging companies from taking production off-shore.   Other Republicans opposed to border-adjustment are:   Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, where the Home Depot has its headquarters;   North Carolina Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis. North Carolina is home to Lowe's hardware and home improvement stores;   Senator Mike Lee of Utah;   Senator John Cornyn of Texas is concerned about border adjustment's effect on gasoline prices.   While White House aide Steve Bannon is known to favor the proposal, it remains to be seen whether President Trump will support it. House Republicans are backing in nationalist terms, which rings consonant with Trump's campaign themes.    Cotton said “border-adjustment” had a ring of George Orwell’s “1984” novel. He said that the measure would hike taxes for "working Americans who've been struggling for decades while the rich keep getting richer."   "Why would we make their stuff at Walmart more expensive?" he asked. Advocates of the bill said that the US dollar would increase in value and leave importers in good stead. Cotton was not buying it. He said, "This is a theory wrapped in speculation inside a guess."   Retail industry executives met with President Trump today to express opposition to the measure. They believe the economy would be hurt if their costs increase under an overhaul of the tax code. Company execs came from a number of companies, including AutoZone, Tractor Supply, Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores, Target, Best Buy, Gap and JCPenney.   The National Retail Federation asserts that the measure, crafted by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), is risky and unproven. They believe that importers would receive no benefit from the proposal.   There is an estimate that the would raise about $1 trillion in tax revenue and work towards lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, though most estimates indicate that it would not cover all the revenue lost. Retailers have formed a group called Americans for Affordable Products. Some of them met with Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), who chairs the Ways and Means committee that will turn the plan into a bill.  SHARE THIS READ NEXT Nazi submarine with entombed crew found off North Carolina Read More politics donald trump business walmart us republican tax import china retail SHARE Short Link   Print Martin Barillas is a former US diplomat and the editor of Spero News.

Marquez, a 25-year-old Riverside resident, has agreed to a deal that could imprison him for the statutory maximum sentence of 25 years to life in federal prison and a $500,000 fine, a news release said. Marquez is scheduled to plead guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court in Riverside to conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and making a false statement in connection with the acquisition of firearms. He originally pleaded not guilty to additional charges involving to a fake-marriage scheme that was designed to help a Russian citizen related to Farook remain in the U.S. after long overstaying her visa. Those charges will be dropped at sentencing, according to the plea deal. Marquez’s trial had been set for Sept. 26. Marquez has not been charged with directly participating in the Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino attack, and federal authorities say Marquez had no advanced knowledge of the shooting. That morning, Farook, 28, and wife Tashfeen Malik, 29, opened fire in a conference room at the Inland Regional Center, where Farook’s San Bernardino County Division of Environmental Health Services co-workers were enjoying a holiday party. The couple killed 14 people and wounded 22 others. Police killed them in a gunbattle hours later. The material support to terrorists involved the purchase of weapons and explosives for planned attacks in 2011 and 2012 that went unused until the San Bernardino attack. Over 2011 and 2012, Marquez purchased a Smith and Wesson M&P-15 Sport rifle and a DPMS model A-15 rifle for Farook, according to the Department of Justice’s affidavit written in support of the criminal complaint against Marquez. Each rifle cost approximately $750. According to the affidavit, Marquez told investigators that he agreed to purchase the weapons because “his appearance was Caucasian, while Farook looked Middle-Eastern.” Farook was born in Illinois. Marquez is a U.S. citizen. Marquez also purchased explosive material ultimately used to construct a pipe bomb found at the IRC. The day after the San Bernardino attack, Marquez called 911 and told the operator, "My neighbor. He did the San Bernardino shooting. ... The (expletive) used my gun in the shooting," according to a transcript of the call contained in the FBI affidavit. Marquez then checked himself into a mental health facility. The FBI eventually arrested Marquez and questioned him for 10 days, during which, the affidavit said, Marquez admitted his role in the Riverside plots. NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBORS Marquez met Farook when Marquez’s family moved in next door in Riverside in 2005. Both attended La Sierra High, a few years apart. The two shared interests in cars and guns. Marquez had worked since 2012 as a doorman at Morgan's Tavern in Riverside, getting around by bicycle, but his California security guard license expired in 2014. Marquez worked as a guard at the Wal-Mart on McKinley Avenue in Corona for about two months, until about the time of the attack. Riverside musician Crystal Carrera in 2015 said she knew Marquez from Morgan’s, where she once worked security. On nights when she performed, Marquez would fill in for her at the door and took over the job when she left. Carrera was shocked to see his picture on TV. "I thought it was a joke," she said.

Marquez, a 25-year-old Riverside resident, has agreed to a deal that could imprison him for the maximum sentence of 25 years to life in federal prison and a $500,000 fine, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said Tuesday. Attack survivor Hal Houser said Tuesday he’d be “perfectly content” with Marquez serving 25 years to life in federal prison. “He really sounds almost like a dupe,” Houser said. “But what he did was horrible, even if he was just doing it to be popular.” Houser, a lead environmental health specialist with San Bernardino County, said he and other survivors hope Marquez’s plea agreement will lead to the release of all the information found by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office during the investigation. “We’d like to know: What did they find out? Was Syed pissed about having to go to the Christmas party? Was he mad at his boss?” Houser said. Marquez is scheduled to plead guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court in Riverside to conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and making a false statement in connection with the acquisition of firearms. He is in custody in Los Angeles. Marquez originally pleaded not guilty to additional charges involving to a fake-marriage scheme designed to help Farook’s Russian sister-in-law remain in the U.S. after long overstaying her visa. Those charges will be dropped at sentencing, according to the plea deal. Marquez’s trial had been set for Sept. 26. He has not been charged with directly participating in the Dec. 2, 2015, San Bernardino attack, and federal authorities say he didn’t know of the shooting beforehand. That morning, Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27, opened fire in a conference room at the Inland Regional Center, where Farook’s San Bernardino County Division of Environmental Health Services co-workers were enjoying a holiday party. The couple killed 14 people and wounded 22 others. Police killed them in a gunbattle hours later.

Next-door neighbors Marquez met Farook when Marquez’s family moved in next door in Riverside in 2005. Both attended La Sierra High School, a few years apart. The two shared interests in cars and guns. Marquez had worked since 2012 as a doorman at Morgan’s Tavern in Riverside, getting around by bicycle, but his California security guard license expired in 2014.

On nights when she performed, Marquez would fill in for her at the door, and he took over the job when she left. Carrera was shocked to see a picture of Marquez on television. “I thought it was a joke,” she said. “I keep trying to wrap my mind around it.” Tavern owner Jerry Morgan in 2015 called Marquez a cheery, efficient, “easygoing” doorman who was honest and never caused problems. Marquez struck Morgan as the sort of kid who “didn’t belong anywhere,” and the owner said he tried to make him feel welcome. When Morgan and his wife learned of Marquez’s alleged involvement in a terrorist plot, he balked. “ ‘Enrique?’ ” Morgan recalls telling her. “ ‘That guy couldn’t fight his way out of a paper bag.’ ” After Morgan learned of Marquez’s plea Tuesday, he said he believes Marquez “just went along with Farook.” “The kid was not a professional terrorist or jihadist. He’s just a dummy who got hooked up in a lot of (trouble) that he had no business being hooked up in,” Morgan said. Shocking revelation Jared Rork reacted with horror Tuesday after learning for the first time that his former neighbors Farook and Marquez had conspired in 2011 and 2012 to attack Riverside City College and the 91 Freeway. “Oh my God. That’s insane,” said Rork, who attended RCC, like Marquez. “To attack that many innocent people and try to destroy something that does good for so many — he needs to serve his time,” Rork said. “That’s just insanity to hurt that many people.” Rork was their neighbor on Tomlinson Avenue in Riverside. He often saw them working late at night in Marquez’s garage. On Tuesday, he remembered telling his wife, long before the Dec. 2 attack, about seeing the flickering light of welding torches inside the garage and wondering if Marquez and Farook were making bombs. At the time, his wife said he was being prejudiced. After the shooting in San Bernardino, Rork told a police officer what he’d seen. Student becomes teacher Marquez was raised a Catholic, but Farook soon converted him to Islam, according to the affidavit. Several years later, Marquez began listening to lectures from terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki. In 2011, the affidavit said, Farook provided more radical Islamic material to Marquez. The pair began planning attacks on Riverside City College and on motorists on the 91 Freeway, the affidavit said. And as part of those plans, the affidavit said Marquez told federal investigators that he was now teaching Farook: In this case, how to build bombs and detonate them by using the filament from a Christmas lightbulb to create a spark. Their plans were halted in 2012 when FBI agents coincidentally arrested a group of Inland men who planned to join al-Qaida overseas and attack American service personnel there, according to an FBI affidavit filed in federal court.

Still Have Room to Run? A listener writes in asking about the equipment manufacturer. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Feb 14, 2017 at 5:11PM In this video from the Market Foolery show, Chris Hill, Taylor Muckerman, and Jason Moser take a closer look at Cummins (NYSE:CMI) after getting a question from a loyal listener. The company manufactures engines, generators, and filtration systems. After a year of cutting costs and increasing efficiency, its share price has soared. But right now, it's looking a bit overvalued, and its operating markets are fairly soft. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Jan. 30, 2017. Chris Hill: Todd Whitcomb in Utah, "I am attempting to value Cummins Incorporated and I was curious to get your expert opinion. Thanks. Love the Show." Taylor, Cummins for those unfamiliar, this is a heavy equipment maker. Engines, power generation, turbo technologies, big stuff. Taylor Muckerman: Yeah, we're talking 15 liter, 12 liter engines. A company that has had a good run. We talked right before the show. It is up about 60% over the last year. That makes me wonder if the valuation might be a little to rich. If you look at some of the metrics that it is trading at, like a price to earnings, just north 21 times. The five year average has been right around 15. The price to book, not as bad, right around 3.5 times. Price to book historically over the last five years around 3.2. You are looking at a lot of these areas where this company does business: mining . . . its mining business is down about 45% from its all-time high. Its marine business is down about 40%. Oil and gas is still down 80%. There is some upside there, but they're not expecting the bottom to flatten until at least the middle of 2017, maybe even later into the year. You might be able to get a better price, especially because we have seen this run up, when results really haven't caught up to that share price performance. Hill: I was going to say, that's surprising to hear you tic off the various percentages of how their business units have fallen. I can see a six . . . I mean this is a $25 billion company. I could see a 60% run up like that if they were flat out crushing it. Muckerman: They're not. Hill: They're not. Muckerman: In the U.S., revenues are still falling. They are looking at China to be a stronger segment, because obviously heavy machinery companies, you're not going to succeed on a global basis unless China is helping you out. So they do have a favorable outlook for China, more near-term than North America. The balance sheet is there, they have some time to wait it out, maybe some M&A on the technology side. If not, you could certainly see some share buybacks or an increase in the dividend as a likely possibility. There is some upside there, in term of where it is at now, I don't have a price target or anything like that. It does appear a little richly valued based on the last five years worth of multiples. Hill: So this is one of those companies we get questions about from time to time and the name pops up, in part because it is one of those spaces that I think certainly over the last few years when you think of Caterpillar and sort of the ups and downs that Caterpillar has gone through. This type of industry becomes more interesting to watch. It is not the sexiest industry in the world. Muckerman: Right. Hill: But it becomes more interesting. Muckerman: One thing that you will look at with these cyclical industries that rely on oil and gas and commodities. If the price to earnings, or the pork value is a little high, maybe it is because earnings have been depressed, so it might be toward the bottom of the cycle. You always want to look a little deeper than just these multiples. If you look at enterprise value to revenue, the spread between its five year average and where it is at right now isn't necessarily as high those other two that I mentioned. You really want to dive in a little bit closer, because earnings could be depressed based on cyclicality. Hill: So I looked up the origins of this company. Started by a man named Clessie Lyle Cummins. Clessie, there is a name that I've never heard in my life before. Muckerman: Bring it back. Hill: Grew up in rural Indiana. Never had formal education past the eighth grade. Is just one of those people that just makes you shake your head in wonder at what he is able to do once he starts working and innovating. He was awarded 33 patents for his various inventions. Set five world records for endurance and speed for trucks, buses and race cars. Really amazing. I love stories like that. There are the people that are highly educated and do amazing things, and there are people who have the brains, don't get the formal education and do them anyway. Muckerman: Roll their sleeves up and get it done. Jason Moser: Yeah, and you hear about that stuff and you think about financial implications there and how much money ends up making and yada, yada, yada. It is natural to think about, wow, it would be so great to make all of that kind of money. Those are the people that just do it, because they love it. That is just what they love doing. For them, the money is like one of those things that just comes from building really great products and ideas. Muckerman: Really fast cars apparently. Hill: Yeah. Muckerman: Or trucks and buses.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) vastly increased its stake in Apple (AAPL) in the fourth quarter while slashing its positions in Wal-Mart (WMT) and Verizon (VZ), according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Berkshire boosted its stake in the iPhone maker to 57.4 million shares, up from 15.2 million in the prior quarter. Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital also increased its stake in Apple by 11% to more than 5.8 million shares. After long steering clear of the industry, Buffett also continued to load up on shares of airlines, adding 23.8 million to his American Airlines (AAL) stake, 53.7 million to Delta Air Lines (DAL) and 24.4 million to United Airlines (UAL) as well as taking a new, 43.2 million-share stake in Southwest Airlines (LUV). He cut all but 928 shares worth of his stake in Verizon, and cut his stake in Wal-Mart from about 15 million shares to around 1.4 million shares. Apple is the top performing stock on the Dow Jones industrial average in 2017. Verizon is the Dow's worst performer in 2017 and over the last six months. Wal-Mart is the second worst-performer on the Dow in the past six months. Apple edged up 0.2% late, after setting a new all-time high in the stock market today. Shares dipped in Q4 but jumped early this month as strong iPhone sales last quarter eased some concerns about waning demand. American climbed 2.3% after hours, United rose 1.7%, Delta gained 1.9% and Southwest added 1.5%. Verizon dipped 0.2%, and Wal-Mart lost 0.1%. Berkshire's B shares were up 0.1% late, after closing up 0.7% at 166.95, near a buy point of 167.35. Berkshire also took a new, 8 million-share stake in agricultural giant Monsanto (MON), which is being bought by Bayer, and a new 167 million-share stake in Sirius XM (SIRI). Sirius jumped 3% after the bell, while Monsanto added 0.9%. Buffett dissolved his stake in Deere (DE), which has struggled as the impact of low crop prices filters through to farmers' spending on equipment. Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble (PG) climbed 2.9% on news that activist investor Trian had taken a stake of more than $3 billion in the consumer-care products giant. Procter & Gamble has been a middling Dow performer in 2017 as the company slashes costs and focuses on core brands. RELATED: What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?

As a result of Judge Lisa Walsh’s order, Peter Ehrlich and Grant Stern have been barred from taking seats 4 and 5 on the board of supervisors of the Midtown Miami Community Development District, a special taxing agency created under state law to finance and oversee public areas in the popular shopping complex. Ehrlich won his race against Angelo Masarin by 86 votes; Stern beat John Sherry by 53. But neither man lived in the district at the time they qualified to make the November ballot, during the election, nor on the day they were to be sworn in. Retail firm and district member DDR Miami Avenue, LLC noted as much in a December lawsuit that kept the two men from assuming their posts on the district’s governing board. Stern, whose candidacy was at least in part about working with the board to challenge a controversial Midtown Walmart superstore planned within the district, argued in court that DDR — which sold Walmart its property — filed its suit in order to intimidate him. But on Jan. 31, Walsh granted the retailer a permanent injunction. She said that DDR would be damaged should Stern and Ehrlich be allowed to take office given their lack of residency, and prohibited the board from swearing in the two men in the future. “The legislature has made a rational decision to limit membership on the board to people who live in the district which the board serves,” Walsh wrote. “This ensures that the people making decisions are the ones who will be affected by those decisions.” Beyond blocking the two victors from taking office, Walsh’s order did not include direction on how the district’s board should proceed. Attempts to reach district director Craig Wrathell at his office and by email Tuesday afternoon were unsuccessful.

The MMQB with Peter King Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017 MMQB VideoPodcastsColumnsOur TeamYour TeamArchive Search Close Facebook Twitter Instagram Google+ Sports Illustrated Close Open FieldThe Longshot: Alton Voss Open Field Tue Feb. 14, 2017 The Longshot: Alton Voss Voss, a 28-year-old former drug addict, is now a sack master drawing interest from the NFL. Not all paths to the draft are linear  by Emily Kaplan Alton Voss was a quarterback at the University of South Florida, a three-star recruit from nearby Gulf High. Redshirting as a freshman, he didn’t like the separation of scout team and starters. He attended lifts and study halls but never really felt present. “It was my first obstacle as an adult, and I didn’t know how to handle it, so I went through the motions,” Voss says. “I was 19. I had tunnel vision.” That was 2007. Voss drank, then drank heavily. Weekend partying began on Thursdays, then moved up to Wednesdays. By spring ball he had incorporated Oxycodone into his repertoire. That summer he moved home to New Port Richey, Fla., commuting 45 minutes for practices, driving home each night to get high. And then he woke up one morning and decided he wanted to be a regular college student. He asked his coach for a meeting. “In 20 minutes,” he says, “I gave up a full ride.” Voss then plunged into a harrowing spiral. A decade later he has resurfaced, miraculously, as an NFL prospect. In The College Column, we have mostly covered top prospects from powerhouse programs. But each year leading up to the draft there are dozens of men that share the same dreams, with less linear paths. Few paths veer as dramatically as Alton Voss’s. After leaving USF, Voss concocted a fake back injury. It was good enough for a pain management clinic, from which he received prescriptions for Oxycontin and Roxicodone. He tried returning to football twice. He enrolled at College of the Sequoias in California (that lasted a week) then Fort Scott Community College in Kansas (that lasted three weeks). At Fort Scott, Voss brought methadone—just enough so that he wouldn’t get dope sick. Suffering from withdrawal, physically, he could not rebound. He overslept and missed meetings. The coach finally said, “I like you, but I need to let you go.” “I was probably slipping into a depression,” Voss says. “Some days I just wanted to get high and escape my reality. Other times I wanted to get back on track. I just couldn’t.” Once, Voss wrapped string around his arm and shot crack in a Walmart parking lot. In 2011 he almost overdosed. He quit pills, quit crack and decided he would only smoke marijuana. He enrolled at a community college in Florida. A few months later he had a manic episode. In the middle of class Voss had a premonition he was going to win the lottery. He went to a gas station and bought six scratch-off tickets—and won each time. Reasonably hyped, he called a friend in Michigan to gush about his fortune. The friend hung up, then called right back: “It doesn’t sound like you’re doing so great. Maybe you should come up here to get away for a few days.” And so Voss, who had $1,800 from selling his pills, bought a one-way ticket to Michigan. He still wasn’t well. Upon arriving in Holland, Mich., he went for a jog. Here’s how he described what happened: “I know it sounds crazy. I had this current that guided me. There was a man who got out of the car, and the current told me to go in that car.” So Voss stole a car. He drove it to a cemetery. Police lights flashed. Voss, who had gotten out of the car, broke down. He was arrested and briefly admitted to the mental health ward at Hackley Hospital in Muskegon, Mich. When he returned to jail, he was assigned a public defender, Jane Patterson. She worked a deal to reduce the charges from felony to a misdemeanor. But among the judge’s orders: Voss needed to be on the first flight back home to Florida. Voss reached out to Patterson to stay in touch. They exchanged emails, then texts, then long phone calls. “I know this place,” she said one day in June 2011, “where I think you can get better.” That’s how Voss ended up in Argentina. He spent two years at a rehabilitation facility, CMI Abasto in Buenos Aires: one year in-patient, the other out-patient. He became clean, then healthy. Photo: Courtesy Grand Valley State Athletics “When I first was down in Argentina, football was the last thing I was thinking about,” he says. “But as I started to think about my goals, football became important to me again. I wanted to finish my journey.” There were people at the rehab facility in Argentina from western Michigan, including a family member of a Grand Valley State booster. “That’s how I found myself at a Panera with Jane Patterson and a booster detailing me about Alton’s case,” says Matt Mitchell, GVSU’s head coach. “Obviously I had some hesitations. We were taking him right from rehab back into the fire. This is a campus of more than 25,000 students.” Mitchell gave Voss a shot. They gathered his transcripts from across the country, and in 2013 Voss walked on as a 23-year-old freshman. He began as a tight end. “I wasn’t great at pass-blocking or run-blocking,” Voss admits. But he got after it on special teams. Impressed by his effort, coaches switched him to defensive end (where he was older than his position coach). Coaches monitored Voss closely; they saw nothing but a leader. He was good with teammates, and he passed every NCAA-issued drug test. Over the past two seasons he accumulated 7.5 sacks, 20.5 tackles for loss and forced five fumbles. His 6'3", 240-pound frame and non-stop motor caught the eyes of scouts. Many NFL teams noticed Voss on film while scouting GVSU teammate Matt Judon, a 2016 fifth-round pick of the Ravens. “Some teams have told me, ‘I’m sorry, I can’t bring a 28-year-old former drug addict to my player personnel guys in good conscience,’” Mitchell says. “Other teams are intrigued.” Mitchell’s pitch to NFL evaluators: Voss may be 28, but there’s not a lot of wear on his tires. He wasn’t playing football for five years, and he stayed injury-free over four years at GVSU. And the coach can’t say enough about his influence on teammates. Four years clean, Voss has entered the public speaking circuit. He talks with the same confidence and cogency he evinced on the phone last week as he recounted his story. At best, Voss will be a priority free agent who needs to earn a roster spot at training camp, likely on special teams. “Even if that doesn’t happen,” Mitchell says. “He should take tremendous pride in the fact he even got to this point.” by Emily Kaplan @EmilyMKaplan More Articles MMQB Tweets Tweets by @theMMQB Raiders Fans Deserve Better mailbag On TB12 and SB51 Brady, in Montana, Tells Comeback Story 2017 Draft Longshots T.O. and Tagliabue: What the Hall?

Schweikert: Tax reform as much about economic growth as payroll growth    Tuesday, 14 Feb 2017 | 7:51 AM ET | 04:31 The stock market rally has been fueled in part by hopes that a big tax cut — of one kind or another — would bump up corporate profits and spending. But the proposed tax plan with the most punch so far could have a tough time making it through Congress, and that ultimately could mean disappointment for a heady stock market. It also means the slow wheels of Washington could delay tax reform for longer than the stock market is expecting. "You're going to get a lot of hand-wringing. It's slow, and it's going to be gradual," said Dan Clifton, head of policy research at advisory firm Strategas. The current House Ways and Means Committee proposal would cut the corporate tax rate from a current 35 percent to 20 percent. That would make a difference for the biggest U.S. corporations, which pay about 25 percent on average. But the plan is paid for by the controversial border adjustment tax, which is meeting resistance in the Senate. President Donald Trump has not clearly come down one way or the other on the plan, and he meets Wednesday with big retailers who oppose it. "Whether the Ryan plan passes with the border adjusted tax is highly controversial. ... The Senate is going to be a lot more resistant to it," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. House Speaker Paul Ryan is a big backer of the plan. "I think bottom line is the market is making it seem like there are only winners from tax reform. But with the border adjusted tax, there are going to be winners and losers." show chapters Border tax fight is economists vs. everybody else: Brill    Friday, 10 Feb 2017 | 7:15 AM ET | 03:10 Goldman Sachs economists put the odds of a border adjusted tax at about 20 percent, with opposition growing. Besides concerns about the effect on consumers, the European Union and other trading partners may challenge it with the World Trade Organization. Trump raised market expectations about tax reform when he promised last Thursday he would debut his own plan in the next several weeks, and it's unclear whether it will be like the House proposal or something else. The concern is the effort could become mired in debate, with the border adjustment tax already seeing industries lining up on both sides of it. The border adjusted tax would put a 20 percent tax on all goods coming into the country and no tax on exports. That pits Boeing, General Electric and Dow Chemical, all exporters, against Wal-Mart, Target and other importers. "If that tax reform date looks like it's pushed too far in the future, the market reacts negatively to it. We don't think it kills the bull market, but it could pull the market down 3 to 4 percent near term. A trim, not a haircut," said John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management. Trump has previously proposed a plan that would reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. "Our expectation is the forthcoming White House plan will reduce rates largely by expanding the budget deficit, with a small amount of base broadening. By contrast, we expect that the Senate will consider legislation that broadens the tax base somewhat more, but proposes a smaller cut to the corporate tax rate to limit the budgetary effect," the Goldman economists said. They also said without the border adjustment proposal the tax rate would probably be closer to 25 percent, not much bang for companies already at that rate based on deductions. Small companies, however, would benefit as many of them pay much closer to the 35 percent rate. The loss of the House border adjustment tax from the plan would be significant since it is expected to raise about $1 trillion over 10 years. It would be a dramatic shift in U.S. corporate tax structure to a destination-based tax, which means that companies would not deduct the costs of imported goods, and would not include export revenue in their tax base. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said Tuesday on CNBC that in his mind, there would be no tax bill without a border adjusted tax. "I don't know any other way to do it. We've long looked at this. We've had exhaustive hearing after hearing after hearing for eight years," said Nunes, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. He said the committee has found the only way to make meaningful changes is to move to a full consumption-based system. "This is the only way to leapfrog United States tax code in front of every other tax code around the world," said Nunes. Clifton said House leadership has said this before, and the House does not currently have the 218 votes for tax reform with the border adjustment tax, but Ryan and others believe they have more flexibility to get the tax rate lower with it. He said without Trump's endorsement, it's a hard sell to get other House members on board. "It's like 'Hunger Games' for tax lobbyists now," said Clifton. "If you're negatively impacted by the border tax, you're pushing the net interest deductibility." Limiting interest deductibility would be a negative for financial firms. The border adjusted tax is an unknown and for that reason, opponents say it's unclear if it would work quite the way it is expected to. For one, it requires a 25 percent jump in the dollar to prevent the import tax from becoming a tax on consumers and on companies that rely on imported goods. Proponents say it would create American jobs and build up U.S. manufacturing. "Our own case is you couldn't get the full appreciation of the dollar in one go, and in all likelihood the border adjustment tax would not have the neutral effect that academic theory suggests it might, and would materially benefit net exporters rather than net importers," said Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. The House bill also proposes limiting the deductability of net interest expense and instead allowing companies to fully expense, instead of depreciating capital expenditures. Turnill said that could hurt companies that are highly leveraged, but analysts say that's a feature that could stay in an alternate plan. Turnill said he believes that the reflation of the global economy has been the main driver of the market, but tax reform is a factor and the process could result in volatile trading as more reform details emerge. Clifton said a tax plan without border tax adjustment is most likely, and he outlined several scenarios. One is for a plan that includes 100 percent expensing for a few years instead of having companies depreciate capital expenditures. That could take the corporate tax rate to 23 percent, he said. Tax reform could also include a one-time repatriation of the $2 trillion in corporate cash held overseas, also currently in the House plan. The net interest deduction would also be capped under this plan and existing corporate deductions and credit would be removed. A second option is a straight tax cut, a proposal that Trump has discussed. But without revenue generation, it could face opposition and potentially result in higher interest rates, as it could add to U.S. debt. Clifton said a straight cut could get done much quicker, and in 2003, a tax cut boosted GDP growth to 7 percent in the third quarter and 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter. The third fallback plan he sees is a one-time repatriation of overseas cash, together with infrastructure spending. Clifton said the collapsing dam in California is likely to renew calls for major infrastructure plans. He said House conservatives would probably oppose such a plan. "I do think they will get corporate tax reform.They'll be targeting anywhere from 15 to 20 percent, and I do think repatriation will be a part of it," said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. "The big question for markets is going to be the loss of deductions that come along with it. If in fact losing the interest deduction is on the table, that one is important for highly leveraged companies." Arone said it seems like some border adjustability will be included. "The administration has seemed to warm to it a bit more. After an initial comment that it was too complicated, we haven't heard much more in terms of tweets, comments talking it down. ... The market has already anticipated some form of border adjustability. Folks that import already manufactured goods, that type of thing, earnings could be impaired."

(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) 727 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE LOS ANGELES — There's a Tracy Morgan code-red emergency poolside at the W Hotel, The actor goes from loudly cracking funny, even throwing jokes to a nearby bikini-clad admirer, to suddenly being blinded by the emerging Southern California sun. He needs sunglasses and not just any pair. Morgan needs his prescription Cazal shades, a designer pair with real gold hardware. His assistant thinks they might be in the hotel room, and Morgan looks perturbed. But that expression turns to joy when the $2,000 shades emerge. "Ah," he proclaims blissfully, sliding them on. "Much better." Morgan's entertainment future is so bright, he's got to wear blinged-out shades. His movie comedy Fist Fight (in theaters Friday) is the first project he's filmed since a near-fatal accident on June 7, 2014, in which a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus, putting the 30 Rock star into a coma with a traumatic brain injury. Tracy Morgan plays a high-school coach who helps prep Charlie Day for a skirmish in 'Fist Fight.'  (Photo: Bob Mahoney) Not only has Morgan, 48, largely recuperated from the ordeal, which required him to learn to walk again, he's back doing what he loves: making comedy. Morgan stars as a gruff but oblivious coach in the R-rated Fist Fight, about a meek teacher (Charlie Day) challenged to a brawl by the tough colleague (Ice Cube) he got fired. "Thank God, I didn’t die in the accident and I was there to do this," says Morgan. "But I was hit by a truck. I was out for a year and change." Tracy Morgan's vision of heaven: God is waiting to slap his butt Morgan's says he's "95%" mentally recovered, while still mourning his friend and fellow comedian James McNair, who died in the crash:  "I miss Jimmy every day." Physically, Morgan has a titanium rod "in my leg for life — otherwise, nothing bothers me." But even after a surprise 2015 Emmy Awards appearance to thank supporters and his Picking Up the Pieces comedy tour, the star feared he might not be funny onscreen. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Tracy Morgan tells USA TODAY's Bryan Alexander how to dress while promoting a movie. Morgan stars in 'Fist Fight.' Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY "When you have a traumatic brain incident like that, there are a lot of components that go into it: the comedy timing, the instincts," says Morgan. "He didn't take that from me." Tracy Morgan talks first real 'Fist Fight': 'She whooped my (butt)!' His co-star Day noticed that Morgan was understandably tight on Day 1 when Fist Fight began shooting in 2015. "So we kept rolling the camera even after those first scenes ended. And three takes in, it was like riding a bike," Day says. "Tracy was the same old Tracy Morgan. He's hysterical." For Morgan, the laughter comes with relief and thanks to his many friends. As he talks about their loyalty, a giant tear rolls down Morgan's cheek, which he doesn't wipe away. Tracy Morgan (from left), Charlie Day and Jillian Bell navigate teacher dynamics in 'Fist Fight.'  (Photo: Bob Mahoney) He married his longtime fiancée, Megan Wollover, on Aug. 23, 2015, and they have a 3-year-old daughter, Maven Sonae. "I know I married the woman I was supposed to marry. When I was on my back, she was there," says Morgan. He makes clear that Fist Fight is just the start. In May, Morgan begins shooting a new, as yet untitled TBS comedy series based on his life. He's full of ideas and appreciation. "I say thank you to God every morning. I open my curtains and the sun is out, even if it's cloudy," says Morgan. "These are tears of joy right now. We just ran a gamut of emotion here, but this is not a tough day. This is joyful day." Tracy Morgan chills at the W Hotel in Los Angeles. His new film is 'Fist Fight.'  (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) 727 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lfsiJe NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

According to the real estate firm CBRE, “The amount of office space the entertainment industry occupies in Los Angeles County has climbed to the most this decade.” New numbers from the firm show that media companies take up about 25.5 million square feet of space in countywide—a jump of nearly 3 million square feet from five years ago. The demand comes from companies such as Netflix, which rents more than 500,000 square feet—that’s “roughly the size of five Wal-Mart stores”!—at Sunset Bronson Studios in Hollywood. The CEO of Hudson Properties, which rents that space to Netflix, credits the “boom” to digital media and entertainment companies. Bloomberg agrees, saying: “The convergence of entertainment and tech has created new outlets for production while also leading to greater use of office space,” as production workers increasing move behind computer screens.

The “surge” in leasing is spread across the city, with hotspots in Silicon Beach, Hollywood, and Downtown. In Hollywood, Netflix is joined by Buzzfeed and a newly consolidated Viacom, which has taken up residence in the new Columbia Square development. In Playa Vista, there’s Google and Youtube, which have continued to help draw more new tenants to the area. These companies seek out casual, open floor plans—spaces that are either built this way or overhauled to appeal to an often younger, entertainment industry crowd: In Playa Vista, offices are spacious and relaxed, with young people in leggings and beanies working on their laptops while lounging on couches, sunk into beanbag chairs or perched on bar stools. Neon signs with inspirational phrases hang on the walls, while sliding doors link indoor dining rooms to outdoor patios strewn with hammocks and foliage. Employees’ dogs run from room to room. More traditional office spaces aren’t faring so well. With their more formal vibes and layout, they continue to face high vacancies, says Bloomberg, as even more “traditional” tenants like lawyers start to want a fresh office style.

Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Everett Botwright is six years old and lives in Nanaimo, B.C. His dad Reed describes his son as a “truly unique little dude” but to say he’s a picky eater is an understatement. Everett has autism and Reed says being on the spectrum means Everett will “physically starve himself instead of eating a food he is [not] familiar and comfortable with.” Story continues below “We believe it is related to the overwhelming tastes and smells of most foods, as he prefers very basic things. Many on the spectrum experience varied levels of sensory processing issues,” says Reed in an email interview. So when Everett spotted something he wanted to eat recently, Reed says they were very excited. “We were walking through Walmart a month ago and he pointed this specific Kraft Dinner out to us, exclaiming, ‘I want to eat that!'” says Reed. Everett wanted to eat Kraft Dinner Star Wars Mac and Cheese and Reed snapped up as many as he could find. “We were wary at first, as the real test is him trying the food and actually eating it,” says Reed. “I got choked up and my wife cried tears of joy when he ravenously ate a whole bowl and then another! He had previously liked regular Kraft Dinner, but something about the shapes of the new Star Wars version attracted him back to it.” But it appears the KD Star Wars Mac and Cheese is a limited-edition product, produced to coincide with the release of Rogue One. So Reed is hoping both friends and strangers can help him out. He has even spoken to a local Kraft representative on Vancouver Island. “I’ve already received several [boxes] from people donating their meager supplies, and some in other towns have bought all they could find to send to us, but it’s getting harder and harder to find them,” he says. Reed says he will be looking for more online, but if anyone has any boxes or sees any for sale, they will go to that store or pay for them. Many people have already stepped up and offered to help. “All of the Botwrights truly appreciate the outpouring of support and know that it is helping our Everett,” says Reed. “It’s also great that people are being educated about the challenges faced by people on the autism spectrum and the people who support them, be they family or friends.” If anyone can help Everett and his family, they can send any boxes to 1969 Stannard Drive, Nanaimo, B.C.

According to Brown County Sheriff John Merchant, the accident happened around 7 a.m. just south of the Wal-Mart on US Highway 36. Merchant says the semi was headed east on US 36 when it overturned and laid down on its side. Nearly 180 hogs were inside the trailer when it crashed. Merchant says emergency responders arrived at the scene and were able to contain many of the animals and get them off of the highway. A Brown County resident with a portable corral drove out to the scene to assist. “He happened to come by immediately after the accident, called me and asked if we’d like to use it,” Merchant said. “For the type of accident this was, with the animals involved, this was ideal. We were able to round up the animals better [than we would have] with makeshift corrals, which could have spooked the animals.” Merchant says an unknown number of hogs were killed and injured in the crash. The driver of the semi sustained minor injuries in the crash. Merchant says the driver remained at the scene while responders worked the accident and does not believe he was taken to the hospital.   The highway was shut down for a short amount of time after the crash.

(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) 727 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE LOS ANGELES — There's a Tracy Morgan code-red emergency poolside at the W Hotel, The actor goes from loudly cracking funny, even throwing jokes to a nearby bikini-clad admirer, to suddenly being blinded by the emerging Southern California sun. He needs sunglasses and not just any pair. Morgan needs his prescription Cazal shades, a designer pair with real gold hardware. His assistant thinks they might be in the hotel room, and Morgan looks perturbed. But that expression turns to joy when the $2,000 shades emerge. "Ah," he proclaims blissfully, sliding them on. "Much better." Morgan's entertainment future is so bright, he's got to wear blinged-out shades. His movie comedy Fist Fight (in theaters Friday) is the first project he's filmed since a near-fatal accident on June 7, 2014, in which a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus, putting the 30 Rock star into a coma with a traumatic brain injury. Tracy Morgan plays a high-school coach who helps prep Charlie Day for a skirmish in 'Fist Fight.'  (Photo: Bob Mahoney) Not only has Morgan, 48, largely recuperated from the ordeal, which required him to learn to walk again, he's back doing what he loves: making comedy. Morgan stars as a gruff but oblivious coach in the R-rated Fist Fight, about a meek teacher (Charlie Day) challenged to a brawl by the tough colleague (Ice Cube) he got fired. "Thank God, I didn’t die in the accident and I was there to do this," says Morgan. "But I was hit by a truck. I was out for a year and change." Tracy Morgan's vision of heaven: God is waiting to slap his butt Morgan's says he's "95%" mentally recovered, while still mourning his friend and fellow comedian James McNair, who died in the crash:  "I miss Jimmy every day." Physically, Morgan has a titanium rod "in my leg for life — otherwise, nothing bothers me." But even after a surprise 2015 Emmy Awards appearance to thank supporters and his Picking Up the Pieces comedy tour, the star feared he might not be funny onscreen. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Tracy Morgan tells USA TODAY's Bryan Alexander how to dress while promoting a movie. Morgan stars in 'Fist Fight.' Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY "When you have a traumatic brain incident like that, there are a lot of components that go into it: the comedy timing, the instincts," says Morgan. "He didn't take that from me." Tracy Morgan talks first real 'Fist Fight': 'She whooped my (butt)!' His co-star Day noticed that Morgan was understandably tight on Day 1 when Fist Fight began shooting in 2015. "So we kept rolling the camera even after those first scenes ended. And three takes in, it was like riding a bike," Day says. "Tracy was the same old Tracy Morgan. He's hysterical." For Morgan, the laughter comes with relief and thanks to his many friends. As he talks about their loyalty, a giant tear rolls down Morgan's cheek, which he doesn't wipe away. Tracy Morgan (from left), Charlie Day and Jillian Bell navigate teacher dynamics in 'Fist Fight.'  (Photo: Bob Mahoney) He married his longtime fiancée, Megan Wollover, on Aug. 23, 2015, and they have a 3-year-old daughter, Maven Sonae. "I know I married the woman I was supposed to marry. When I was on my back, she was there," says Morgan. He makes clear that Fist Fight is just the start. In May, Morgan begins shooting a new, as yet untitled TBS comedy series based on his life. He's full of ideas and appreciation. "I say thank you to God every morning. I open my curtains and the sun is out, even if it's cloudy," says Morgan. "These are tears of joy right now. We just ran a gamut of emotion here, but this is not a tough day. This is joyful day." Tracy Morgan chills at the W Hotel in Los Angeles. His new film is 'Fist Fight.'  (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY) 727 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lfsiJe NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.

HIAWATHA, Kan. (KSNT) – Around 7:00 Tuesday morning, an east bound semi-tractor trailer loaded with market hogs overturned on its side on U.S. Highway 36 in Hiawatha, south of the Wal-Mart. According to the Brown County Sheriff’s Office, emergency responders arrived shortly after the accident and were able to contain the loose pigs off of the south side of the highway in the right-of-way. “We were very fortunate to have a county resident who immediately was enroute to the location with a portable corral,” said Brown County Sheriff John Merchant. Merchant says it was quickly set up and with the number of emergency services personnel at the scene, the pigs were then quickly contained and loaded up by the owners. Approximately 180 head were on the trailer. Merchant says the Kansas Highway Patrol arrived and worked the accident.  KDOT provided traffic control.  Hiawatha Fire Department, Squad 48 and Town and Country Ambulance were at the scene and without these dedicated volunteers, things would not have gone as smoothly as they did. “We are very fortunate to have the caliber of emergency services personnel  that we do in Brown County who work together in such an organized manner.  We are also very fortunate to have offers of assistance from the public.” U.S. 36 was only shut down for a short amount of time to enable wrecker crews to remove the semi and trailer.

Here are the major trends that will shape the industry in the coming year. Joe Tenebruso (TMFGuardian) Feb 13, 2017 at 7:15PM 2017 has been most unkind to traditional retailers. Data source: YCharts.  Assailed by the relentless and merciless rise of e-commerce, brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling to adapt to an increasingly online world. Will this retail destruction continue in the year ahead? And what are the major retail trends that investors should watch? Read on to find out. Image source: Getty Images. Department-store carnage Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD) -- the parent company of Sears and Kmart -- may not survive the year, with these once iconic retailers besieged by a poisonous combination of plunging sales, massive losses, and dwindling cash reserves. CEO Eddie Lampert has turned to creative financing deals and fire sales of most of Sears' best assets to raise the capital needed to fund the company's operations, but even these drastic measures are likely to only delay Sears' seemingly inevitable demise. Other department-store chains, such as Macy's (NYSE:M), J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), have also seen their stock prices plummet as they struggle with falling traffic and declining comparable-store sales. Consumer buying habits continue to shift away from their core mall-based operations, with department-store sales down for 11 years in a row, according to data from the Commerce Department. In response, these chains are attempting to adapt by closing stores and slashing expenses, but cost cuts can only go so far. Ultimately, Kohl's and Macy's shareholders' best hope may be a sale to a private equity firm or another retailer. J.C. Penney has an even tougher road ahead, and if the heavily indebted retailer doesn't significantly improve its profitability and cash-flow generation, it could head down a path similar to that of Sears Holdings. All told, the department-store industry appears to be in a state of secular decline, and these retailers' ongoing struggles will be a major storyline to watch in 2017. No reprieve for discounters Even discount chains such as Target (NYSE:TGT) and the mighty Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) have seen their sales and margins dented by intensifying competition. For decades, these discount chains were the disruptors; with their wide selection of goods and low prices, they steadily claimed market share from their higher-priced and often smaller rivals. Now, however, it's these massive retailers that are losing share to an even more disruptive threat: the relentless rise of e-commerce. And this global megatrend is being spearheaded by the juggernaut that is Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Can anyone challenge Amazon? Without the cost burdens and physical limitations of a store base, Amazon -- along with its army of third-party sellers -- is able to offer an even wider selection of goods and often lower prices than its still primarily brick-and-mortar rivals. Even more worrisome for traditional retailers is that Amazon dominates consumer mindshare when it comes to shopping online. In fact, a report by marketing firm BloomReach shows that 55% of consumers begin their searches on the e-commerce titan's website when shopping online, up from 44% in 2015. During that time, the percentage of shoppers whose searches originated at all other retailers' sites combined fell from 21% to only 16%, with search engines holding the remaining share. It appears that "Amazon" is increasingly becoming synonymous with shopping in the minds of consumers. To combat this trend, Wal-Mart and Target are investing aggressively in their e-commerce operations. Target is largely focused on improving its website, strengthening its supply chain, and utilizing more of its stores to fulfill online orders. Wal-Mart's efforts are highlighted by its $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet.com, which the company hopes will help it gain ground on Amazon. Yet even with these heavy investments, Wal-Mart and Target's e-commerce businesses are still only a fraction of the size of Amazon's online retail operations. Still, investors shouldn't completely dismiss Wal-Mart and Target as threats to Amazon's dominance, and the battle between these giants will be interesting to watch in the year, and years, ahead.  Joe Tenebruso has no position in any stocks mentioned.

article LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital health innovator and pioneer, myLAB Box, the first nationwide at-home STD testing service, has added a comprehensive new array of self-administered in-home STD tests, as nationally reported cases of STDs reach record levels according to the CDC. The six new myLAB Box in-home tests include kits for Hepatitis C, Herpes Simplex 2, HPV, Mycoplasma, Syphilis and Ureaplasma and further expand the company's offerings which include extragenital tests, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, HIV and Trichomoniasis. Every test is suitable for both men and women and includes the myLAB Box's 'Testing to Treatment' program which offers complimentary telemedicine consultations with physicians for anyone who tests positive using the service. Tests are available individually or in combination kits through the myLab Box website, Amazon, Walmart and other trusted ecommerce sources. "myLAB Box was created in response to the unstable healthcare climate in the U.S. and what we saw as the need for alternatives to payer-based health systems," said Lora Ivanova, co-founder and CMO, myLAB Box. "From affordable screening to complimentary physician consultations for positives, every aspect of the myLAB Box service is designed to be something a user can easily handle out-of-pocket and without complications. The recent shake-up of our healthcare systems further deepens our resolve to grow our offerings and develop a new hassle-free lab testing model. We believe this is not just great business, but a much needed resource to curb a widespread epidemic in the U.S. today." The myLAB Box tests screen for STD risks using FDA-approved technology and are sold individually or in combo kits: Safe Box - a 4 Panel Home STD Test Pack - screens for the 4 most common STDs that comprise 71% of all new cases in the U.S. (excluding HPV), including Chlamydia (2nd), Trich (3rd), Gonorrhea (4th) and HIV. Uber Box - a 7 Panel Home STD Test Pack - screens for 7 of the most common STDs similar to what is administered by a doctor's visit, including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Hepatitis C, Herpes Simplex 2, HIV, Syphilis, and Trichomoniasis. Total Box - a 10 Panel Home STD Test Pack - the most comprehensive pack which screens for all STD risks in the Uber Box plus HPV, Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma. "At myLAB Box we spend a lot of time listening to our customers' concerns and innovating new and better ways to address them. From the very beginning the key asks have revolved around increased privacy and convenience," added Ivanova. "By bringing testing home, we have given them the opportunity to access all aspects of their care anytime and anywhere.

There was a car next to them that started to back out. It actually drove over his foot and ankle. The driver then stopped while the car was still on his foot and ankle. The man’s wife went out and told the driver what happened. She moved off of him. When the wife went out to check on her husband, the driver left. We are trying to find out who she is.” Clemens has this brief description of the car and driver. “Dark colored four door sedan. The driver is a white woman around 85 to 90 years old, petite and blond hair.” Clemens says the victim was not seriously hurt.

Authorities were dispatched about 6 p.m. to 11200 Potranco Road for a report of a cutting. When officers arrived, they found a woman in her 30s lying on the ground with a stab wound to her chest. The victim suffered one fatal wound to the chest and was pronounced dead at the scene, said Sgt. Jesse Salame, San Antonio Police Department spokesman, who added that the suspect is at large. Witnesses told investigators that the altercation between the two women started and ended in the parking lot. Detectives believe that the two knew each other and likely went to Walmart together. Salame said authorities are looking for a female in her 30's in connection to the stabbing.

They also called for a boycott of U.S. products in an unusual display of nationalist pride. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: As for our neighbors to the south, Mexicans are calling for boycotts of U.S. products. They're waving their country's flag - at least virtually on social media posts - and they are marching in the streets against President Trump's policies. As NPR's Carrie Kahn reports, tens of thousands of Mexicans demonstrated over the weekend in a display of nationalist pride not seen in decades. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Marchers shouting Mexico, Mexico circled the Angel of Independence monument and spilled down several city blocks of the capital yesterday. Similar demonstrations took place in more than a dozen cities throughout Mexico. ANA HALLY: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: Ana Hally says she was glad to see so many Mexicans marching to defend Mexican pride, which she says has been greatly insulted by President Trump and his depiction of Mexicans as rapists, criminals and stealing American jobs. Marta Solis says she wanted to show support of the millions of Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. who she says are now under attack and threatened with deportation. MARTA SOLIS: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: "They are not alone, every Mexican stands by them," says Solis. Mexicans are not only marching in response to the rapid deterioration of U.S.-Mexican relations. Many groups are calling for boycotts of U.S. goods and chains from Starbucks to Wal-Mart. And there are campaigns to vacation at home and buy only made-in-Mexico brands. Some U.S. citizens and longtime residents of Mexico are feeling an anti-Trump backlash. Just this Saturday, freelance photographer Ben Schreibman says he was in his Mexico City neighborhood taking pictures when he was stopped by local police who asked to see his immigration papers. He asked why, and the police said... BEN SCHREIBMAN: Well, in your country with Trump now they're checking documents and visas and deportations. And then now they're getting very serious, so we feel that we should do the same thing. KAHN: Schreibman says he hasn't experienced such animosity in the years he's lived in Mexico and feels it was an isolated incident. Political science professor Soledad Loaeza says relations now are tough. SOLEDAD LOAEZA: Of course, this is like the worst moment in our recent history, but it's not the first time that we have problems with the U.S. KAHN: There was, of course, the Mexican-American War that led to Mexico losing nearly half its territory and the nationalization of U.S. oil companies in the 1930s. But such fervor in Mexico had largely subsided in the past few decades as the country's two economies have become tightly integrated, especially since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Loaeza says Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto is also to blame for the fraying relationships with the U.S. She says Pena Nieto has been weak and incoherent in his response to Trump. His approval rating around 12 percent is the lowest of any recent Mexican president. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing in Spanish). KAHN: While yesterday's rally in Mexico City ended with the huge crowd breaking out in a rendition of the Mexican National Anthem, chants and signs demanding their own president's resignation were on full display, too.

Close Email This Story Send Email Cancel Here are three gifts that anyone can recreate without spending more than $10 for Valentine’s Day. All the person needs is creativity, time and energy. Cheers to love This do-it-yourself project requires a wine glass and decorating supplies like stickers, permanent markers, paint and glitter. All supplies can be found in Wal-Mart and the Dollar Tree in Charleston. The glass has a lot of surface area for the person to be creative and use their supplies to transform it to fit the person’s taste. Before decorating the glass make sure you sketch out your design on a sheet of paper and try to pick a design that is simplistic. This is a simple reusable gift for people who are 21 years old and older. For an extra special touch, you can fill the glass with candy or special notes. The love game Purchase a set of standard playing cards and write a note on each card. This project just requires a marker and 52 creative compliments about your valentine. This inexpensive gift does not take much money or time but it is a great gesture to express how you feel about that person. The notes can range from simple compliments to detailed memories. The key is to have fun and be real. Loving from the oven Who does not enjoy baked goods? The price and the number of ingredients do vary for each desert but I recommend for my new bakers, brownies or buy prepared cookie dough because they have minimal steps and ingredients. For those experienced in the kitchen, I would recommend chocolate covered strawberries. A batch of strawberries and chocolate is all you need. There are some residence halls where students can access an oven and rent baking utensils. The key is to decorate the desserts with either sprinkles, frosting and fudge or caramel.

X Civil war looms in corporate America over Trump tax plan All agreed on cutting corporation tax but importers and exporters diverge on border tax Tue, Feb 14, 2017, 16:46 Donald Trump’s plans to impose an import tax has divided corporate America         Rick Woldenberg views US economic policy through an unconventional lens: a multicoloured toy microscope that retails for just $20 (€18.90). Copyrighted in the US but manufactured in China, My First Microscope is one of hundreds of toys sold by Learning Resources, his Chicago company, which he uses to measure the effect of Washington on his business. Alongside chief executives from Wall Street, the rust belt and Silicon Valley, Mr Woldenberg has spent years pleading for Washington to overhaul an uncompetitive tax code that charges US companies the highest rates of any developed nation. “It is a crushing load,” he says adding that profits from his microscopes are taxed at above 40 per cent. After November’s election Republicans said their party’s control of both the White House and Congress had created the best chance to revamp the tax code in a generation. President Donald Trump has put slashing the 35 per cent corporate tax rate at the heart of his mission to boost the economy and create jobs. Expectations of success powered a post-election stock market rally. Devastating Yet for Mr Woldenberg the hope has turned to horror. Republicans are still promising the most sweeping changes since the Reagan reforms of 1986. But the only firm proposal on the table – from the House of Representatives – threatens to devastate his 150-person business because it includes a 20 per cent tax on imports. “This plan is not good for me if it kills me,” he says. “You know John Maynard Keynes said in the long run we’re all dead. I just don’t want to be dead now.” US importers have serious grounds to fear being hurt. Yet there are potential winners also, because the flip side of the import levy is a tax exemption for exports leaving the US. That stark difference has triggered a corporate civil war between big importers and exporters, a conflict playing out via fierce lobbying in Congress. ADVERTISEMENT Tax reform is one of Mr Trump’s best chances of making good on his election promise to improve the lives of financially strapped blue-collar voters. But the early skirmishes underline just how hard it will be for him to deliver his “tax revolution”. They have shattered Republican unity, left politicians skittish about their party’s plan and given the Trump administration reason to keep it at arm’s length. The broad tax blueprint does have “America first” credentials: it aims to stop US businesses fleeing overseas and seeks to eliminate advantages the current system gives to foreign companies selling into the US or competing with American rivals abroad. It would also cut the business tax rate from 35 per cent to 20 per cent. Threat to jobs But its most potent weapon is the import duty. Coupled with a tax exemption for exports leaving the US, it was conceived to boost the global competitiveness of American-made products and services. The problem for Mr Woldenberg is that his goods come from China – 98 per cent of the products he sells in the US are imported. US factories could not produce them with the same low costs and specialised skills, he says. So he would have no choice but to pay the import levy. He estimates it would send his tax bill soaring to 165 per cent of earnings. “To preserve cash flow I [would have to] raise my prices by a third, expect volume to go down by 40 per cent, and fire one out of five people,” he says. “I don’t want to do any of those things.” Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Nike, Gap and dozens of other groups that rely on imports last month began a lobbying campaign to kill the Republican plan. Dubbing it a “consumer tax”, they say they would have to increase prices on foreign goods, cut jobs or lose money. Stephen Sadove, former chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, the luxury department store, and a coalition member, said it was fanciful to think an import tax could reverse decades of outsourcing. “This is an existential threat to the retailers,” he told CNBC this month. The consumer companies are squaring off against their industrial peers. Big exporters such as Dow Chemical, General Electric, Boeing, Caterpillar and Pfizerhave formed the American Made coalition to champion the House plan. They argue that it would end the perverse practice of having lighter taxes on imports than American goods and foster job creation. The clash between the marquee names of corporate America has delayed the drafting of legislation in the House. In January Paul Ryan, the top Republican lawmaker, said he wanted tax reform introduced by August. A week later Mr Trump hinted at a longer timeline, saying: “I think before the end of the year I would like to say yes.” Adjusting borders Until the morning after election night, few people had paid attention to the ambitious House plan, published in June 2016. It was driven by a rising anger in both parties about the number of US companies moving factories overseas or using “ inversion” deals to shift their headquarters to low-tax jurisdictions. The plan was designed to stem that tide, a major election issue, and stimulate US corporate investment, raising productivity and people’s earnings. The headline proposal was the cut in business tax. However the plan would also replace income tax with a cashflow alternative allowing companies to write off capital investment on day one rather than gradually over a period of years - a very generous provision. In addition, it would end America’s unpopular practice of taxing global profits, replacing it with a system of taxing only companies’ US earnings. That provides the basis for the measures, known as “border adjustments”, that exclude export revenues from the tax base while taxing imports. ADVERTISEMENT “Regardless of where it is produced and regardless of who produces it, our international tax plan centres on a simple question: if it is consumed in the US it will be taxed at an equal rate,” says Kevin Brady, who created the plan as chairman of the House ways and means committee. “It eliminates every tax incentive for a US company to move jobs, manufacturing or their headquarters overseas.” Border adjustments would provide roughly $1.1 trillion of revenue to help fund any rate cut, says the Tax Foundation. But the think-tank estimates the whole plan would lift federal debt by $2.4 trillion over a decade. Its effect on global trade, investment and supply chains would be profound, say tax experts. Michael Devereux, director of the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation, believes the plan could be the biggest shake-up of cross-border taxation since the 1920s. Worry for Ireland Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands would have particular reason to worry, he says. They are low-tax countries that have encouraged US companies to shift profits or head offices to their shores. Under the House proposal the incentive to do that disappears. Instead, it is the US that would start operating “in a way akin to a tax haven”, according to an Oxford paper Mr Devereux co-authored in January. Countries watching their tax bases drift to the US would feel the pressure to adopt the same system, triggering a race to the bottom. Alternatively, they could challenge the US at the World Trade Organisation, arguing that the import tax is discriminatory. Mr Brady says he is just bringing the US into line with 100-plus countries that already levy VAT on imports but not exports. Trade lawyers in Brussels and Geneva are said to be preparing the groundwork for a case that could be the biggest in WTO history. “For there to be a WTO violation you don’t have to prove that there is both import discrimination and an export subsidy, one will do. In this case I believe there will be both,” says Jim Bacchus, a former congressman and member of the WTO’s top appellate body. The first companies to wake up to the significance of the import tax were retailers, which source everything from avocados to T-shirts overseas. Koch Industries, a petrol-to-paper towels conglomerate owned by the billionaire Republican donors Charles and David Koch, warned in December that the plan would “distort” the market. David French, the top lobbyist at the National Retail Federation, says: “Some retailers have looked at the numbers and consider it a threat to their viability. We are talking about effective tax rates that easily take up 100 per cent of their profits and in some cases come close to 200 per cent or 300 per cent. ” Disadvantage Advocates of the House plan say the importers need not worry. Border adjustments, they argue, would not distort trade because the dollar should appreciate immediately to offset the effect, with a stronger US currency boosting the buying power of importers and making US exports more expensive overseas. Critics dismiss that as an unreliable prediction from academics. For US exporters, the ability to export tax-free would also give them the option of dropping prices. But their support for the plan is grounded in the proposed 20 per cent corporate tax rate. Equally popular is ending the tax levied on foreign affiliates’ earnings when they are repatriated, which has left an estimated $1.2 trillion stranded in offshore cash piles. David Lewis, vice-president of global taxes at the US drugmaker Eli Lilly, says the current system puts his company at a disadvantage to British and Swiss rivals. “They can take their earnings from outside the US and spend a full dollar in the US on investment, intellectual property, whatever it might be. Whereas if we want to take a dollar from outside the US and redeploy it in the US we’re only getting 65 cents [after paying 35 per cent tax],” he says. “It’s about levelling the playing field.” ADVERTISEMENT The next step for tax legislation is the Senate, where the corporate upset has already made some Republicans nervous. David Perdue, a Georgia senator and a former chief executive at the retailer Dollar General, describes the border adjustment tax as “regressive”, adding: “It hammers low-income and middle-income consumers.” Politically expensive If tax reforms built around the import levy are to survive, Mr Trump will have to embrace them. The White House says the president will offer his “outline” for tax reform within the next three weeks. Ultimately, he will have to pick a side in the corporate civil war but so far his administration has sent out mixed signals. Peter Navarro, the head of the White House National Trade Council, told the Financial Times last month that border adjustability “offers one possible option among several” for correcting anti-US bias in the global tax system. The status quo may be unacceptable but if an import tax that boosted voters’ incomes also increased household bills, it would be politically costly. James Lucier, managing director of Capital-Alpha, a policy research group, says a conventional US president would be unable to sell a proposal that could be attacked as a sales tax. “It will take a figure like Donald Trump to convince the pick-up driving, Walmart-shopping American that it’s the right thing to do,” he says. “The alternative is if Trump wanted to blow it up, one tweet would do it.” Mr Woldenberg says Mr Trump should not confuse being bold with being reckless. He calls the import tax proposal an exercise in “blind faith” in which his microscopes could become victims. “We are being asked to risk a lifetime of work to prevent other people’s abuses. That’s more unfair than the current situation. We would be much better off if Congress did nothing.” WINNERS AND LOSERS FROM THE TAX REFORM PLAN Rate cut Would slash the top federal corporate tax rate to 20 per cent from 35 per cent, the highest in the OECD club of rich countries. This is a change, in isolation, that all companies can welcome. Reagan’s 1986 reforms cut the rate from 46 per cent to 34 per cent. Border adjustment The most controversial aspect of the House Republicans plan. It would tax imports by denying companies the ability to deduct the cost of imported goods from their taxable profits – a big blow for US importers. It would also exempt export revenue from company tax bases, in effect handing a rebate to US exporters. End worldwide taxation The proposal would end the taxation of profits from the foreign affiliates of US companies and tax only US earnings. Companies would be charged a one-off 8.75 per cent rate on existing offshore cash. This is a big win for technology and pharmaceutical companies with large offshore cash piles. Full ‘expensing’ Would allow companies to write off capital investment in the year it was made rather than gradually over the life of purchased equipment and buildings. A boon for capex-intensive industries such as energy and transportation. End favourable treatment of debt Companies would not be allowed to deduct interest payments on loans from their taxable profits. The move would deliver a blow to private equity and real estate companies that depend on debt financing. Critics of the current system say it encourages risky, debt-laden capital structures. – Copyright The Financial Times Ltd       Topics: Trump presidency David Koch Donald Trump John Maynard Keynes Kevin Brady Paul Ryan Peter Navarro Best Buy Boeing Caterpillar Cnbc Dow Chemical Eli Lilly General Electric Learning Resources Nike Target WalMart Read More Flynn’s demise puts new focus on Trump’s ties to Russia Russia says Michael Flynn resignation a ‘matter for US’ Trump’s Mar-a-Lago meetings raise security questions British government rejects petition to halt Trump state visit Donald Trump’s travel ban: what happens next?

Caption(Stephanie Markham - smarkham@shawmedia.com) Carmelo Gonzalez (right) assists customers Monday at Cell Vision, the latest Verizon Wireless retailer in DeKalb. By STEPHANIE MARKHAM smarkham @shawmedia.com DeKALB – Mike Haber, owner of the newest Verizon Wireless retailer in DeKalb, said he opened the store to offermore personalized and community-minded service to local Verizon customers. Cell Vision at 917 S. Annie Glidden Road is the second Verizon store in DeKalb and the eighth owned by Haber, of Naperville. The store opened in October. Haber also owns stores in Roselle, Lisle, La Grange, Rochelle and Roscoe in Illinois and Racine and Milwaukee in Wisconsin. DeKalb has a Verizon store at 2387 Sycamore Road along with authorized retailers at Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Harber said he has been working to bring another Verizon store to DeKalb for nearly two years. "I just believe that this community needs more than one store, especially with the large university as they have," he said. "I thought it was a great opportunity." He said as a Verizon agent, he operates his stores independently and can provide indivdiualized service based on his customers' needs. "We actually will go above and beyond corporate stores," Haber said. "We’ll work closer to each individual family. We’re actually going to call them, [offer] better deals for people that can’t afford it; we can bend more." Haber said his store offers new lines, upgrades, insurances, accessories, tablets, Internet hotspots and various smart devices. The store's hours are 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. Haber said his goal is for the store is to be a "community player" by getting involved with groups like the DeKalb Chamber of Commerce and earning lifelong customers through good service. "I believe at the end of the day, everybody sells phones, accessories, but the major difference is the actual people inside and how you act and react with every member and individual that comes through our store," he said. "Either they’re going to remember a great experience, or it’s just another store."  Related Links Verizon store owner aims to provide service Get breaking and town-specific news sent to your phone.

Mary Rice, 37, faces multiple charges in Alabama and Florida in connection with the women’s deaths. She surrendered Tuesday in West Point, Georgia, after a standoff at the motel where she had been holed up with William “Billy” Boyette.  Law enforcement officials said the two were involved in a crime spree that began Jan. 31 with the deaths of Jacqueline Jeanette Moore, 39, and Alicia Greer, 30, at the Emerald Sands Inn in the city of Milton, in Florida’s Panhandle.  Authorities said they are also suspected in the death of Peggy Broz, 52, who was stalked and followed Feb. 3 from her job at Baptist Health Care in Pensacola, Florida, to her home across the state line in Lillian, Alabama.  Three days later, on Monday, authorities said, they believe Boyette and Rice shot Kayla Crocker, 28, in her home near Pensacola and took her car. Crocker died Tuesday afternoon, the same day the pair was tracked to the motel in Georgia.  An arrest report from Santa Rosa County, Florida, said Boyette had been living with Rice in Milton before the crime spree began. Authorities previously said that Greer, one of the first victims, was Boyette’s girlfriend. According to the affidavit, Boyette’s mother - who wasn’t named in the document - rented a black Ford Edge on Jan. 30 in the name of one of the victims. The next day Greer and Moore were found dead, and sheriff’s investigators said Boyette “was immediately determined to be a suspect in the murders” and his photograph was circulated to media outlets.  On Feb. 3, a dark colored SUV was spotted leaving Broz’s house, some 15 miles from Pensacola, the arrest report said. A white Chrysler Concord belonging to Broz also was taken from the home. Broz was found dead at her home, and later that day the rented SUV was found in a parking lot near Pensacola. Investigators reviewed surveillance video from the area that showed the Chrysler followed the SUV to the parking lot and a woman got out of the SUV and into the stolen Chrysler.  The next day the stolen car was found abandoned near Interstate 10, the arrest report states. Inside, investigators found receipts from a Wal-Mart and GNC stores in Crestview, Florida. The receipts - dated Feb. 2 - were in Rice’s name and indicated she had purchased ammunition, hand warmers and a sleeping bag, according the arrest warrant. Surveillance from Wal-Mart shows Rice getting out of a dark SUV, while another individual waits inside. After making the purchases, she returned to the SUV and it drove off.  Photographs from a game camera in a wooded area outside Pensacola show Boyette and Rice carrying the items she purchased through the woods on Feb. 5, the affidavit said. Early the next morning, Crocker was shot. Her 2-year-old son wasn’t injured.  Mary Rice captured on surveillance cameras at a Crestview, Fla. WalMart Feb. 2, 2017 Sheriff’s officials believe the pair had been hiding in the woods near her home.  Authorities said Rice was “a willing participant” in the crime spree. Santa Rosa County Sheriff Bob Johnson told local news outlets Rice had several opportunities to break away from Boyette as she went in and out of stores.  Rice was extradited to Florida on Wednesday. On Thursday, a judge in Santa Rosa County set bond at $750,000 on a charge of accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. She also faces charges in nearby Escambia County and a capital murder charge in Alabama.  At a news conference Thursday in Alabama, Baldwin County District Attorney Robert Wilters said once investigations into all the killings are complete, prosecutors from both states will decide who will prosecute Rice first. Florida may go first, he said.  “They have her,” said Wilters. “That’s their trump card.”  But Wilters’ office could push to prosecute the woman before Florida because Alabama has an active death penalty law, while Florida’s is in limbo because of court rulings on the way juries can recommend capital punishment.  According to court records, Boyette was a habitual offender who was accused of beating and stabbing previous girlfriends. Authorities said he had only been out of jail for four months on a probation violation when the first two women were killed. © 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Bernd Debusmann Jr. (Chief Reporter)/Dubai bernd@khaleejtimes.com Filed on February 14, 2017 Share More > Vote Governments should focus on education and job training Governments need to prepare their people for an age in which disruptive technologies - such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation - change the labor market and in some cases take jobs currently done by human beings, according to experts speaking at the World Government Summit. Jonathan Matus, the Founder and CEO of Zendrive, a company that uses data to monitor driver behaviour, noted that AI has already made its way into people's daily lives. "Vertical AI is the intelligence that suggests which restaurant you should go to, what news stories you should read and where you should fly next based on your interests, while general AI or super-intelligence is a self-driving car or a robot that thinks for itself," he said.

In the US, for example, three and a half percent of US citizens mention driving as part of their job. "This is an area where we can make an important distinction. Driving on the highway is much easier than driving in the city. So, the autonomy of driving in trucks can come faster. Instead of building trucks that will drive all the way from the warehouse to the destination, companies can use autonomy for highways and a human driver within the city," he said. "Conglomerates such as Walmart will embrace this, and in the next seven years, robots will drive a massive number of miles." On Monday, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said he believes that "almost all cars built will be capable of full autonomy in 10 years." "That's going to happen much faster than people realise. It's going to be a great convenience, but there are many people whose job it is to drive," he said. "It will all be very disruptive and very quick. That disruption I'm talking about will take place over 20 years." "The traditional metric by which we measure social assistance currently is how it affects labour supply" #WorldGovSummit @joemfbrown pic.twitter.com/7ptbC9gY9M - World Gov Summit (@WorldGovSummit) February 14, 2017 Digital super intelligence, Musk noted, will "be like an alien" when compared to human beings. To counteract the disruption of the job market, some WGS speakers - such as Elizabeth Rhodes of Y Combinator - advocated for the implementation of a basic universal income. "The idea to give people a basic income as one of their human rights has always existed and is considered as a great measure to curtail crime," she said in a video-teleconference to the summit. "When machines replace jobs, there will be a real cost to educating people and filling the deficit of lost wages." But not everyone is convinced. Cade Metz, a WIRED magazine journalist who specializes in AI, said that a better option would be to teach humans to work with AI, rather than sit back and be replaced by it. "If we just give people money unconditionally, it can go two ways - either they will give back to society through creating something new or just while away their time playing video games," he said. "To avoid the latter, governments should focus on education and job training. While we still do not know how many jobs will be affected, we can prepare citizens to work with AI better to strike a balance." bernd@khaleejtimes.com Bernd Debusmann Jr. Originally from Mexico City, I've been in Dubai since January 2015.

After training in the United States and a one-year stint in Korea, she was deployed to Afghanistan where she took part in deadly firefights against the Taliban in Nuristan Province. Knox Museum Award-winning filmmaker Susan M. Sipprelle, center, winner of Best Feature Documentary at 2012 Massachusetts Independent Film Festival. Knox Museum Adria O. Horn , director of Maine Bureau of Veteran Services. Posted Feb. 14, 2017, at 10:56 a.m. ROCKLAND, Maine — Knox Museum will kick off Women’s History Month with a special screening of the new film, “Soldier On: Life After Deployment,” at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 1, at the Strand Theatre in Rockland. A panel discussion with award-winning filmmaker Susan M. Sipprelle, two of the women featured in her film, and key Maine women veterans, will be held immediately after the screening. Admission is free and all are welcome to attend. This program is funded by the Walmart Foundation. Susan M. Sipprelle is a documentary filmmaker and founder of Tree of Life Productions, producer of the award-winning documentary “Set for Life” and the online project “Over 50 and Out of Work. Soldier On: Life After Deployment,” her most recent project, makes its debut on public television in 2017. Sipprelle has been interviewed on network television about “Set for Life” and “Over 50 and Out of Work,” which have been featured in both print and online publications as well. In June 2011, Susan testified before the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee about unemployment among older Americans. Susan writes a regular column for StayThirsty.com and has also published articles in the Huffington Post, NextAvenue.org and The New York Times. Sipprelle was graduated with honors from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 2008, with distinction from New York University’s Stern School of Business in 1991 and cum laude from Williams College in 1980. She lives in the New York metropolitan area, but grew up in Rhode Island. She and her husband, Dwight, have five children. She is a member of New York Women in Film and Television and the Williams College Presidential Advisory Council, and she also serves on the board of the Newport Performing Arts Center. “Soldier On: Life After Deployment” documents the story of three women veterans confronting the challenges of readjusting to civilian life after their post 9-11 military service. The women in “Soldier On” are forthright about their many problems, while simultaneously managing to find moments of humor amidst their struggles and gradually reconnecting with the inner strength and resilience that has always defined them. Forever changed by their military service, the women adapt to find a new place in the civilian world. The film presents these women’s compelling and illuminating stories in the context of a civilian population that has little appreciation for the experiences and sacrifices of female veterans, who are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. veteran population. The complete integration of women into the armed services as well as their full access to veterans’ benefitsand the veteran community is a challenging work in process for the United States. “Soldier On: Life After Deployment” is part of that conversation and effort. Natasha Young, USMC Staff Sargent (Iraq 2005 and 2007) and SGT US Army Amanda Tejada (Afghanistan 2009), are two of the women featured in the film who will participate in the panel discussion following the screening; along with Joleen Lilley, OEF/OIF/OND Program Manager, at Togus VA; and Beth Parks, U.S. Army nurse, (Vietnam 1966-67). The panel will be moderated by MAJ Adria O. Horn, Director of Maine’s Bureau of Veterans Services. Horn, a West Point graduate, currently serves as a US Army Reservist with US Pacific Command, and has deployed in support of the Global War on Terror five times in her 14-year career. Mother of two, Adria met her husband in Baghdad where each was serving on coalition security details. They live on a 91-acre yak farm outside of Augusta.  For additional information contact Knox Museum at 354-8062 or infor@knoxmuseum.org. This post was contributed by a community member.

( REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) A new recession is coming, and Donald Trump needs it to begin sooner rather than later. As I explained last week, most American voters tend to care about their pocketbooks more than anything else. If the next recession were to officially start during the first quarter of 2017, it would be very easy for Trump to blame it on Obama, and then he could portray himself as the one who pulled the U.S. economy out of recession in time for the 2020 election. But if the next recession does not begin until 2018 or 2019, everybody is going to blame it on Trump, even if it is not his fault. In politics, who gets the blame for whatever goes wrong is often the most important thing, and if Trump wants to avoid blame for the next recession, he needs it to start as quickly as possible. For most of 2016, the mainstream media was warning that a new recession was probably coming no matter who won the election. For one example, just check out this Bloomberg article. And for once, the mainstream media was precisely correct. Barack Obama left us with an enormous economic mess, and it would take an economic miracle of unprecedented proportions to keep the U.S. economy from going into a recession at this point. During the Obama years, the U.S. went on a debt binge unlike anything we have ever seen before. The U.S. national debt almost doubled. During Obama's time in the White House, it increased from $10.6 trillion to nearly $20 trillion, and that means over $9 trillion of future consumption was brought into the present. That incredible boost to spending would have shot U.S. economic growth into the stratosphere during normal times, but because we were struggling so much all we got out of it was eight years of economic stagnation. In fact, Barack Obama was the only president in modern American history never to have a single year when the U.S. economy grew by at least 3 percent, and he had two terms to try to accomplish that goal. And remember, Obama also had the benefit of doctored economic numbers. John Williams of shadowstats.com tracks what the figures would look like if honest numbers were being used, and according to his calculations, the U.S. economy has actually continually been in a recession since 2005. In addition to government debt, other forms of debt are way out of control as well. The total amount of consumer debt in the United States has now hit $12 trillion, and corporate debt has approximately doubled since the last recession. When levels of debt grow much, much faster than the overall economy, it's inevitable that a crash will come. If you look back throughout history, I don't know if you can find a single example where debt has grown this quickly and a crash has not happened afterwards. By some miracle if we are able to avoid a major economic downturn this time, we will literally be defying the laws of economics. The employment crisis also threatens to get a lot worse in the months ahead. The mainstream media keeps trying to tell us that we are almost at "full employment," but the truth is that more than 100 million Americans do not have a job right now. Yes, there are a few areas of the country where jobs appear to be plentiful, but there are many more areas where they are not. For example, you will never, ever be able to convince 23-year-old Tyler Moore that the job market is good: Tyler Moore's late-December drive to Louisville, Kentucky, was one of desperation. He was headed four hours west on Interstate 64 to interview for a job. Even if he landed the position, filling his gas tank had left him with $8 to his name. He would have to sleep at a friend's place until he could earn enough to pay rent. The 23-year-old had run out of options. He'd applied for dozens of jobs within an hour and a half of his hometown of Lovely, once a coal-mining stronghold. Instead of opportunities, he had found waiting lists. "Minimum-wage jobs, fast-food restaurants, Wal-Mart, anything like that, a lot of them has already been took," he says in an Appalachian drawl, explaining that the backlog just to interview was as long as a year. "There are no jobs." If the U.S. economy is in "good shape", then why can't people like Moore find a job? Yes, there is a tremendous amount of optimism in the financial markets right now and the stock market has been soaring. But the exact same things were true in 2007, and we remember how that turned out. There is no possible way that the S&P 500 can continue to generate an 18 percent annual return without corresponding economic growth. The following comes from David Stockman: Altogether the S&P 500 now stands at 3.4 times its post-crisis low, having generated an 18 percent annual return (including dividends) for nearly eight years running. To be sure, in an honest free market, that very fact would be a flashing red light, warning that exceptionally high gains over an extended period necessitate a regression to the mean in the period ahead. A lot of people get caught up in trying to predict exactly when the stock market will crash, but what everybody should be able to agree on is that it will crash. There is no possible way that stocks can stay at such ridiculously overpriced levels indefinitely. Throughout history, stocks have always moved back in the direction of the long-term averages, and this time will be no exception. And just like last time, the beginning of a new recession will likely be accompanied by a major financial correction. In recent articles, I have been highlighting some of the reasons why it appears that a new recession is imminent. - Federal tax receipts have gone negative for the first time since the last recession. - Job growth at S&P 500 companies has gone negative for the very first time since the last recession. - The U.S. trade deficit in 2016 was the largest in four years. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1979648448" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1979648448" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement - Lending standards have tightened up for medium- and large-sized firms for six quarters in a row. - Lending standards are also tightening up for consumers. - We just saw the largest percentage decline in average weekly hours since the recession of 2008. - Gross private domestic investment is down. - Consumer bankruptcies are rising. - Commercial bankruptcies are rising as well. All of this is not necessarily bad news for Trump. A horrible recession started during the early years of Ronald Reagan's presidency, but the U.S. economy turned around later in his first term, and that momentum helped propel him to an easy victory in 1984. Similarly, Trump could actually take advantage of the coming economic downturn as long as he is able to pin all of the blame for it on the previous administration. If there is one thing that is true about U.S. voters, it is the fact that they tend to care about their own economic well-being more than anything else. If you doubt this, just check out the results of a recent Fox News poll... The latest Fox News Poll also asks, what defines the American Dream today? At the top, according to the national survey released Wednesday, is "retiring comfortably." Some 88 percent feel that is extremely or very important to realizing the dream. Next, 76 percent say "having a successful career" is important. That's followed by "raising a family" (74 percent) and "making a valuable contribution" to their community (74 percent). "Owning a home" is seen as a big part of achieving the dream for nearly 7 in 10 (69 percent). About 6 in 10 say "graduating college" (61 percent) and "being better off" than their parents (57 percent). To most Americans, being "successful in life" comes down to how much money they have. That should not be true, but it is. And this is ultimately what Trump will be judged on. If the economy is improving by 2020, voters will tend to evaluate him favorably. But if the economy is faltering during the next election season, it will be more difficult for him to get a second term. So what Trump and all those that support Trump should want is for the coming recession to begin and end as quickly as possible. However, there is also the possibility that the next recession may be a particularly bad one. Because we are in the midst of the biggest debt bubble in human history, any major downturn could ultimately spiral completely out of control. In other words, we may be facing the kind of crisis from which we never quite recover. One expert that is warning about such a scenario is legendary investor Jim Rogers: ... get prepared, because we're going to have the worst economic problems we've had in your lifetime or my lifetime, and when that happens, a lot of people are going to disappear. In 2008 Bear Stearns disappeared; Bear Stearns had been around over 90 years. Lehman Brothers disappeared. Lehman Brothers had been around over 150 years. A long, long time, a long glorious history they've been through wars, depression, civil war—they've been through everything, and yet they disappear. So the next time around, it's going to be worse than anything we've seen and a lot of institutions, people, companies even countries, certainly governments and maybe even countries are going to disappear. I hope you get very worried. When you start having bear markets, as you, I'm sure, well know, one bad thing happens and another bad thing happens and these things snowball, just like in bull markets, good news comes out then more good news comes out, the next thing you know, you're five or six or seven years into a bull market. Well, bear markets do the same thing, and so we have a lot of bad news on the horizon. I haven't even gotten to war. I haven't even gotten to trade war or anything like that but you know things do go wrong. If it is as bad as Rogers is suggesting, it wouldn't be too long before conditions in America would begin to resemble those portrayed in my novel. Let's hope that does not turn out to be the case. Let's hope that the next recession begins and ends as quickly as possible and that the U.S. economy is on a solid upswing by 2020. And if you are a Trump supporter, don't be too dismayed if the U.S. economy takes a major downturn in 2017. As I discussed above, it could actually be just the thing that Trump needs to set the stage for another election victory in 2020.

Need proof? Just ask Target, which suffered a supply chain disaster this summer over falsely labeled Egyptian cotton sheets, prompting other major retailers including Walmart, JC Penney and Bed Bath & Beyond to investigate the labeling and sourcing of their Welspun-made sheets and other textiles. In addition to ensuring authenticity, traceability is important for ensuring the quality and safety of virtually every product on the market. Customers are increasingly demanding traceability and transparency — and to this end we are seeing leading companies like Target pledging transparency and traceability for all chemicals used across its operations and in its products. And now a new ISO committee has been formed to make this task easier. There are an overwhelming number of chain-of-custody management systems and programs — for food safety, sustainable agriculture or compliance in manufacturing — and they all have their own semantics, presentation and industry focus. But the sheer number of such systems adds unnecessary layers of administration, thereby increasing costs and pushing smaller companies out of international markets, ISO says. With this in mind a new ISO project committee, ISO/PC 308, Chain of custody, was established to make traceability simpler for all supply chain actors by using a uniform ISO language globally. The upcoming ISO standard will also reduce unnecessary duplication, said chair of ISO/PC 308 Rob Busink. “The proliferation of traceability systems and definitions is causing unnecessary confusion, complexity and costs for players in different supply chains,” Busink said. “The proposed generic chain-of-custody standard will define supply chain models and the respective traceability levels and specific requirements related to administration, conversion rates and physical handling activities, thus simplifying market access by using a uniform language and criteria throughout the supply chain.” Categories Manufacturing, Supply ChainTags Bed Bath & Beyond, ISO, JC Penney, Target, traceability, Walmart Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

JAMES PARK Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Related Stories Prisoner suffers miscarriage in Ottawa cell as her cries for help were ignored Alyssa Bennett says there was no ambulance after she suffered a miscarriage in her Ottawa jail cell, just a strip search, a pair of handcuffs and a ride to the hospital alone in the back of a prisoner transport van. That was after the 28-year-old watched a nurse flush the toilet that contained the fetal remains, she says. “I was crying and I was a little bit hysterical because, in my eyes, I’m looking in the toilet and seeing my child,” said Bennett, who spoke publicly Friday for the first time since her miscarriage at the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre on Jan. 25. Bennett had been in the jail after failing to appear to serve an intermittent sentence on weekends. She had also stolen a bottle of Grey Goose vodka and $227 worth of items from a Walmart. Bennett’s case garnered widespread attention after a judge described the treatment she suffered inside the jail as “nightmarish and inhumane.” A court heard about how the woman, who was 13 weeks pregnant, failed to receive medical treatment before the miscarriage, despite two weeks of bleeding and repeated attempts by her defence lawyer, social worker, Elizabeth Fry Society worker and even a Crown attorney to get her to a hospital. The Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services has since launched an investigation into her treatment. It wouldn’t comment Friday on the investigation or on Bennett’s allegations about the treatment she received. Bennett said that from the moment she arrived at the jail within a day or two of her arrest on Jan. 11, she told staff she was concerned about her condition. “I made them aware I was not only pregnant, that I was bleeding and it was a condition that I was worried about,” Bennett said. Bennett said the jail did take her to hospital on Jan. 16, and tests determined there was no heartbeat, that the pregnancy wasn’t viable and that she would need to schedule a medical procedure to remove tissue from her uterus. However, it is unclear whether anyone ever scheduled an appointment. Bennett said she was told an appointment had been scheduled shortly after learning the pregnancy wasn’t viable; however, an email obtained by the Citizen from the health-care manager to the jail social worker indicates that, as of Jan. 24 — eight days after the hospital visit — no appointment had yet been made. Bennett said she had also been told that nothing would be addressed until her condition worsened. By then, Bennett said, she was experiencing increasingly severe cramping. “I told them, ‘I am starting to cramp really bad, and I need to get looked at.'” The morning of the miscarriage, she said, the head of the nursing department assured her he would take care of her in what she described as a religious and paternalistic manner. By this time, she had been in the jail nearly two weeks. “He told me that, at the end of the day, this is just a job to him, that he has someone else to answer to and that is God and that he doesn’t want to have to answer to God and say why he didn’t give this lady this proper treatment,” she said. The head of the nursing department also told her “He is a married man and he has children so women’s needs are very, very important to him,” said Bennett, who ultimately was returned to her cell. “I don’t feel like he would let his wife or his daughter suffer for that long,” Bennett said. Bennett said she was in cell No. 5 in the women's unit of the jail when she started to miscarry. The room is just big enough for two bunks, a toilet, a sink and a small metal desk. “I started yelling for an officer to come, for a CO to come. I had my roommate bang on the cell and a girl across from her started banging because we were like ‘We need help down here, we need help,'” said Bennett, who said she felt herself passing something into the toilet. “No one’s coming.” Bennett said it took at least 10 minutes for someone to arrive. It was a male correctional officer. “My roommate is doing most of the banging because I couldn’t stand up, I was bleeding so bad,” she said. “I was kind of starting to cry.” Bennett said after help arrived she was being comforted by her cellmate when a nurse flushed the toilet. She was then taken to the admitting and discharge area, she said, where she was strip searched and handcuffed before being sent to hospital in the prisoner van. She noticed paramedics were already at the jail when she left, but apparently it was for a male inmate with chest pains, she said. Bennett then spent a night at The Ottawa Hospital’s General campus before receiving the procedure recommended by a doctor nine days earlier. Bennett said the strip search was the only physical examination she received while at the jail. She said she only met with a doctor three times; twice to discuss medication, and once to fill out a form for the medical procedure she required. “They never checked the bleeding, never checked the pads,” Bennett said. “You feel helpless. I can’t go and call 911 myself. I’d get sent to the hole if I dialled 911 myself.” When she left the hospital, she was again handcuffed. This time they also shackled her, she said. Bennett — whose 2 1/2-year-old son was killed in a crash with an impaired driver and whose parents have both died — said she started using drugs to cope with the loss. She survives on $600 a month in welfare. She said the treatment she received left her feeling angry. “I’m a human being and I deserve to be treated better than that. It’s inexcusable, from my point of view. There’s no excuse,” said Bennett, who wiped away tears. “It’s like you’re a criminal and so you don’t deserve to get treated like a human being.” As Advertised in the Edmonton SUN Inmate says she was strip-searched, handcuffed after jail-cell miscarriage By Andrew Seymour First posted: Friday, February 10, 2017 04:12 PM MST | Updated: Friday, February 10, 2017 06:04 PM MST Alyssa Bennett says there was no ambulance after she suffered a miscarriage in her Ottawa jail cell, just a strip search, a pair of handcuffs and a ride to the hospital alone in the back of a prisoner transport van. That was after the 28-year-old watched a nurse flush the toilet that contained the fetal remains, she says. “I was crying and I was a little bit hysterical because, in my eyes, I’m looking in the toilet and seeing my child,” said Bennett, who spoke publicly Friday for the first time since her miscarriage at the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre on Jan. 25.

Hot Topics: Missing mother, child Longmont home prices double SpaceX payload 'Neptune will rise again' Mike MacIntyre contract News tips Print   Email   Font Resize Opinion: Editorials From the Editorial Advisory Board: Bank ban Posted:   02/10/2017 08:30:30 PM MST Customer Kathy Bales leaves the Well Fargo Bank on the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder on Wednesday morning. The night before, Boulder City Council approved a surprise temporary ban on new building permits for financial institutions. The ban, effective immediately, runs for 120 days and applies to ground-floor spaces on Pearl Street between Ninth and 18th streets. (Paul Aiken / Staff Photographer) This week's topic: Boulder City Council has imposed a temporary ban on new ground-floor banks on Pearl Street downtown. Your thoughts?   In the agenda packet for this past Tuesday's City Council meeting, staff stated that the nine blocks of Pearl Street between 9th and 18th have "long been the heart of Boulder" and that in order "to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city" that council needed to take EMERGENCY(!) action. Egads, what were they going to do? Was City Council finally going to do something to help eliminate the lack of adequate shelter for the homeless that hang out day and night on the Pearl Street Mall? Were they going to solve the problem of overnight camping in City Park? Were they going to clean up the growing piles of trash and human feces spread up and down Boulder Creek? The hopes of the citizenry were on edge as they waited for their appointed leaders to announce their plan of action to save the "heart of the city." And then there it was. By the slimmest of margins, voting 5 to 4, council drew a line in the sand. No more banks on the first floor on Pearl Street. Yes, in spite of the fact that there are nearly 100 retail stores and over 60 bars/restaurants/coffee shops in these nine blocks, City Council had determined that four, soon to be five, banks were on the verge of creating a Pearl Street Armageddon. Rest easy tonight fellow citizens. Your beloved city has been saved. Chuck Wibby, cxwibby1@gmail.com   Boulder has a vibrant downtown. The diverse shopping and dining options draw visitors from all over the world. The money visitors and residents spend generates sales tax revenues that fund amenities like open space and arts. These attractions then lure more visitors. It's a virtuous cycle. It doesn't happen by accident. All across America, city and town centers have died. Their downtowns lost business to suburban malls and big-box stores like Walmart. They didn't implement policies that supported economic vitality. With the decay of their centers, towns lose their sense of community and connection. Main streets lined with boarded-up restaurants and empty retail spaces provide no places for people to come together and little entrepreneurial opportunity. Citizens are disconnected and reluctant to invest in their downtowns. This is a vicious cycle. It happens when there is a failure of leadership. Our city leaders have consistently taken steps to maintain a healthy and successful community. We preserved open space, created the pedestrian mall and pushed back on giant big-box retailers. Efforts to revitalize the Hill area are underway right now. A balance of chain stores, restaurants, financial services and unique independent retailers has been part of the magic of Pearl Street. There is nothing wrong with banks, but they don't generate city sales tax and they don't draw many people to downtown. It's prudent to make sure their proliferation doesn't displace other diverse types of business. Judy Amabile, Jamabile570@earthlink.net   Lions, and tigers, and BANKS! Oh my! Boulder law requires that council can change a zoning ordinance only upon the recommendation of the planning board, following a duly noticed public hearing. On Tuesday, council "suspended" this requirement and passed on first reading an ordinance that banned banks from central Pearl Street — without consulting the planning board, notifying the affected public or involving stakeholders at all. Sound familiar? I haven't decided whether banning banks is sound policy. I've been too busy scanning the horizon for the emergency that might justify council's abandonment of regular process. So I watched the meeting replay, hoping to understand. I was not reassured. Mayor Jones called the action on first reading a "timeout." But it's no such thing. Having passed on first reading, it's actually a "pending ordinance," meaning it has the force of law for 120 days. Council has that amount of time to finish the enactment, and the recording made clear that this is what they intend to do. Moving by surprise was thus a preemptive strike against the law's likely opponents and businesses it will affect. Bob Yates called it "sneaky." When others expressed doubts, Matt Applebaum snapped, like a salesman waiting for a customer to sign a contract, "Come on, this isn't that big a deal!" Actually, it is a big deal. Suspending legal process by fiat is not OK in Washington, and it's not OK in Boulder. Council should take a mulligan, unless they want to invite more odious comparisons. John Tweedy, john@landlockedfilms.com   City Council is right that the number of banks downtown has proliferated in the last several years. For the city that means fewer tax dollars from the sales tax generated by retail sales. For retailers and restaurants it means less foot traffic upon which these businesses depend. Walnut Street is a case in point: It has become a place to avoid for a retailer because the banks and other non-retail businesses have created a downtown "dead zone." It is eerily quiet and devoid of pedestrian traffic. It is laudable that City Council wants Pearl Street — the aorta of downtown — to avoid the same fate. But City Council has rushed in hastily and taken a sledgehammer to an issue that is complicated and has a number of stakeholders to consider. It is not just banks that have taken up space in the ground-floor storefronts. There are also ad agencies, production studios and co-op work spaces for startups. This ordinance would have no impact on them. Council has once again signaled an arrogant and paternal attitude by not seeking any input from those with the expertise and experience to address this issue in a meaningful way, including Downtown Boulder Partnership (disclosure: I am a board member), the Downtown Management Commission, and the Downtown Business Improvement District. Rather than tampering with the Land Use Code in this cavalier manner, City Council has got to reach out to solve this problem. Fern O'Brien, fobrien@fobrienlaw.com   Trump channeling. Without consulting with stakeholders, the temporary ban on banks on the mall is an example of, "I know what's good for Boulder because I'm the only one who knows what's good for Boulder." We've heard this sort of reasoning from the Twitter Troll for way too long. It's unexpected and unacceptable from our City Council. Not many of us are great fans of bankers. These are the folks who bought derivatives without knowing what they purchased. They almost tanked our economy. More recently, one major bank was caught opening accounts for customers without the customers' knowledge. They act like students from the bottom of the business school class who, having failed at used car sales, looked to banking as a profession. Finding a sinecure for the simple in suits, they build or buy these edifices to themselves that are difficult to get to unless you want to walk some distance. The buildings are bricks and mortar write-offs against huge profits from overdraft charges and usurious credit card interest. When have you had a good experience with a banker? My last set-to with a banker was when, while pompously shuffling my papers, I got a Dodd-Frank lecture. "Dodd-Frank has made my job very, very difficult?" he concluded. "You mean it's like real work?" I asked. But banks have as much a right to occupy space on the mall as any other retail enterprise. Good for the four council members who voted against this ban.

"Retailers are saying, and we're fully in line with them, that the border adjustment tax is a consumer tax, a consumption tax," Alexandre Ricard told reporters in London. Ricard's comments come the same week that the chief executives of some of America's largest retailers, including Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc head to Washington to try to kill the tax. "I don't think it's fair to the American consumer," Ricard said of the proposal by Republican lawmakers to impose a 20 percent tax on imports. The U.S. arm of the maker of Absolut vodka, Martell cognac and Mumm champagne has joined "Americans for Affordable Products," a group of over 100 businesses opposed to the tax. The lobby group, launched earlier this month, includes other distillers Diageo North America and LVMH, as well as retailers including Walmart, Nike and Walgreens Boots Alliance, according to its website.

But for some products, like blended Scotch, there is flexibility. For example, Ricard said it was possible to blend Scotch in Scotland and ship it to the United States in bulk in inert containers to be bottled locally. He said such a move could be more efficient regardless of any border tax, since shipping whisky in bulk is lighter than shipping it in bottles. "Maybe, it's something one could consider despite all of that," Ricard told Reuters. "I would say it's something we should do anyway for environmental reasons."

The little boy witnessed a nasty fight between his mom, Kailyn, and his stepdad, Javi, on the Jan. 30 episode of ‘Teen Mom 2.’ Apparently, Javi showed up to Kailyn’s house unannounced, and she wasn’t very happy because she had a ‘special guest’ over. To find out what happened, read our recap below! Kailyn and Javi already got into a few arguments after he returned home from deployment, but their fight on the Jan. 30 episode of Teen Mom 2 was bigger than the others. It was so nasty, in fact, that Kailyn begged Jo to come take Isaac for the week — she didn’t want him to witness any more drama than he already had. Their fight originated when Javi showed up to Kailyn’s house unannounced. He just wanted to get his stuff. She told him to wait an hour before stopping by because she was “at Walmart,” but when he drove by and saw her car, he thought he’d drop Lincoln off and get his stuff. However, when he knocked on the door, she wouldn’t allow him to come in because she had a guest over. Obviously, it was a male guest, so Javi freaked and they just had a huge argument. Kailyn refused to film after it happened, and cameras failed to catch the initial drama, so we were left to hear about everything from Javi and his friends. Meanwhile, Jenelle tried her best to keep her pregnancy a secret from her mom. She and David took Barbara and Jace to the plot of land they bought, but Jenelle’s stomach was popping out of her shirt. Even so, she still denied having a bun in the oven. She and David told producers they want to wait until they know the gender before telling everyone the good news. Click here to see more pics from ‘Teen Mom 2’! And speaking of waiting, Chelsea and Cole decided that it’d be best to put their wedding on hold. Chelsea said she didn’t want to plan a wedding while pregnant, so they’d still get married legally, but put the wedding on hold until after the baby’s born. Oh yeah, and Adam showed up to Aubree‘s baseball game, where he yelled at producers and told them to get the cameras out of his face. He’s so pleasant. Lastly, Leah and Corey were left to deal with the aftermath of the flooding in West Virginia. The twins’ school was closed, so they were forced to pick another school for them. They both expected to fight about it, but surprisingly, they came to a reasonable conclusion rather quickly — without arguing!

These three DIYs are exactly that. Whether they’re filled with love notes, candy or just come as they are, these handmade tokens of love are little reminders that someone in your life is special. I hope you have a little extra time this week (or weekend) to play around with some materials you may already have on hand and see what you come up with! Click through for instructions to make this Hanging Valentine Patch Pocket and for two more sweet Valentine’s gifts including a Custom Clipboard and a Ribbon Covered Heart that harkens back to the days when boxes of chocolates came festooned with a lot of ruffles and ribbons! –Caitlin *This post is brought to you in collaboration with Waverly Inspirations. This project, ideas, and words are from us here at D*S and were created by us, for you. Thanks for supporting our sponsors that help us create and publish original content like this. The Waverly Inspirations collection is available at Walmart. Hanging Valentine Patch Pocket Materials 2 differently patterned fabrics (We used Waverly Inspirations classic gingham and polka dot fabrics) Glue gun & glue Scissors Embroidery needle Embroidery floss or yarn Ruler Light cardboard Ribbon (We used Waverly Inspirations double ruffle edge ribbon in red and their scalloped grosgrain ribbon with white edging detail) Steps 1. Cut two 5″ x 4″ rectangles of the fabric that will be the background for the heart pocket. 2. Cut out a heart shape from the fabric you’ve chosen to be your patch pocket. Make sure it fits nicely on your background, with at least 2″ of background fabric surrounding the edge of the heart shape. (You’ll be cutting a heart shape from the background fabric too, so you’ll need room on the sides of the patch pocket.) 3. Turn your patch pocket heart shape over so that it’s right side down. Using your glue gun, apply hot glue to the edge of the heart pocket beginning at the top of right, top part of the heart, working your way around to the same spot on the left side of the heart. Be sure to leave the edge in between the two peaks of the heart shape unglued so you can actually use it as a pocket and put something in it! (Bottom line is don’t glue the entire heart on the background!) 4. Once your patch pocket heart is glued to the background, thread your needle and knot it. Start the process of sewing the patch pocket heart onto the background by bringing the needle through both the background fabric and the patch fabric from underneath. Once you’ve pierced both fabrics, pull your needle and thread all the way through until your knot stops underneath the fabric. Bring your needle just past the edge of the patch (on the background fabric) and push through to the underside. Repeat this process, left to right, from the same places on the patch heart peaks that you laid your hot glue on. Again, be sure to leave the edge in between the two peaks of the heart shape unattached so you can actually use it as a pocket and put something in it! 5. Cover one side of your cardboard with your wet glue using a paintbrush. Attach the background fabric with your attached patch pocket to the cardboard. 6. Cut an 8″ length of ribbon and match the two cut ends together and apply hot glue in between them so the ends stick together. Turn the cardboard over and apply hot glue about 2″ from the deep “V” point of the heart. Press the ribbon loop into the hot glue to attach it to the cardboard. 7. Cover the ribbon side of your cardboard with your wet glue using a paintbrush. Attach the second rectangle of background fabric to this side of the cardboard. Let dry. 8. Following the outline of the smaller patch pocket heart, cut through the cardboard, making a larger heart shape around the patch pocket heart. 9. Stuff your pocket with love notes or candy and hang in a spot to surprise someone you love! Ribbon Heart Materials Light cardboard Ribbon (We used Waverly Inspirations double ruffle edge ribbon in red and their scalloped grosgrain ribbon with white edging detail) Hot glue gun Pencil Ruler Steps Draw a line in the middle of a 5″ x 6″piece of cardboard. Cut lengths of ribbon to attach in a diagonal pattern on each side of the line. Using a hot glue gun, glue the ribbons to the cardboard on one side of the line. Repeat on the opposite of the line. Cut a heart shape out of the ribbon covered cardboard. Experiment with some more with fabric, ribbon and other embellishments. Cut hearts out of your results! Give to someone you love! P.S. These are great grouped together in a small fabric wrapped box with a sweet note. I Heart U Clipboard Materials Paintbrush (We used Waverly Inspirations 1/2″ stiff craft brush) Clipboard Craft Paint (We used: Red – Waverly Inspirations High Gloss Multi-Surface Acrylic Paint in Crimson, Silver – Waverly Inspirations Metallic Multi-Surface Acrylic Paint in Silver, White (to make light pink) – Waverly Inspirations Multi-Surface Acrylic Paint in White Opal) Stick-on letters Masking or painters tape Steps 1. Tape off an area on the clip board on the diagonal. 2. Place the letters that spell out your message in the lower right corner working right to left to make sure that all of your letters fit. If you’re using a heart in your message, cut it out and place it with tape on the back to hold it in place. 3. Trace gently around the heart if you’re using one. You’ll be painting this freehand. 4. Remove the wax paper from the adhesive on the letters and attach them to the clipboard surface. 5. Paint in between your taped diagonal area. Use two coats for maximum coverage, letting the paint dry between coats. 6. Mix different paints together to create a custom color and finish like we did here. We mixed a high gloss red with a glittered white. Use your custom color for your heart or to embellish your diagonal metallic stripe. We added high gloss red scalloped edge to our metallic edge and then dotted on our custom color to create a faux eyelet. 7. Clip a love note to the board and stash it where your Valentine will discover it! jen says: February 10, 2017 at 2:48 pm who is the green head artwork by?

Apple closed on Monday at $133.29 a share, surpassing its record closing high price of $133, set in February 2015. The stock is up more than 15 percent in 2017, gaining nearly $100 billion in market cap in just six weeks. It's also just points away from a split adjusted price of $1,000 a share. Perhaps what's even more impressive is the move from its 52-week low in May. The stock has rallied nearly 50 percent and gained more than $200 billion in market cap in just nine months. For context, that market cap gain from the low is larger than the total market cap of 488 companies in the S&P 500, including Visa, Pfizer and Verizon. It's $1 billion less than Wal-Mart, and it's bigger than American Express, Mondelez and Netflix combined. Even as the stock has come so far, many on Wall Street still consider the tech darling undervalued. In a note Monday, UBS said Apple's services business was underappreciated by the market, and estimated that if its services were valued similarly to that of PayPal, the stock could rise another 10 percent. Goldman Sachs also published a note Monday raising its price target on the stock to $150, citing growing confidence in the outlook for the iPhone 8 cycle in the second half of the year. "I still think there's room to run, and we've seen that with Wall Street analysts. We've seen that target price keep moving up, along with the stock. And so it's still trading about 5 percent below the consensus target price," Erin Gibbs told CNBC's "Trading Nation" on Monday. "One of the things we're still seeing is really higher expectations for growth for not only this year but for the following fiscal year," said the equity chief investment officer at S&P Global. "There's a lot of positive news about their augmented reality technology, and so I think this is a still a stock to hold." According to Ari Wald of Oppenheimer, the charts are setting up for an even sweeter rally. "The charts are bullish. They argue for a sustainable breakout here, and that the stock should be bought," he said Monday on "Trading Nation." Wald pointed to a rising 200-day moving average and a striking similarity to a previous trend for his bullishness. "The first thing you'll note is that it has a rising 200-day moving average. So that's indicative of the stock's bullish trend that it's possessed for a couple of months now," he said. "Another reason why we think it goes higher is just the similarities to how this stock traded back in the second half of 2013, into 2014; that after a year of decline, you can see in that prior period, that the 200-day started to push higher, pull back to that 200-day, great buying opportunities, and then that final inflection which really marked the sustainable turn. We're seeing very similar price action."

February 14, 2017 By Rich Barlow Share closemore Economists overwhelmingly would vote to tax the carbon content of fuels to curtail climate change. Could the carbon tax win over the climate-change-denying troglodytes in the GOP? Pictured: In this Jan. 20, 2015 file photo, steam billows from the chimney of a coal-fired Merrimack Station in Bow, N.H. (Jim Cole/AP) COMMENTARY A rogue band of tax-loving socialists just declared war on capitalism by suggesting the government impose a jobs-killing levy on pollution. Could anything be more un-American in Donald Trump’s United States? If there were an emoticon for facetiousness, it would go here. The lefties to whom I refer are heavy hitters on the Republican academic and political benches — secretaries of state for Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush; the chairmen of Reagan’s and George W. Bush’s economic advisers’ councils; W’s treasury secretary; and the former chairman of Walmart. And their proposed carbon tax would be the soundest move we could make against climate change. Which is why the biggest obstacle to this GOP proposal likely will be our GOP president. But I digress. The background: If you’re curious about the best strategy for curtailing climate change, economists, who tend to be a conservative bunch, overwhelmingly would vote for a tax on the carbon content of fuels, for eminently conservative reasons. “The beauty of a carbon tax is its market-based simplicity,” wrote Laura D’Andrea Tyson, Bill Clinton’s top economic adviser. “Economists since Adam Smith have insisted that prices are by far the most efficient way to guide the decisions of producers and consumers. Carbon emissions have an ‘unpriced’ societal cost in terms of their deleterious effects on the earth’s climate. A tax on carbon would reflect these costs and send a powerful price signal that would discourage carbon emissions.” Other places (Ireland, Sweden, the Canadian province of British Columbia) tax carbon. The alternatives to a tax, Tyson wrote — climate change denial not counting as a serious alternative — are either more expensive (subsidizing clean fuels) or “second-best” (complicated regulations of emissions, as in President Obama’s Clean Power Plan). That regulation is more bureaucratic and cumbersome than a tax may explain an observation by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat: Every Republican who wants to address climate change favors the tax route. The new Republican plan confirms his point. It would impose a $40-per-ton tax on carbon dioxide emissions, rising over time. (Whitehead, who's from Rhode Island, has proposed a similar tax.) The proceeds would be rebated to consumers, with the average family of four getting an estimated $2,000 a year. To prevent other nations without carbon taxes from getting a competitive advantage on their imports to us, the plan would slap fees on those products to jack up their prices. Finally, fossil fuel companies would be indemnified against future lawsuits for any environmental damage they’ve done. The graybeards backing the tax would use it to replace the Clean Power Plan, which I supported as a way to bypass a do-nothing Congress. (The plan relies on the executive branch’s regulatory authority, not congressional approval.) A carbon tax is a better approach, and at any rate, Obama’s plan is tied up in court challenges. But repealing it outright without substituting a carbon tax, as Trump has threatened, should be a deal-breaker. Opposition to the tax might be expected from a president who called climate change a Chinese-baked “hoax” and nominated an anti-environmentalist to safeguard the environment. (On the other hand, Secretary of State and former oilman Rex Tillerson favors a tax.) More surprising perhaps is likely objection from some in the green movement, who will balk at spending the tax proceeds on consumer rebates rather than clean fuels, and at letting fossil fuel companies off the hook. The first objection particularly has some merit. A carbon tax would address an impressive 80 percent of our contribution to global warming, yet it wouldn’t touch methane, a greenhouse gas given off by landfills and agriculture operations. But greenies should remember their own mantra: Climate change is the transcendent environmental threat of our time. If easing the tax burden on consumers is the compromise required to win over tax cut-loving, climate-change-denying troglodytes in the GOP, it’s worth it. A Yale survey found 66 percent of registered voters would support a carbon tax with accompanying cuts in other taxes. Even 48 percent of Trump voters agreed fossil fuel companies should be taxed. This is not to deny that a carbon tax will be a formidably heavy lift politically. But as the Republican economists behind the plan wrote, their tax “would be pro-growth, pro-competitiveness, and pro-working class, which aligns perfectly with President Trump’s stated agenda.” If only they can overcome that part of the president’s agenda that is pro-facts-be-damned.

The spirits industry is regulated by provenance rules whereby cognac and champagne cannot be produced outside of their designated namesake regions in France, or tequila outside of Mexico, the subject of Trump’s proposed 20 percent levy on exports to the U.S., Chief Executive Officer Alexandre Ricard said Tuesday. The distiller is putting its case with “a huge group of members,” including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and retail associations, “because they view this potential border tax just as a consumer tax,” Ricard said in an interview with Anna Edwards on Bloomberg TV.  “If your cost of imports increases via taxes, the only way to cope with it is to pass it on to consumers, which is not nice to consumers, but we don’t have much of a choice,” he said. Ricard weighs in on the impact of a possible U.S. border tax. (Source: Bloomberg) A border tax could also lead to inflation in the U.S. and weigh on consumption, Pernod Ricard’s Chief Financial Officer Gilles Bogaert said on a call with investors last week. A slowdown would come as the company exports record numbers of cases of its Martell cognac and Jameson Irish whiskey to the U.S., its largest market by sales. Pernod Ricard last week reported first-half earnings that beat estimates as sales of Jameson extended a seven-year surge and revenue in Asia rebounded.

Two weeks ago I wrote about how I -- an impulse shopper with a kitchen-gadget fetish who doesn't even cook all that much -- just had to have this popular seven-function pressure cooker. Almost couldn't find one. Freaked out. Eventually ordered one. Couldn't wait to get it. Promptly forgot about it. Ignored it when it arrived. And left it unopened in my entryway for days. I confessed in this space: "I can report that I have found an eighth function for it. Until I get around to skimming the manual, trying it once and forgetting about it again, the Instant Pot makes a great Instant Doorstop!" Well, the saga continues. First, I wish to thank you -- all the food-prep-fixated who took time away from watching Tasty videos, saving recipes on Pinterest and obsessing over that 60 Second Salad Maker on Kickstarter (that slatted plastic bowl that allows one to wash, drain, slice and toss salad all at once! Oh my gravy warmer, how I covet!) to write to me. You all made me feel not so alone. One kindred kitchen spirit wrote: "I'll be keeping an eye out for you in every kitchen section of each store I go into ... especially the kitchen store in Branson (oh my, my heart is a flutter thinking about the place)." Several who had bought the pot encouraged me to plug it in, like the reader who wrote this: "The Instant Pot will bring you delicious food in a short amount of time. Tastes like gourmet and cooked all day. If leftovers, or 'used food' as my dad called it, are your thing, then by all means clear freezer room for yourself and sit back and enjoy more evenings." Finally, I was ready to assess its pot-ential. I opened the box, removed the contraption and all its accessories and thumbed through the owner's manual, familiarizing myself with parts like the venting knob, float valve and anti-block shield. Next, I was ready for the water test -- a quick run-through to heat water and generate steam. I waited. I waited some more. So much for "instant," as it took more than 10 minutes to reach high pressure in order to begin the two-minute test. Lesson learned: Cook time and overall preparation time are two different things. While the Instant Pot does cook food quickly, it requires plenty of heating time. Having passed the water test, I was ready to give it a whirl and cook rice. Right after I posted a picture to social media to prove, yes, I finally was using the thing. Wait, what's that in the picture? On its left side? Is that ... a giant dent?! I was so busy studying the manual, I never bothered to study the condition of the pot. While it was anchored firmly in foam in the pristine shipping box, somehow the Instant Pot had arrived damaged. I pulled the plug and repackaged it for a return. I'd just ship it back to Wal-Mart and exchange it. No! I'd have to wait too long (even though clearly I had been fine without it, not even bothering to open it). I elected to return it to the Wal-Mart store the next day and exchange it in person. I did return it to the store, but I was unable to exchange as there were none in stock. Fine. I'd go back to Walmart.com and buy another 6-quart pot. Oh no! Sold out with no estimated shipping dates available! I'd go to Amazon.com. Again, sold out, and it wouldn't be shipped for one to two months! This impulse buyer just had to accept the fact that she just couldn't have what she wanted now and that she'd have to wait. Nah! Instead, I ordered the immediately available 8-quart, more expensive model that I could have in two days! Friends teased me that it would just be a bigger Instant Doorstop. But the very day it arrived, in flawless form this time, I performed the water test and found an online meatball recipe (tinyurl.com/ipmeatballs) to try. I marveled as I used the pot to saute my own marinara and then pressure-cook meatballs, which were done -- no browning required and no kidding -- in five mere minutes. I think Instant Pot and I are going to be very happy together. In fact, I haven't even put it away! Not because I've used it since (I haven't). But because I haven't yet cleared enough cupboard storage space for the giant thing. Email: jchristman@arkansasonline.com What's in a Dame is a smirk at pop culture.

The Japanese nuclear and energy conglomerate saw its shares drop 8 per cent in Asian trading after it delayed an earnings release detailing the scale of a multibillion-dollar writedown. Then, five hours later, the company released unaudited numbers showing $6.3bn writedown on its nuclear unit and announced that its chairman, Shigenori Shiga, would step down. The financial mess engulfing the company reflects massive cost overruns and delays linked to several nuclear projects in the US and experts say it will cast a shadow over the future of the global nuclear industry. Toshiba has said it will withdraw from nuclear plant construction overseas. (FT, NAR, Reuters) In the news First man down Donald Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn has resigned, becoming the fledgling administration’s first high-level departure. The retired general was accused of illegally discussing US policy with a Russian diplomat weeks before Donald Trump’s inauguration, then misleading the White House about the conversation. It has also emerged that the justice department warned Mr Trump that Mr Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail late last month. (FT, WaPo) New leader for Hamas Yahya Sinwar, a founding member of the Hamas military wing, has been chosen as head of the militant group in secret elections, replacing Ismail Haniyeh. Sentenced to four life terms by Israel, Mr Sinwar was freed in a prisoner swap in 2011 after serving 20 years in jail. His appointment is seen as a message of defiance towards Israel. (Jazeera) A taxing reform Lawyers for the EU and other US trading partners have begun laying the groundwork for a legal challenge to a US border tax proposal in a move that could trigger the biggest case in World Trade Organisation history.

Here are the major trends that will shape the industry in the coming year. Joe Tenebruso (TMFGuardian) Feb 13, 2017 at 7:15PM 2017 has been most unkind to traditional retailers. Data source: YCharts.  Assailed by the relentless and merciless rise of e-commerce, brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling to adapt to an increasingly online world. Will this retail destruction continue in the year ahead? And what are the major retail trends that investors should watch? Read on to find out. Image source: Getty Images. Department-store carnage Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD) -- the parent company of Sears and Kmart -- may not survive the year, with these once iconic retailers besieged by a poisonous combination of plunging sales, massive losses, and dwindling cash reserves. CEO Eddie Lampert has turned to creative financing deals and fire sales of most of Sears' best assets to raise the capital needed to fund the company's operations, but even these drastic measures are likely to only delay Sears' seemingly inevitable demise. Other department-store chains, such as Macy's (NYSE:M), J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP), and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), have also seen their stock prices plummet as they struggle with falling traffic and declining comparable-store sales. Consumer buying habits continue to shift away from their core mall-based operations, with department-store sales down for 11 years in a row, according to data from the Commerce Department. In response, these chains are attempting to adapt by closing stores and slashing expenses, but cost cuts can only go so far. Ultimately, Kohl's and Macy's shareholders' best hope may be a sale to a private equity firm or another retailer. J.C. Penney has an even tougher road ahead, and if the heavily indebted retailer doesn't significantly improve its profitability and cash-flow generation, it could head down a path similar to that of Sears Holdings. All told, the department-store industry appears to be in a state of secular decline, and these retailers' ongoing struggles will be a major storyline to watch in 2017. No reprieve for discounters Even discount chains such as Target (NYSE:TGT) and the mighty Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) have seen their sales and margins dented by intensifying competition. For decades, these discount chains were the disruptors; with their wide selection of goods and low prices, they steadily claimed market share from their higher-priced and often smaller rivals. Now, however, it's these massive retailers that are losing share to an even more disruptive threat: the relentless rise of e-commerce. And this global megatrend is being spearheaded by the juggernaut that is Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Can anyone challenge Amazon? Without the cost burdens and physical limitations of a store base, Amazon -- along with its army of third-party sellers -- is able to offer an even wider selection of goods and often lower prices than its still primarily brick-and-mortar rivals. Even more worrisome for traditional retailers is that Amazon dominates consumer mindshare when it comes to shopping online. In fact, a report by marketing firm BloomReach shows that 55% of consumers begin their searches on the e-commerce titan's website when shopping online, up from 44% in 2015. During that time, the percentage of shoppers whose searches originated at all other retailers' sites combined fell from 21% to only 16%, with search engines holding the remaining share. It appears that "Amazon" is increasingly becoming synonymous with shopping in the minds of consumers. To combat this trend, Wal-Mart and Target are investing aggressively in their e-commerce operations. Target is largely focused on improving its website, strengthening its supply chain, and utilizing more of its stores to fulfill online orders. Wal-Mart's efforts are highlighted by its $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet.com, which the company hopes will help it gain ground on Amazon. Yet even with these heavy investments, Wal-Mart and Target's e-commerce businesses are still only a fraction of the size of Amazon's online retail operations. Still, investors shouldn't completely dismiss Wal-Mart and Target as threats to Amazon's dominance, and the battle between these giants will be interesting to watch in the year, and years, ahead.  Joe Tenebruso has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Sears and Kmart will no longer sell Trump home products. Image: Getty Images/Spencer Platt By Patrick Kulp2017-02-14 03:48:56 UTC Even a presidential tweet can't save Ivanka Trump's shoes. The Trump name is vanishing from store shelves and shopping sites as retailers distance themselves from the first family's business empire.  Sears and its subsidiary Kmart became the latest big shopping chains to pull away from the Trump organization this weekend, Reuters reported. The two stores said they would end online sales of 31 items from Trump Home, the brand's line of household furnishings. A jargon-bogged company statement attributed the decision to a "streamlining effort" focused on the retailers' "most profitable items."  SEE ALSO: Meet the woman who's making consumer boycotts great again The move follows similar announcements from Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus and Belk last week. Several other stores, like T.J. Maxx, Marshall's, Macy's, Walmart-owned Jet.com and Burlington, have quietly whittled down their Trump-branded selections, according to various reports. None of the latter group have responded to multiple requests for comment.  The stores that have publicly admitted to their actions have each insisted that it was a plain business decision rather than a political stand.  But all have been subject to a long-running boycott campaign called #GrabYourWallet, which targets any consumer company with business or political ties to the president or his family.  Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. Image: Evan Vucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock That movement has gained particular traction in recent weeks as the Trump administration has steamrolled through a controversial agenda.   It may or may not be a coincidence that sales of Ivanka Trump clothes and shoes at Nordstrom dropped most dramatically from the previous year in the three weeks after #GrabYourWallet began last October, according to internal data leaked to the Wall Street Journal. Either way, the report traces an ongoing decline, even as the chain's overall sales have grown.  Our Twitter egg-in-chief evidently sees the decisions as political nonetheless, as do his most fervent followers. The president accused the department store of treating his daughter "so unfairly" last week in his daily scattershot of social media outbursts. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Perhaps that's why many of the retailers that have followed Nordstrom's lead have been so reluctant to confirm their stocking changes. Retailers, and consumer companies in general, have had to navigate a fraught political landscape as the president's detractors and supporters have turned shopping into an act of protest. Here's a list of retailers that have taken Trump-related action: Nordstrom's - The department store said early this month that it would drop Ivanka Trump products from its stores. Neiman Marcus - The upscale department store followed Nordstrom's lead the next day and dropped Ivanka Trump's jewelry line from its website and some stores. T.J. Maxx and Marshall's- Employees at the discount retailers were told to throw out signs and promotional materials related to Ivanka Trump's brand last week, according to a memo obtained by the New York Times. Belk- The 300-location department store announced that it would remove Ivanka Trump products from its website last Thursday.  Kmart and Sears- Sears Holding Co. said Saturday that the two shopping chains will dump 31 Trump Home products from their respective sites. Jet.com- Mic reported last week that the Walmart-owned shopping site had removed some of its Trump products. Macy's- Business Insider reported that the number of Ivanka Trump products available on the department store's site dropped from 45 to 25 this week. Burlington- Trump Home products mysteriously disappeared from the retailer's site over the weekend.

Ashley Williams, a singing telegram performer, was recently hired by Demetre White after he saw a flyer for her services.  He wanted to surprise a woman he admires and has been friends with for two years and ask her to be his girlfriend. The two planned for the surprise to happen at Walmart in Decatur on Saturday, February 11. As Davis walked into the store for a quick shopping trip, some of White's family greeted her along with Williams.  As the ladies walked around the store, Williams sang "Stand By Me" accompanied by the music on a portable speaker. During the walk, people held balloons and different signs saying "Will, You, Be and My..." White was waiting at the exit with balloons and another sign across his chest, "Girlfriend." Davis gave him a big hug and kiss. We'll call that a yes! We wish the two of them lots of happiness. As this new couple is spending their first Valentine's Day together in the River City, millions of people are watching their viral story! "As soon as I walked in, the music started playing and my heart dropped," recalled Quita Davis. White wanted to ask Quita Davis to be his girlfriend. He had the idea, the location, and knew of a singing telegram performer. "He was like I want to do something for my, shes not my girlfriend yet, we've been talking for two years and I really like her. I think I found my queen," singing telegram performer Ashley Williams recalled. Davis recalled that when White asked her to meet him at Walmart, "I still had no idea what was going on until I hit the corner and saw him. I thought it was a prank to be honest." "Even after it was done, we were both like that was amazing," recalled Williams. "I didn't realize that five million people would think it's amazing too!" Davis said it's a grocery shopping trip she'll never forget. It's a moment that took her completely by surprise, and that's why five million people have seen her in her pajamas. "Clearly I had no idea what was going on," said Davis. "I would've put some clothes on and some shoes instead of slippers." "He was like 'but I love her' so I had to thank him for just including me in that whole process," said Williams. "Do you believe this is my first valentine ever? Ever!" said Davis. "He just wanted me to be his girlfriend and now something so beautiful and personal got to be shared with the world. I'm in love with this man!" Not only has this created a big memory and mark on social media, but it's also increased Ashley Williams singing business, Send a Song Today.

The Obama administration’s Federal Communications Commission established net neutrality by reclassifying high-speed internet as a regulated phone-like telecommunications service, as opposed to a mostly unregulated information service. The re-classification was cheered by advocates for a free and open internet. But now Trump’s new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a former Verizon attorney, is pushing to repeal the net neutrality reform by rolling back that re-classification — and he’s getting help not only from a legion of telecom lobbyists, but from civil rights groups. In a little-noticed joint letter released last week, the NAACP, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, OCA (formerly known as the Organization for Chinese Americans), the National Urban League, and other civil rights organizations sharply criticized the “jurisdictional and classification problems that plagued the last FCC” — a reference to the legal mechanism used by the Obama administration to accomplish net neutrality. Instead of classifying broadband as a public utility, the letter states, open internet rules should be written by statute. What does that mean? It means the Republican-led Congress should take control of the process — the precise approach that is favored by industry. None of the civil rights groups that signed the joint letter responded to a request for comment. It’s not the first time civil rights group have engaged in lobbying debates seemingly unrelated to their core missions, but in favor of their corporate donors. At a time when OCA received major funding from Southwest Airlines, the group filed a regulatory letter on behalf of the airline in support of Southwest’s bid to open flights at Houston airport. The NAACP, after receiving financial backing from Wal-Mart, helped the retail chain during its contentious bid to open stores in New York City. Telecom issues, however, are a particular specialty. Last week’s letter was organized by the Multicultural Media, Telecom & Internet Council (MMTC), a group funded by the telecom industry that has previously encouraged civil rights groups to oppose net neutrality. MMTC in previous years reported receiving about a third of its budget from industry-sponsored events; its annual summit, which was held last week, was made possible by $100,000 sponsorships from Comcast and AT&T, as well as a $75,000 sponsorships from Charter Communications and Verizon. MMTC, which acts on the needs of telecom lobbyists, has been accused of “astroturf lobbying” by creating the appearance of grassroots support for the industry. The civil rights group opposed to net neutrality have employed several arguments against the proposal. In one filing made in 2010, the NAACP signed onto an argument from MMTC that net neutrality reforms were a waste of resources because the FCC should focus on “more pressing racial discrimination and exclusionary hiring and promotion practices of certain Silicon Valley high-tech companies.” In a separate filing in 2014, MMTC and the NAACP argued that reclassification would threaten the “fragile state of minority engagement in the digital ecosystem.” While advocating against net neutrality, the organizations on the joint letter have raked in money from the telecom industry. The NAACP, which signed letters opposing net neutrality both times the rule was proposed by the Obama administration, has named AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast as corporate fundraising partners. After the NAACP endorsed Comcast’s merger with NBC, Comcast disclosed that the NAACP was one of the the recipients of $1.8 billion in funds doled out to various community groups. The Asian-American groups on the letter, including OCA and Americans Advancing Justice, have similar ties to the largest telecom firms. Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, a trade group for the telecom industry, are listed as members of the “Corporate Alliance” of donors funding AAJC. Comcast and Verizon sponsored OCA’s annual gala last year. The National Urban League received $1.2 million from Verizon in 2014 alone. As the Center for Public Integrity reported, senior officials from AT&T, Verizon and Comcast have held positions on the National Urban League’s board. Net neutrality activists are crying foul. “Net neutrality is based on a communications law that guarantees vital nondiscrimination rights,” said Jessica J. González, the deputy director and senior counsel of Free Press. “This joint statement may seem innocuous but it actually endangers the communications rights that have empowered people of color to tell our own stories, organize for racial justice and earn a living online.” “The Congress that tried to destroy net neutrality once would only weaken it with legislation that fails to adequately protect those it is meant to serve,” says Malkia Cyril, the executive director of the Center for Media Justice. She noted that the civil rights groups that signed the letter are now calling for putting the future of the internet “into the hands of a GOP Congress that just appointed white supremacist Jeff Sessions to be attorney general.” Activists have expressed alarm at the pace at which Commissioner Pai has already axed reforms enacted by the Obama administration. In his first days  as chairman, Pai rolled back an attempt to regulate overly expensive prison phone rates, got rid of the proposal to allow more competition for the cable box market, and blocked nine companies from providing low-income families with discounted high-speed internet services. Observers believe net neutrality is next. But Kim Keenan, the president of MMTC, the group that organized the joint letter, has showered Pai with praise. “He is really focused on closing the digital divide. As an advocate, I feel so much pride that that it is a priority for his chairmanship,” Keenan told Multichannel News, a trade outlet.

By Om Malik   February 13, 2017 A familiar technology is transforming our interactions with the digital world, and Snapchat’s parent company wants to lead the way.CreditPHOTOGRAPH BY J. EMILIO FLORES / THE NEW YORK TIMES / REDUX Ever since Snapchat—sorry, Snap Inc.—filed for its initial public offering, last week, it has been all that anyone in Silicon Valley can talk about. In the documentation that it sent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Los Angeles-based company reported that it had achieved a sixfold increase in revenue in 2016, and that its hundred and fifty-eight million daily users were generating more than 2.5 billion Snaps per day. When Snap goes public, in March, it may be valued at as much as twenty-five billion dollars. Much of the tech-world buzz centered, as it has for months, on the question of the company’s future potential, given that larger and more established platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have already proved themselves adept at mimicking Snapchat’s features. As the S.E.C. filing acknowledges, “We face significant competition in almost every aspect of our business.” But hidden in the opening pages of that filing is a more interesting declaration. It appears in emphatic black lettering against Snapchat’s signature yellow: “Snap Inc. is a camera company.” Technically speaking, Snap is a camera company, and has been for a number of months. In September, it announced the launch of Spectacles, camera-equipped sunglasses that allow you to record a ten-second video by tapping a button near your left eyebrow. (For the moment, Spectacles are sold exclusively in itinerant vending machines called Snapbots.) But the company’s vision of the future appears to be more expansive than that. “In the way that the flashing cursor became the starting point for most products on desktop computers, we believe that the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones,” it writes. The personal devices of the past decade have already made the camera more central to our lives than ever before; it has evolved into a multipurpose tool, a visual sensor, as useful for recording a lunch receipt as for capturing a dazzling landscape. (And don’t forget the screenshot, which has partly usurped the functions of the old-fashioned notebook.) At the same time, the huge demand for smartphones has forced developers to make their cameras better and better, with ripple effects well beyond the industry. Action cameras, drones, low-orbit satellites—many have directly benefitted from this arms race. Cameras can look down from on high and predict crop yields, traffic in Walmart parking lots, and travel patterns on Labor Day weekend. On the ground, they form the foundation of autonomous-driving systems. Snap is betting that the cameras we carry in our pockets could be even more powerful. In its S.E.C. filing, the company contends that “images created by smartphone cameras contain more context and richer information than other forms of input like text entered on a keyboard.” Snap, of course, is not the first company to recognize that its users’ experience of the world is increasingly mediated through cameras. Consider WeChat, a free messaging app developed by the Chinese giant Tencent. The service, which has hundreds of millions of customers, allows people to use their smartphones to read the data hidden in QR codes. By scanning the codes with their cameras, WeChatters can buy food, call up Web sites, and make payments. According to Allen Zhang, WeChat’s founder, the technology constitutes a “third hand for humans.” Indeed, several years ago, at a time when barely anyone used QR codes, he described them in language similar to Snap’s. “The entry point for PC Internet is the search box,” he said. “The entry point for mobile Internet is the QR code.” Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that earlier this month Snap began expanding the use of QR codes on its platform. And, as Bloomberg’s Mark Bergen and Sarah Frier reported a couple of weeks ago, Snap was at one point in talks with Google to introduce a feature that would have allowed Snapchatters to perform Internet searches merely by pointing their phones at objects in the real world. That search feature never came to fruition, but it’s a useful indicator of where the mobile Internet is headed. QR codes have always been a kind of half-measure, a useful but inelegant transitional technology; the ultimate goal is augmented reality. Last Tuesday, Pinterest offered a small glimpse of this future in the form of an experimental feature called Lens. “Sometimes you spot something out in the world that looks interesting, but when you try to search for it online later, words fail you,” the company explained in a blog post. Lens allows you to perform a visual search—for clothing, furnishings, recipes, and so on—using your smartphone camera. It’s a self-evident-enough idea, but the reason Lens and other A.R. technologies are being introduced only now is that software is finally capable of supporting them. In the past couple of years, companies including Microsoft, Facebook, and Google have used vast repositories of photos available on the Internet to build intelligent systems that can accurately identify everything from dogs to babies to flowers. The more training data—that is, images—these systems have, the more accurate they become over time. If and when Snapchat makes its foray into A.R., it will have those 2.5 billion user images a day to learn from. The possibilities that come with thinking about the camera as a portal into the realm of information and services are attractive not only to Snap but also to every other big player in the tech world. Facebook, for instance, has slowly been enhancing the visual capabilities of its Messenger. If you show Google Assistant a pair of Nike Air Maxes, it can not only identify the shoes but also bring up related styles and direct you to a place where they are sold. Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, is high on A.R., too. At a technology conference last fall, Cook predicted that in the near future “a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have A.R. experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.” Until fairly recently, that might have seemed like pure Silicon Valley hype. The early entrants into the world of A.R., as with its cousin virtual reality, were disappointing: the phones were too weak, the networks were too slow, and the applications were too nerdy. But now the technological pieces are in place, and a whole generation—much of which is on Snapchat—has come to consider the camera almost a third arm. Yes, Snap is a camera company. It’s just that the camera isn’t a camera anymore. Om Malik is a technology writer, the founder of GigaOm, and a partner at TrueVentures, a venture firm based in Palo Alto, California.

Iglesias | Miami Herald | TNS Foreign nationals at the Krome detention center, where those with criminal records and deportation orders are often held. By Francis Wilkinson, Bloomberg View Posted Feb. 13, 2017, at 1:46 p.m. Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, 35, a mother of two American children, was arrested last week in Phoenix and deported to Mexico, which she left as a 14-year-old to travel illegally to the United States. There was no public-safety rationale for her removal. But the president who defrauded students, cheated contractors and shattered democratic norms on his way to the White House is apparently a stickler for following rules. The deportation, over protests, was another shot in the federal government’s new war on immigrant communities. Its reverberations extend far beyond the 20 metro areas, including Phoenix, that are home to the majority of undocumented immigrants in the United States. Guadalupes can be found in unexpected places. Worthington, Minnesota, is a prairie town of 13,000 near the southwest corner of the state, just north of the Iowa line. It has a thriving little downtown spotted with restaurants and stores, and, from June to October, an open-air farmer’s market in the old Campbell Soup Co. parking lot. City administrator Steve Robinson, a Worthington native, said that his 1978 graduating high school class had about 260 people. “Thinking back,” he said in a phone interview, “I believe there were four non-Caucasian classmates.” Immigrants began coming to Worthington from around the globe in the late 1980s, when the local pork-processing plant was expanding. The cultural transition often was excruciating. Natives, Robinson said, “were afraid to go to the grocery store because they were afraid they were going to be attacked.” Crime in Worthington is lower than in most comparable towns within a 150-mile radius, and myths about the dangers of immigrants are “really starting to wane,” Robinson said. It helps that immigrant businesses have revitalized a sinking downtown that seemed destined for destruction after a Wal-Mart opened nearby. Today, the local JBS plant employs more than 2,000 people processing more than 20,000 hogs daily. Other businesses, including local farms, livestock transporters, veterinarians and Worthington’s downtown merchants, all benefit from the plant’s economic impact. Not everyone in Worthington is in the U.S. legally. In 2006, federal immigration agents raided the pork plant (then owned by Swift Co.) as part of a nationwide crackdown and arrested more than 200 workers there. The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports greater restrictions on immigration, estimated in 2009 that almost one-quarter of Swift plant workers nationwide were undocumented immigrants. (Some undocumented workers use stolen Social Security numbers to obtain work; many companies pretend not to know.) The pro-immigration Migration Policy Institute, working from U.S. Census data, estimates that, nationally, about 13 percent of the workforce in the meat-processing sector is unauthorized. Worthington is not a sanctuary city. It lacks the resources of Los Angeles or San Francisco. “We don’t care what your immigration status is,” Robinson said. “We will, however, cooperate with immigration officials.” If the feds come for local undocumented immigrants, there’s little place for them to hide. The city works with community groups to counsel local immigrants on how to deal with law enforcement. “We have done demonstrations to show people how to behave during a routine traffic stop,” Robinson said. “Many come from countries where the police have been the bad guys.” The 2006 raid unleashed a wave of fear through the town. The plant lost workers. The town lost residents. But the trauma didn’t stop Worthington’s transformation into a cultural polyglot. President Donald Trump’s multi-faceted campaign against immigrants is likewise futile. Deportations and immigration bans can impose misery on families and friends. They can compromise businesses, communities and local economies. But they won’t make America white again. “First, the racial minority population is growing more from natural increase than immigration,” Brookings Institution demographer William Frey said in an email. “Second, the white population will start declining after the year 2025.” Robinson said more than 50 languages are now spoken in Worthington. Its diversity is a product not of coastal cosmopolitanism, but of low wages paid for hard work. The town’s political leadership still is all white. But it probably won’t be for long. Asked if there were anything Trump’s immigration policies might do to alter Worthington’s trajectory, Robinson didn’t hesitate to answer: “Not at all.” Francis Wilkinson writes editorials on politics and U.S. domestic policy for Bloomberg View.

Cross Feb 13, 2017, 11:53 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Feb. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross has launched a massive disaster response in northern California, where at least 188,000 people have been ordered to evacuate over the past 24 hours due to the potentially catastrophic failure of a spillway which is part of the Oroville Dam system. "The Red Cross has shelters open now and more relief supplies and disaster workers are on the way to provide assistance for people in harm's way," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, disaster operations and logistics for the Red Cross. "This is a potentially catastrophic situation – affecting thousands of people and homes – and our first priority is making sure people have a safe place to stay. We will be in the community to offer comfort and support for as long as needed." As many as 2,200 residents were in Red Cross and community shelters as of Monday morning, and the Red Cross is preparing to shelter and feed thousands more in the upcoming days. The evacuation orders came Sunday night in Butte and Yuba counties, Yuba City and Marysville, as damage was discovered to the Oroville spillway. The Oroville Dam is the tallest dam in the United States, and is a critical piece of the state's water system. The dam currently remains intact, but the emergency spillway is compromised. The governor of California has declared a state of emergency and substantial search and rescue help is being deployed, including the California National Guard and Highway Patrol, along with swift water rescue teams. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP: Everyone should download the Red Cross Emergency App to have safety information available on their mobile device, including emergency weather alerts, safety information and open shelter locations. Red Cross apps are available in smartphone app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps. MAKE A DONATION We are thankful to those who would like to donate items for people evacuated in California – but the Red Cross is not equipped to manage, support, and distribute donated items.

They know someone you should. Gail Kurpgeweit is a Commercial Recipe Developer and Consultant to the foodservice industry, specializing in new product development. Her clients enjoy tremendous success from the sale of her creations, but one client’s story is particularly impressive. A Bellevue, Washington-based baked goods manufacturer purchased a portfolio of custom all-natural, non-GMO, gluten-free recipes that have been selling extraordinarily well in retail stores across the U.S. including Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Walmart, Kroger Foods, Jewel-Osco and more. The demand has been so hot for this line of products, the cookies recently launched as a “Family Pack” in Costco stores across Washington, California and Texas, where they are selling out quickly. Ms. Kurpgeweit, a Caterer based in Issaquah, Washington, also creates recipes and formulas for one of the fastest-growing segments of the foodservice industry: Meal prep and prepared-meal delivery companies. Whether the format is ingredients-only for DIY meal prep, or fully-prepared fresh or frozen meals, the most successful meal preparation and delivery services in the U.S. depend on Ms. Kurpgeweit’s creations to keep their menus fresh and exciting while increasing customer retention. Home cooks can also enjoy Ms. Kurpgeweit’s recipes through her blogs and in an upcoming cookbook entitled “Frozen & Fabulous” expected to publish in early 2018, which teaches advanced freezer meal preparation, including sous vide techniques. Some recipes are available now on her website at www.FrozenandFabulous.com, where customers can also link to Gail’s exclusive freezer-to-oven meal prep containers currently available on Amazon. For more information regarding this topic, contact Gail Kurpgeweit via her catering company, Taste of Amazing, by email at gail@tasteofamazing.com or via her website at www.gailkurpgeweit.com.

"This is a potentially catastrophic situation – affecting thousands of people and homes – and our first priority is making sure people have a safe place to stay. We will be in the community to offer comfort and support for as long as needed." As many as 2,200 residents were in Red Cross and community shelters as of Monday morning, and the Red Cross is preparing to shelter and feed thousands more in the upcoming days. The evacuation orders came Sunday night in Butte and Yuba counties, Yuba City and Marysville, as damage was discovered to the Oroville Dam, the nation's highest dam. The dam currently remains intact, but the emergency spillway is eroding. The governor of California has declared a state of emergency and substantial search and rescue help is being deployed, including the California National Guard and Highway Patrol, along with swift water rescue teams. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP : Everyone should download the Red Cross Emergency App to have safety information available on their mobile device, including emergency weather alerts, safety information and open shelter locations. Red Cross apps are available in smartphone app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps. MAKE A DONATION We are thankful to those who would like to donate items for people evacuated in California – but the Red Cross is not equipped to manage, support, and distribute donated items. Instead, our priority is to get those affected settled at emergency shelters, and to provide supplies to meet immediate needs. Right now, the best way to help is through a financial donation. Help people affected by disasters like floods and countless other crises by making a donation to Red Cross Disaster Relief. Your gift enables the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from disasters big and small across the United States.

Online marketplaces are selling gift cards from all sorts of places, such as Walmart, Target and even Sunglass Hut. They make money by buying these leftover giftcards from people and then reselling them. Sometimes, however, you can save a few bucks by buying these gift cards at a discount. The discounts usually range from 5-10 percent, which can add up when making a big purchase. However, there are a few places where you can buy giftcards and get a savings of 30-50 percent. Tuesday morning on WMC Action News 5, we will share with you the websites which have the best savings and the brands which you can really save on.  That’s Tuesday morning starting at 4:30 a.m. with weather and traffic every 7 minutes.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Simpson: A column without any politics at all Monday Feb 13, 2017 at 1:53 AM Dave Simpson / Opinion columnist TURNABOUT: A mere year ago, it was nothing but wine and roses. Puppy dogs. The smell of freshly-baked bread. Money in the bank, and six-pack abs. Perfection. Total vindication. Proof positive of unquestioned galactic superiority. Confetti descending from the rafters. The football team I root for every year was the undisputed champion. Best in the world, the solar system, and our neck of the Milky Way. Top of the heap. That day, there was nothing in the history of mankind better than being a fan of the football team for which I root. That was then. This, sadly, is now. There is a new best and undisputed champion of the solar system, as of Sunday. The wine and roses, puppy dogs, the freshly-baked bread, and the six-pack abs now reside in New England. Some folks can’t even remember last year’s greatest team in the history of mankind. Our big day is discarded, forgotten, and perfection in every way is a mere memory. Enjoy your moment in the sun, Patriot fans. Because — take it from a Bronco fan — even after proving your total galactic superiority, the garbage still has to go out when the chicken wrapper starts to smell bad, old joints still ache in the morning, and tax time is almost upon us. Even for the fans of world champions. Your team winning the Super Bowl is kind of like scoring the closest-in parking space at Walmart. It’s nice, maybe even worth mentioning at dinner, but it’s a fleeting victory. They do this Super Bowl deal every year, and chances are the confetti will be falling on some other best team in the history of the universe in a mere 12 months. THIS IS CRAZY: I catch myself trying to score the closest-in parking space every day when I go to exercise, and I’m curiously happy when the space closest to the door is available. I pay good money to trot on a treadmill for a half hour, then ride on an exercise bike for an hour, sweating copiously in the name of fitness and good health. But, subconsciously, I can’t stand the thought of walking an extra 25 yards across the parking lot. Go figure. I MISS IDOL: I don’t know about you, but I miss “American Idol.” Every year at this time, a couple evenings a week, The Wife and I would sit down in front of the TV and watch “American Idol.” She was a fan from the beginning, but I was a late adopter. I couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket, so I don’t think it was necessarily the singing that attracted me. No, it was the incredible enthusiasm of those thousands of young people, risking probable defeat and sometimes humiliation, to make a dream come true. In a world full of young people all too often hardened by skepticism, cynicism, and even anger at perceived promises not fulfilled, it was wonderful to see youngsters so head-over-heels excited to pursue a nearly-impossible dream. Cold February nights aren’t the same without “Idol.” SAY AGAIN?: A relative used the term “husband ears” recently when telling The Wife about her husband perhaps not hanging with eager anticipation upon her every word. This reminded me of the old guy at exercise who sometimes wears a t-shirt that says, “My wife says I don’t pay attention to her. Or something like that...” The challenge of hanging with eager anticipation upon a spouse’s every word can be difficult after, in our case, over 30 years. We’ve both heard each others’ favorite stories hundreds of times. (My favorite: The property taxes on my land in the mountains came to $7.28 a year before I built my cabin. The punch line: “And they let me pay it in two installments!”) I love that story, but if The Wife is around, I can’t tell it, because I can see her lips moving, and her eyes rolling, when I get to the punch line. What with ears that don’t hear like they used to, and loved ones who sometimes mumble, and the proclivity to retell golden oldie stories, I think it’s overly simplistic to chalk this phenomenon up solely to “Spouse Ears.” Contact Dave Simpson at davesimpson145@hotmail.com About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Wedding Form Anniversary Form Engagement Form Birthday Form Archives Photo Reprints Contact Us Birth Form Classified Advertising Form For Advertising Market Place Boats Magazine Cars Classifieds Coupons Homes Garage Sale Form Community Info Village of Morton Morton Park District Morton Economic Development Council Morton Chamber of Commerce Morton District 709 Morton Public Library Communities Chillicothe Times-Bulletin East Peoria Times-Courier Woodford Times Washington Times-Reporter Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

They know someone you should. Gail Kurpgeweit is a Commercial Recipe Developer and Consultant to the foodservice industry, specializing in new product development. Her clients enjoy tremendous success from the sale of her creations, but one client's story is particularly impressive. A Bellevue, Washington-based baked goods manufacturer purchased a portfolio of custom all-natural, non-GMO, gluten-free recipes that have been selling extraordinarily well in retail stores across the U.S. including Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Walmart, Kroger Foods, Jewel-Osco and more. The demand has been so hot for this line of products, the cookies recently launched as a "Family Pack" in Costco stores across Washington, California and Texas, where they are selling out quickly. Ms. Kurpgeweit, a Caterer based in Issaquah, Washington, also creates recipes and formulas for one of the fastest-growing segments of the foodservice industry: Meal prep and prepared-meal delivery companies. Whether the format is ingredients-only for DIY meal prep, or fully-prepared fresh or frozen meals, the most successful meal preparation and delivery services in the U.S. depend on Ms. Kurpgeweit's creations to keep their menus fresh and exciting while increasing customer retention. Home cooks can also enjoy Ms. Kurpgeweit's recipes through her blogs and in an upcoming cookbook entitled "Frozen & Fabulous" expected to publish in early 2018, which teaches advanced freezer meal preparation, including sous vide techniques. Some recipes are available now on her website at www.FrozenandFabulous.com, where customers can also link to Gail's exclusive freezer-to-oven meal prep containers currently available on Amazon.

Keith Owsley was selected to fill the vacancy on Friday afternoon. He comes from a corporate HR background, working around the country. "Keith has all the ingredients and a lot of experience," Mayor Steve Holt said. "He has worked for Wal-Mart in corporate HR and was with Lowe's in corporate HR. He has a number of years at the university level." Owsley will be on the job Monday, Feb. 20. He grew up in east Tennessee and holds degrees in psychology and personnel science from the University of Tennessee. The human resources job came open in October 2016 when Alanna Sullivan left to take a job in the private sector. Dan Barger, chief general fund accountant, has been the acting human resources director. Holt said Sullivan left before he took office at the October runoff election, and filling the opening was one of his first priorities. Most recently, Owsley had been working for Wal-Mart in Birmingham, Holt said. He has lived in Killen for three years and was commuting to and from work, he said. "He wanted a local job, and he was the right person at the right time for us," Holt said. "He fell in love with our area and wanted to stay here." About 90 people applied for the job, he said. "He has interviewed with the department heads, and he has met with the HR staff. We've gotten a good response from everybody," Holt said.

Photo: Gene Page/AMC/© 2016 AMC Film Holdings LLC. All Rights Reserved. The Walking Dead Rock in the Road Season 7 Episode 9 Editor's Rating 4 stars Prev Next Complete Series Coverage After a first half that began with a stunner and ended on a snooze, the back eight of season seven kicks off with a welcome end to the wussification of The Walking Dead. Gone is the sweaty, subservient Rick who preaches go along to get along; back is the sweaty, pissed off Rick who cocks his head, invades your personal space, and stares a hole in your skull while he convinces you it’s time to stand up and fight. Daryl’s found himself again, too, projecting that combination of toughness and vulnerability that just isn’t possible while wearing Walmart sweatpants. Along with the rest of the A-towners, they set out to recruit allies in their upcoming rebellion against Negan and his oppressive gang of bikers/iron-burn victims. Smartly, rather than drag out the recruitment process too long, Rick and company cover a lot of ground posthaste. The result? A surprising amount of progress toward uniting the clans, a mystery with Father Gabe, a twist ending, and one of the best zombie slaughter scenes ever. The opener was a typical bit of TWD misdirection: a slow, silent creep in the darkness with Father Gabe as he abandons his post on the wall, cleans out the pantry, and drives out of town. Only much later do we learn that no one knew Gabe was cutting out with a carload of canned goods and tools. There’s a notebook with strange numbers and a sketch of what looks like Lucille. He leaves his Bible behind. What’s it all mean? No idea. More important question: Would anyone but Rick miss him if Gabe’s gone for good? Doubtful. Thankfully, we shift immediately to see Rick in full recruitment mode at Hilltop, where Gregory is behaving in a rather Trumpian way, calling off a trade agreement and bitching about refugees. If the G-man had access to social media, he would have tweeted, “Asked so-called leaders Ricky & Margaret who will train cannon fodder 4 their war. RHETORICAL!” The meeting ends as Rosita channels the Sarge and calls Daniel a “walking ballsack” as all the world nods in agreement. Hey, who needs that weasel’s help when they have … Enid? She introduces Birdie, who herself introduces a bunch of eager Hilltoppers who owe their lives to Mags and are ready for revolution. Not a total victory, but it’s a start. Daryl also presents a battle plan that’s more Beavis & Butt-head than Sun Tzu — they need explosives or fire, he says. Um, sure Daryl. Plenty of those lying around. Next stop on the Please Stand By Me World Tour is The Kingdom, or as Rick says, “the Kingdom?” Jesus somehow forgets to mention King Ezekiel has a large pet tiger, and also, Jerry. (“It pleases him indeed!” Missed you, Jerry!) Zeke’s doing his usual Medieval Times routine, tossing off lines like “What plans have you, Rick Grimes of Alexandria?” and “I invite you all to sup with us.” You can almost hear Rick’s thoughts as he somehow keeps a straight face: Man, this is total batshit, but we could really use a dude with a tiger and guys with body armor on horseback and a minstrel who knows “Life in a Northern Town” on acoustic guitar. Rick’s pitch takes an odd turn when he recalls a story his mother told him about a rock in the road and a family who lost some beer and a little girl who dug it out to find gold buried underneath. (Not now, Jerry!) I think the true lesson here is that if a king plants a rock in the middle of the road as a test, even though it’s going to wreck horses and jugs of beer and the fingers of a child, then that king is a real dick. Zeke, however, seems to vibe on the message of great rewards coming to those who take a brave, perhaps bloody stand in the name of righteous change. But Morgan expresses doubt — he’s still hung up on taking lives, even though he saved Carol from certain death by killing that Savior. Morgan really wasted his “Get Out of Self-Imposed Jail Free” card on Carol, who’s still out there creeping in the woods, alone but not as far enough away as she should be if she were serious about being left alone. Don’t squander your pomegranates on her mopey ass, Zeke. The King wimps out in the end, but Richard is all in. (Alas, something tells me our poor man’s Gerard Butler will not survive this war.) Zeke does a solid by giving Daryl asylum, which comes in handy when the Saviors realize he’s missing and turn A-town upside down. Yet the most shocking showdown of the night goes down when Sasha tries to make small talk with Rosita, who replies with the shade of a thousand black holes: “What the hell are you telling me for? We both had sex with the same dead guy. Doesn’t make us friends.” Whoa! Didn’t they recently exchange a knowing look not that long ago that suggested they were all good? Maybe Rosita is just salty because every guy she sleeps or flirts with ends up butchered by Negan. Speaking of Neags, he makes a cameo via walkie talkie as the A-towners head home and hear his eulogy for Fat Joey. (“Things will not be the same now that he’s dead. Without Fat Joey, Skinny Joey is just … Joey. So it’s a goddamn tragedy.”) Then, wouldn’t ya know it, the gang discovers an elaborate herd trap rigged by the Saviors that just happens to fulfill Daryl’s shopping list: a steel cable rigged with dynamite and RPGs. Somehow Rosita has bomb-disarming skills (are we ever going to get her backstory?) and so the clock starts ticking. While they scramble to load up without blowing up, the Saviors are headed to A-town in search of Daryl as a massive herd of fleshbags is closing in. The payoff is epic: a mass walker slaughter as Rick and Michonne turn two cars and a steel cable into a zombie John Deere, mowing down hundreds of undead. That victory isn’t enough to make Rick smile, of course. Even with all those boomsticks, he knows they’re still too low on manpower and firepower to take on the Saviors. Hey Tara, perhaps it’s time to mention all the single ladies you met? The ones with the guns and sniper skills? Making matters worse, a visit from the Saviors ends with mass property damage and an ominous warning: Negan’s mustachioed henchman suggests that if they ever find Daryl, Rick should “keep that hatchet handy … and it won’t turn out the way it did for your boy.” Day-um. One-armed Daryl would have a tough time riding that hog and loading a crossbow. For some reason, Aaron risks his relationship and everyone risks their lives looking for AWOL Gabe at zombie lake. Rick spots a track, then — boom! — a band of camo-wearing, arms-bearing no-nonsense types surround them, guns drawn. For a second, I thought they were the women of Oceanside, but there are dudes in this posse. Instead of sweating some more, Rick smiles, finally. These aren’t enemies in his mind — they’re recruits. Imagine how tickled he’ll be when he meets the gals with guns and that nasty little brat who spit at Tara?

(OTCQB: MRPHF) subsidiary, Marapharm WA has entered into an agreement to purchase 13.6 acres of industrial, highway frontage property located a few minutes south of the Canadian border for $4.2 million US. The transaction should close on or before February 28, 2017. Previously, on June 16, 2016, the Company announced that it had concluded a deal for a lease of a 30,000 square foot building and an option to purchase 13.6 acres of industrial property located in Whatcom County, Washington State. Further, on August 17, 2016, Marapharm announced that Marapharm WA had closed on the purchase of the assets of a 30,000 square foot operating tier 3 marijuana cultivation and processing facility, located in Washington State and on September 27, 2016 and November 1, 2016 provided updates with regard to the Washington operations. Marapharm has been making lease payments on the property and has chosen to act on the option to purchase the land. The 13.6 acres is appropriately zoned for Washington States I-502 marijuana cultivation and processing requirements. There are currently multiple buildings on the property, including the 30,000 square foot building with marijuana cultivation and processing licenses, a 9,190 square foot truck wash building, a 7,200 square foot mechanic shop, a 2208 square foot office building and large sheds. Wal-Mart presently uses an area of the property for truck and trailer parking. There is ample room for further development.

Bringing together international leaders from government, business and civil society, the OMC aims to address the growing short-term preoccupations of modern politics and business and identify ways of overcoming today’s gridlock in key international negotiations. The OMC’s website says that this diverse group of highly respected global leaders has called for a radical shake-up in politics and business to deliver progress on climate change, reduce economic inequality, improve corporate practices and address the chronic burden of disease. Any institution committed to radically shaking up politics and business should be both willing and able to call to account powerful private interests and not be compromised by ideology or conflicts of interest. However, campaigner Dr Rosemary Mason wrote to the OMC last year to state that such things do appear to be undermining its stated aims. She expressed concern that OMC commissioners have allegiances with various global corporations that could undermine the neutrality and credibility of the commission. She went on to name certain individuals and noted their links to corporate power. For example, there is Sir John Beddington, Professor of Natural Resources Management for the OMC, and his position on the debate about genetically modified (GM) food and crops. Beddington was made Chief Scientific Adviser to the British Government in 2007. In 2012, he declared his faith in GM technology. Mason quotes him as saying, “And among those scientific wonders, the use of genetically modified crops has a particularly rich potential… Just look at the problems that the world faces: water shortages and salination of existing water supplies, for example. GM crops should be able to deal with that.” A recent report says that during his visit to Australia, Beddington told ABC Rural news that politicians around the globe are ignoring the science relating to GM for the sake of short-term political opportunism. He is quoted as saying, “If a politician completely ignores scientific advice, then they’re in danger of making policy decisions which will prove to be unutterably wrong.” Beddington went on to argue for more rapid and sensible responses from policies that engage science and stated, “There is a movement in Europe which is just against any genetically-modified plant used for food [and] that is so naïve. There’s no doubt in the developing world, plants can be modified to be resistant to drought or insect pests and that is going to be very, very important moving into the future.” He also claimed that the aim of gene editing is to produce plants that are resistant to droughts, pests and diseases, while boosting yields, which would be needed to feed a growing world population. Beddington told ABC Rural that there was approximately two billion people experiencing malnutrition and these people either lack sufficient levels of nutrients needed for proper development or are eating too much poor-quality food. With 25 per cent of children dying in the first few years of life, he said that children were being robbed of their social and economic potential. In an era of so-called ‘anti-science’, he argued it was more important than ever that scientist ensured their relevancy within society. Beddington concluded by saying: “What is sensible is to insist that this is the scientific evidence, you may not like it, but that is the evidence.” Taken at face value, much of what Beddington says might seem quite reasonable: a growing global population requires food, GM based on scientific evidence can provide it and naïve resistance, which is not based on science, is holding back the technology’s potential. It’s a line of thought that we have heard many times before from proponents of GM. The purpose here is not to go over old ground and repeat what I or others have written in recent articles that take issue with some of Beddington’s views, especially regarding the science of GM and his wholly erroneous claims about critics holding anti-scientific views. The wider context: scientists and development    However, the issue of ‘naivety’ is worth exploring. If there is any naivety around, it is not to be found within the ranks of those who question or oppose GM. In fact, the type of views Beddington expresses are driven by naivety or even worse: a failure to appreciate the reality of hunger, malnutrition, poverty and the nature of a global system of food and agriculture that is tied to corporate power. Scientists are fond of telling everyone that GM technology can fix the world food problem. This assumes there is a ‘problem’ as they define it (food shortage); but any problem that does exist has less to do with the world’s inability to feed itself and more to do with political issues related to food distribution, access to land, inequality and so on as well as inappropriate models of economic and social development that have adversely impacted indigenous agriculture and regional food security. As a technology, GM is but a tool. There may indeed be a need for it in certain situations, given proper testing and analyses of specific contexts and circumstances. However, you can roll out a technology and it can have disastrous consequences because of the context within which it operates. And you can roll out that technology knowing it will have many adverse effects but it will be highly beneficial to those who financially profit from that roll-out. We just have to look at the outcome of GM technology since GM crops were commercialised over 20 years ago. Has it reduced pesticides use? No. Has it increased yields? No. Have companies who control the technology and its associated proprietary inputs (e.g. Roundup/glyphosate) made a financial killing? Certainly (see this, this and this). Some 20 years of GM indicate that statements about the efficacy and benefits of GM are based more on wishful thinking than actual reality. GM has been dominated by giant transnational corporations who have used the technology to grow a select handful of crops, which by and large have been used to feed people in richer countries, not poorer regions where hunger and malnutrition persists. Moreover, GM has been integral to a system of food and agriculture in the US that fuelsobesity, bad health and monolithic diets that are nutritionally poor. Also, in the US, farmers are squeezed and kept afloat by taxpayer subsidies so that Monsanto, Cargill and the likes of Wal-Mart can rake in massive profits. People in the US now have a diet dominated by GM corn and soy. And where GM has been grown outside of the US, food security has been undermined, crops are grown for animal feed to be exported to rich countries and the planting of GM has led disease and illness places such as Argentina. GM is being used by vested interests who seek to irreversibly alter the genetic core of the world’s food and rake in massive profits. This is why GM is not just about science – indeed, science might be a minor issue given the overall context – especially for poorer countries. If we are to take India as an example, the Green Revolution was promoted by US corporations and interests that uprooted what was a highly productive system of agriculture. That system offered a diverse diet, and system was responsive to local climate and soil conditions. What we now have is drought, degraded soil, less diverse diets, nutritionally deficient crops and farmers placed at the mercy of rigged global trade rules as well as a whole range of other problems. To say that GM will rectify problems related to drought, yields or climate change fails to acknowledge the damage already done and that GM – the way it is to be rolled out by foreign corporations – is only going to exacerbate things: a damaging corporate-controlled chemical treadmill followed by similar; this time a corporate-controlled biotech treadmill. The Green Revolution was never designed to ‘feed the world’. The same is true for GM. Such rhetoric is designed to mask the motives based on self-interest, geopolitics and profit. In India, the World Bank and US companies are driving the development agenda. The push to drive at least 400 million from the land and into cities is already underway at the behest of the World Bank: a World Bank that India is seriously indebted to and a World Bank that is, under the guise of ‘enabling the business of agriculture’, committed to opening up economies to corporate seeds and agrochemicals and securing global supply chains. The drive is to entrench industrial farming and displace the current productive system with one suited to the aims of foreign agribusiness and retail interests. This entails commercialising the countryside and replacing small-scale farming –  the backbone of food production in India (and globally), which is more productive than industrialised agriculture, more sustainable and capable of producing more diverse, nutrient-dense diets. The ongoing issue to commercialise GM mustard in India is part of a push that seeks to restructure India to benefit foreign capital. By touting for GM, many scientists are (inadvertently) lobbying for a particular model of development. That development agenda regards the peasantry, small farms and India’s rural-based traditions, cultures and village-level systems of food production/processing as backward, as an impediment to ‘progress’. It regards alternative approaches to agriculture that have been advocated by numerous high-level reports as a hindrance: approaches that would in effect build on and develop the current rural infrastructure and not eradicate it. Do people who promote GM without addressing the issues raised above really think that technology is a silver bullet? Do they think it is the key way to feeding the world – or to feeding an India that is already self-sufficient in key foodstuffs and could be more so if it were not for the effects of politically motivated WTO rules and World Bank directives? By not addressing any of this, can scientists who tout for GM to the detriment of all else be regarded as ‘objective’? To dismiss all of the issues raised in this article and to ignore the model of corporate power that GM is wedded to demonstrates either gross naivety or an (unwitting) ideological allegiance to the political dogma of neoliberalism. Rosemary Mason raised a valid point: allegiances to corporate power can and do undermine any chance of neutrality and credibility. Science certainly has a role to play in helping to deal with food and agriculture issues. But the problem is that some scientists feel a need to promote a technological innovation without looking at (or even wanting to look at) the wider context. By doing so, they fail to appreciate that the answer to poverty, hunger and malnutrition first and foremost lies in addressing the context and in not blindly promoting technology.

Berkshire Hathaway is, of course, the holding company operated by investor Warren Buffet that has been skeptical of AAPL in the past. According to the SEC filing, first noted by Reuters, Berkshire Hathaway increased its holdings in AAPL from 15.2 million shares to 57.4 million shares during the fourth quarter of 2016. This additional purchased raised the value of Berkshire’s stake in Apple from around $1.7 billion to $6.64 billion in December. Now, with AAPL trading near the $135 mark at the close of business today, Berkshire’s AAPL stock is worth some $7.74 billion if it still holds the stock. In addition to the increase in AAPL holdings, Berkshire Hathaway also cut its stake in Verizon significantly, down from 15 million shares to 928 shares. Berkshire also cut its Walmart holdings by 89.3 percent, dissolved its share stake in Now Inc, and increased its holdings of Delta Air Lines to 60 million shares from 6.3 million. Buffet’s continued increase in AAPL stock is notable as prior to last May, Berkshire held few AAPL shares. Last May, the conglomerate purchased around 9.8 million shares in the company, worth a total of $1.069 billion at the time of purchase. Buffet has been a skeptic of AAPL for a while, explaining in 2011 that, in terms of AAPL shares, Berkshire “held very few in the past and we’re likely to hold very few in the future” due to how difficult it was to predict Appel’s long-term prospects. Nevertheless, Buffet seems to have move past that thinking if recent investments are any indication. Earlier today, AAPL hit a new all-time high stock price of $134.67, which continued to climb. Yesterday, we noted that the stock opened at all-time record high of $133 thanks to Goldman Sachs raising its target price. News of Berkshire’s increase will likely continue to push the stock up.

Buffet is seen here speaking to CNN in 2016. By Jackie Wattles NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway unveiled its latest holdings Tuesday, and it looks like the investment fund headed by the Oracle of Omaha is getting hungrier for airline stocks. The firm more than doubled its stake in American Airlines, increased its stake in United six-fold, and boosted its stake in Delta by 1,465% during its fourth quarter, which ended December 31. Buffett has said his company picked up shares of Southwest for the first time last quarter, and Tuesday's filing revealed Berkshire now owns about 43 million shares. The company picked up a much larger stake in Apple, buying up tens of millions of shares and increasing its stake in the company by 277%. That's on top of the 55% increase Berkshire Hathaway reported its stake in Apple rose between its second- and third-quarter. The fund brushed off several stocks in which it formerly held massive stakes. It completely dumped its stake in Deere. It sold off the vast majority of its Walmart and Verizon stock. It formerly owned more than 15 million shares of Verizon, but now has just 928. Its Walmart stake dipped to 1.4 million shares from nearly 13 million. Berkshire also made new investments in agrochemical firm Monsanto and satellite radio company Sirius XM. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

One obvious reason? FedEx produces more revenue offshore than it does in the United States. FedEx’s top brass, Fred Smith and Dave Bronzcak, have been lobbying the Trump administration to re-think their policies. Alan Graf, FedEx’s chief financial officer, told WMC Action News 5’s Joe Birch that free trade means you pay less for products at stores like Walmart and Costco. "There are no clothes made in the U.S. anymore,” Graf said. “So, we have to have trade. We still trade in oil. Our soybean farmers sell soybeans all over the world, and China is one of the biggest importers. So, trade helps everybody.” As for U.S. jobs moving overseas to lower labor costs, Graf said the U.S. needs to do a better job of retraining Americans for new lines of work when that happens.

Erie County Sheriff Timothy B. Howard reported that at about 3:20 a.m. a deputy stopped a vehicle without a front license plate and proper lighting. Howard said the deputy discovered that the driver, James Caffey, 57, had a suspended license and that the passenger, Henry McGriff, 32, did not possess a valid license or identification. According to the press release from Howard, it also was determined that McGriff was the subject of two outstanding warrants from Niagara Falls. Another deputy arrived to assist with the search of the vehicle, and they discovered crack pipes and a quantity of crack cocaine, according to the release from Howard. Authorities said the search also discovered four GoPro cameras, an electronic baby monitor, electronic gaming accessories and clothing in a duffel bag. Howard said the investigation revealed that the items were stolen from the Wal-Mart in Lockport. The deputies contacted the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office for an additional investigation. Caffey is charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance, aggravated unlicensed operation, and various vehicle and traffic law violations. McGriff is charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance. Both subjects were turned over to the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office.

Penney Company Inc , to discuss tax reform and infrastructure improvements, according to people with knowledge of the meeting. A White House official confirmed Trump will meet with retail industry CEOs on Wednesday morning to discuss economic growth. The meeting will include Target CEO Brian Cornell, Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly, Gap Inc CEO Art Peck, Autozone Inc CEO William Rhodes, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc CEO Stefano Pessina, J.C. Penney Company Inc CEO Marvin Ellison, Jo-Ann Stores LLC CEO Jill Soltau and Tractor Supply Co CEO Gregory Sandfort, according to the people familiar with the matter. This is the first time well-known retail CEOs will descend on Washington as a group to try to make the case that a controversial proposal to tax all imports will raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses. Their input has more urgency as Trump is finalizing his own tax plan that he plans to unveil in the coming weeks. The group will also meet on Wednesday with the heads of the two tax-writing Congressional committees -- Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Reuters reported on Monday. Brady and Speaker Paul Ryan are leading a House Republican push that would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports. Companies that rely heavily on imports, such as retailers, automakers and refiners say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax. "Given the retail industry's position as America's largest private-sector employer, retailers welcome the opportunity to speak with President Trump about policies that will spur job creation and economic growth here in the United States," said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. The trade group is leading the industry's effort to oppose House Republicans' proposal for a border adjustability tax, running a coalition of more than 120 companies and trade organizations including Wal-Mart Stores Inc . Representatives for all eight retailers headed to Washington did not respond to requests for comment. Trump has voiced some concern about the House tax proposal calling it "too complicated." But the White House also said previously that a border tax on goods from Mexico is one option under review to pay for a wall along the nation's southern border. The prospect of a big import tax is also pitting some of the largest U.S. companies against one another. A group of major exporters including Boeing Co , General Electric Co and Pfizer Inc have formed their own coalition to support the import tax. Retailers have become the most vocal opponents to the proposal, saying a 20 percent tax on imported goods would cause prices to increase for consumers and erase any profits the companies currently make. Nearly all of the nation's clothing, shoes and electronics are imported into the United States, as well as foods that cannot be grown domestically, like coffee and palm oil. The largest U.S. electronics retailer, Best Buy, for example, has circulated a flyer to lawmakers, which cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company's projected annual net income of $1 billion and turn it into a $2 billion loss.

Berkshire’s investments in American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc. climbed to more than $2 billion each, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday from Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based company. It also disclosed a stake in Southwest Airlines Co. valued at about $2.2 billion as of Dec. 31. Taken together, the holdings represent one of the largest common stock investments for Buffett’s company in years. Berkshire first disclosed that it had invested in airlines in November, which came as a surprise to some, because the billionaire previously criticized the business. “There has been massive consolidation in that industry," said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management, which oversees about $2.1 billion including Berkshire shares. Buffett likes investing in businesses that have a durable competitive advantage, Scherrer said, and “it seems like airlines now offer that.” American climbed 2.5 percent in extended trading at 6:04 p.m. in New York, while Delta rose 1.8 percent. United advanced 1.6 percent, while Southwest increased 1.3 percent. Apple shares were little changed. Parker’s Presentation Berkshire’s airline purchases were influenced, in part, by a presentation from American Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing Berkshire’s strategy. Buffett said in November that Berkshire added Southwest shares after Sept. 30, without specifying how many. Tuesday’s filing also showed that Berkshire more than tripled its Apple holding to about 57 million shares. The stake is now valued at more than $7 billion, making Berkshire among the top 10 holders of the Cupertino, California-based company. The Monsanto stake was about 8 million shares and valued at more than $800 million. Bayer AG struck a $66 billion deal last year to take over the seed maker. “I’m assuming he sees the same thing we do, which is that there’s a good likelihood the deal with Bayer will go through,” Chris Shaw, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. in New York, said by phone. Cash Hoard Buffett, 86, said last month that he’d been accelerating stock purchases at Berkshire, which he’s run for more than five decades. On Sept. 30, the company’s cash hoard hit a record $84.8 billion. It had been climbing in recent quarters because of profit from Berkshire’s dozens of subsidiaries and the redemption of securities that Buffett bought to fund deals. See also: Buffett bought stocks after U.S. election Not all the picks in the portfolio are Buffett’s. In 2010, he brought on Todd Combs, a former hedge fund manager, to help him pick stocks. A year later, the billionaire hired another money manager, Ted Weschler. The filing doesn’t show which person is responsible for each investment. In general, the deputies tend to make smaller investments than their boss. Buffett declined to discuss the rationale for the airline investments during an interview with Charlie Rose on Jan. 27, but he did say that the decision to buy was “in large part” his. Wal-Mart, Deere The billionaire further reduced his holding in Wal-Mart Stores Inc., cutting it to less than 2 million shares as of Dec. 31. That compares with more than 60 million in 2014. Buffett has said online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. present an increasing threat to the big-box retailer. Berkshire exited stakes in Kinder Morgan Inc., NOW Inc. and Deere & Co. A rout in crop prices has left some farmers too cash-strapped to buy new tractors from the company. Deere slipped 0.7 percent in extended trading. Berkshire also reported owning about 167 million shares of Sirius XM Holdings Inc., valued at about $740 million at the end of 2016. The satellite radio provider is controlled by billionaire John Malone. Shares of Sirius jumped about 3 percent in extended trading, while climbed 1 percent. Even as Berkshire’s stock picks are closely watched by investors, they’ve become less important to the company’s overall performance. During the past two decades, Buffett has focused more on acquisitions than picking stocks. Berkshire’s dozens of subsidiaries include auto insurer Geico, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and railroad BNSF. Early last year, Buffett completed one of his biggest acquisitions, the $37 billion buyout of Precision Castparts Corp., a supplier to the aerospace industry.

The firm more than doubled its stake in American Airlines, increased its stake in United six-fold, and boosted its stake in Delta by 1,465% during its fourth quarter, which ended December 31. Buffett has said his company picked up shares of Southwest for the first time last quarter, and Tuesday’s filing revealed Berkshire now owns about 43 million shares. The company picked up a much larger stake in Apple, buying up tens of millions of shares and increasing its stake in the company by 277%. That’s on top of the 55% increase Berkshire Hathaway reported its stake in Apple rose between its second- and third-quarter. The fund brushed off several stocks in which it formerly held massive stakes. It completely dumped its stake in Deere. It sold off the vast majority of its Walmart and Verizon stock. It formerly owned more than 15 million shares of Verizon, but now has just 928. Its Walmart stake dipped to 1.4 million shares from nearly 13 million. Berkshire also made new investments in agrochemical firm Monsanto and satellite radio company Sirius XM.

Orchardist looks to grow more peaches Karen Binder Agrinews Publications Feb 14, 2017 Updated Feb 14, 2017 (…) AgriNews file photo Illinois apple growers learned the latest growing tips at the Commercial Fruit Tree School, hosted by Illinois Extension, in Mount Vernon, Ill. TownNews.com Content Exchange MOUNT VERNON, Ill. — Jeff Flamm has witnessed plenty of changes at his family’s Union County orchard since he started there full time in 1981. Flamm Orchards decades ago replaced its original packing shed built in 1888, and new computerized tracing technologies now are prominent on the line. Bushel baskets have been replaced with reusable plastic containers that are easily sanitized and stackable. Migrant labor camps have been upgraded and federal H2A immigrant work visas are common practice. Even the orchard’s apple and peach crop has been diversified to include yellow squash, zucchini and cucumbers and, most recently, strawberries. “It’s gotten to the point that we have to do more than just peaches and apples,” the fifth-generation orchardist said. Flamm shared his comments at the Commercial Fruit Tree School, an annual production conference hosted by Illinois Extension each February in Mount Vernon. Besides hearing from colleagues, growers also learn about which diseases or pests are causing problems and their remedies, best management practices and other technical information to boost yields and improve profitability. Looking Back At 2016 Flamm’s review of his 2016 season included a range of challenges. “We just came off our wettest July-August ever,” he said, adding that his acreage was drenched by 9 to 12 inches of rain over three days. While he’s never seen so many apples crack, the orchard still ended up with a big crop that sold out. The wet summer also increased disease and pest pressure, making it difficult to stick with a timely spraying schedule. Hiring for help continues to be a challenge because many local workers are not interested in orchard work. The orchard also has been working with a new fertilizer and micronutrient program the past four years. Deer — and beavers — have been creating enough crop and tree damage that traps, fences and cattle crossing gates are going up. Despite all of that, Flamm’s has plans to expand its acreage this year. Currently, it has 260 acres in peaches with 200 acres of those in production. In 2015, it planted an additional 50 acres in peaches. It also wanted to plant another 50 acres in 2016, but could only find enough rootstock for 35 new acres. Another 50 acres is planned for this year. “I really see great potential for growth in the peach business right now. We really have a tremendous amount of interest in our product in the last few years. We’re trying to aggressively increase our production, extend our season on both ends and have a more consistent supply throughout the season,” Flamm said. Just Peachy They raise a range of peach varieties that will ripen in a wave across the growing season. They focus on yellow-flesh freestone peaches that begin in June and are picked through August for retail and wholesale customers. Flamm’s does host a small retail shop and bakery that accounts for about 10 percent of its income compared to its wholesale business. Flamm said Wal-Mart and Kroger are its top customers. To do wholesale business with these retailers, the orchard is Good Agricultural Practices certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In fact, Flamm said, the process is becoming more familiar. “GAP certification is quite a big deal. There’s a lot of paperwork,” he explained. “We really didn’t have to change the way we do things that much, but you do have to learn how to get it all documented.” The biggest challenge, Flamm said, is the traceability program. “Everyone had to learn to use a computer. It seems to be getting a little bit easier each year as everyone becomes more familiar with it,” he added. With 220 acres of apples and 190 acres in production, Flamm said he’s not interested in planting more apples at this time. “Everyone keeps telling me that Red Delicious is losing market ground, but we pick more and sell more of that than anything else,” he said. While many Midwestern orchards are replacing Red Delicious with Evercrisp or similar varieties, Flamm said Union County’s climate is too warm to make those varieties successful. “The crop ended up big,” he said. “All in all, it didn’t turn out too bad.” Karen Binder can be reached at 618-534-0614 or kbinder@agrinews-pubs.com.

Penney, to discuss tax reform and infrastructure improvements, according to people with knowledge of the meeting. A White House official confirmed Trump will meet with retail industry CEOs on Wednesday morning to discuss economic growth. Quotes in the article Best Buy Co Inc BBY ▲ 45.92 +0.63 +1.39% Target Corp TGT ▲ 65.75 +0.10 +0.15% JC Penney Co Inc JCP ▲ 7.31 +0.04 +0.55% Gap Inc GPS ▲ 24.39 +0.19 +0.79% The meeting will include Target CEO Brian Cornell, Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly, Gap CEO Art Peck, Autozone CEO William Rhodes, Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO Stefano Pessina, J.C. Penney CEO Marvin Ellison, Jo-Ann Stores CEO Jill Soltau and Tractor Supply CEO Gregory Sandfort, according to the people familiar with the matter. This is the first time well-known retail CEOs will descend on Washington as a group to try to make the case that a controversial proposal to tax all imports will raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses. Their input has more urgency as Trump is finalizing his own tax plan that he plans to unveil in the coming weeks. The group will also meet on Wednesday with the heads of the two tax-writing Congressional committees -- Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Reuters reported on Monday. Brady and Speaker Paul Ryan are leading a House Republican push that would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports. Companies that rely heavily on imports, such as retailers, automakers and refiners say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax. "Given the retail industry's position as America's largest private-sector employer, retailers welcome the opportunity to speak with President Trump about policies that will spur job creation and economic growth here in the United States," said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. The trade group is leading the industry's effort to oppose House Republicans' proposal for a border adjustability tax, running a coalition of more than 120 companies and trade organizations including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Representatives for all eight retailers headed to Washington did not respond to requests for comment. Trump has voiced some concern about the House tax proposal calling it "too complicated." But the White House also said previously that a border tax on goods from Mexico is one option under review to pay for a wall along the nation's southern border. The prospect of a big import tax is also pitting some of the largest U.S. companies against one another. A group of major exporters including Boeing Co, General Electric Co and Pfizer Inc have formed their own coalition to support the import tax. Retailers have become the most vocal opponents to the proposal, saying a 20 percent tax on imported goods would cause prices to increase for consumers and erase any profits the companies currently make. Nearly all of the nation's clothing, shoes and electronics are imported into the United States, as well as foods that cannot be grown domestically, like coffee and palm oil. The largest U.S. electronics retailer, Best Buy, for example, has circulated a flyer to lawmakers, which cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company's projected annual net income of $1 billion and turn it into a $2 billion loss.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Fiji Time: 9:23 PM on Thursday 16 February Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Bid to kill border tax Reuters Wednesday, February 15, 2017 CHIEF executives of some of America's largest retailers, including Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc, are headed to Washington this week to make their case that a controversial tax on imports would raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses, according to people familiar with the plan. The group of eight retail bosses, that also includes chief executives of Gap Inc and Autozone Inc, will meet on Wednesday with Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, and with members of the Senate, four people said in recent days. Reuters could not confirm the full list of participants. This is the first time well-known retail CEOs will descend on Washington as a group to try to make the case to kill the import tax proposal. Their input has more urgency as US President Donald Trump is finalising his own tax plan that he plans to unveil in the coming weeks. It is not known if the group, including Target CEO Brian Cornell, Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly, GAP CEO Art Peck and Autozone CEO William Rhodes, will meet with Mr Trump at the White House while in town, according to people familiar with ongoing discussions.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks pushed to fresh records again on Tuesday (Feb 14), with financial shares rallying after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signalled higher interest rates are on their way. All three major indices set records for the fourth straight session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 92.25 points (0.45 per cent) at 20,504.41. The broad-based S&P 500 gained 9.33 points (0.40 per cent) to close at 2,337.58, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 18.62 points (0.32 per cent) to 5,782.57. Yellen presented an upbeat view of the economy in her testimony to Congress, noting labour market conditions continue to improve and inflation is inching up to the Fed's two per cent target. She confirmed the next rate increase could come at any time, which leaves open the possibility of a move at the Mar 14-5 policy meeting. Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent and JPMorgan Chase rose 1.6 per cent following the Yellen hearing. Banks typically prosper from interest rate increases. US stocks have been on a tear since President Donald Trump last week said he planned to unveil a tax-cut plan within the next two to three weeks. Consumers stocks were strong with Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot both gaining 1.0 per cent. Technology giant Apple won 1.3 per cent to finish at an all-time high. General Motors jumped 4.8 per cent after French car manufacturer PSA said it was considering an acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall, GM's loss-ridden European subsidiaries. GM confirmed the talks, cautioning that "there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached." Health insurer Anthem fell 0.2 per cent after rival Cigna announced it was suing Anthem for billions of dollars in breakup and other fees after a US court blocked their proposed merger on antitrust grounds. Anthem said the suit was invalid and that it was committed to completing the merger. Cigna gained 0.8 per cent. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Renewable Energy Massachusetts Might Become America's First State to Commit to 100% Renewables Environment America Feb. 14, 2017 09:07PM EST Subscribe to EcoWatch Newsletter Subscribe Clean energy supporters in Massachusetts announced legislation Monday, backed by more than a quarter of the state legislature, committing Massachusetts to get 100 percent of its energy needs from clean and renewable sources by mid-century. The legislation, introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Sean Garballey and Marjorie Decker and in the Senate by Sen. Jamie Eldridge, establishes targets for Massachusetts to meet its electricity needs from renewable energy by 2035 and all of its energy needs, including heating and transportation, from renewable sources by 2050. "The supporters of this bill have joined the growing number of stakeholders and leaders who recognize the need for rapid transition to clean, renewable energy to tackle our environmental challenges," Rob Sargent said. "With a can-do attitude, powering our state entirely with clean, renewable energy is as feasible as it is necessary." A combination of environmental concerns and declining costs for renewable energy have made it the "go-to" option for many communities and businesses, in part because it is pollution-free, but also because it requires no fuel costs. As a result, dozens of major corporations from Google to General Motors to Walmart have already committed to a complete shift to renewable energy. Similarly, dozens of local governments including San Diego, California, St. Petersburg, Florida and Georgetown, Texas, have plans to go 100 percent renewable. "The federal government is moving backwards on clean energy. So, the states must lead," said S. David Freeman, a long-time utility executive at Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the New York Power Authority and the Tennessee Valley Authority. "Massachusetts can show the way by enacting the 100 percent renewable bills and by so doing save consumers millions of dollars in the future with a free fuel energy supply." Given the considerable resistance renewables are likely to face in Congress and the Trump administration, clean energy proponents are looking to state and local governments, businesses and institutions to ensure continued progress. In addition to the campaign in Massachusetts, Environment America and its partners are planning campaigns to get other states to go 100 percent renewable. And, today they will launch an effort to persuade America's colleges and universities to make similar commitments. "Despite tremendous progress on renewable energy in the past decade, we've got much more to do and leaders in Washington who want to take us backward," Sargent said. "That's why we're counting on our local and state governments, along with businesses, colleges and universities and other institutions to lead the way by setting their sights on 100 percent renewable energy."

CEO, Brian Cornell speaks during an interview on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:00 AM, February 15, 2017 WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet on Wednesday with the chief executives of eight large retailers, including Target Corp <TGT.N>, Best Buy Co Inc <BBY.N> and J.C. Penney Company Inc <JCP.N>, to discuss tax reform and infrastructure improvements, according to people with knowledge of the meeting. A White House official confirmed Trump will meet with retail industry CEOs on Wednesday morning to discuss economic growth. The meeting will include Target CEO Brian Cornell, Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly, Gap Inc <GPS.N> CEO Art Peck, Autozone Inc <AZO.N> CEO William Rhodes, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc <WBA.O> CEO Stefano Pessina, J.C. Penney Company Inc <JCP.N> CEO Marvin Ellison, Jo-Ann Stores LLC [NEDLEJ.UL] CEO Jill Soltau and Tractor Supply Co <TSCO.O> CEO Gregory Sandfort, according to the people familiar with the matter. This is the first time well-known retail CEOs will descend on Washington as a group to try to make the case that a controversial proposal to tax all imports will raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses. Their input has more urgency as Trump is finalizing his own tax plan that he plans to unveil in the coming weeks. The group will also meet on Wednesday with the heads of the two tax-writing Congressional committees -- Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Reuters reported on Monday. Brady and Speaker Paul Ryan are leading a House Republican push that would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports. Companies that rely heavily on imports, such as retailers, automakers and refiners say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax. "Given the retail industry's position as America's largest private-sector employer, retailers welcome the opportunity to speak with President Trump about policies that will spur job creation and economic growth here in the United States,” said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. The trade group is leading the industry's effort to oppose House Republicans' proposal for a border adjustability tax, running a coalition of more than 120 companies and trade organizations including Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>. Representatives for all eight retailers headed to Washington did not respond to requests for comment. Trump has voiced some concern about the House tax proposal calling it "too complicated." But the White House also said previously that a border tax on goods from Mexico is one option under review to pay for a wall along the nation's southern border. The prospect of a big import tax is also pitting some of the largest U.S. companies against one another. A group of major exporters including Boeing Co <BA.N>, General Electric Co <GE.N> and Pfizer Inc <PFE.N> have formed their own coalition to support the import tax. Retailers have become the most vocal opponents to the proposal, saying a 20 percent tax on imported goods would cause prices to increase for consumers and erase any profits the companies currently make. Nearly all of the nation's clothing, shoes and electronics are imported into the United States, as well as foods that cannot be grown domestically, like coffee and palm oil. The largest U.S. electronics retailer, Best Buy, for example, has circulated a flyer to lawmakers, which cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company's projected annual net income of $1 billion and turn it into a $2 billion loss.

If you've been waiting for a killer deal to pick up a PlayStation 4, the time may have arrived. Sony has discounted the console to match its lowest price ever, with two bundles available for just $249. The special pricing matches the deal that was available on Black Friday last year, and includes two specific bundles. Uncharted 4 Bundle: Includes a PS4 Slim with a 500GB hard drive, a DualShock 4 controller, and a copy of Uncharted 4 Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Bundle: Includes a PS4 Slim with a 500GB hard drive, a DualShock 4 controller, and a copy of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare There's also a CoD bundle available exclusively through Wal-Mart that includes the Glacier White console and controller. This is certainly the lowest price we've seen for the PS4 Slim, but it may be a tough sale, especially if gamers are will to shell out $399 for the PS4 Pro, which has more powerful hardware, a 1 TB hard drive, and Boost Mode, the new addition that improves the performance of PS4 games without Pro support. The Pro is also PSVR ready. If you're more interested in the $249 model, you can grab one for this price until the deal ends on February 25.

Penney Company Inc CEO Marvin Ellison, Jo-Ann Stores LLC CEO Jill Soltau and Tractor Supply Co CEO Gregory Sandfort, according to the people familiar with the matter. This is the first time well-known retail CEOs will descend on Washington as a group to try to make the case that a controversial proposal to tax all imports will raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses. Their input has more urgency as Trump is finalizing his own tax plan that he plans to unveil in the coming weeks. The group will also meet on Wednesday with the heads of the two tax-writing Congressional committees -- Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Reuters reported on Monday. Brady and Speaker Paul Ryan are leading a House Republican push that would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports. Companies that rely heavily on imports, such as retailers, automakers and refiners say a border tax will outweigh the benefit of a lower headline corporate tax. "Given the retail industry's position as America's largest private-sector employer, retailers welcome the opportunity to speak with President Trump about policies that will spur job creation and economic growth here in the United States," said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. The trade group is leading the industry's effort to oppose House Republicans' proposal for a border adjustability tax, running a coalition of more than 120 companies and trade organizations including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Representatives for all eight retailers headed to Washington did not respond to requests for comment. Trump has voiced some concern about the House tax proposal calling it "too complicated." But the White House also said previously that a border tax on goods from Mexico is one option under review to pay for a wall along the nation's southern border. The prospect of a big import tax is also pitting some of the largest U.S. companies against one another. A group of major exporters including Boeing Co, General Electric Co and Pfizer Inc have formed their own coalition to support the import tax. Retailers have become the most vocal opponents to the proposal, saying a 20 percent tax on imported goods would cause prices to increase for consumers and erase any profits the companies currently make. Nearly all of the nation's clothing, shoes and electronics are imported into the United States, as well as foods that cannot be grown domestically, like coffee and palm oil. The largest U.S. electronics retailer, Best Buy, for example, has circulated a flyer to lawmakers, which cites an analyst forecast that a 20 percent tax would wipe out the company's projected annual net income of $1 billion and turn it into a $2 billion loss.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 February 2017 by Military News Market Trends Suggest It Is Time for Banks and Credit Unions to Take Another Look at Cash Access Strategies With new trends such as the rising expense of surcharge rebate programs and a desire to get out from underneath the overhead expense of managing off-premise ATM fleets, very large financial institutions are embracing surcharge-free as a lower-cost option. Boston, MA February 14, 2017 While other countries look to discourage reliance on cash, consumers in the U.S. continue to include cash in their day-to-day payment transaction mix. The use of cash permeates across generations, suggesting that although cash use has seen a small decline in use, it will still play an important role for many years to come. Mercator Advisory Group’s latest report, New Trends Underscore Role of Surcharge-Free ATMs, provides an understanding of cash usage in the U.S., the reasons that financial institutions of all sizes are latching onto surcharge free networks, and a discussion of the small group of market providers for these services. “Smaller institutions, online-only banks, and alternative financial product providers have been the traditional buyers of surcharge-free ATM networks to offer cash access points that could rival big financial institutions. Now, with new trends such as the rising expense of surcharge rebate programs and a desire to get out from underneath the overhead expense of managing off-premise ATM fleets, very large financial institutions are embracing surcharge-free as a lower-cost option, comments Sarah Grotta, Director, Debit Advisory Service at Mercator Advisory Group, the author of the report. Highlights of the report include: Trends in cash usage in the U.S. Channels U.S. consumers use to get cash. The influence of convenient cash access has on the choice of a financial institution Recent trends that are influencing the use of surcharge-free strategies by larger banks and credit unions This report is 14 pages long and has 6 exhibits.

While robots have already been used behind the scenes in warehouses and distribution centers for pick, pack and ship duties, they have only recently started making their way to the “front lines” of retail, roaming store floors and interacting with customers.  Leading retailers are testing robots in a variety of use cases throughout the retail supply chain, and the robots are proving their worth with the ability to reduce labor costs while improving visibility, service levels and customer experience.  Here are some examples. Taking Stock to Improve the Customer Experience Robots like Tally, which is currently being tested at some Target stores, can roam store floors to survey shelf condition, take stock of inventory and note planogram compliance. With the ability to check thousands of SKUs faster and more accurately than human workers, robots can have a significant impact on reducing revenue loss and the customer frustration caused by out-of-stocks or misplaced items. Additionally, as they travel the floor checking shelf conditions they can also capture real-time data on shopper behaviors. Using computer vision, video analytics and other technologies, robots can capture data on how shoppers move through the store, where they are congregating and what products they are purchasing. They can even examine shoppers’ facial expressions for insights into consumer sentiment and their decision making processes. When combined with analytics, this data yields powerful, real-time insights and provides retailers the opportunity to send an associate to help the shopper, or send a personalized offer to the shopper’s mobile phone, or take other action to give the shopper exactly what they need in that moment.   Personal Shopping Valet Lowes is using the LoweBot at select stores to help customers find items within the vast home improvement store. Shoppers can tell the robot what they’re looking for – a specific type of screw, for example – and have the robot guide them to its exact location on the shelf. Walmart is testing the use of robotic shopping carts that not only help shoppers find items on their list, but also eliminate the need to push a heavy cart through the store. This can be especially helpful for customers with disabilities. The charming, humanoid robot Pepper greets customers in stores across Japan, Europe and now in Silicon Valley. Pepper can read a variety of customers’ emotions, respond to their inquiries and make recommendations based on its interactions with them. While some people have expressed concern over the prospect of robots replacing human workers, retailers actually gain the greatest benefits by using robots to augment and complement the human workforce. Robots can offload the more tedious and repetitive tasks, thereby freeing up staff to focus their efforts on more skilled work, such as “clienteling” and building loyal relationships with customers. To join the robotics revolution, retailers will need to have an IT architecture that supports pervasive, robust wireless connectivity, data collection and aggregation, flexible cloud computing, edge analytics, mobility, and more. They will also benefit from precision indoor location technology, which helps a robot navigate and pinpoint targeted customers, shelves, or merchandise. Nearly every step of the retail supply chain can benefit from the robotics revolution through improved operational efficiency, workforce productivity and customer service. Retailers that want to use robots to improve their stores should examine their businesses and identify areas where robots can be used to improve shelf conditions and planogram compliance, help customers find what they’re looking for, or even take over the more tedious tasks so human associates are free to engage with customers. As consumers continue to become ever-more connected to the IoT, and as artificial intelligence and natural language processing continue to improve, shoppers will feel increasingly comfortable with robots in their retail experiences. -Shaun Kirby, Director, Industries Product Group at Cisco   RELATED LINKS Using the Internet of Things to Achieve “Frictionless Retail” Merchandising Across Channels Enhancing the Store Shopping Experience in an Omni-Channel World 2013 Mobile Product & Solutions Guide: Maximizing the Personal Touch POST A COMMENT Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RATE THIS CONTENT (5 Being the Best) Rating Rating Rating Rating Rating 1 2 3 4 5 Current rating: 0 (0 ratings) Tweet Add To Favorite Email Print Text Size + − MOST READ STORIES Vineyard Vines Employs Unified Commerce to Sell a Lifestyle Best of NRF 2017: Top 10 Takeaways Walgreens CIO Quits, Forming Marketing Startup Top 10 Department Stores: Who Made the Cut?
