The state Supreme Court on Thursday decided not to hear an appeal from a McCandless residents' group trying to block construction of a Wal-Mart store off McKnight Road. In April, the Citizens of McCandless group petitioned the high court to intervene on its behalf, after it lost its original case and a series of appeals. The group's attorney, Dwight Ferguson, said members will continue efforts to prevent Wal-Mart from building a 155,000-square-foot super store on 23 acres along Blazier Drive.“This is a multi-faceted project and there remains a number of applications and approvals the company must obtain before it can proceed,” he said. “We have been vigilant in all phases of this project and will continue to monitor the process.” Wal-Mart has not started construction. Before work can begin, the company must obtain permits from the state's environmental protection and transportation departments, according to Bruce Betty, McCandless' planning director. Those state permits are needed before the town can issue grading and building permits, he said. Wal-Mart spokesman Phillip Keene said the company plans to move forward. “With today's ruling, we'll begin the next phase of our routine diligence and planning process,” Keene wrote in an email to the Trib. Citizens of McCandless' original lawsuit — filed in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court in August 2014 on behalf of 17 residents — said, among other things, that McCandless officials failed to properly inform the public about the project. The group also has argued the store will create traffic headaches, the property is too small and its close proximity to Pine Creek poses an environmental risk. Last year, Common Pleas Senior Judge Joseph James ruled that town officials acted properly and Wal-Mart's plans met municipal zoning requirements. The group appealed that ruling in Commonwealth Court in February, but a three-member court panel upheld James' decision. In response, the group applied in March to have the full Commonwealth Court, with nine members, rehear arguments in the case. Commonwealth Court President Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt on March 31 denied the group's request, which prompted the Supreme Court filing. The municipality issued a statement Thursday saying: “With this decision from the Supreme Court, the Town of McCandless' approval of the Wal-Mart development, with the accompanying conditions, stands.” Before McCandless Council approved plans for the store in 2014, Wal-Mart agreed to 14 conditions that apply to construction vehicles, building procedures and other matters.

(CBC) Related Stories New front open in Walmart's war with Visa, as cards will soon be banned in Manitoba Goliath vs. Goliath: consumers caught in middle of high-stakes fee fight between Visa and Walmart As of Oct. 24, the 16 Walmart stores found through Manitoba will no longer accept Visa at the till, the mega-retailer confirmed Thursday. Walmart Canada's Visa ban expands to Manitoba from Thunder Bay "Manitoba was the next market that we felt was the right one for us to do develop this change," Alex Robertson with Walmart Canada told CBC News in Winnipeg Thursday. Robertson said the company spends $100 million a year on credit card fees, and the move away from Visa is all about saving money. This summer Visa bit back after Walmart announced plans to stop accepting its cards. Walmart pulled Visa from stores in Thunder Bay recently and Robertson said the results there have been positive thus far. "Customers have adopted alternate forms of payments and there's been minimal disruption to shopping patterns," he added. MasterCard, American Express and Discover cards will continue to be accepted.

Restaurants are rolling out fall-themed specials, and stores are bringing in truckloads of candy, all for the holiday. “When I’m done running candy, I hurt everywhere,” a Jonesville Walmart employee said. Walmart imports approximately 60 pallets of candy in preparation for the Halloween season. “The amount of candy in each pallet depends on what kind it is. For candy corn, you’re looking at about 800 pounds [per pallet].” The amount of candy imported at Walmart will continue to increase through Halloween and Thanksgiving and peak before Christmas. Walmart was not able to release revenue numbers for their holiday sales, but candy prices range from 98 cents to $19.88 per package. Hillsdale Community Schools hold a school-wide Halloween costume dance at Hillsdale High School on Saturday, Oct. 27. All grades in the Hillsdale Community School district are invited to the dance. “All the schools participate, and all the staff dresses up and hands out candy [in the classrooms],” said Lisa Gonschorowski, a paraprofessional at Bailey Elementary School. Hillsdale Academy takes a different approach to the Halloween season. “We do not celebrate Halloween at the Academy. We do, however, have a school-wide Thanksgiving feast the Tuesday before Thanksgiving,” said administrative aide Pat Iszler. Restaurants around Hillsdale are also bringing out specials and events that represent the fall season. Oakley Deli and Party Store said that they usually will do themed desserts and promotions in conjunction with holidays, but said that they were not sure what those will be, since it is usually a “last-minute decision.” Finish Line Family restaurant also said that they will have fall-themed specials, but that they only decorate for the Christmas season. Rick Tropiano, owner of Johnny T’s Bistro, said that they will roll out seasonal specials, such as pumpkin cheesecake and pumpkin-spiced cappuccinos — all homemade from locally-grown ingredients. Tropiano also said that they will “spruce up” the inside of the building for the holiday. “We really put a lot of time and effort into it,” he said.                 ebrune@hillsdale.edu SHARE Facebook Twitter Previous articleWeight Watchers to shape up campus Next article2012: Worst apple shortage in six decades Evan Brune RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR City News Hillsdale Police participate in No Shave November to raise money to fight child abuse City News Christmas season events around Hillsdale include baazars, parades, and a scavenger hunt City News Historical Society awards owners of restored homes Popular Posts Trump considering Arnn for secretary of education The silent majority has spoken Winner-take-all system is a loss for democracy 5 Endearing things about Hillsdale College Alumni win state legislature elections About The Collegian Advertise With Us Archives Join the Staff Subscribe Contact e-edition Dow Journalism Program WRFH Radio Free Hillsdale The Hillsdale Collegian Michigan’s Oldest College Newspaper Copyright @2016 Hillsdale Collegian Hillsdale College

Robo-shopping carts CBS News 9/15/2016 Aimee Picchi © Rick Wilking/Reuters lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, hurt by an unexpected decline in U.S. comparable sales and what the company called a competitive retail environment. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/Files (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS) America’s biggest private employer might be getting ready to outsource some jobs to robots. Walmart (WMT) has patented a robotic device that would create self-driving shopping carts, giving customers free hands while they shop. While that might benefit shoppers, the robot could lead to cutbacks in staff if it lives up to the potential highlighted in the patent, ranging from retrieving containers and abandoned items to helping with stocking and checking inventory. Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.85 -0.34 -0.49% A wave of automation is predicted to take 5.1 million jobs away from humans​ over the next five years, with low-paying, low-skill jobs considered those most at risk (even pizzerias may see more robots​ and fewer cooks in their kitchens). Walmart has always had a strained relationship with labor, ranging from pushing back against labor unions to coming under fire for what customers have complained are understaffed stores. Robots could prove an answer to Walmart’s labor headaches. “In the modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer,” the patent said. “Customers often require assistance that employees of the store are not always able to provide.” Also according to the patent: “Due to high employee turnover rates, available employees may not be fully trained or have access to information to adequately support customers.” Abandoned shopping carts, messy aisles, misplaced inventory and improper shelf prices are among the issues the patent highlighted. Robo-carts could be summoned by customers, respond to voice commands and use scanners to notice inventory issues. The system uses a number of small “motorized transport units” that would connect to the bottom of carts, as well as a central computer, video cameras, Wi-Fi and other components. Walmart said robo-carts are part of its ongoing efforts to improve customer service. “As the retail landscape continues to evolve, we want to be able to serve customers when and how they want to shop. That means testing new and innovative ways to serve the customer, which we’ve done through different initiatives like our grocery pickup service,” the company said in a statement.  It continued: “And while it’s too early to determine how we would even potentially use this technology, our goal always is to find ways to help simplify processes to help our associates better serve our customers as they will continue to play a critical role in the success of our business.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney Up Next 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from CBS News National Toy Hall of Fame finalists 2016 CBS News 5 steps to stop living paycheck to paycheck CBS News CBS News View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Walmart Canada has announced that stores in Manitoba will no longer accept Visa cards starting Oct. 24, but hasn’t provided any details on when the change will be coming to the rest of the country. A spokesperson from the retail giant confirmed that signage announcing the change is set to go up in the affected stores Thursday. Story continues below Spokesperson Alex Roberton said Manitoba was chosen second because it provided a “seamless transition” but didn’t elaborate on why. He confirmed that the policy is still on track to roll out nationwide, but wasn’t able to provide a timeline for any other provinces. The move comes as the retail giant and the credit card company remain locked in a battle over merchant fees. READ MORE: Visa vs. Walmart: Credit-card giant not flinching as Walmart begins not accepting cards Walmart pledged in June that it would stop accepting Visa at its more than 400 Canadian stores, saying it pays more than $100 million in fees annually for customers using credit cards. Manitoba is the second location to stop accepting Visa cards; in July the policy rolled out in three stores in Thunder Bay, Ont. WATCH: Walmart stops accepting Visa cards at 3 Canadian stores   The credit card company called the decision to expand the ban on their card “disappointing.” “Walmart’s decision to further limit Visa acceptance in Manitoba is disappointing,” a Visa spokesperson said in an email to Global News. “Visa remains committed to actively working with Walmart so that Canadians can use their Visa cards wherever they wish to shop.” Visa said it had offered Walmart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country but the retailer wanted more. In a separate statement issued on Wednesday, finance minister Bill Morneau said that Visa has met a previous, voluntary commitment to reduce its interchange fees, but there was no immediate data on how high the fees actually are. *With files from the Canadian Press © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

With the USDA reporting that in 2015, 42.2 million people in America, including more than 13 million children lived in households at risk of struggling with hunger, the Walmart and the Walmart Foundation grants are helping provide meals to those who need them the most and helping students access the nutritious food they need for focused minds -- both in and out of school. The $2.5 million in funding provided to NRPA from the Walmart Foundation will help over one million children and families by: Increasing the number of healthy meals children in low-income communities receive through the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) during out-of-school times. Providing nutrition literacy to children and families that create behavior change by teaching the importance of healthy eating. Implementing nutrition and physical activity standards that increase access to healthier foods and increase opportunities for physical activity. Promoting meal and program efficiencies that will decrease food waste and lead to more sustainable meal programs. "NRPA shares Walmart and the Walmart Foundation's commitment to fighting hunger and is thrilled to receive this grant funding -- continuing our long-standing partnership," said Barbara Tulipane, NRPA President and CEO. "Through this partnership we have been able to provide nearly 60 million healthy meals to youth, including 20 million meals in 2015, through our Commit to Health and nutrition programs." "These philanthropic investments are the latest examples of our long-standing commitment to hunger relief and dedication to ensuring every family has access to healthy and affordable food in the times and places they may need it," said Karrie Denniston, Senior Director of the Walmart Foundation. "Collaboration and dedication are key to making a positive impact on the issue of hunger in the U.S. and we're proud to work with the National Recreation and Park Association and our ten other nonprofit partners to support hunger relief and nutrition education for families in need. Thanks to the programs our partners have implemented, millions of children and families will have access to the healthy food needed to support a successful school year and beyond." The grant awarded to NRPA is one of 11 grants awarded to national nonprofit organizations totaling more than $33 million to fund nutrition education and meal programs for youth, and increase families' access to fruits and vegetables through state and federal nutrition assistance programs. In October of 2014, Walmart announced a commitment to create a more sustainable food system, with a focus on improving affordability by lowering the "true cost" of food for both customers and the environment, increasing access to food, making healthier eating easier, and improving the safety and transparency of the food chain. The commitment includes a goal of providing four billion meals to those in need by 2020. For more information about the grant awarded to the NRPA, visit www.nrpa.org/committohealth.

Walmart has more than 400 locations throughout Canada. Newslook Walmart customers line up to check out at the register. (Photo: Gunnar Rathbun/Invision for Walmart/AP Images) Shoppers who slap down Visa credit cards to pay for their purchases at some Walmart stores in Canada may be in for a shock. The big-box chain will stop accepting Visa credit cards at its 16 stores in Manitoba province, Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove confirmed Thursday in an interview, the latest escalation in a tiff over credit-card transaction fees. Although still limited to a fraction of Walmart's vast network, the fight reflects a deepening divide over the transaction fees Visa charges in Canada, where Walmart operates more than 400 stores. USA TODAY Jay Z gets soaked by Tidal streaming music service The boycott started this summer with Walmart's three stores in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Hargrove said Walmart (WMT) is "working to keep prices low" for shoppers -- and that apparently includes the hidden cost of those fees. "Unfortunately Visa has not been willing to provide a reasonable rate to continue accepting their cards," he said. "We believe credit-card fees should be lower for everyone, whether they're a large retailer, small business or charity." Visa (V) said in a statement that the decision was "disappointing" but said the company "remains committed to actively working with Walmart so that Canadians can use their Visa cards wherever they wish to shop." USA TODAY Monsanto, Bayer deal raises farmers' anxiety level In November 2014, Visa and Mastercard agreed to lower credit-card transaction fees in Canada to 1.5% beginning in April 2015 amid mounting pressure from Canadian authorities to cap fees and pass along savings to merchants. The Canadian finance minister said Tuesday that it would review recently completed "independent audit findings that both Visa and MasterCard have met their respective commitments to reduce credit-card interchange fees" to ensure that the companies are following through. Hargrove said the timing of Walmart's Manitoba boycott was not related to the Canadian finance minister's announcement. The boycott officially begins Oct. 24. He declined to reveal details of Walmart's fees arrangement with Visa. "We're committed to continuing discussions," he said, and "just looking to get a rate that's more reasonable." The dust-up between Walmart and Visa includes a dispute over how the Thunder Bay boycott has played out. "We know from our experience in Thunder Bay that consumers want the option to use the payment method of their choice when shopping — including at Walmart stores," Visa said. USA TODAY Apple shares soar 3.4% as multiple iPhone models sell out But Hargrove said "things went better than expected" in Thunder Bay. "Customers see the value we're providing and they've adjusted their payment methods accordingly," he said. Walmart shares rose 0.6% in early trading to $71.94. Visa shares were down a penny to $81.48.

Luckily one 13-year-old managed to see the funny side as she attempted to locate the tampons in her local supermarket - and created a hilarious text exchange in the process. Isabella Miller, from Cabot, Arkansas, popped into her local Walmart while her mother Belinda Hankins waited in the car outside. 'You stay in there until you find them': Belinda Hankins shared the exchange online after her daughter Isabella popped into a local branch of Walmart to find some tampons When she insisted that there were no tampons to be found, her mother replied: 'Yes I promise they are. Look near condoms are sex lube.'  She told her daughter she 'swore on her life' the tampons would be near the diapers, adding: 'There is no way they don't carry those essential items. You stay there until you find them.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next From a banana served inside a bag of spaghetti to a tin of... Would YOU wash your sanitary pad and re-use it? New feminine...

They're here tucked away in a corner unlabelled.' Her mother replied: 'No big sign reading "SUPER PERIOD CENTER?"' 'They labelled the tiny shelf of joint braces,' Isabella wrote. 'But not the massive aisle of stuff for your vagina?' Belinda deadpanned: 'Because there is NEVER a sign for that section. Vaginas are SECRET.' Her daughter took the joke one step further, writing: 'VAGINAS ARE MYTHS, WHISPERED QUIETLY IN SECRET AMONG ONLY THE BRAVEST OF MEN, COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO EVEN MENTION THE NAME.' She continued: 'BUT SERIOUSLY WHY ARE MEN SO AFRAID OF WOMEN AND VAGINAS?? DO THEY THINK IF THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR EXISTENCE WE WILL SHOOT OUR LASER ESTROGEN BEAMS OUT OF OUR EYES AT THEM AND DISINTEGRATE THEM WITH EASE.' DO NOT ENTER: Isabella drew her mother a humorous 'map' of the supermarket layout on her phone, with 'the vagina zone' cordoned off and 'danger: do not enter' signs. After Belinda encouraged her to continue to 'smash the patriarchy', the teen even drew her out a humorous 'map' of the supermarket layout - with 'the vagina zone' cordoned off and 'danger: do not enter' signs. Since Belinda proudly posted the exchange on Facebook, it has been liked and shared by more than 100,000 people. She said that while she never expected it to go viral, she was pleased that most people appeared to find it as 'funny and innocent and hilarious' as she did. Belinda took to Facebook to share the exchange, calling it the 'highlight' of her parenting week Since Belinda posted the exchange on Facebook, it has been liked and shared by more than 100,000 people - with Beth Albert Couch writing: 'Omg I love her' However, some had been laying into her 'like a pack of wild dogs', openly criticising her parenting abilities. 'I can't even count the parenting mistakes I've been accused of,' she wrote.  'Or the excessive mansplaining about how easy it is to find feminine hygiene products or how you could always just ask someone or just BE PREPARED, etc. etc.  'Oh, men of the Internet, is there anything you don't know better than us, even about menstruation? Clearly not.'

The move comes as the retail giant and the credit card company remain locked in a battle over merchant fees. Walmart pledged in June that it would stop accepting Visa at its more than 400 Canadian stores, saying it pays more than $100 million in fees annually for customers using credit cards. But the retailer took only a small step toward fulfilling that June pledge when it dropped the credit card from its three locations in Thunder Bay, Ont., on July 18. Visa, the country’s largest credit card firm, shot back by encouraging Walmart customers “to use their cards at the more than 5,200 stores in Thunder Bay that accept Visa.” Article Continued Below Visa said it had offered Walmart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country but the retailer wanted more. If it had given in, Visa said, Walmart’s merchant fees would have been lower than those charged to local grocery markets, pharmacies, convenience stores, charities and schools. When the battle first erupted, the Retail Council of Canada called on the federal government to intervene to mandate lower fees for all merchants. A spokesman for Finance Minister Bill Morneau said he was waiting to receive a report on the matter before deciding “how we can ensure this market stays competitive in the future.” Read more about: Walmart The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:35 PM, September 15, 2016 Updated: 5:30 AM, September 16, 2016 Wal-Mart Stores Inc's <WMT.N> Canadian unit will stop accepting Visa Inc <V.N> cards at 16 stores in the province of Manitoba starting Oct. 24, a company spokesman said on Wednesday, raising the stakes in a high-profile fee dispute in the country. Manitoba was "most ready" for the move on Visa cards, Wal-Mart spokesman Alex Roberton said, without giving any details on why the province was chosen. Wal-Mart Canada stopped accepting Visa cards in three Thunder Bay, Ontario stores in July and said the step would be mirrored across the country. The retailer, which has over 400 stores in Canada, added that the decision will not affect Wal-Mart stores outside the country. In a rare example of talks between a major retailer and credit card company spilling out in public, Wal-Mart said in June it had been unable to agree with Visa on an "acceptable fee" and would no longer accept the company's credit cards unless it got a better deal. Visa cards may be banned in more stores if the companies cannot reach an agreement, Wal-Mart spokesman Roberton said, though he did not specify which ones. "We're committed to continuing negotiations with Visa, and we are still hopeful of reaching an agreement‎." Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim said Walmart's decision to limit Visa acceptance in Manitoba was "disappointing." "We know from our experience in Thunder Bay that consumers want the option to use the payment method of their choice when shopping – including at Walmart stores," she added.

Now, it's his only paid work. Photo by: Jim Tankersley/The Washington Post LINCOLN, Del. — He is sitting on his mother's back porch on a September day too hot to earn any extra money mowing lawns. He's wondering what he'll do if he loses his slot at a Walmart truck repair shop next month, his surgically repaired back too fragile to do the work at the moment, and he is remembering a time when America felt more safe, more free and more like a family. "I'm doing worse than my parents' generation," he says, and then he counts the ways that's so: "I can't speak my mind. I can't get ahead. They take every dime I make anymore — in taxes, in insurance, whatever." Johnny West is 45, a grandfather, and an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump, whom he considers a kindred talk-from-the-gut spirit. In many ways, he embodies the anxieties and resentments that differentiate Trump's backers from other Americans. Feelings of economic decline, political powerlessness and antagonism toward immigrants distinguish Trump supporters from Clinton’s, according to new polling from The Washington Post and ABC News. For likely Trump voters such as West, those feelings intertwine in complicated ways. More than a third of Trump supporters in the new poll said that life has gotten worse for them compared to their parents, double the rate of Clinton supporters. Trump supporters are four times more likely than Clinton backers to say the United States is “less great than it has been in the past.” They are twice as likely to believe they have no influence whatsoever in Washington. [Is America still great? Clinton and Trump voters have starkly different views.] Almost a third of Trump supporters say that immigrants "strongly" weaken American society, four times the rate of Clinton supporters. But perhaps surprisingly, Trump backers who say they aren't getting ahead in the economy show little evidence of believing immigrants — or any other group of Americans — are getting ahead, either. Only 4 percent of Trump supporters say life is getting worse for them, but getting better for other groups of people. West, who has lived his whole life in this cornfield-crowded section of southern Delaware, says he and his neighbors have been deprived of economic opportunity by a corrupt government and profit-hungry corporations. "Everybody's getting gotten," he says. "I don't think anybody's getting ahead at my expense. They're just keeping us all down." When West was growing up here, his father worked in a plastics factory — still works there, in fact — and his mother raised her children at home. One income was enough to afford small luxuries, like dining out and the occasional vacation, he recalls. At age 18, West started a working life, and a family, of his own. He got married, had a daughter and took a job in the local plastics factory. One day, he fell from the top of a machine that turned pellets into sheets. He could barely move the next morning. Doctors told him he had herniated disks, but he was not a candidate for surgery. With limits on his mobility, he had to leave his job. West went on to sell cars, mow lawns and work several other jobs. He earned a commercial trucking license and finally, a decade ago, put a self-taught skill with engines to work in a repair shop for Walmart. He was making good money: $25 an hour, before insurance and taxes. The bad back finally wore him down. Late last year, his legs felt like a hundred needles were stinging them. Under a special program designed to help employees with spinal problems, Walmart agreed to pay for back surgery. He took six months of disability pay. When it ran out, he was limited in how much weight he could lift, so he could not perform his job at the repair shop. He has not drawn a paycheck since July, though Walmart said it would save a spot in the company for him for 12 weeks if he can find another suitable position. He expects to be formally let go in October. "I live here with my mom," West, now divorced, says from her porch, motioning toward the back door of a low-slung house. "This ain't mine. If it weren't for her, I'd be done." West's daughter is now grown, with two kids of her own. He has a son who is an assistant manager for a grocery store. He worries about their opportunities even more than his. He says big businesses don't care about their workers like they used to, and government officials cut deals to enrich those businesses — and themselves. He believes that all racial and ethnic groups are struggling equally in that system. But he also says, without mentioning specific examples, that immigrants in Delaware drive nicer cars than he does, and get free health care for the government, and that angers him. “I don’t have free health care. I don’t have anything handed to me,” he says. “I’m not bitter about that, but it does anger me. It ain’t fair, but you suck it up and move on.” In Trump's approach to governing, including his tax plan, West sees hope for a better economy and more job creation. In the candidate's style, he sees someone he can, at last, relate to in government. "He's a lot like me," West says. "He gets himself in trouble because he speaks right from his heart." West has been speaking for an hour, and the porch is heating toward boiling. He walks into the yard. He had plans to mow some lawns later in the morning with a young associate, as part of a side business he had started to supplement his income but loomed as his only source of it. But the forecast calls for temperatures in the 90s, and they decide to do the work the next day, when it should cool down. They drive to drop a mower off with West's son, who needs to cut his own yard. Along the way they roll down miles of back roads to a highway, past rows of brown corn stalks. Big green harvesters slice through the fields, knocking the husks to the ground. Emily Guskin contributed. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

And the best part: It costs less than $8, helping you save even more money at this retailer if you usually do most of your gift shopping here. And in case one beard-bearing Chia Pet isn’t enough, Walmart also offers a Chia Willie Robertson, a Chia Kermit, Chia Zombies, Chia Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and more. Walmart Stores, Inc. / Walmart Stores, Inc. 2. 3D Chrome VIP Lounge Toilet Seat Price: $49.99 Sure, the price tag is nearly $50. But if you’ve ever wanted to create that feeling of exclusivity in your very own bathroom — and who wouldn’t? — consider this VIP Lounge Toilet Seat available on the Walmart website through its Marketplace partner program. This wood-composition toilet with a chrome finish seat is decorated with “diamond-look gems” and embossed letters that will have you feeling like a VIP every time you VI-pee. Walmart Stores, Inc. / Walmart Stores, Inc. 3. 2 Hot Does Estrus Scent Price: $7.68 Are you a hunting enthusiast? Do you have a hunter in the family whose favorite sport is deer? If so, this is just one of the many hunting products designed to attract animals through smell. This “all-natural, Estrus-blend formula” keeps both local does and bucks intrigued, according to the item’s description. This is how it works: The scent “mimics nature” and attracts bucks to your area. If you’re near does that are actively breeding, it’s advised you place three to four scent wicks upwind of your hunting spot. Just don’t spill any on your clothes. Walmart Stores, Inc. / Walmart Stores, Inc. 4. Official Major League Baseball Caskets and Urns Price: St. Louis Cardinals Urn ($559), Casket ($2,259) All jokes about die-hard fans aside, Walmart.com offers official Major League Baseball caskets and urns featuring some of your favorite teams’ logos and colors. And, although it might have little to do with records and rivalries, it’s worth noting Walmart’s prices sometimes vary by team, at least when it comes to urns. For example, at the time of writing, a Chicago White Sox urn retails for $469.41 while the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets urns are as high as $798 each. Those prices might be high, but they’re nothing compared to these ridiculously expensive baseball memorabilia. Walmart Stores, Inc. / Walmart Stores, Inc. 5. ‘The Exorcist’ Movie Head Platter Price: $71.99 This platter featuring the head of the possessed child portrayed by Linda Blair in “The Exorcist” is perfect for a Halloween party, an Oscar party or any other time you want to impress your party guests — but only if you’re sure the green vomit oozing from her mouth won’t have them running away in disgust. And the doll head isn’t just decorative. It also rotates, flashes red eyes and recites lines from the classic 1973 horror film. Walmart Stores, Inc. / Walmart Stores, Inc. 6. Slipper Genie Dusting Slippers Price: $9.12 per pair Fashion meets function in these chenille slippers that allow wearers to clean their floors while they walk. Of all the things to buy at Walmart, this could be the perfect gift to sweep that special someone off their feet. And, considering the As Seen on TV Superstore price of $12.99, the Walmart price offers some significant savings for the cost-conscious clean freak.

Inflatable Big Baby Adult Halloween Costume Price: $30.13 Sure, DIY Halloween costumes are usually the way to go, especially if you want to save money on your kids’ costumes. But this year, go big on your costume — real big. This full-body big baby adult costume includes a battery-powered fan to inflate it. Just buy four AA batteries, and you’re good to go. And, considering Walmart lists this costume at more than $10 less than some other retailers, you won’t have to steal any candy from real babies, as the old saying goes. Walmart Stores, Inc. / Walmart Stores, Inc. 8. Redneck Christmas Mug Price: $7.20 Need a funny and cheap gift that will make someone laugh? Consider this ceramic mug, which showcases a cartoon titled “A Redneck Christmas.” The cartoon features some rather regional snacks for “Sante,” including a can of PBR Beer and a paper sack of roadkill jerky. Hung by the chimney with care is a stocking for Billy Bob. Walmart Stores, Inc. / Walmart Stores, Inc. 9. Trailer Park Santa Kit Gingerbread House Price: $24.99 In keeping with similar holiday themes, skip the traditional, boring gingerbread house and buy this Trailer Park Santa Kit instead. Offering a “humorous twist on a holiday tradition,” according to its description, this kit includes everything you need to make one gingerbread trailer and sleigh. This item is currently out of stock on Walmart.com, but it’s also available on Amazon.com for a few cents less, leaving you plenty of time for assembly between now and Christmas.

By Aimee Picchi MoneyWatch September 15, 2016, 5:00 AM Coming to a Walmart near you? Robo-shopping carts Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email America’s biggest private employer might be getting ready to outsource some jobs to robots. Walmart ( WMT) has patented a robotic device that would create self-driving shopping carts, giving customers free hands while they shop. While that might benefit shoppers, the robot could lead to cutbacks in staff if it lives up to the potential highlighted in the patent, ranging from retrieving containers and abandoned items to helping with stocking and checking inventory. A wave of automation is predicted to  take 5.1 million jobs away from humans over the next five years, with low-paying, low-skill jobs considered those most at risk (even pizzerias may see more robots and fewer cooks in their kitchens). Walmart has always had a strained relationship with labor, ranging from pushing back against labor unions to coming under fire for what customers have complained are understaffed stores. During the past two years, Walmart has invested $2.7 billion in education, training and higher wages, with about $1.5 billion of that investment coming in the current fiscal year, a spokesman said. Robots could prove an answer to Walmart’s labor headaches. “In the modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer,” the patent said. “Customers often require assistance that employees of the store are not always able to provide.” Also according to the patent: “Due to high employee turnover rates, available employees may not be fully trained or have access to information to adequately support customers.” United States Patent and Trademark Office Abandoned shopping carts, messy aisles, misplaced inventory and improper shelf prices are among the issues the patent highlighted. Robo-carts could be summoned by customers, respond to voice commands and use scanners to notice inventory issues. The system uses a number of small “motorized transport units” that would connect to the bottom of carts, as well as a central computer, video cameras, Wi-Fi and other components. Walmart said robo-carts are part of its ongoing efforts to improve customer service. “As the retail landscape continues to evolve, we want to be able to serve customers when and how they want to shop. That means testing new and innovative ways to serve the customer, which we’ve done through different initiatives like our grocery pickup service,” the company said in a statement.  It continued: “And while it’s too early to determine how we would even potentially use this technology, our goal always is to find ways to help simplify processes to help our associates better serve our customers as they will continue to play a critical role in the success of our business.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Buy Now Jim Lee, Sioux City Journal CNOS athletic trainer Brandon Marreel watches with North High football players during a 2012 football practice. SIOUX CITY | That sinking feeling didn't sneak up on Brandon Marreel as much as it punched him in the gut. Driving away from Walmart at Southern Hills he scrambled for his checkbook. Wallet? There. Cell phone? Got it. Checkbook? Nope. Marreel, a Sioux City resident, had run errands that morning. His last stop involved a grocery run at Walmart. He knew he had his checkbook with him at that time. He turned around and found the cart he'd used. His checkbook, a brown leather one with a Wells Fargo logo, wasn't there. "I went inside and spoke with the checkout teller, who remembered me being there," Marreel said. "We didn't find anything. I checked at Customer Service. Nothing there, either." Marreel did what many men do in a time of panic: He called his wife. "I called Heather to have her walk me through what I should do," Brandon Marreel said. "She asked me if I still had my phone, my wallet and my ID, which I did. She told me to come home and we'd look there before contacting the bank." Within minutes Marreel was home poking around the house. Finding nothing, he called the officials at Wells Fargo who set up a new account, created a link from his old account to the new one and transferred his money. "I was worried, of course, that someone had my checkbook and would maybe be writing checks all weekend," he said. "You know, I hate to admit this, but I haven't been asked for my ID while writing or cashing a check in a long time." He had three checks that hadn't been cashed. One was to his church and one was to the Catholic schools in Sioux City, where the Marreels send their children. Marreel spent the Labor Day weekend with some feelings of unease, as you can expect. "He cancelled the checks through Wells Fargo and they put out a fraud alert," Heather said. "We knew that everything would be covered from that standpoint, but you still wonder. We hoped it wasn't floating around with someone who would do harm." And then last Tuesday, a letter came in the mail. It had no return address and no signature on the card. The postmark was blurred, so the Marreels couldn't even tell where it came from. They recognized what was inside, however. It was Brandon's checkbook. And a card that read, "Hi - found this in a shopping cart at Walmart parking lot 9/2/16 -- there was no phone # and I do not live in the city, hope you have a great day. "Believe. Be in faith -- live with God. I am in His welfare (sic) line too!" "We have no idea who it came from," Brandon said. "Even though I can't use the checks any more, it's good to know no one else can use them." Brandon, an athletic trainer for CNOS, helps dozens, if not hundreds, of people each month. He eases their physical pain while providing a sense of relief and well-being. He remarked that an anonymous stranger did it for him with this simple act of kindness. "There is still hope that people would rather protect one another than take from one another," he said. "You read about these things happening and then it happened to us," Heather concluded. "It's a nice lesson for our girls to see: There are good people in the world." The Marreels got another package in the mail on Monday. This item didn't come from an anonymous source. The package came from Wells Fargo: New checks.

Published Sep 14th, 2016 5:42 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas A robotic shopping cart is yet another example of the “test and learn” mindset infused into the DNA of Wal-Mart Stores by founder Sam Walton. The company hopes self-driving shopping carts could enhance consumer experiences as well as increase operating efficiencies. The U.S. Government on Sept. 8 approved a patent for Wal-Mart Stores that details technology that could be applied to shopping carts to automate their movements when connected to smartphones or other devices. The smart cart that can drive itself is not a new concept, but if automobiles, semi trucks and airplanes can be equipped to self pilot it stands to reason shopping carts could do the same. Lorenzo Lopez, corporate spokesman for Walmart U.S., said the retailer had a concept for the smart cart but it’s just one of the dozens of technology applications being examined by Wal-Mart. “We continually are looking at applications of technology that allow us to better serve our customers. This concept would be part of the shopping experience and it could do some other functions as well. There is not a plan in place at this time regarding this concept,” Lopez told Talk Business & Politics. He said there would be lots of testing and learning before any concept could be put into the retailer’s everyday operation, and he offered no timeline for the testing phase. The 62-page patent application noted one use for the technology concept would be to equip typical shopping carts with detachable motors. The motors that would be placed below the bottom rack of the shopping cart would have video cameras and sensors and be controlled from a central command center and easily interfaced with mobile devices such as smart phones. (Link here for the PDF of the application.) A customer would request a cart and one would be dispatched. The self-driving carts return to the cart dock when groceries are unloaded by the shopper at their car. There would be no need for shoppers to push the carts toward a holding area and there would be no empty carts left stranded in parking lots or store aisles. The application also addressed how motorized carts could help stores keep track of inventory. If a manager wants to see if a particular item is in stock after searching the inventory system, a smart cart could be sent to the shelf to ensure the product is there. The camera on the device could photograph the shelf to ensure correct pricing and labeling. While robots have become standard in manufacturing, they are still a novelty in retail and other applications. Wal-Mart told the media during its shareholder week in June that they have a team of scientists and technology experts continually looking at ways technology can be used to deliver efficiency and convenience for the business and customers. The innovation team also is looking at drone technology and exploring how that can be used across the business. Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Bentonville-based Spieckerman Retail, said smart carts are part of a move to personalize the retail experience. “Smart cart technology is a retail inevitability and no two retailers will approach it the same way. It is yet another example of the digital rethinking of physical retail and reinforces retailers’ determination to create more engaging and intuitive in-store experiences,” Spieckerman told Talk Business & Politics. “Smart carts also have the potential to become a powerful personalization tool that can track shopping lists, store personalized payment information and even monitor shoppers’ dietary preferences and restrictions. The possibilities are truly endless. For retailers, having the ability to track shoppers’ in-store journeys and tie them to actual purchases will be invaluable.” Spieckerman also said Wal-Mart is fully invested in trying as many ideas as possible. “The retailers that have made it this far have to be in a constant state of ‘multi-testing’ and Walmart is embracing this sensibility as never before. The days of going all-in or chain-wide on a single experiment or, conversely, dabbling in innovations one-at-a-time are over. Having the courage to fail fast and move on will also be critical going forward. No sacred cows or hanging on and hoping for traction,” Spieckerman said. This summer Wal-Mart confirmed it also is evaluating another smart cart prototype developed by Five Elements Robotics. Wal-Mart spokesman Ravi Jariwala said the retailer was evaluating a smart cart prototype in its lab and giving feedback to the robotics company. Five Elements Robotics first developed Budgee in early 2014 with the goal of seeing the robot integrated into daily life. The robot is equipped to carry items for the user. Budgee weighs less than 20 pounds and can be driven by remote control using a smartphone or tablet. The company said in 2014 a second target for this type of smart cart would be retail chains and mall management services. “For retail chains such as Walmart, KMart, Target, etc, having a fleet of Budgees will not only draw shoppers due to the novelty, but also help them with sales,” Budgee said in a statement. This type of smart cart can be equipped with helpful information such as where is the store items are located and also reminded customers of sales items and their locations in the store. The robot can also be equipped with a scanner to better facilitate checkout and allow customers to skip the line. The company also said the smart cart could alert management if a customer tries to leave with an item they didn’t purchase. Budgee retails for $1,399 and can carry up to 50 pounds. It is not clear what prototype Walmart is evaluating. Analysts agreed it’s unlikely that Walmart would spend that kind of money on shopping carts, but given the retailer’s own tech savvy perhaps there is a way Wal-Mart can make its own shopping carts smarter in the years to come. The recent patent approval could be a step in that direction.

Target Keeps Building Tiny Stores, Tries To Succeed Where Walmart Failed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Target Keeps Building Tiny Stores, Tries To Succeed Where Walmart Failed Image courtesy of Steve September 14, 2016 5:11 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup tiny targets mini-stores small big boxes target brian cornell For the first half of this decade, Walmart experimented with mini-stores: tiny Walmarts that fanned out across the country, serving markets too small to support a full-size store. The experiment ultimately failed, and Walmart closed all of its Express stores at the beginning of 2016. Target, however, wants to take over the business of building tiny big boxes, planning to build at least 25 more through 2017. The chains’ strategies do differ, though. Target’s mini-stores are in urban neighborhoods where a full-size Target simply wouldn’t fit, while the Walmart Express experiment mostly put stores in small rural towns. Target CEO Brian Cornell said today during the company’s annual meeting that if the concept succeeds, we could see hundreds of tiny Targets across the country. “Tiny” is a relative term when it comes to big-box stores, of course, since the smaller Target stores are usually about 50,000 square feet. Notably, though, both chains have experimented with mini-stores on or near college campuses. Cornell says that a store near the University of Maryland, for example, carries a lot of clothing and cosmetics. A second purpose for mini-stores is as access points: yes, you can buy stuff there, but more importantly, they bring in-store pickup closer to urban dwellers.

A man told police that two cars pulled up in the parking lot, and blocking his car in the parking spot. He said the victim was putting groceries into the back of his car when three people got out and started punching and kicking him. Luckily for him, a Comanche Nation officer happened to see the fight, and ran over to help. He drew his service weapon and ordered everyone to get on the ground until Lawton police got there. "I would do it a 100 times over if I had to and If I see someone else in trouble, you can guarantee it, I'll be right there to help them," John Lawrence, Comanche Nation Police Officer. Officer John Lawrence says he was just running a quick errand with his wife, son and daughter and on the way out unexpectedly witnessed a fight. Oddly enough, he says this isn't the first time this has happened at the same Walmart. He once broke up a small fight after someone attempted to steal from the store. He says stepping up to put an end to it, just came natural. "It's just pure instincts. No one deserves to be treated that way. No one deserves to be hurt Whether I'm in law enforcement or not, I think any good citizen would do the same thing and any law enforcement officer would do the same thing. It's our obligation as a human being, as a person," said Lawrence. A witness close by was able to capture some of the incident on video. He says he's thankful the officer was at the right place at the right time. "I was just thinking holy cow this is going on right in front of me. I was just shocked. I was completely shocked that I was in Walmart and I was around for something like that to happen. I was a little scared that I didn't know what was going to happen, that guns were drawn," said Patrick Carney, a witness. Carney says he's thankful there are good Samaritans and officers who will step up and protect this community whether they're on duty or not. "I just want to say thank you to that officer for doing his job, and I mean, he did a great job. He defused the situation and he showed his badge to let everyone know he was a police officer and not just some random guy with a gun," said Carney. Lawrence says the victim's wife and young child were close by when he was attacked. He says knowing he might have helped save that man's life is touching. "I mean, it makes me feel good. I'm glad that he's able to go home to his newborn son and and take his wife and newborn son home and spend the rest of the day with them, rather than being in the hospital or worse. He didn't deserve to have that happen to him and his child didn't deserve to have that happen in front of him," said Lawrence. Officer Lawrence says he hopes other Samaritans will learn from this and not be afraid to put an end to incidents where people might be in danger. He also says if you do carry a firearm, to make sure you do have a conceal and carry permit. Two of the suspects were arrested for disorderly conduct. The third person involved, ran away from the scene.  Copyright 2016 KSWO. All rights reserved.

Responding paramedics administered Narcan to revive the Newbury man, 21, and took him to Hillcrest Hospital. Officers located multiple indicators of drug use in the stall. The incident was turned over to the drug enforcement unit for investigation. Theft from auto, Queens Park Avenue: A man reported Aug. 31 he believed his wallet was stolen from his vehicle while it was parked in his driveway. He believed he left the vehicle unlocked because there were no signs of forced entry. Inside the wallet were debit and credit cards, which he learned had been used fraudulently to make purchases at a Giant Eagle store in Cleveland and at an unknown Walmart location. The four purchases at Giant Eagle totaled over $350 and the Walmart purchase was $106.21. Officers are investigating and checking to see if the Giant Eagle store has surveillance video of the transaction. Theft, Mayfield Road: A woman and her fiancé suspect a friend that they allowed to briefly live with them when he moved from Florida, may have stolen the woman's debit card before he moved out of their apartment Aug. 30. There were fraudulent charges made to the card at the city's Target store and online at T-Mobile. They said there was nobody else in the apartment and the charges were made a day before the man, 26, moved out. While he was there, they said they had issues with him regarding living conditions, personal space, personal property and unusual behaviors. The woman's bank is investigating. Theft from building, Eastgate Plaza: A woman, 78, reported Sept. 1 her wallet was stolen from her purse while she was shopping at Marc's the previous day. She said a woman kept asking her questions about cereals and she answered her questions because she wanted to be polite. At one point, she said she turned her back to her purse, which was in her cart. She was unable to locate the wallet after the encounter. Inside the purse, was her roommate's credit card, which the man, 80, later found to have been used fraudulently at the Home Depot in Euclid to make a $1,287 purchase. Officers reviewed surveillance video from Marc's but did not see the incident or any suspects. They are investigating and trying to obtain surveillance video from Home Depot. Theft, Mayfield Road: A True North Shell employee reported at 1:30 a.m. Sept. 3 a man stole a can of Mike's Hard Lemonade after she declined selling it to him because of the time of day. She said he concealed it in his pants and left the store. She provided officers with a description of the vehicle he left in and they located the vehicle and stopped it at a neighboring business. The driver denied stealing the item, but it was subsequently located inside the vehicle and the Mayfield Heights man, 20, was cited for theft, driving under suspension and underage alcohol possession. Two passengers were inside the vehicle. One was drunk and the other also had a suspended driver's license. Impaired driving, Mayfield Road: A Mayfield Village man, 27, was arrested for OVI after officers found him asleep at the wheel of his vehicle at 1 a.m. Sept. 4. His foot was on the brake and the car was in gear. Officers had to tell him how to move the gear shifter to place it into park. He said he was coming from Panini's and admitted he had been drinking alcohol. Menacing, Mayfield Road: A woman, 21, reported at 11:50 p.m. Sept. 5 a car, occupied by five people, followed her from Lyndhurst into the city and then into the Walmart parking lot. She said the occupants were yelling at her as she drove and she was trying to elude them. At one point, she said the driver tried to run her off the road, causing her five-year-old daughter to hit her head on a back seat window. After she turned into the parking lot, she said she remained in her car as they all surrounded it and yelled at her for being scared. She said the male, who had been driving, then yelled at her to get out of the car while pointing a gun at her. She was subsequently able to drive to the police station. She provided officers with the license plate number of the suspect's car and a picture she took of one of them. The vehicle was registered to a 22-year-old Cleveland Heights man. Officers from that city checked his residence, but did not locate the car. The woman did not know any of the people in the car. She said there were two female and two male passengers. The incident remains under investigation. Suspicion, SOM Center Road: Officers responded to the Target parking lot Sept. 3 after someone saw a man trying to force a child into his car. They learned the man was the child's father and the boy was upset because he did not get a toy at the store. The boy calmed down and the family left the area. Disturbance, Marsol Road: Just after midnight Sept. 4, a woman, 54, reported her boyfriend was at her apartment and tried to steal her dog. She said they had both been drinking alcohol. Responding officers learned the couple was only arguing. The woman's son arrived and said he would monitor the situation and call police if there was a problem. While there, officers confiscated a sword for safekeeping and told the man he could retrieve it when he becomes sober. Suspicion, Lander Road: A Mattress Firm manager said Sept. 4 it appeared someone broke into the store because the staff found empty beer cans inside of it. He said they would file a report if they found anything missing or damaged and he requested special attention to the store.

Dan Voorhis The Wichita Eagle Kroger, the parent of Dillons, said it expects grocery prices overall to stay down into 2017. Dan Voorhis The Wichita Eagle 1 of 2 i By Dan Voorhis dvoorhis@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The low price of eggs is a nice surprise at the grocery store these days – but is it too much of a good thing? Prices for eggs – as well as for cheese and other dairy products, meat, grains, gasoline and diesel fuel – are all down from a year ago. And it’s giving grocers indigestion. Kroger, parent of Dillon Stores, and Wal-Mart – the nation’s two largest grocers – both reported in recent conference calls an overall fall in food prices, which has cut sales growth, profit growth and their stock prices in recent quarters. Corporate officials and analysts in the industry have dubbed it “food deflation.” It’s caused by a low ebb in the cycles of a series of food commodities sold on grocery store shelves. The price drop has caused trouble for food producers, manufacturers and, now, grocers. The big winners are consumers. The price drop is a big factor in holding down inflation and allowing people to survive on their wages, which had been fairly stagnant until recently. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the price of food bought to eat at home was down 1.6 percent from a year ago, even while the price of food bought at restaurants was up 2.6 percent. So what does that mean for the big grocery chains when prices are falling? It’s a challenge to their financial models, which assume price inflation, allowing them to show increased store sales and more flexibility in pricing. Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen told analysts in a recent conference call that the chain’s grocery prices overall were down 1.5 percent for the quarter compared to a year ago. Wal-Mart, in its most recent quarterly filing, showed that food prices were down 1 percent compared to a year ago. Jim Hertel, senior vice president of industry consulting firm Willard Bishop and Inman Analytics, said falling food prices expose store operations to greater scrutiny. Kroger, for instance, held off on $500 million in capital expenditures because profit growth didn’t hit targets. “I think the key piece of it is that, for years, grocery retailers have counted on 3 to 5 percent food inflation as a source of profit growth, and when that’s not forthcoming, as we are seeing, it sheds lights on other parts of the business,” he said. Why are prices down? Commodities prices cycle up and down based on supply and demand. In recent years, U.S. crop and livestock farmers enjoyed high prices caused by drought and strong export demand. To take advantage, they pushed to increase production, which then turned into overproduction as the drought receded, weather improved and global demand for U.S. exports slackened. Grain prices and gasoline prices dropped sharply in late 2014, and meat and poultry prices started dropping sharply last year. Eggs had a particularly sharp price drop. When the bird flu arrived from Asia in the spring of 2015, egg and meat producers in the West and the Midwest destroyed 40 million chickens to contain the infection. As chicken and egg prices shot up, consumers and processed-food manufacturers cut back. The industry recovered in numbers faster than expected, but some of the demand hasn’t returned. The result: a price collapse for eggs, down 29 percent from a year ago, according to the USDA. Beef producers and packers saw a similar cycle, but it was spread out over more time. The Midwestern drought of 2011 to 2014 pushed up the costs of raising cattle, causing many ranchers to cut back their herds. By 2013, the rains started to return, and farmers started holding back female calves to breed, adding to the shortage. By late 2014 and into early 2015, beef prices were sky high. But as additional cattle started working its way through the system, prices started dropping. As of July, beef prices are down 7.7 percent from a year ago. Also from a year ago, dairy prices are down 3.1 percent and poultry is down 3.2 percent. Even the price of cereals and bakery products, such as bread or crackers, is down 0.8 percent, according to the USDA. Only the price of fresh fruits and vegetables was up, by 1.4 percent. Compounding the problem for some grocery chains is that Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest grocer, has aggressively recommitted to lowering prices. The company is also dealing with food deflation but is better able than most grocers to absorb that, with its broad array of general merchandise products. “You always want that customer coming away realizing that, on a basket of goods, they got the best deal at Wal-Mart. And that’s who we are as a company,” chief financial officer Brett Biggs said at an investor conference this month. McMullen, Kroger’s CEO, said the company – which has focused its strategy on the customer experience rather than simply price – hasn’t seen much impact from its competitors, such as Wal-Mart. How will this fix itself? McMullen told analysts he expects deflation to continue into early next year. “High prices solve high prices, and low prices solve low prices,” McMullen said in the conference call. “Farmers are smart, and they will start producing less of the things that don’t make money.” As demand rises and supplies fall, prices will start to rise. But Hertel, the industry analyst, said there may be some longer-term changes that gradually steer grocers away from being so dependent on the up-and-down swings of the commodities markets. The more processing and preparation involved in food sales, the less commodities price swings will matter, he said. That dovetails with the arrival of the millennial generation and its bias toward more convenience and quality over concerns about price, Hertel said. “Right now, the grocery industry is focused on food consumed at home,” Hertel said. “But you’re starting to see a real blurring in the midst of this deflation. “One of the things creeping in is a move to more prepared foods in store. They’re called ‘grocerants.’ “And that move to more prepared foods will start to mitigate their dependence on some of the commodity price fluctuations,” Hertel said. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:29 Woman killed, infant missing Pause 2:49 Salvation Army announces fundraising goal to kick off holiday season 3:07 So what can Trump actually do in his first 100 days? 0:36 30-second pizza 1:35 Trump transition team member: Wall will get built 0:42 Supermoon over Wichita 3:10 Wichita State forwards come up big in win over Tulsa 4:38 Dining with Denise: Wichita's most obscene foods 0:39 Fatal shooting on East Harry 0:15 Quarterback celebrates with a heart for his sister Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Dillons adds online grocery shopping in Wichita Starting at the 21st and Maize store and moving to six stores in the market by year's end, Dillons is adding online shopping.

Patent reveals 'disc-shaped' robots that allow carts to navigate the stores Patent filed 4 months before rumors surfaced of driverless carts Describes motorized robots that could slide underneath shopping carts Customers could control units with mobile device or voice commands  Also describes 'parcel retrieval process' that places items in the cart e-mail 67 shares 4 View comments While driverless cars may be a few years away, it appears self-driving shopping carts are right around the corner. Walmart has been awarded a patent illustrating ‘disc-shaped’ robots that use sensors and cameras to transport and navigate shopping carts throughout stores. This application comes two months after reports surfaced that the firm was developing driverless carts that scan a customer's shopping list and then guide them to the aisles and shelves. The patent suggests the system could easily retrieve abandon carts ‘in and around the area of the shopping facility, including the sale floor areas and back-room areas’. Pictured are the motorized robots underneath the shopping carts WALMART'S NEW  PATENT  Walmart was awarded a patent called ‘Shopping Facility Assistance Systems, Devices and Methods’ is the patents title which was filed on March 4, 2016. The pages describe a ‘motorized transport unit’ that is a disc-shaped robotic device designed with motorized wheels, which transports and navigates the shopping carts through the store.  Customers could summon the robots by pushing a button. When the cart arrives, the person would either push the cart or have the robot drive. It could also be controlled with a mobile device or voice commands.  The document describes components of inventory tracking and parcel retrieval process using a multitiered inventory system. Illustrations suggest the shopping cart would be navigated to specific locations where items could be placed, swept or blown into the car ‘Shopping Facility Assistance Systems, Devices and Methods’ is the title of a patent filed on March 4, 2016, which is just four months before Bloomberg reported that Five Elements Robotics collaborated with Wal-Mart to build the tech savvy carts. DailyMail.com has contacted Walmart for comment and has yet to hear a response. The new patent presents an illustration of a ‘motorized transport unit’ that is a disc-shaped robotic device designed with motorized wheels. These devices are neatly arranged in a docking area, where they wait to be summoned by shoppers. Somewhere in the store will be a central computer that transmits a wireless signal to the unit, informing it of the customer’s location after the human pushes the request button, reports PatentYogi. The motorized unit then exits the holding area and navigates itself to the shopping cart storage where it slides under an empty cart, and both objects then head towards the customer's location.  Customers would have two options with Walmart's technology: they can either detach the shopping cart from the robotic disk to push it themselves or navigate the motorized unit using a mobile device.

Share this article Share 67 shares The patent also suggests the system could respond to voice commands. ‘The user may speak voice commands to the motorized transport unit itself and/or to the user interface unit,’ reads the patent. ‘In some embodiments, a voice print is used to authorize to use a motorized transport unit to allow voice commands from a single user at a time’.  The new patent presents an illustration of a ‘motorized transport unit’ (pictured) that is a disc-shaped robotic device designed with motorized wheels. These devices are neatly arranged in a docking area, where they wait to be summoned by shoppers The motorized unit then exits the holding area and navigates itself to the shopping car storage where it slides under an empty shopping cart, and both objects then head towards the customer's location. It has a second tier that activates when it slides under a shopping cart Although this technology is aimed at helping its customers, Walmart believes it will also be a fan favorite among its employees. The pages in the patent suggests the system could easily retrieve abandon carts ‘in and around the area of the shopping facility, including the sale floor areas and back-room areas’. The technology would use its visual recognition to tap into the store’s cameras, user interface units and central computer systems to identify the lonely shopping carts and use the motorized units to return them back to the storing area.  Customers has two options: they can either detach the shopping cart from the robotic disk to push it themselves or navigate the motorized unit using a mobile device. The patent also suggests the system could respond to voice commands REPORTS FROM BLOOMBERG Wal-Mart is working with a robotics firm to developing 'driverless' shopping carts that help customers find items on their lists. It has implemented tools that allow consumers to scan and purchase items using their mobile phones –without ever having to step foot in a checkout line. Wal-Mart is also working on an online grocery service that brings a cart full of edibles right to the customer's vehicle in the parking lot and in some cities the firm has teamed up with Uber and Lyft for home delivery. Walmart's new system may also end the frustration of not being able to find items on your shopping list. The document describes components of inventory tracking and parcel retrieval process using a multitiered inventory system. Illustrations suggest the shopping cart would navigate to specific locations where items could be placed, swept or blown into the car - this portion coincides with news that surfaced this past June. Altogether, this new innovation is a way for Walmart to compete with the convenience that Amazon and other online stores offer consumers. 'I don't have a lot of details to share but here's what I can tell you', Ravi Jariwala, director of public relations at Wal-Mart, told DailyMail.com in June. Walmart has been awarded a patent illustrating ‘disc-shaped’ robots that use sensors and cameras to navigate shopping carts for customers throughout shopping centers. This is just two months after rumors surfaced that the firm was developing driverless carts 'We test many new technologies at any given time, including innovations from several companies.' 'We are focused on testing how these advanced technologies can help make shopping faster, easier and more convenient for our customers.' Bloomberg reported that Five Elements Robotics has collaborated with Wal-Mart to build the tech savvy carts, following a panel discussion with the New Jersey firm's founder and CEO Wendy Roberts. During the conference, Roberts said they are working on a project with the 'world's largest retailer', a title given to Wal-Mart this year by Market Watches. And although Wal-Mart has declined to share any details, a person familiar told Bloomberg that a prototype is currently in the works and the firm is providing feedback on the design and technology.  Rumors surfaced in June that Walmart was working with a robotics firm to develop 'driverless' shopping carts that will help customers find items on their lists. This new innovation is a way for the retiler to compete with the convenience that Amazon WAL-MART TO TAKE ON AMAZON IN DRONE WARS  Wal-Mart says using the drones enables it to check inventory in about a day or less, instead of a month that it takes manually. Right now, employees stand on lifts that go up and down the stacks, and scan items to make sure that boxes are in the right place. Shekar Natarajan, Wal-Mart's vice president of logistics strategy, told reporters the technology is custom-built on top of the drone and is proprietary for Wal-Mart. 'We are still in early phases of testing and understanding how drones can be better used in different types of business functions,' he said. The remotely controlled drone captured 30 frames per second of products on aisles and alerted the user when product ran out or was incorrectly stocked. Natarajan said drones can reduce the labor intensive process of checking stocks around the warehouse to one day. It currently takes a month to finish manually. A control tower will oversee the images on a screen and will send alerts when items are flagged so that workers can go back to the stacks to fix the issue. This innovation is among a handful of others the American corporation is developing in order to compete with e-commerce sites that are slowly taking over the world of retail.  Wal-Mart has implemented tools that allow consumers to scan and purchase items using their mobile phones –without ever having to step foot in a checkout line. It is also working on an online grocery service that brings a cart full of edibles right to the customer's vehicle in the parking lot and in some cities the firm has teamed up with Uber and Lyft for home delivery. Although Walmart declined to share details, a person familiar told Bloomberg that a prototype is currently in the works and the firm is providing feedback on the design and technology. This innovation is among a handful of others the American corporation is developing The grocery service is said to be a bid to gain back shares and business Wal-Mart has lost to rivals like Kroger and Costco Wholesale. Since 2008, grocery sales at Wal-Mart US division has contributed 100.4 percent of its sales growth, which is $48.7 billion, increasing overall revenue from 47 percent to 56 percent, reports The Motley Fool. The retailer is also toying with drones as a method to deliver online orders or monitor inventory in its distribution centers. AMAZON DRONE DELIVERIES COULD BEGIN IN TWO YEARS  Drones could be bringing parcels to your door within two years, thanks to a bill that left the Senate in april. The bipartisan aviation policy bill, which passed the Senate 95-3 earlier this month, demands that the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) authorize package deliveries by drones within two years. Amazon says Prime Air will start once government regulations are in place to support it. It has development centers in the U.S., the U.K. and Israel The bill, which must now be debated by the House, also makes changes to various regulations including those affecting airport security and airplane pricing. The FAA currently bans commercial drone flights but has granted several thousand waivers. It has granted Amazon approval to fly drones for research. The drones will fly under 400 feet and weigh less than 55 pounds, according to details posted on Amazon's web site.  Amazon says Prime Air will start once government regulations are in place to support it. It has development centers in the U.S., the U.K. and Israel. Although Wal-Mart has been operating since 1962, the corporation has stuck very close to its traditional ways of operating. However, as technology advances the firm has found itself in a race to impress investors – not only with competing technology, but prove they can maintain the honorable title of 'world's largest retailer'. Over the past few years, Wal-Mart has reported a slow in revenues and profits are projected to fall as much as 12 percent this year due to more spending on wages and its technology operations.   Read more: Wal-Mart Experimenting With Robotic Shopping Cart for Stores - Bloomberg Why Wal-Mart Needs Grocery Pick-Up to Work -- The Motley Fool Self-driven shopping carts to follow Walmart shoppers - PatentYogi Share or comment on this article e-mail 67 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

Working on Self-Driving Shopping Carts The carts could help customers find items in the store Sep 14, 2016, 11:24 am EST  |  By William White, InvestorPlace Writer     Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is working on self-driving shopping carts. Source: Flickr A patent filed by Walmart with the US Patent & Trademark Office reveals plans for shopping carts that customers can summon with the aide of an interface device, which would likely be a smartphone. The patent mentions that these carts would have motors attached to them with sensors that could let them see their surroundings. One possible use of the Walmart self-driving shopping carts would be returning carts to the store. This could mean that carts corrals would no longer be needed and employees wouldn’t be given the task. The cart could also scan store shelves to assure that they stay stocked with products for customers to buy and lead them to the items. The system to create self-driving shopping carts would have the company retrofitting its normal carts with new technology. This technology would be a motor with various sensors. The motor in the patent is detachable, which means it could be used on different carts, reports CNNMoney. Five Elements Robotics is reportedly working with Walmart to develop the self-driving shopping carts. The robotics company is said to be evaluating a prototype in its lab. This wouldn’t be the company’s first helpful robot. It also released Budgee in 2014. This robot is designed to help a person carry things in inside and outside environments. It has been used to help people with disabilities, Bloomberg notes. Walmart’s work on self-driving shopping carts is likely part of an effort to make shopping easier on customers. The retailer has been working to find ways to better compete with online retailer Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

 You'll soon be able to get cookie fries and deep-fried hash browns at this Walmart Kate Taylor Sep. 14, 2016, 10:18 AM 1,198 facebook linkedin twitter email print Issac Rousso's Cookie Fries were named Most Creative at this years' Big Tex Awards at the State Fair. State Fair of Texas A Walmart in Plano, Texas is about to become a destination for bizarre, deep-fried foods.  State Fair Treats will open next week, serving items inspired by State Fair favorites such as cookie fries, funnel cake fries, and deep-fried hash browns stuffed with bacon and cheddar cheese, reports the Dallas News.  The restaurant — which replaced a McDonald's previously located in the Walmart — is the brainchild of Issac Rousso, a restaurateur who has established himself as a State Fair champion. Rousso's past State Fair hits, which will serve as menu inspiration for the Walmart location, include the Smoky Bacon Margarita, Deep Fried Cuban Roll, and Fried Pop Tart.  Why yes, I think I will!! #texasstatefair #smokybaconmargarita A photo posted by @offgridtinylife_shelly on Oct 17, 2015 at 9:09am PDT on Oct 17, 2015 at 9:09am PDT "Walmart was looking for a creative new food concept to energize high-profile locations," Rousso told Dallas News. "They loved the idea of finding someone who was able to take an idea and constantly create something fresh and innovative." While many Walmart locations around the US have long rented space to local franchises, such as Subway or McDonald's, it is less common to see original concepts like State Fair Treats.  Rousso's Deep-Fried Cuban Roll won the Best Taste Big Tex Award in 2013. State Fair of Texas Walmart will serve as the landlord, not an investor in State Fair Treats, according to the Dallas News. The hope is the restaurant will serve as another reason to visit the store.  Collaborations between retailers and restaurants are increasingly common, as retailers look for ways to improve in-store experience and boost traffic. Whole Foods is opening an outpost of the popular vegan concept By Chloe in a store in Los Angeles and investing in the gourmet sandwich chain Mendocino Farms. Last year, Urban Outfitters purchased a pizza chain and several fine-dining restaurants.  SEE ALSO: Walmart is patenting 'mini-robot' technology that could have terrifying implications for workers NOW WATCH: FAST FOOD WARS: Burger King goes all in with 'Cheetos Chicken Fries' Loading video...

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson Sep 14th 2016 9:33AM Target is losing customers to Walmart and Amazon, according to new research. The retailer recently revealed that shopper traffic is declining for the first time in years. The decline immediately followed the start of a boycott against Target for its policy welcoming transgender customers to use any bathroom or fitting room that matches their gender identity. But Cowen & Co. analysts say the real reason shoppers are abandoning Target is because they can find better prices and more convenience elsewhere. STOCK PRICE FOR TGTFull price information According to the analysts, Target is losing the business of shoppers who visited the retailer for "fill-in" trips — or quick stops to get a small amount of items between larger "stock-up" trips. Shoppers are cutting down on these "fill-in" trips to Target because they are finding cheaper prices at Walmart and more convenience with Amazon Prime, according to data compiled by Cowen & Co. "Amazon is seeing explosive growth in several categories most notably grocery and consumables, which accounts for 45-50% of Target's business and are likely the categories feeling pressure from the 'fill-in' trip dynamics," the analysts wrote in a research note published Monday. "In our view, Walmart can use its scale to compete on price to regain or maintain market share vs. Amazon... but Target cannot compete as easily." Associated PressTarget's same-store transactions, which is how traffic is measured, fell 2.2% in the second quarter. Overall, sales fell 7.2% to $16.2 billion. "In the second quarter, our No. 1 challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories," Target CEO Brian Cornell said last week on a call with analysts. Target is planning to overhaul its grocery department to better compete with its rivals, but analysts say the changes will take too long to accomplish.

Walmart, Kroger, Harris Teeter, Giant Food, and other chains have started offering online grocery pickup, meaning customers can order their groceries online and pick them up at a nearby store.

The American shopping giant has imagined a complete ecosystem, from store to end-user, which would allow a container of purchase to travel from a designated space to a customer, follow the shopper, and drive back to its place after it becomes empty again. In other words, WalMart has thought of a way to make shopping carts autonomous. These vehicles would operate using a multitude of sensors, but their primary advantage would be the knowledge of the “map.” Since none of the vehicles would leave WalMart’s parking lot, the company would not have to go to great lengths to make them independent or outstandingly smart. Think about it - the fleet of autonomous shopping carts could be controlled seamlessly from a central node in each store, while each of the carts would drive itself after its human user. Since people do not tend to be fast while walking through stores, the speed of operation would be humble, and they might make the cart even slower than average walking pace just to keep it safe. The patent application already mentions the fact that the customer selects the cart with a “user interface device,” which could mean a smartphone with an app. The phone would only be used to identify and “tag” the client, so that the cart would know whom to follow. Evidently, merely patenting an autonomous shopping cart will not make it a reality. Wal-Mart would probably not replace all of its carts with the self-driving units because of the costs that would be involved in the move. However, in the name of convenience, a few might be placed at every store once they will be available. Expect them to be offered to customers that have locomotion deficiencies. In other words, if you can walk without assistance, you can probably push you shopping cart just fine. Otherwise, shopping might be a hassle and bring numerous impediments.  Download attachment: Walmart patent application (PDF) Walmart self-driving cars self-driving vehicles autonomous car technology shopping technology autonomous   Why Apple and McLaren Should Probably Not Hook Up Engine Mounts - What They Do And Why You Should Replace Them Five Crazy Alternatives For The Design Of The U.S. Presidential Limo For 2017 Naturally Aspirated Engines are Dead Six Tips To Check On Your List Before Considering An Engine Swap Triple Turbo And Quad Turbo Engines - The Only Cars That Feature Them A Story about Expensive Car Warranties and Respect Infiniti's Variable Compression Engine - Why It's Important And How It Works The Biggest Anticipations in Motorcycling for 2016, Part 1 On Electric Harleys and New Generations Safety on American Roads - The Safest States In The USA And The Most Dangerous The Five Smallest Displacement Engines Found In Production Cars of 2016 What if Jaguar and Land Rover Weren't British Anymore?

News Room SOURCE: High Performance Beverage Co. September 14, 2016 07:30 ET High Performance Beverage Co. Confirms Meeting With Walmart for Distribution in Mexico, Talks to Include Potential Sales in Sam's Clubs in U.S. CAVE CREEK, AZ--(Marketwired - Sep 14, 2016) - High Performance Beverage Co. (OTC PINK: TBEV) (the "Company") is pleased to announce confirmation of their meeting with Walmart for distribution of its High Performance Sports Drink in Mexico. Walmart de Mexico (WALMEX) represents Walmart's largest division outside of the U.S. consisting of 2,363 stores around the country, including 256 Walmart Supercenter stores and 160 Sam's Club stores. The meeting is currently set for October 05, 2016 at Walmart's corporate headquarters in Bentonville, AK and will include executive buyers from WALMEX and U.S. representatives. Any distribution into Mexico will be handled by Pro Prom, High Performance Beverages Licensee for Mexico, Central & South America. The Company also expects to start preliminary discussions on North American distribution in Sam's Clubs which has been initiated by Joey Girardin of Girardin International Marketing and Consulting Group.  Toby McBride, High Performance Beverage CEO, stated, "We are extremely grateful for the work that has been done by both Pro Prom and Girardin International Marketing and Consulting Group for the meetings set up with Walmart executives. While optimistic, we realize that with fast potential growth come many challenges that will need to be addressed. With that in mind, I would like to briefly address the Company's recent decision to increase its authorized shares. While we understand our shareholders concern, the increase is not necessarily reflective of the Company's intent to dramatically increase its outstanding shares. Rather, we felt it necessary to be proactive and prepared in the event of our decision to utilize our previously announced $5 million credit facility. Should that become necessary, it would be related to significant progress with our operations, inventory controls, distribution and sales. We would view that as a significant positive for our company. Our only other alternative would have been to do a reverse split in order to create reserve shares and that was not an option. We are hopeful that eventual royalties from sales through Pro Prom will allow us to eliminate our remaining notes, fuel growth and procure more conventional forms of financing. Taking this proactive approach is our best option to ensure our abilities to meet potential supply and demand needs. Additionally, unlike a stock split that is irreversible, we can always modify and reduce our authorized shares at a later date."  To purchase High Performance Sports Drink on Amazon Go to: https://www.amazon.com/Performance-Punch-16-Ounce-Pack/dp/B014Q64HEI About Pro Prom ProProm Mexico with offices in Mexico City DF, Monterrey Mexico and Guadalajara Mexico, is a 20 year old company specializing in the deployment and marketing of new products through the aggressive market penetration of new brands through their abilities to elevate brands with dedication, intensity, professionalism and the overall synergy they create when bringing a product to market. Most notably, ProProm was instrumental with the introduction and success of the Gatorade brand in Mexico.

Toby McBride, High Performance Beverage CEO, stated, "We are extremely grateful for the work that has been done by both Pro Prom and Girardin International Marketing and Consulting Group for the meetings set up with Walmart executives. While optimistic, we realize that with fast potential growth come many challenges that will need to be addressed. With that in mind, I would like to briefly address the Company's recent decision to increase its authorized shares. While we understand our shareholders concern, the increase is not necessarily reflective of the Company's intent to dramatically increase its outstanding shares. Rather, we felt it necessary to be proactive and prepared in the event of our decision to utilize our previously announced $5 million credit facility. Should that become necessary, it would be related to significant progress with our operations, inventory controls, distribution and sales. We would view that as a significant positive for our company. Our only other alternative would have been to do a reverse split in order to create reserve shares and that was not an option. We are hopeful that eventual royalties from sales through Pro Prom will allow us to eliminate our remaining notes, fuel growth and procure more conventional forms of financing. Taking this proactive approach is our best option to ensure our abilities to meet potential supply and demand needs. Additionally, unlike a stock split that is irreversible, we can always modify and reduce our authorized shares at a later date."

Suburbs Daily Southtown Southtown News Wal-Mart Supercenter opens in Olympia Fields; nearby grocer wary Walmart opens a Supercenter in Olympia Fields Will Konrath, the store manager of the new Walmart Supercenter in Olympia Fields, explains what the new store has to offer. Will Konrath, the store manager of the new Walmart Supercenter in Olympia Fields, explains what the new store has to offer. Erin GallagherDaily Southtown Privacy Policy Wal-Mart is opening a new 183,000-square-foot Supercenter in Olympia Fields Wednesday. A couple miles away, the owner of a small grocery store said bigger does not necessarily mean better, but he remains optimistic. The opening of a large store "will always impact some, but I don't think it will impact much," said Jeff Jabar, owner of Country Squire Foods, 113 W. Joe Orr Road, Chicago Heights. "(Customers) always turn around and come back to you." The Wal-Mart Supercenter at 21000 Western Ave. will employ 330 people and sell both food and general merchandise. Store manager Will Konrath said that the expansive variety of products will appeal to everyone. "Our target audience is going to be every type of customer," he said. The new Wal-Mart features organic and gluten-free products, he said. Along the wall of the bakery department, there are more than 20 racks filled with different varieties of fresh-baked breads and doughnuts. There are also more than 100 different rice products for sale. The Supercenter is not much different from the Richton Park Wal-Mart, 22401 Central Ave., which opened earlier this summer, Konrath said. There are some cosmetic differences, such as sign placement inside the store and lower tables for bakery goods. However, both offer similar services, such as the drive-thru pharmacy and custom cake decorating, he said. Walmart is opening a new 183,000-square-foot Supercenter in Olympia Fields Wednesday. A couple miles away, the owner of a small grocery store said bigger does not necessarily mean better, but he remains optimistic. Jabar said his 15,000-square- foot store offers convenience for people who do not want to take on the challenge of a large store. Country Squire customers Robert Plochl and Jackie McGarel of Chicago Heights agreed. "The (Wal-Mart) store is too big," said Plochl, 84. "You get lost in there." "I like the little personal stores, where the boss talks to me," McGarel said. Both Wal-Mart and Country Squire feature a wide variety of specialty items. Wal-Mart has an aisle of ethnic foods, which includes Asian fare. Jabar said Country Squire stocks foods reflecting the area's diverse community, such as numerous products from Italy and Mexico. For example, a typical store may stock 10 to 20 varieties of vinegars, but Country Squire stocks over 50. While other stores may carry two or three different Italian specialty salami, Country Squire stocks eight. John Zartuche of Chicago Heights, said he shops at Country Squire Foods for many reasons, not just the Italian foods indicative of his Sicilian heritage. In addition to wanting to support his local community, he said it's not worth "spending $10 dollars in gas to save a nickel." "I think his prices are fair," Zartuche said. Still, Wal-Mart offers numerous products and services that Country Squire does not, such as a pharmacy, a vision center, general merchandise and its own mobile app. In June, Wal-Mart launched Walmart Pay in Illinois, allowing customers to use a cellphone app for payment. "More than 20 million customers actively use the Wal-Mart app each month, and it ranks among the top three retail apps in the Google and Apple app stores," according to a Wal-Mart statement.

Your Right to Know Public records complaint program open for business View Slideshow Request to buy this photo By Kaitlin Fochesato The Columbus Dispatch  •  Friday September 16, 2016 6:51 AM Mabel Becker says she once helped Hillary Clinton get a job. Back in 1986, the Columbus-area resident owned stock in the retail giant Walmart. Becker wrote to the founder and then CEO of the company, Sam Walton, demanding a woman be appointed to the company's board of directors. "And he responded and said he would by the end of the year," Becker said, and Walton kept his promise. Hillary Clinton, whose husband Bill was governor of Arkansas at the time, was appointed to the board that year. Now, Becker is hoping she can help Hillary attain another position: President of the United States. "I want everything she stands for," Becker said as she waited to watch the candidate's daughter Chelsea Clinton speak in Westerville on Thursday afternoon. "I want to see a woman in the White House." Becker was one of about 100 guests who attended brief remarks made by Chelsea in the Ohio Together office on Westerview Drive that opened last week. The venue was a rented office space with a small stage, in between a hot yoga studio and a printing press. Never mentioning Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump by name, only as the "opponent," Chelsea spoke for about five minutes thanking the campaign volunteers. "Everything we all care about is at stake this election," Chelsea said, mentioning the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to deny Ohio's Golden Week, a period of time in which Ohioans can register to vote and vote early. She reminded the crowd that her mother is not "new to these fights," adding that before she was born her mother was already fighting for children and their families. The Trump campaign was ready to fire back. Cameron Hunt, a member of the Ohio State University Students for Trump, said he encourages his classmates to vote for Republican candidate Donald Trump because, Hunt believes, Trump will bring real jobs back from overseas for the regular American student. "As a millennial voter, I don’t believe Chelsea Clinton understands what it’s like for average Ohioans struggling under the failed Obama-Clinton economic policies that her mother wants to continue," Hunt said in a statement. She will return to Ohio next week for an event in the Toledo area. kfochesato@dispatch.com @KaitFochesato Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

Kline Coming off a quarter when it reported that fewer shoppers visited its stores, Target CEO Brian Cornell has a plan to turn around his company. Quotes in the article Target Corp TGT ▼ 75.97 -0.16 -0.21% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.85 -0.34 -0.49% The chief executive shared some of his ideas on Sept. 14 at Target's annual meeting. Cornell has his work cut out for him because not only did the chain report that foot traffic in stores was down 2.2% in its latest quarter, but comparable sales dropped by 1.1% as well. When the company announced its Q2 2016 earnings, Cornell offered a message about his plans for the future. "Looking ahead, we remain focused on our enterprise priorities as we continue to see the benefits of investing in Signature Categories, store experience, new flex-format stores and digital capabilities," he said. "Although we are planning for a challenging environment in the back half of the year, we believe we have the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time."

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

Small stores are key Early in 2016, Target rival Wal-Mart closed all of its small-format stores. In theory, those locations were supposed to let the retailer operate in places where a full-size store would not make sense. That could have been for a variety of reasons ranging from cost of real estate in a city setting or population in a more rural area. Despite Wal-Mart abandoning the format, Target plans to continue growing its small-store portfolio, Cornell said during the annual meeting, Bloomberg reported. Target already has 23 small-format stores operating in larger cities and plans nine more this year and at least 16 in 2017. Coming in at less than 50,000 square feet, these smaller locations allow the chain to operate in downtown locations where a full-size store would be cost-prohibitive. Cornell noted during the meeting that eventually the company could have hundreds of these smaller locations that can also serve as locations for in-store pickup of online orders, according to Bloomberg. Groceries are part of the answer Cornell, who has a background in groceries, believes that his chain is actually on the right track when it comes to its offering. Instead of being a full-service, everything-to-everyone grocer, Target wants to focus on organic, natural, and gluten-free foods while also offering attention-getting items like craft beer. The CEO believes that he has made the right moves, but that the public has not noticed yet. "It's just going to take time for us to get credit for those changes," he said during the national meeting, Fortune reported. To help raise awareness, Target has begun putting more focus on groceries in its weekly circulars and has begun tweaking store displays. Target has a ways to go Part of Target's Q2 problem came from the customer boycott over its decision to allow people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with rather than their birth gender. The company has partially addressed that by committing to add single-person bathrooms to all its stores, but it's possible that a small percentage of its audience may not come back due to its stance. Aside from that, though, Target's big problem is Wal-Mart and, to a lesser extent, Amazon.com. Cornell is playing smart when it comes to his big physical-store rival. By adding small stores and differentiating its grocery offering, Target is setting itself up as a clear alternative. Going higher end with groceries and opening up hip stores in downtown locales also reinforces the "Tar-Jay" higher-end image, which can separate the company from its more mass-market rival. None of these moves will pay off quickly, but Cornell has a plan and in the long run it should help him build back sales and maybe earn new customers.

The Thursday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories National by The Canadian Press Posted Sep 15, 2016 3:24 pm MST Last Updated Sep 15, 2016 at 4:40 pm MST Denise Stark, mother of Cpl. Justin Stark, is seen at the cemetery where her son is buried in Hamilton, Ont., on Thursday, March 6, 2014. The mother of a Canadian soldier who killed himself after serving in Afghanistan will finally be honoured with a Memorial Cross this weekend, ending a long battle to have the military recognize his death as service related. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Colin Perkel Highlights from the news file for Thursday, Sept. 15 ____ CANADIAN HELD IN CHINA RELEASED: A Canadian man jailed in China on espionage charges has been released, a federal official said Thursday. Kevin Garratt lived in China for about 30 years, conducted Christian aid work and ran a popular coffee shop near China’s border with North Korea. He and his wife Julia were arrested just over two years ago, although she was released on bail about six months later. In January, he was indicted on accusations of spying for Canada and stealing Chinese state secrets. During his recent visit to China, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated that he had raised the case during his talks with Chinese leaders. ____ MAN FOUND GUILTY OF KILLING ALBERTA COUPLE: The son of an Alberta couple who disappeared six years ago says the second-degree murder conviction handed down in their deaths is a relief. Bret McCann says the family will probably never know exactly what happened the day his parents Lyle and Marie vanished, but said he hopes that some day their bodies will be found. Justice Denny Thomas said Thursday there was no reasonable doubt that Travis Vader killed the McCanns during a robbery. Vader’s DNA and a fingerprint were found in the McCanns’ SUV. The conviction carries an automatic life sentence, but a hearing still needs to be held to determine Vader’s parole eligibility. ____ GRAHAM JAMES GRANTED FULL PAROLE: Ex NHL star and sex abuse survivor Theoren Fleury says if victims of pedophiles are looking for closure from the justice system, in many cases it will never happen. He weighed in after convicted sex offender Graham James was granted full parole Thursday in Laval, Quebec. For his part James apologized for his deeds and has called them “horrific.” The now 64-year-old James is serving a federal sentence for sexually assaulting hockey players he coached in the late 1980s and early ’90s with the Swift Current Broncos of the Western Hockey League. ____ HOUSEHOLD DEBT HITS NEW RECORD: The amount Canadians owe compared with how much they earn hit a new record in the second quarter. TD Bank economist Leslie Preston says low interest rates have made borrowing more attractive, especially for homebuyers, and she predicts the debt ratio could continue to trend a little higher in the next few quarters. The Bank of Canada has identified household debt as a key risk to the economy. ____ MP MUSES ABOUT MAKING OTTAWA OFFICIALLY BILINGUAL: A Liberal MP is trying to start a debate on the merits of making Ottawa an officially bilingual city. Denis Paradis says he would like the House of Commons committee he chairs to explore the idea. The idea has come up before, sparking debate between those who want stronger protections for the rights of the minority French-speaking community in Ottawa and those who fear it would cost too much and further restrict access to jobs. ____ WALMART STEPS UP PRESSURE AGAINST VISA: Walmart Canada says it will no longer accept Visa at any of its Manitoba stores starting next month. It’s part of Walmart’s battle with the credit card giant over the fees retailers must pay, which it says are too high. Walmart said in June that it would stop accepting Visa at its more than 400 Canadian stores, arguing that it unfairly pays more than $100 million annually in credit card fees. It started phasing out Visa at its store earlier this summer. ____ NDP WRAPS UP CAUCUS: NDP leader Tom Mulcair has wrapped up a party caucus meeting with a dim view of the Trudeau government. He accuses the Liberals of lacking substance and says the New Democrats will hold them to account. With a new session of Parliament set to open on Monday, the NDP has several challenges to overcome, including declines in poll numbers and membership. Many party members are hoping an upcoming leadership race will boost the party’s popularity. ____ GOVERNMENT IMPROVES LABELLING ON SOME PHARMACEUTICALS: Health Canada has released updated labelling standards for over-the-counter products containing acetaminophen. The idea is to try to reduce the risk of liver damage. The department says the changes will include clearer instructions on packages that encourage using the lowest possible dose, not exceeding the recommended daily amount of 4,000 mg for adults and not using products for more than five days for pain or three days for a fever. Acetaminophen is commonly used in a wide range of non-prescription and prescription drugs, including opioid painkillers. ____ TRUMP SAYS NO PRESCRIPTION SHOULD BE NEEDED FOR BIRTH CONTROL: Donald Trump says he thinks women should be able to obtain birth control without a prescription. He told “The Dr. Oz Show” that for many women, getting a prescription can be challenging. But an official with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund is warning that making birth control prescription-free could make it too expensive for millions of women. That’s because insurance doesn’t cover over-the-counter drugs. __ UN SECRETARY GENERAL SAYS LIFE-SAVING DRUGS NEED TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE: UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s office says it hopes a new report he commissioned will help make life-saving drugs more affordable for vulnerable people. Spokesman Matthias Gillmann says Ban doesn’t necessarily endorse this week’s report of a high-level UN panel that calls for changes to international intellectual property rules that keep lower-priced generic drugs off the market longer. But he hopes it stimulates discussion at this weekend’s Global Fund conference in Montreal, which the secretary general will attend along with philanthropist Bill Gates and the Irish rock star and activist Bono. The two day event will try to raise US$13 billion to replenish the Global Fund’s fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria for the next three years. ____ ____ Next Story Movie Trailers November 18, 2016 to November 24, 2016 Landmark 6, 10015 Manning Ave. PH:791-6610 Landmark Cinemas Landmark Cinemas Fort McMurray Inferno (14A) 3:00pm / 6:15pm / 9:45pm Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (14A) 3:20pm / 6:45pm / 9:55pm Ouija: Origin of Evil (14A) 3:40pm / 7:10pm / 10:15pm Keeping Up with the Joneses (PG) 3:10pm / 6:30pm / 9:30pm The Accountant (14A) 6:00pm / 9:20pm The Girl on the Train (14A) 10:05pm Deepwater Horizon (PG) 7:00pm   660 NEWS CALGARY NATIONAL The effects of India’s currency reform? “Chaos” say analysts Today at 3:59 AM TV academy gets first black CEO in its 70-year history Today at 3:24 AM Despite protests, Marcos is buried at heroes’ cemetery Today at 3:10 AM Hundreds of O’Hare airport workers vote to strike Today at 2:45 AM Researchers at Calgary university explore antibiotic resistance link Today at 2:09 AM Selfie tower: Trump’s home becomes NYC’s hottest backdrop Today at 1:45 AM Defence experts, politicians gather for international security forum Nov 18, 2016, 4:37 AM Hearing to be held on fate of woman facing deportation to Britain Nov 18, 2016, 4:12 AM Health experts, politicians look to address national opioid epidemic at summit Nov 18, 2016, 2:30 AM Quebec prosecutors to speak about sex abuse allegations involving police officers Nov 18, 2016, 2:25 AM Five stories in the news Friday, Nov. 18 Nov 18, 2016, 2:00 AM Canada still committed to NATO, Sajjan says, after Trump's campaign threats Nov 11, 2016, 3:45 PM BUSINESS SPORTSNET OIL & GAS ENTERTAINMENT US stocks hardly move as energy rises, health care falls Nov 18, 2016, 8:00 AM Markets Right Now: Stocks slip in early trading Nov 18, 2016, 7:42 AM Calgary dentists, therapists and optometrists hit by energy price slowdown Nov 18, 2016, 2:00 AM Volkswagen to shed 30,000 jobs to cut costs after scandal Nov 18, 2016, 1:58 AM The effects of India's currency reform?

The entrepreneurial chef behind the new food endeavor is one Isaac Rousso, who has been a regular finalist and winner at the Texas State Fair over the years for his kitchen creations like Cookie Fries, Smoky Bacon Margaritas, Deep Fried Cuban Rolls, and Fried Pop Tarts, as the Dallas Morning News reports. Depending on the new restaurant’s success in Plano, Walmart will consider opening up outlets of State Fair Treats in other locations across the country, meaning that dangerously caloric dishes like funnel cake fries and deep-fried hash browns stuffed with bacon and cheese might make it to a retail stop near you. In the face of the national trend for healthy foods, this might seem like an unexpected development — but Walmart has been bullish on retro snacks, recently adding deep-fried Hostess Twinkies to their freezer section. State Fair Treats sounds like a natural addition to this nostalgic menu.

The two day event will try to raise US$13 billion to replenish the Global Fund’s fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria for the next three years. ____ ____ Listen Now 680 NEWS live --:-- Next Story "> Posted LOCAL NATIONAL Man stabbed in the head in violent night in the GTA Nov 18, 2016, 6:08 AM Man suffers life-threatening injuries in Jane-Falstaff shooting Nov 17, 2016, 9:45 PM Shooting in Weston leaves one man in serious condition Nov 17, 2016, 8:38 PM Man suffers life-threatening injuries in Brampton shooting Nov 17, 2016, 6:13 PM Police officer found guilty of sex assault in Richmond Hill Nov 17, 2016, 5:03 PM Man hit by truck on Highway 401 Nov 17, 2016, 4:05 PM Hearing to be held on fate of woman facing deportation to Britain Nov 18, 2016, 6:12 AM Health experts, politicians look to address national opioid epidemic at summit Nov 18, 2016, 4:30 AM Wildfire's return stalls recovery plans for Fort McMurray oilsands industry May 17, 2016, 8:06 AM 3 workers rescued after being trapped in collapse in Ottawa tunnel; one injured Nov 10, 2016, 4:54 PM 'It's a betrayal:' former Calgary police officer charged with kidnapping Nov 15, 2016, 5:48 PM Quebec prosecutors to speak about sex abuse allegations involving police officers Nov 18, 2016, 4:25 AM LIFE SPORTSNET ENTERTAINMENT Christmastime is here: Santa comes to town, tree lighting events this weekend Nov 17, 2016, 8:42 AM Twitter adds new options to curb abuse, harassment Nov 16, 2016, 5:37 AM Review: How Google Daydream View compares to other VR options Nov 15, 2016, 4:42 PM Tinder update allows gender options beyond woman and man Nov 15, 2016, 1:43 PM Royal Bank of Canada increases fixed mortgage rates Nov 15, 2016, 9:53 AM Report suggests more Canadians are using food banks Nov 15, 2016, 5:35 AM Young Maple Leafs have an opportunity to do something special Today at 2:03 AM Encarnacion’s agent: ‘Door still open’ for return to Blue Jays Nov 17, 2016, 8:49 PM Five things we learned: The Ben Bishop show Today at 2:49 AM Marner, Brown lead Leafs over Panthers; spoil Reimer’s return Nov 17, 2016, 11:18 PM Mike Trout, Kris Bryant take home MLB MVP honours Nov 17, 2016, 7:22 PM Leonard Cohen died in his sleep after a fall, manager says Nov 17, 2016, 6:06 AM Rocker Leon Russell dies in Nashville Nov 13, 2016, 11:04 AM Dave Chappelle, 'SNL' give thoughtful coda to election Nov 13, 2016, 4:09 AM Memorial service held for Leonard Cohen on Thursday in Quebec Nov 10, 2016, 8:53 PM Ahead of the weekend, Toronto comes together on Remembrance Day Nov 10, 2016, 7:38 AM Home About Us Contact Us Download App Advertise with us Privacy Policy Ad Choices Terms of Service 333 Bloor Street East, Toronto, Ontario M4W 1G9 © 2002-2016 Rogers Media.

(NYSE: WMT) might still have a brick-and-mortar-based business strategy, but there is evidence that the company is diving into digital innovation. Earlier this month, the US Patent and Trademark Office published a patent application filed by Wal-Mart for a technological device that appears to have the capability to propel autonomous shopping carts. The circular, sensory-ridden device, would allow carts to move around a Wal-Mart store without the help of customers. Linked to an app and centralized computer system, carts would navigate the store for the customers allowing them to easily find their items. The growing online shopping industry is considered a competitor to Wal-Mart. If launched, this cart could serve as a marketing tool for the Arkansas-based corporation.

The company, which operates stores in Eastern Iowa, said on Thursday it would hire full-time and part-time employees, including for permanent sales floor positions such as store managers, lead sales associates and store associates. “Dollar General remains focused on our strategy to invest in our employees as a competitive advantage,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in a statement. “We look forward to providing new employees opportunities to gain new skills, develop their talents and grow their careers through our mission of Serving Others.” The news comes two weeks after bigger rival Wal-Mart Stores said it would cut 7,000 back-office jobs to focus more of its resources on the sales floor. Dollar stores operators such as Dollar General and bigger rival Dollar Tree are locked in an intense battle against each other as well as big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart to win over shoppers. Dollar stores have eaten into the market shares of their big-box rivals in recent years, helped by aggressive expansion, improving product assortment and low prices. Goodlettsville, Tenn.-based Dollar General operates more than 13,000 stores in the United States and has laid out plans to open 900 stores this year and about 1,000 more in 2017. In 2015 Dollar General opened 730 new stores, remodeled or relocated 881 stores and closed 36. The retailer had about 113,400 full-time and part-time employees as of Feb. 26. It has hired 42,000 employees since 2008, or an average of about 5,200 each year. Dollar General’s annual sales grew from $18.9 billion in 2014 to $20.4 billion in 2015. Its expansion plans come a year after the company failed in its attempt to acquire rival Family Dollar for $9.1 billion. Your next Business articles Water quality advocates say voluntary ac ...

(KCRA) — Cell phone video shows a frightening fight over a handicapped parking space in a Fairfield, California Walmart parking lot. Susan Fowler started recording after a 64-year-old man with disabilities was pulled from his car, put in a chokehold and punched. “It was horrible to watch, you know,” Fowler said. “Justice needs to be served.” Her video shows the man on the ground and the attacker yelling at a few Fairfield Walmart shoppers who tried to intervene. Chris Bennett is one of them. “By that time, he had already unfortunately got the guy out on the ground — slammed him on the ground,” Bennett recalled. “I was able to get in between them, push him off of him. He went to kick him, I pushed him back.” Read more: http://bit.ly/2cLKW64 Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Google Tumblr More Send to Kindle LinkedIn Pocket Like this: Like Loading...

Supreme Court will not hear appeal in Wal-Mart construction September 15, 2016 4:54 PM Jae C. Hong/Associated Press A citizens' group sued McCandless and Wal-Mart in 2014 after council approved the construction plan for a retail store. After the group lost its case in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court, it appealed to the state Commonwealth Court. When it lost that case, it appealed to the state Supreme Court, which has refused to hear the appeal. By Paula Reed Ward / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette The state Supreme Court today denied a request to hear the appeal of a citizens group protesting the construction of a Wal-Mart superstore in McCandless. The decision to deny the appeal from a Commonwealth Court ruling includes no explanation. Citizens of McCandless sued the township and Wal-Mart in 2014 after McCandless council approved the construction plan. The group raised concerns about parking — the store would have 624 spaces even though town zoning requires 1,000 — and the fact that it would located in the Pine Creek watershed. The citizens group lost its case in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court in January 2015 and appealed to Commonwealth Court. A three-judge panel of the Commonwealth Court issued an opinion in February finding that McCandless council did not err in approving the construction plan. A month later, the court refused a request for reargument before a panel of nine judges.

The suspect, Thomas Smith, 53, is on parole for a 2002 robbery of a KeyBank branch in Latham. He was paroled after serving more than 13 years of a 15-year sentence. Detective Robert Lawyer fired a round into the window of Smith's vehicle on Wednesday in a neighborhood near the Port of Albany. Police Chief Brendan Cox said the detective reported the suspect's car was backing toward him when he opened fire. No one was injured. Police leaders declined to release many details about what unfolded Wednesday in the city's South End or to confirm the name of the detective and the suspect. Smith is being held in police custody on a parole violation. He has not been charged with the bank robberies, law enforcement officials said. The shooting rattled the neighborhood along Green Street, and the incident took place a short distance from an elementary school and a large apartment building. In November, after the Times Union published a story about Smith's termination from the Walmart, there was a national backlash against the retailer. Smith told the newspaper he liked his job gathering shopping carts from the vast parking lot of the Walmart Supercenter in East Greenbush, where customers often left trash and empty drink containers. Smith picked up the garbage for more than two months until Nov. 6, when he was fired for redeeming the empty cans and bottles he found discarded on two occasions. He was called into the security office and questioned by a manager and two security staff members. "I didn't know you couldn't take empties left behind. They were garbage," Smith said. "I didn't even get a chance to explain myself. They told me to turn in my badge." Smith's criminal history also includes a 1989 conviction for drug possession. He served nine years in prison. Lawyer, who served in the Army for seven years, was credited by the department last year with helping save a shooting victim's life in West Hill. He and Officer Amy Forgea, who had experience as an emergency medical technician, applied a tourniquet to the leg of a 20-year-old man who was shot in the leg last year and fell unconscious with no pulse. The officers administered CPR to the man, who regained consciousness and survived. In January, city officials approved a $70,000 payment to settle a federal lawsuit filed by a man who accused Lawyer of excessive force, false arrest, malicious prosecution and racial discrimination related to a 2011 arrest. The city did not dispute that the officer hit the man, Myles Hernandez, three times with a closed fist as Lawyer and another officer investigated what they said was a loud college party on Partridge Street. Hernandez claimed the punches were unprovoked, while the city contended Lawyer — who was alone after his partner had gone upstairs to investigate further — felt threatened and was using approved tactics to create distance between Hernandez and himself. blyons@timesunion.com • 518-454-5547 • @brendan_lyonstu   Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Dick's Sporting Goods Black Friday Now Sale: Up to 65% off +...

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:30 PM, September 15, 2016 U.S. discount retailer Dollar General Corp said it plans to hire 10,000 employees by mid-October, boosting its headcount by nearly 9 pct to support its expansion efforts as it looks to protect its turf amid fierce competition. The company said on Thursday it would hire full-time and part-time employees, including for permanent sales floor positions such as store managers, lead sales associates and store associates. The news comes two weeks after bigger rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it would cut 7,000 back-office jobs to focus more of its resources on the sales floor. Dollar stores operators such as Dollar General and bigger rival Dollar Tree Inc are locked in an intense battle against each other as well as big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart to win over shoppers. Dollar stores have eaten into the market shares of their big-box rivals in recent years, helped by aggressive expansion, improving product assortment and low prices. Dollar General operates more than 13,000 stores in the United States and has laid out plans to open 900 stores this year and about 1,000 more in 2017. The retailer had about 113,400 full-time and part-time employees as of Feb. 26. It has hired 42,000 employees since 2008, or an average of about 5,200 each year.

Walmart Helps Sustain Food Pantries, Job Programs In Rural Communities Bruce Barlow, Market Manager for Northern Nevada Walmart stores, is shown here presenting Silver Stage Food Pantry director Kathy McIntosh with a donation that will benefit food pantries and employment programs in Dayton, Virginia City and Silver Springs. Quest Lakes photo By Quest Lakes Virginia City News There was a lot of laughter and many hugs at a luncheon in Silver Springs as Bruce Barlow of Walmart presented a check for $70,000 to benefit the Dayton and Silver Stage Food Pantries. Each summer, pantry volunteers, staff and participants host a lunchtime tour with key Walmart representatives to show their appreciation. Walmart�s donations over the last 5 years have helped sustain Healthy Communities Coalition�s food pantries and its unique food, health and community development �hubs� - interconnected regional efforts designed to support residents in revitalizing their own communities. Donation Supports Food Pantries and Employment Program: This year as in past years, Walmart donated a total of $70,000 to the �volunteer powered� food pantries in Dayton and Silver Springs, and to Community Chest in Virginia City. Each year, Community Chest�s Erik Schoen has written a proposal for the donation, and Walmart has responded with an annual donation of $35,000 to sustain Healthy Communities Coalition of Lyon and Storey�s pantries in Silver Springs and Dayton, plus $35,000 to support Community Chest�s employment program, which places employment experts at both of the food pantries and at Community Chest in Virginia City. The employment specialists help Pantry visitors locate job openings, develop resumes, and connect with job training opportunities, in addition to assisting with Medicaid, Disability and SNAP (food stamps) questions. Schoen welcomed the team from Walmart to the tour and luncheon, noting that �this is the 5th year in a row that Walmart has helped fund some of the wonderful work being done at Healthy Communities Coalition�s food pantries in Silver Springs and Dayton. I think Walmart�s sustained commitment is evidence of two things -- one, their commitment to the well being and livelihood of the program participants; and two, their understanding of the need to provide support over not just the short term but the long term.� Schoen went on to say, �On the face of it, Walmart�s donation helps bring food to people, but it is really so much more. The food is also an invitation to be in connection with a great community of others who care about where they live, an opportunity to be of service to each other.� Silver Stage Food Pantry Director Kathy McIntosh, along with Jackrabbit Junction Director Troyanne Cada and many enthusiastic volunteers, were obviously delighted with the chance to show the Walmart team the busy food pantry, the adjacent thriving community garden and hoop house, and the indoor farmers market called Jackrabbit Junction. Bruce Barlow, Market Manager for Northern Nevada Walmart stores, commented that the welcoming, family atmosphere that the volunteers and staff have created at the Silver Stage Pantry is deeply touching. Silver Stage manager Kathy McIntosh said that the food pantries set a high bar for treating each visitor with dignity and compassion, explaining that �the volunteers do so much. It�s not just about standing at a table handing out food. It�s about so much more. The volunteers are the most wonderful, caring people I�ve ever met.� Other Walmart team members in attendance included Amber Vaught, Fernley Walmart Store Manager; Rebecca Johnson, Fallon Walmart Store Manager; and Jason Schmidt, Market Asset Protection Manager. Christy McGill, director of Healthy Communities, said the pantries do everything possible to leverage and match Walmart�s donation. During the last year, with the Walmart donation, plus USDA Commodities, Food Bank of Northern Nevada, local fundraisers and donations, and more than 25,000 hours of work by hundreds of community volunteers, the pantries in Dayton and Silver Springs have reached 8,685 individuals with more than 578,977 pounds of food. Walmart also helps sustain the food backpack program for children attending schools in Dayton and Silver Springs, a program that supplies 4,068 weekend meals every month. Getting to the Roots of Hunger: McGill explained, �Walmart�s generous funding is crucial in meeting the �short term� needs for food so that we can work with the communities on long-term structural reforms that can stop food insecurity. These include re-empowering local citizens to grow their own food at home and in community gardens, further connecting people to opportunities for job training and continuing education, and continuing to increase access to affordable dental, vision, mental health and medical care so that people can get and stay healthy. It also includes removing barriers standing in the way of entrepreneurial dreams. For instance, Silver Springs residents came to Coalition meetings saying they wanted legislation that would allow them to create micro-businesses to sell their home-produced foods like breads, jams, pickles and salsa at area farmer�s markets, and so the Cottage Food Industries law and the �Pickles and Salsa� bills were introduced. With advocacy by everyday folks and many groups, both bills passed. The result is that hundreds of new micro-businesses have popped up, and many existing businesses throughout Nevada were able to expand.� Regional Food Hub: The food pantries in Silver Springs and Dayton are part of a regional �Healthy Food Hub� with Healthy Communities that addresses the roots of hunger and increases access to nutritious and affordable foods through food pantries, weekend food backpack programs for children, school salad bars with local produce, farmers markets that accept WIC and SNAP as payment, gardening and cooking education, community and school gardens and hoop houses throughout Lyon County, teen garden internships, a nonprofit garden center (Community Roots) that also serves as a vocational rehabilitation site for both adults and youths, etc. These strategies boost the local economy by increasing local farmers� access to new consumers and expanding opportunities for youth and adults to teach and learn new skills that increase food security.  submit your comments  Sitemap { Online Newspaper by bulletlink.com }

Consumers Suing Welspun Over Egyptian Cotton Bedding Made With Inferior Materials Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Consumers Suing Welspun Over Egyptian Cotton Bedding Made With Inferior Materials September 15, 2016 11:01 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk bad bedding egyptian cotton lawsuits welspun Welspun USA class action lawsuits target mislabeled products bedding sheets linen walmart There’s more bad news for textile manufacturer Welpsun: after Target cut ties with the company, and Walmart pulled its sheets from shelves, U.S. consumers have filed two lawsuits claiming the textile manufacturer fraudulently labeled its bedding as premium Egyptian cotton when it was in fact made from lower quality fibers. Both lawsuits point to the fact that Welspun responded to Target’s decision by saying, “[w]ithout any ambiguity, the fault is on our side” as evidence of unlawful conduct. In the first lawsuit, [PDF] was filed on Aug. 29 in New York District Court by a plaintiff who says she purchased Fieldcrest bed linens by Welspun from Target that purported to consist of “100% Egyptian Cotton” and have a 500-thread count. She relied on the fact that they were labeled as such, and believed they were “higher quality, softer, more durable bed linens” as a result, the complaint states, so she was prepared to pay a premium for them. “‘Your comfort is our commitment’ claims Defendant Welspun India in corporate presentations,” the complaint states. “In fact, Defendants’ commitment is to their own profits rather than the consumer.” The lawsuit claims that Welspun committed a “widespread fraud” in which “consumers who have purchased Welspun bed linens have overpaid for an inferior product.” The second lawsuit was filed in Aug. 31 (and amended Sept. 2 [PDF]) in a St. Louis federal court. “By attempting to pass off the Indian cotton as Egyptian cotton, Defendant is able to entice consumers like Plaintiff and the class members to pay a premium for the Products or pay more for them than they otherwise would have had the truth be known,” the suit states. Both lawsuits claim minimum damages of $5 million each, and class-action certification, while also filing suit against subsidiary Welspun USA.

Yet even as Amazon continues to record double-digit product sales gains, investors shouldn't get hung up on the companies' comparative digital growth rates, analyst Charlie O'Shea said. That's because Wal-Mart has one crucial advantage over Amazon: physical stores. By leveraging its massive fleet, sales at Wal-Mart's U.S. locations only need to increase 4 percent to match a comparable period of 20 percent growth from Amazon North America, O'Shea said. In the latest quarter, Wal-Mart's U.S. sales increased 3.1 percent. "Let's keep this in context," O'Shea said. "The brick-and-mortar guys have two businesses." In the end, what matters are the actual dollar gains, O'Shea said. Though Wal-Mart's online sales growth has slowed in recent quarters, increasing roughly 12 percent in the second quarter, that still equates to nearly $2 billion in additional sales, according to Moody's estimates. As traditional retailers search for ways to compete against Amazon, Wal-Mart is one of the companies forging ahead of its bricks-and-mortar rivals, Moody's says. Wal-Mart's $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com should continue to propel its digital revenues. Moody's estimates Wal-Mart's domestic online sales were roughly $15 billion during the 12 months ended June. The firm expects that figure to grow to $35 billion in 2022. While that pales in comparison to the $212 billion expected from Amazon's North American product sales that year, Wal-Mart is expected to maintain its lead in overall revenues. Though the gap between the two companies will narrow, O'Shea predicts Wal-Mart's 2022 domestic sales will still be far ahead of Amazon, at $464.4 billion to $399 billion. "They're (Amazon) competing with people that have not only online businesses that are growing pretty rapidly, but also have these bricks-and-mortar businesses that aren't going to go away," he said. Amazon has responded by testing the waters with physical stores, including more than a dozen pop-up locations from California to New York. In addition to Wal-Mart, Moody's says Best Buy is gaining ground online. The company, once thought to be an inevitable victim of Amazon, grew its U.S. digital sales nearly 24 percent during the second quarter. Overall, Moody's projects online revenues will account for 20 percent of all retail sales in seven years. That compares with approximately 9 percent penetration today.

The retailer informed customers of the change on its Canadian website and in stores Thursday. Wal-Mart’s Canadian unit has threatened to expel Visa from all 406 of its stores nationwide unless the network agrees to lower the amount it charges for credit-card transactions. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, stopped accepting Visa at its three Thunder Bay outlets on July 18. Walmart Canada, which pays more than C$100 million ($76 million) to accept credit cards annually, called the fees Visa charges “unacceptably high” in a June 11 statement on its website. “Walmart’s decision to further limit Visa acceptance in Manitoba is disappointing," Visa spokeswoman Carla Hindman said in an e-mailed statement. “We know from our experience in Thunder Bay that consumers want the option to use the payment method of their choice when shopping -- including at Walmart stores. Visa remains committed to actively working with Walmart so that Canadians can use their Visa cards wherever they wish to shop." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Linda Nguyen, The Canadian Press Published Thursday, September 15, 2016 7:17AM EDT Last Updated Thursday, September 15, 2016 3:14PM EDT TORONTO -- Walmart Canada continued its battle with Visa over merchant fees Thursday, with an announcement that it will no longer accept the popular credit card at any of its Manitoba stores starting next month. The U.S.-based retail giant said the change will come into effect at all 16 locations in the province as of Oct. 24. Customers will still be able to pay for purchases with cash, debit, MasterCard and American Express cards. Walmart pledged in June that it would stop accepting Visa at its more than 400 Canadian stores, arguing that it unfairly pays more than $100 million annually in credit card fees. Three Thunder Bay, Ont., stores were the first locations to drop the credit card on July 18. Walmart spokesman Alex Roberton said it decided to continue the phase-out in Manitoba after seeing the small impact it made in Thunder Bay. "There has been no surprises. Reaction from customers has been better than expected," he said, noting that the Visa ban in Manitoba Walmarts will involve retraining cashiers and reprogramming payment equipment. Roberton said the retailer is singling out Visa because its fees are higher than its rivals, refuting the idea that the decision is due to attempts to promote the usage of Walmart's own branded MasterCard. "The reason why we're doing it is because the fees are too high," he said. "Visa is the company we're dealing with right now." When asked whether Walmart has plans to ban any other credit cards from its stores, he replied that he wasn't going to speculate on what the company will do in the future. Visa, the country's largest credit card firm, declined a request for an interview but said in a statement that Walmart's decision to drop Visa at more store locations was "disappointing." "We know from our experience in Thunder Bay that consumers want the option to use the payment method of their choice when shopping -- including at Walmart stores," said spokeswoman Carla Hindman in an email. Previously, Visa had said it had offered Walmart one of the lowest rates for any merchant in the country but the retailer wanted more. If it had given in, Walmart's merchant fees would have been lower than those charged to local grocery markets, pharmacies, convenience stores, charities and schools. According to consumer finance industry newsletter Nilson Report, Visa accounts for 56 per cent of credit card transactions globally in 2015, with MasterCard behind at 26 per cent. Credit card companies generally charge retailers between one per cent to 2.5 per cent of the cost of purchases in merchant fees. The fees can vary depending on the type of card a customer is using, with cash-back and points cards racking up the largest fees. The Retail Council of Canada, which represents businesses including Walmart, said Visa and MasterCard have lowered their merchant fees to an average of 1.5 per cent. Even so, it said that is not low enough compared to what the companies charge retailers in other countries. "Our opinion is that credit card fees are grossly inflated in Canada when compared to most of the rest of the world," said Retail Council spokesman Karl Littler. "Let's be clear -- 1.5 per cent is nowhere near low enough." Littler noted that credit cards companies charge merchants fees of 0.28 per cent in France, 0.3 per cent in the U.K. and 0.99 per cent in Israel. But in the U.S., he said rates are comparable to Canada. The council said it continues to call on Ottawa to intervene to mandate lower fees for all merchants. "There's an obligation for the government to step in and deal with those fees, whether through regulation or the necessary application of moral suasion," said Littler. "Our point is that they need to come down." The federal government says it is continuing to look into the matter.

The potential possibilities for including a partnership with Bulgaria in the future plans of the company were discussed at the meeting. The delivery of Bulgarian products to Walmart stores would lead to a significant increase in exports to the US, considering the fact that the company has 6,500 stores in the USA, reported the Ministry of Economy. Lukarski presented the advantages which Bulgaria offers in terms of logistical development of the base of the company here as a gateway to the markets of the EU, the Middle East and Africa.

Luckily one 13-year-old managed to see the funny side as she attempted to locate the tampons in her local supermarket - and created a hilarious text exchange in the process. Isabella Miller, from Cabot, Arkansas, popped into her local Walmart while her mother Belinda Hankins waited in the car outside. 'You stay in there until you find them': Belinda Hankins shared the exchange online after her daughter Isabella popped into a local branch of Walmart to find some tampons When she insisted that there were no tampons to be found, her mother replied: 'Yes I promise they are. Look near condoms are sex lube.'  She told her daughter she 'swore on her life' the tampons would be near the diapers, adding: 'There is no way they don't carry those essential items. You stay there until you find them.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next From a banana served inside a bag of spaghetti to a tin of... Would YOU wash your sanitary pad and re-use it? New feminine... Share this article Share She urged her daughter to 'stay in there' until she found the tampons. Isabella eventually found the item in questions, writing: 'OH WAIT. They're here tucked away in a corner unlabelled.' Her mother replied sarcastically: 'No big sign reading "SUPER PERIOD CENTER?"'  Isabella eventually found the item in questions, writing: 'OH WAIT. They're here tucked away in a corner unlabelled.' Her mother replied: 'No big sign reading "SUPER PERIOD CENTER?"' 'They labelled the tiny shelf of joint braces,' Isabella wrote. 'But not the massive aisle of stuff for your vagina?' Belinda deadpanned: 'Because there is NEVER a sign for that section. Vaginas are SECRET.' Her daughter took the joke one step further, writing: 'VAGINAS ARE MYTHS, WHISPERED QUIETLY IN SECRET AMONG ONLY THE BRAVEST OF MEN, COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO EVEN MENTION THE NAME.' She continued: 'BUT SERIOUSLY WHY ARE MEN SO AFRAID OF WOMEN AND VAGINAS?? DO THEY THINK IF THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR EXISTENCE WE WILL SHOOT OUR LASER ESTROGEN BEAMS OUT OF OUR EYES AT THEM AND DISINTEGRATE THEM WITH EASE.' DO NOT ENTER: Isabella drew her mother a humorous 'map' of the supermarket layout on her phone, with 'the vagina zone' cordoned off and 'danger: do not enter' signs. After Belinda encouraged her to continue to 'smash the patriarchy', the teen even drew her out a humorous 'map' of the supermarket layout - with 'the vagina zone' cordoned off and 'danger: do not enter' signs. Since Belinda proudly posted the exchange on Facebook, it has been liked and shared by more than 100,000 people. She said that while she never expected it to go viral, she was pleased that most people appeared to find it as 'funny and innocent and hilarious' as she did. Belinda took to Facebook to share the exchange, calling it the 'highlight' of her parenting week Since Belinda posted the exchange on Facebook, it has been liked and shared by more than 100,000 people - with Beth Albert Couch writing: 'Omg I love her' However, some had been laying into her 'like a pack of wild dogs', openly criticising her parenting abilities. 'I can't even count the parenting mistakes I've been accused of,' she wrote.  'Or the excessive mansplaining about how easy it is to find feminine hygiene products or how you could always just ask someone or just BE PREPARED, etc. etc.  'Oh, men of the Internet, is there anything you don't know better than us, even about menstruation? Clearly not.'

Advertisement On the cover Re “Gone to Mexico” (Cover story, by Catherine Beeghly) and “Flip the border talk” (Letters, by Jo Ann Mondon) Sept. 8: Ms. Mondon asked a question about laws pertaining to Americans, and the editor says “See this week’s cover story.” What? To live and work in Mexico full-time, legally you need an FM3 (long-term visa). Not easy to get. Or leave every six months and re-enter on a tourist visa. May I see your FM3? Puerto Vallarta is probably one of the most Americanized (Canadianized, too) cities in Mexico. Yes, Starbucks, Walmart, Home Depot, Sam’s Club, McDonald’s, etc. They are all there. How much is your rent? Sure, street tacos are cheap, but the chance of typhoid fever and other sicknesses are there. Authentic Mexico? I think not. I have a friend who drove down to southern Mexico a year ago and came back early after being robbed twice on the highways. Over 160,000 Mexicans have been murdered in the last 15 years by their own people! I traveled all through Mexico in the 1990s and lived full-time for three years in 2002-04 in Tepic, Nayarit (capital, about 300,000 people, and very few expats) and Sayulita (a popular tourist town north of PV). My sons’ mother was Mexican (long story). It is a beautiful country, with beautiful people, but it’s another world. Paradise? William Strom Chico Editor’s note: Last week’s reference to the cover story was made with tongue planted firmly in cheek. For the record, Ms. Beeghly returns to the U.S. every six months. Down on the Democrats Re “Review history” (Letters, by Robert Woods, Sept. 1): The lipstick Bob Woods has applied to the Democratic Party and Clinton’s tenure as U.S. secretary of state can’t hide the neoliberalism (unfettered capitalism) they’ve embraced. Transglobal corporatism is their golden calf. Quantifiable profit is all that matters. Forget about old saws like “What does a man profit if he loses his soul.” And now, war-loving former Republican neoconservatives like Paul Wolfowitz are mingling their money sources with Democratic money sources to back Hillary Clinton. There will be no stopping transglobal trade pacts that supersede nations’ laws. Wars won’t stop until the U.S. is the only superpower in the world—as deemed in the neocons’ Project for the New American Century. Also, please Google wikileaks/clintonfoundation to learn of the pay-for-play schemes set up to receive money from hugely wealthy, undemocratic dictators of the world. The Saudis today are slaughtering Yemeni with weapons the State Department didn’t sell them until the Saudis gave a multimillion-dollar donation to the Clinton Foundation. The Democrats’ bowing to neoliberalism and neoconservatism is the exact opposite of honoring international law. I don’t like it. Linda Furr Chico Standing with Trump Re “Stand by your man” (Second & Flume, by Melissa Daugherty, Sept. 8): I take offense to Ms. Daugherty’s assumption that it “takes a special person to agree with [Donald] Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric, his racist and misogynistic screeds …” Really? Are you calling all Trump supporters hateful names? First, Trump has apologized for his inappropriate rhetoric. As Hillary has “apologized” for putting our national security at risk for her inappropriate use of a private email server! A much bigger “mistake,” and she was not indicted because we have a corrupt government, so yes, so far no laws broken. Second, Trump is not a politician, and had a lot to learn in a short time! Trump has been giving speeches and rallies weekly and biweekly about his policies, so if you listened to them, you might know what he envisions for America, but my favorite was the speech/rally in Phoenix where he introduced his “angel moms and dads”—parents who have heart-wrenching stories about how their children were killed by illegals! There are so many! So Trump’s first order of business is to keep Americans safe! Somehow that’s wrong? Ask Ray Tranchant, whose 16-year-old daughter Tessa was killed by illegal [drunken driver] Alfredo Ramos Really, name-calling? Paula Garcia Orland Trump’s policies are on his website. For the economy, Trump wants to “reduce the burdens on the American economy and create fair trade deals.” He wants tax reform, including no taxes on childcare expenses. Trump wants regulatory reform, trade reform, energy reform, to repeal and replace Obamacare (for which we are almost all paying more for our deductibles and insurance)! Trump wants to improve and grow our infrastructure! Most importantly, he wants safety, security and prosperity for Americans! Fences make good neighbors. A nation without borders is not a nation. Trump wants nationwide E-Verify and a mandatory return of all criminal illegals. More about it on his website! He went to Mexico and met with Mexican President Enrique Nieto, wearing a hat, “Make Mexico Great Again.” Trump recently revealed his education reform, which includes education for all children at the local level (state), and ending Common Core, and school choice for every American child living in poverty (1 in 5)! Parents choosing the school of their choice that’s best for their child and family! Trump’s policies are directly opposite of Hillary’s! What has Hillary done in the last 30 years? Jess Furtado Corning ‘Vote third party’ The two-party system has created a world that is horrific, to put it mildly. A place where untold millions of people have been killed in wars, thousands of species have been extinguished for the profit of a few and the environment is on a path to where mammals will not be able to survive on the surface (you are a mammal). Whether a Republican or Democratic candidate achieves federal or state office, they will continue to represent the insane-with-greed, loyal-to-no-country wealthy humans and their corporations; not you. Stop being motivated by fear. It is time to be brave. Vote third party this election and we will have an alternative next election. R. Sterling Ogden Chico Re “Swallow hard and support Clinton” (Guest comment, by Chris Verrill, Sept. 8): Like Bill, Hillary Clinton “represents too much of what is wrong with our political system … saying whatever it takes to get votes—that calculated pandering, the huge donors buying elections.” It is disgusting, but that’s politics as usual. Sanders “lost” because the DNC rigged the primary election with voter suppression, disenfranchisement and fraud throughout. What did Clinton do to make it right? She hired the person who was responsible to work on her campaign. That’s telling. In the past 24 years, Democrats have been POTUS for 16 and yet things have gotten progressively worse for 99 percent of Americans. With bailouts to the Wall Street crooks who collapsed the economy, escalation of the “war on terror”—a guise for U.S. imperialism to enrich U.S. corporations, environmental devastation from fracking, the transportation and use of oil products, the proliferation of GMOs/pesticides/herbicides, pushing dangerous “trade deals” like the TPP that make NAFTA seem mild in comparison, all of which Hillary Clinton supported. A vote for Clinton is a vote for politics as usual, unbridled corporate greed and increased corporate control of our lives. Swallow hard on that. Now is the right time to vote Green. Jill Stein 2016! Sherri Quammen Chico Earning their keep? Re “Cop talk” (Cover story, by Ken Smith, Sept. 1): The police officers [interviewed by CN&R] described their work as both “hard” and “soul-crushing,” and I am sure that it often is. Nurses, teachers and social workers, among others, might agree that this is true of their work, too. But police work is financially compensated far better than other public service jobs in Chico. According to 2015 data, of the 62 police officers listed, 25 had an annual salary $100,000-$135,000, 25 made $75,000-$100,000 and 13 made $50,000-$75,000. Generous retirement and health benefits add to these costs. This in a city where the median household (not individual) income is $43,000. Overtime in particular seems to add to individual police salaries. It may be true, as the officers say, that only police officers can understand police work. But it is also true that Chico residents and their elected representatives can best assess if police officers are meeting the community safety, behavior and service standards that are as high as the compensation we have agreed to pay them, year after year. Regrettably, there does not seem to be widely known and clear performance measures that would contribute to mutual understanding and cooperation between Chico’s police and the residents of Chico. It is not too late. Douglas Ferguson Chico More wordplay Re “Back and forth” (Letters, by Rick Vagts, Sept. 8): Joining myself and Feminista Quammen, Rick Vagts plopped down in the letter-writing sandbox and pulled a loudly quacking mechanical duck from his diaper. Top drawer Romper Room humor. All this toddling audacity inspired research: a slow reading of the missives de Vagts. I diligently searched for a coherent thread, or the odd dalliance with principle—all to no avail. I did notice a reference to Buddha and George Carlin, together in one paragraph; a promising glimmer of intelligent life. But alas, on closer examination, twas the sparkling eye of a deranged spider monkey, pounding on a typewriter, ad infinitum and with King Lear in potentia. In a hundred billion years, Buddha and Carlin shall meet again, no less eloquently without Vagts: “… yellow doorknob Buddha goat Voltaire hubcap Carlin Neptune albatross Cordelia gonorrhea Goneril …” I do appreciate sweaty old Vagts, jabbing his flaccid spear at my bubbles of sanctimonious greenhouse gas. I dearly hope he soldiers on. But, let it be said, that no heap of half-baked cynicism or spastic Rorschach word associations will obscure the crippling moral lethargy conspicuous in America—50 years into the Anthropocene. Patrick Newman Chico Stop the wasteful fliers I once again have received the Chico Enterprise-Record’s weekly flier. I have requested twice for them to stop leaving it in my driveway every week. I have notified the City Council to see if it is even legal. Why does this bother me? I don’t look at the ads. Many of my neighbors don’t either. What an enormous waste of resources. We are requested to ration water usage and recycle all that we can. How much water does it take to produce thousands of these fliers? The E-R hires people to drive around town and flip them out the windows of their cars. How much gas is being consumed by these cars? I’m breathing enough exhaust fumes already. I assume the advertisers are paying for the production and the delivery and the paper is making a profit. Is that profit worth the cost to the environment? I wonder what percentage of people take advantage of the ads and how many copies go directly to the trash. It’s probably not great for the landfill either. My complaints went to the City Council four weeks ago. I hope they take up the matter of the legality and the wastefulness of it. What if every business decided to drop a flier at every house? Chuck Samuels Chico Not an Aussie Re “Hunt for the Wilderpeople” (Film shorts, by Juan-Carlos Selznick, Sept. 8): Ultra-patriotic Kiwi actor Sam Neill would probably feel amused to be called an Australian by your film reviewer, Juan-Carlos Selznick, given his fine sense of humor. But J-C was still about 2,000 miles off the mark. Otherwise, his was a fine short summation of Taika Waititi’s Hunt for the Wlderpeople, Paul Owen Orewa, New Zealand NASA’s boondoggle OSIRIS-REx has blasted off! NASA’s seven-year, $1 billion mission to gather real dust and debris from the asteroid Bennu has commenced. During October, in these orchards north of town, there’s an alarming shortage of both products. Now to convert the wealth from such rare commodities into providing for more inconsequential matters like comforting people rotting in the gutter, rising mental instability, rampant childhood disease, mounting addiction and abuse, crumbling infrastructure, corruption, preservation and even debt. Actually, we should have answered these desperate screams long before this senseless boondoggle was ever conceived—all to determine the origins of life. Long before this worthless contraption ever waddles back to Earth, many of us, beyond choice, will have already known whence we came. Kenneth B. Keith Chico Corrections In last week’s Streetalk (“What song inspires you?” Sept. 8), the wrong photo was published with Sherry Sommer’s response. Additionally, the photo of the Paradise Pow Wow that appeared in CN&R’s calendar (page 30) was incorrectly credited. Paula Schultz took the photo. We apologize for the errors. —ed.

Daily Herlad File photo   Amazon has been particularly aggressive in its development of last-mile fulfillment centers near major population centers. AP Photo File photo   Ryan Phillips   It didn't take long for Amazon Prime's same-day delivery service, available in just a handful of U.S. cities in 2014, to evolve from novelty to industry norm. Then, last year, Chicago became one of the pilot markets for Amazon Prime Now, through which everything from basic household items to TVs are delivered to customers' doorsteps in an hour or less. The shrinking delivery times, together with rising e-commerce sales, have e-tailers and brick-and-mortar giants alike scrambling to adapt their distribution channels, with many focusing on the final leg -- or so-called "last mile" -- of a product's journey from warehouse to consumer. Amazon has been particularly aggressive in its development of last-mile fulfillment centers near major population centers. In August, for the third time in as many months, the company announced another such facility in Chicago's suburbs -- this time, an 850,000-square-foot warehouse in Monee. The news followed earlier announcements in May and June about similar facilities in Joliet and Romeoville, respectively. Why so many distributions centers so suddenly? The shorter delivery times -- which are just getting shorter, as demonstrated by Amazon Prime Air, a drone delivery service currently in development that is targeting delivery in 30 minutes or less -- require more inventory to be on-hand locally. Not to mention, goods packed in separate boxes for shipments to customers take up much more space than those same goods stacked in pallets for bulk delivery to retailers. Census data backs up the new retail reality: e-commerce sales accounted for 8.1 percent of all retail sales in second-quarter 2016. The e-commerce sales total of $97.3 billion represented a 4.5 percent increase over the first quarter and a 15.8 percent jump over the same period last year. To compete in this arena, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is spending heavily. Its recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, the largest purchase of a U.S. e-commerce startup, was intended to level the playing field. But catching up won't be easy. While Amazon Prime Air does not yet have an official launch date, the company already has introduced new services like Amazon Flex, through which independent contractors pick up and deliver goods in Uber-like fashion. In addition to developing massive suburban warehouses, Amazon is also pursuing urban infill opportunities, recently leasing warehouses on Goose Island and the South Side. Although most brick-and-mortar retailers aren't as advanced in their delivery channels, they do have a distinct advantage: an established network of physical storefronts -- many in highly accessible locations -- that can function as mini-fulfillment centers. In order to stay competitive, Wal-Mart and other retailers have started reconfiguring the footprint of their brick-and-mortar locations in order to facilitate faster at-home delivery and in-store pickup. In some cases, this is done by reducing showroom space to make room for more efficient warehouse storage or by using shelf inventory to fulfill orders placed online. It's a different approach compared with how online orders have historically been fulfilled by brick-and-mortar retailers. Rather than goods going directly from warehouse to consumer, they move from store to consumer -- a faster model for retail chains that already have locations near residential neighborhoods. Larger suburban warehouses are still needed, but rather than inventory going directly to customers, it is increasingly being used to restock store shelves. Brick-and-mortar retailers aren't the only ones taking a page from the competition. As they expand their e-commerce presence, Amazon is going the opposite direction to pursue brick-and-mortar opportunities. The company recently announced plans to open an offline bookstore on Southport Avenue in Chicago's densely populated Lakeview neighborhood, replicating a format first introduced in Seattle in fall 2015. As Chicago, one of the country's main distribution hubs, sees its real estate landscape evolve to meet the increasingly complex needs associated with last-mile delivery, cities throughout the world are watching, ready to apply the best practices that emerge. • Ryan Phillips serves as director in Transwestern's Agency Leasing: Industrial group in Chicago.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next SHAWNEE, Kan. - An Overland Park man accused of attempted murder, kidnapping and robbery outside a Shawnee Walmart remains behind bars. Previous stories: Woman, good Samaritan improving after Shawnee Wal-Mart attack Shawnee Wal-Mart tops businesses police respond to in recent years Arthur Wyatt, 27, went before a judge Wednesday. Shawnee Police say he was one of two suspects involved in a shooting Sunday night. He is being held on a $1 million bond. “My brother was in the wrong. No matter what anybody says, no matter how I feel about him being gone, I will always openly admit that he was wrong for what he did,” Kayla Blackmon told 41 Action News. Blackmon’s older brother John Simmons was with Wyatt when the shooting occurred. Simmons was shot and killed at the scene. "We are so sorry for everyone that is affected by this. We hate the fact that they have to go home traumatized, their lives have changed, everything has changed. A lot of things have changed due to this once incident,” said Blackmon. Shawnee Police say Wyatt and Simmons attacked a mother who was buckling her child into a carseat. According to the police report, two good samaritans rushed over to the mother’s car, who 41 Action News confirmed is a Johnson County paramedic, to help. Joshua Owen, 33, was one of the good Samaritans. His family told 41 Action News, Owen was shot three times— in the face, chest and arm. Owen has already undergone two surgeries and his recovering in the hospital. He is an Air Force veteran who severed overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. Owen’s 15-year-old daughter, Halle, sent 41 Action News this statement, via text: “To me, my dad is a hero. He risked his life trying to save someone else’s. I love him with all my heart and I’m so thankful that he is going to be fine. I’m so thankful that the people were there to help my dad. Without them, I would’ve lost the best dad that I could have ever asked for.” A GoFundMe account has been set up to help Owen’s family with medical expenses.  ------   Ariel Rothfield can be reached at Ariel.Rothfield@KSHB.com.

(This year’s new creations include fried Jello and pulled pork-stuffed fried Funyuns.) But if one fair food vendor has it his way, fair-worthy fried food will be as close as your nearest Walmart. State Fair vendor Isaac Rousso, who’s won numerous awards for his deep-fried wonders, is opening a fair food-themed restaurant inside a Walmart in the Dallas suburb of Plano next week. The Dallas Morning News reports it’ll be “the first in a region-wide, then potentially nationwide expansion.” The aptly named State Fair Treats, described as a “retro-themed diner,” will serve funnel cake fries, corn dogs, “deep-fried hash browns stuffed with bacon and cheddar cheese,” and Rousso’s new cookie fries (deep-fried cookie dough masquerading as crinkle fries, with chocolate and strawberry sauces for dipping), among other things. This is the same guy that unleashed nuclear-colored bacon margaritas on an unsuspecting public, so expect things to get weird. Rousso anticipates he’ll have more than a dozen locations open by the end of 2017, and tells the Morning News he’s looking to snap up vacant spaces inside Walmart stores as big chains like McDonald’s move out. While we’d argue that the best part about State Fair food is that it’s only available three weeks each year, perhaps Walmart customers in other parts of the country will take delight in discovering the kind of deep-fried oddities that Texans have punished their bodies with for years. • Deep-Fried State Fair Food Will Be Served At A Plano Walmart 365 Days a Year [E] • State Fair Fixture Isaac Rousso Opening Restaurant in Plano Walmart [DMN] • The Weirdest Things to Eat at the 2016 State Fair of Texas [E] More From Eater Watch: How to Turn Leftover Sashimi Into Beer-Battered Fish Tacos The Eater Guide to the Whole Entire World The 23 Most Anticipated Restaurant Openings of Fall 2016 Escaping the Restaurant Industry's Motherhood Trap The 24-Year-Old Coca-Cola Virgin The Biggest New Cookbooks of 2016 Most Read Internet Crazies Think This DC Pizzeria Is the Center of a Clinton Sex Ring The 9 Hottest New Restaurants in Tucson, Arizona Watch: Eating Wagyu Beef From Nose to Tail at This Meaty Omakase This Article has a component height of 6.

Courtesy of the family 1 of 5 i By Matt Campbell goodsamaritan@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Charles and Linda Segebrecht had been shopping at Wal-Mart on “a gorgeous day” when they became immersed in a horrific incident that shocked them out of their complacency. First came a woman’s scream. Then Linda saw and heard another woman yell directly to her: “Call 911! He’s got a gun!” The Segebrechts had driven smack into the middle of what authorities say was a brutal attempted robbery that turned into a deadly encounter between two attackers and two unrelated Good Samaritans. In a matter of minutes one of the attackers was dead and one of the Good Samaritans was critically wounded, as was a mother who apparently was the initial target. Exactly three days after that Sunday afternoon incident, at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, an Overland Park man made his first appearance in Johnson County District Court. Arthur Fred Wyatt III, 27, is charged with attempted first-degree murder and other crimes, accused of repeatedly hitting the mother on the head and trying to rob her. When Magistrate Judge Daniel W. Vokins learned that Wyatt’s previous convictions included involuntary manslaughter and aggravated arson, he doubled the bond to $2 million. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson Pause 2:31 May 9 arrests at Kansas City library event 0:54 Out-of-control car careens toward Merriam police officer working crash 3:47 Refugee children in Kansas City find solace in soccer 2:03 See and experience Pompeii in new Union Station exhibit 8:28 KC Star 'New Wave of Hip Hop' group cypher 0:14 Who kicked this small dog down a flight of stairs?

Police describe what took place during the attempted robbery that ended with one attacker dead and the woman and one Good Samarita Laura Bauer, Joe Ledford and Robert A. Cronkleton The Kansas City Star Also by late Wednesday afternoon, a GoFundMe page for Joshua James Owen, the Good Samaritan who was wounded, had raised more than $30,000 from more than 800 people to pay for the uninsured landscaper’s extensive medical bills. The husband, father of a 15-year-old daughter and Air Force war veteran was struck by three bullets — in the face, the wrist and the chest. The 33-year-old Kansas City man faces many surgeries in the weeks ahead and is not expected to be able to work for at least six months. “We will continue to pray for a speedy recovery for Josh, as well as the victims and any other members of the community who were affected by this unfortunate and unforgettable event,” Owen’s sister-in-law Brittany Parks wrote on the GoFundMe page. “We ask you to do the same.” Linda Segebrecht, an education consultant who has worked with the Battle of the Brains at Union Station’s Science City and several other projects, immediately called 911 as the woman in the parking lot implored her to do. Charles Segebrecht, a volunteer firefighter for Lake Quivira, at first mistakenly thought someone was having a heart attack and he prepared to do what he could to help. That’s when the gunfire began. The Segebrechts saw it all through their windshield. “Two men tumbled out in front of us and one had a gun and was shooting at the other one,” Linda Segebrecht said. “They were wrestling on the ground.” One of those men was 28-year-old John W. Simmons III of Kansas City. The other was Owen, who was not armed but was coming to the aid of a woman who was struck in the back of the head as she was placing her child into a car seat in the parking lot outside the lawn and garden section of the Wal-Mart. “And then a third man came out from between the cars and he shot the man with the gun,” Linda Segebrecht continued. “He shot, it looked like, several times. It looked like he was trying to get up and then finally he fell backwards.” Simmons died at the scene. According to police, the second man with a gun was a second Good Samaritan. Police questioned that 36-year-old De Soto resident and released him later that afternoon. Police have not released his name. By this time Charles Segebrecht was backing up, trying to get himself and his wife away from any errant bullets. “My husband turned and saw a second man run up the hill and the back down the hill,” Linda Segebrecht said. “Then he turned around and ran away.” That, apparently, was the other alleged attacker. A police K9 unit soon apprehended nearby a man who fit the description that witnesses gave. But they later released him after determining he was not involved in the Wal-Mart incident. Police then began the hunt for the second attacker, which led them Tuesday to Wyatt. Wyatt was convicted as a juvenile in 2003 of aggravated arson and a few years later of involuntary manslaughter in Wyandotte County. He was convicted again in Wyandotte County in 2012 on a drug charge. He was released from state prison in July 2015 and his sentence expired in July this year. According to court records, Wyatt was either employed by or had some affiliation with Avenue of Life, a Kansas City, Kan., organization whose mission “is to mobilize our community to equip and empower low-income individuals and families to be self-sustained and independent,” according to its website. The organization did not return calls Wednesday. Wyatt’s father on Wednesday told The Kansas City Star that his son was at the crime scene at Wal-Mart on Sunday but said he was not the gunman. “All I can say is my son never pulled a trigger on a gun at that site and he’s being blamed for everything,” Arthur Wyatt Jr. said. “He didn’t have a gun and they didn’t find no gunshot residue on him or nothing. … I think it’s an injustice on the Shawnee Mission police force to say, ‘OK, we’re going to put all the blame on you and we got our man and glorify ourselves,’ because he wasn’t the guy that committed the crime.” The criminal complaint against Wyatt alleges he did shoot at Owen with the premeditation of killing him. It also alleges that Wyatt repeatedly struck the mother, identified only as “M.D.J.” and a 39-year-old Kansas City, Kan., resident. The complaint alleges Wyatt’s actions were an attempted kidnapping and that he tried to grab her “purse or keys or motor vehicle.” The woman was released from a hospital on Monday. Arthur Wyatt Jr. said his son did not know what Simmons intended to do in that parking lot and that he thinks Simmons had a bipolar disorder. Federal court records show that Simmons, at the time of his death, was under indictment in U.S. District Court in Western Missouri for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and for having a firearm while trafficking drugs and for being a felon in possession of a firearm. Missouri court records show Simmons had a protective order against him in 2013, ordering him to stay away from a person with whom he had a child. The day Wyatt was charged, Owen underwent a second surgery, this one on his hand, according to the GoFundMe page. A previous surgery on Sunday was on his face after a bullet removed part of his nose, shattered cheek bones and damaged nerves. A third bullet struck his chest and traveled up to his left shoulder and remained lodged in the bone on Wednesday, according to the GoFundMe page. He is unable to eat because of the surgeries and trauma to his face; a tube offers nutrients. “This past Sunday was not the first time Josh has put his life on the line to save someone else’s,” the page said, adding that the joined the Air Force after 9/11  and during more than four years’ deployment served in Iraq and Afghanistan. “He was also present during the shooting at Independence Center in 2012, and quickly responded by helping aid people who were injured,” the page said. “Josh has always put others before himself, and we are all confident he will continue to do so, even after this tragic event that has left him hospitalized.” The Saturday afternoon shooting at Independence Center in 2012 injured two people and caused the mall to shut down for several hours. Linda Segebrecht said she had never before experienced anything like what happened Sunday afternoon in the Wal-Mart parking lot and she hopes she never will again. As she related events to a police dispatcher on the phone, she did not realize that Good Samaritans were involved. “It was absolutely shocking to see all that happen in front of you,” she said. “It didn’t seem real.” To reach Matt Campbell: goodsamaritan@kcstar.com, 816-234-4902, @mattcampbellKC Related content Good Samaritan shot, alleged robber slain near Wal-Mart in Shawnee LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Crime Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson Pause 2:31 May 9 arrests at Kansas City library event 0:54 Out-of-control car careens toward Merriam police officer working crash 3:47 Refugee children in Kansas City find solace in soccer 2:03 See and experience Pompeii in new Union Station exhibit 8:28 KC Star 'New Wave of Hip Hop' group cypher 0:14 Who kicked this small dog down a flight of stairs?

Michael Taleb, 41, was found by Lt./Detective Mike Nichols and Patrolman Travis Rutherford in the store's electronics department. One of the store managers explained to the officers that Taleb tried to return cell phones to the store. When she was told that the 15-day return limit had expired on the phones, Taleb “...began yelling and screaming about the policy...,” the probable cause affidavit related. When she reportedly refused to leave the store, the manager had an employee call 9-1-1 and request police assistance. Officers attempted to calm the woman and then called for Scott County EMS to come when she stated she felt ill. When told the ambulance would take her to Scott Memorial Hospital, Taleb apparently became upset again and refused to get into the ambulance, saying she wanted to go to University of Louisville Hospital instead. Told she would have to go to the local hospital first as a matter of EMS policy, the woman still refused to be helped by the technicians and stated she would not leave the store either. At that point, Lt. Nichols attempted to handcuff the woman, but, in the struggle that followed, both EMS technicians and Lt. Nichols were allegedly struck or scratched by her. When Lt. Nichols walked Taleb to his patrol car, he said the woman fell. EMS staff assisted Taleb off the ground and onto a stretcher. She was transported to Scott Memorial where her handcuffs were removed by Deputy Jac Sanders so she could be examined by emergency room staff. He had to “forcefully” place them back on her, and the woman was taken to the Scott County Security Center after being released by a doctor. Lt. Nichols noted that the woman's 13-year-old daughter was recording portions of the incident. The girl and her mother's possessions were released to her older brother. A copy of the Wal-Mart store security video and tapes of the store manager's 9-1-1 call and two 9-1-1 calls made by Taleb have been obtained as evidence by the police department. Taleb was charged with two Level 5 battery charges for hurting Lt. Nichols and one of the EMS technicians. A Level 6 battery charge was added for the injury she allegedly caused to the second EMS technician. A Level 6 felony resisting law enforcement is also among her charges as are two misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. Taleb appeared for her initial hearing in Scott Circuit Court on Wednesday, September 7. A preliminary plea of not guilty was entered for her, and her case was assigned to a public defender. An initial jury trial date of December 13 was scheduled. Bail was set at $10,000 by corporate surety bond or $1,000 cash. As conditions of her bail, Taleb was advised that she was not to contact either Lt. Nichols or the EMS technician hurt in the scuffle nor was she to go onto Wal-Mart property again. Judge Roger Duvall set a hearing to review her bail on Tuesday, September 13.   -30-

Unfortunately they’ll be out of the artisanal potato chips and organic cottage cheese. Instead, you’ll receive Doritos and Cheez Whiz. Close enough, right? Libra (9/23-10/22) — You’ll blitz through town ripping down Halloween decorations you feel are up too early. You’ll continue by pulling banners off the endcaps of a local grocery store for the same reason. Psych evaluations are in your future. Scorpio (10/23-11/21) — With a hint of fall in the air, you’ll break out your flannel shirt and winter cap. Despite their style and comfort between the hours of 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., come noon you’ll be sweating like Michael Jackson at an orphan’s picnic. Sagittarius (11/22-12/22) — Inspired by the Alabama Coastal Cleanup, you decide to purge the clutter from your life and organize all your remaining possessions alphabetically and according to color. Weeks later, you’ll be diagnosed with OCD, but luckily, you’ll also be down with O.P.P. Capricorn (12/23-1/19) — After spending last weekend decorating your front porch for Halloween, you’ll be disappointed when a vigilante sabotages the display overnight. In an effort to protect it, you’ll spend the next six weeks standing guard, motionless, dressed as the Grim Reaper. Aquarius (1/20-2/18) — Misunderstanding the Mobile Arts Council’s annual “Throwdown,” you’ll arrive wearing nothing but tight briefs and a Mexican wrestling mask. But a fight will erupt anyway after you declare that pop art is boring and Picasso’s Blue Period was more like an ultramarine. Pisces (2/19-3/20) — You’ll storm the field during a football game, shirtless and drunk, evading police for about two minutes before becoming winded and surrendering. Despite your very public crime, you’ll be offered immunity along with a position on the force. Aries (3/21-4/19) — After your favorite internet cartoon is hijacked by the “alt-right,” you’ll finally take it upon yourself to shut down Breitbart.com. After learning to code and planning a multistage hack, you’ll realize nobody but your uncle reads the website and apply for a job in IT somewhere. Taurus (4/20-5/20) — Despite being reared as a patriotic American, your boycott of the NFL over its failure to condemn peaceful protests won’t last. With a fantasy app beeping and constant peer pressure, you’ll be painting your face again by next Sunday. Gemini (5/21-6/21) — As a Republican, you’ll mourn for your party after watching a recent candidate compete on “Dancing with the Stars.” If the rise of Donald Trump wasn’t enough, the fact that Rick Perry’s footwork is far superior to his foreign policy plan should drive the point right home. Cancer (6/22-7/22) — Inspired by YouTube videos aimed at gaining awareness and acceptance of various disorders, you’ll take to Bienville Square to create your own. You’ll demonstrate your problems with rage by screaming at and breaking the cell phone video recorder when the music starts. Leo (7/23-8/23) — It’ll be a new battle of the bulge, when your guilt will force you on a juice cleanse after workday candy bars cause your weight to balloon to 10 pounds above your previous high in college. You’ll drink only juice for exactly half a day before consuming a Big Mac.

Reports Results for Three and Nine Months Ended July 31, 2016 STATEN ISLAND, NY -- (Marketwired) -- 09/14/16 -- Coffee Holding Co., Inc. (NASDAQ: JVA) (the "Company") today announced its operating results for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2016: Net sales totaled $17,354,533 for the three months ended July 31, 2016, a decrease of $9,685,324, or 35.8%, from $27,039,857 for the three months ended July 31, 2015. The decrease in net sales reflects reduced wholesale transactions with our largest wholesale green coffee customer during the quarter of approximately $9,379,000. Cost of sales for the three months ended July 31, 2016 was $14,203,343, or 81.9% of net sales, as compared to $24,991,366, or 92.5% of net sales, for the three months ended July 31, 2015. Cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity. The decrease in cost of sales reflects a more favorable inventory position during the quarter and reduced wholesale transactions with our largest wholesale green coffee customer. Gross profit for the three months ended July 31, 2016 was $3,151,190, an increase of $1,102,699 from $2,048,491 for the three months ended July 31, 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.1% for the three months ended July 31, 2016 from 7.5% for the three months ended July 31, 2015. The increase in gross profits was due to improved margins on our wholesale and roasted business as well as a decrease in our losses quarter to quarter on our hedging operations. Total operating expenses decreased by $18,785 to $1,868,223 for the three months ended July 31, 2016 from $1,887,008 for the three months ended July 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of $18,785 to $1,704,373 in selling and administrative expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2016 from $1,723,158 for the three months ended July 31, 2015. The Company had net income of $755,518 or $0.12 per share basic and diluted, for the three months ended July 31, 2016 compared to net income of $139,162, or $0.02 per share basic and diluted for the three months ended July 31, 2015. The increase in net income was due primarily to the reasons described above. "I'm pleased to report another solid quarter to our shareholders as we earned $0.12 per share for the quarter ended July 31, 2016 versus $0.02 per share for last year's corresponding quarter. The second half of the quarter saw positive developments for the green coffee market as prices continued to rise from previous lows. These higher prices have translated into improved margins on our sales of specialty green coffee as we are able to take advantage of our favorable inventory position. This trend continues into the fourth quarter as the market is currently trading at highest level since February of 2015 and we believe this trend will be sustainable for the foreseeable future. Also, during the quarter, we completed our acquisition of the assets of Coffee Kinetics LLC, doing business as Sonofresco, a seller of electrical table top roasters and specialty green coffee. Sonofresco's financial results from the month of July are reflected in this quarter's results and going forward, will be fully integrated in our consolidated financial statements. The Sonofresco acquisition has already been accretive to both top and bottom line results and the effects of a higher green coffee market will assist in meeting our positive expectations," commented Andrew Gordon, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. "As previously announced, we are excited about the rollout of our Café Caribe flagship brand, a popular Spanish style espresso roast coffee, in approximately 900 Food Lion grocery stores and our new business developments with Smart&Final and Wal-Mart. Food Lion is a prominent food retailer located in areas where we previously had limited distribution of Café Caribe and we are excited about the opportunity for expansion into this market. While we have not yet seen the impact of our Smart&Final and Wal-Mart partnerships on our financial statements as these took place late in the quarter, we look forward to these results in upcoming quarters. "We remain upbeat that going forward we will begin to rebuild top line revenue growth in conjunction with our improved bottom line results by continuing our aggressive approach to seeking new business opportunities and sustaining our margins on both current and new business," concluded Mr. Gordon.

To be honest, I hadn’t had much of an encounter with America itself. I had only arrived the country the first time just over a week ago. And my encounter had been mostly limited to the pleasantly choreographed tours around the twin cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis by the wonderful organisers of the World Press Institute (WPI) fellowship. I had only gone out once on my own to a nearby Walmart to buy groceries. The trip to Ely was also particularly interesting to me because I was earnestly looking forward to seeing what life in rural America looked like, having spent some part of my teenage years in a rural community in Lagos. I like making comparisons. I have come to believe that most big cities around the world are essentially alike – a core, made of huge concrete edifices, mostly fenced by affluent suburbs, with a mix of undesirable slums pushed further away or hidden from view like piles of used dishes after a feast. So, Lagos minus 17 million people, the chaotic rush hour traffic, and Keke Napep (tricycle popularly called tuk-tuk in some parts of the world) would not be much different from the Twin Cities. I had not spent time in rural communities in any other countries I had visited before so I was eager to see how rural America compared to rural Nigeria. There was not much comparison to be made. Rural America was not the neglected poverty-stricken, hopeless settlements that rural Nigeria is. One could move back and forth from urban America to rural America without the degraded standard of living that such a movement in Nigeria would have automatically elicited. I tried to imagine how things would have been different if politicians back home could be made to see the benefits of developing their rural communities but the picture of Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, commissioning a hand pumped borehole early this year kept popping up in my mind. I had no intention of getting depressed so turned and mimicked Marina, the fellow from Bulgaria and Natalia, from Ukraine, who were speaking Russian inside our van. The ensuing laughter was therapeutic. Ely was a beautiful town of 3,500 people sheltered by forests of tall pines and several lakes. Ely was old money. You know this as soon as you drive into the town. Its picturesque setting provides the perfect summer getaway for wealthy Minnesotans, who own beautiful lakeside cabins inside the woods. I didn’t have to wait long before I found out the source of the old money – mining. A resident, Hans Olsen, 73, told me that buried under the pines of Ely is huge deposits of copper, nickel and 20 other minerals. John Seliga, inside the old Pioneer Mine, Ely Minnesota. “At its peak, two-third of all the iron ore in the United States came from Ely,” he said. The Pioneer Mine, which opened in 1888 was forced to close in 1967 due to the introduction of new steel-making technology where oxygen was directly shot into the steel via ceramic lances thereby ending the demand in the richly oxygenated ore found in Ely. However, by the time it closed the mine had shipped 41,112,587 tons of iron ore. In 2015, many inhabitants were filled with hope of the return of the town’s heydays after Twin Metals LLC, owned by Chilean mining conglomerate, Antofagasta Plc, announced it was considering revisiting an underground mine near the Birch Lake, southeast of Ely, where large deposits of copper and nickel were found. The announcement caused a crack in the relationship between local Ely politicians and residents, who wanted the mines back and state politicians and environmentalists, who feared that the return of sulphide mining in the area might destroy the forest and contaminate the pristine lakes in the area. John Seliga, who worked at the Pioneer Mine from 1957 to 1966, six months before the mine was closed, said the concerns about the resumption of mining in the area were unfounded. He added that if anything at all there are now technologies to stop any environmental hazards that may result from mining in the area. “The mining company (Oliver Mining Company, a division of US Steel) allowed you to go to college. As long as they do it right there shouldn’t be any problem,” he said, his voice overflowing with nostalgia. Similarly, Seraphine Rolando, picker/historian, who conducted the WPI fellows on a tour of the Pioneer Mine, said the state of Minnesota maintained the highest environmental standards you can find anywhere. He doesn’t see the reason why the anti-mining people are worried. “At this stage, the mining company is only testing to see what can be found. But it would eventually happen because there is a lot of jobs to be created. Job creation and the prosperity of the town was also high on the mind of Anne Swenson. “The three biggest industry in the town are mining, logging, and tourism. How much do loggers make? Maybe $9,000. You’d be lucky if you made $9,000 from working in tourism but studies have shown that miner could make up to $60,000 to $70,000 a year,” she said. Ms Swenson was probably referring to a 2009 study by the University of Minnesota, Duluth. The study revealed the enormous impact of the return of mining in northern Minnesota. The Study, “The Economic Impact of Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Mining Study on the State of Minnesota” found that Iron mining helped contribute $3.1 billion to the state’s economy in 2007 and helped support more than 10,000 jobs. Iron mining paid $148 million in state and local taxes in 2008, based on 2007 production levels. Of that amount, $46 million was used to supported local schools, $11 million supported the University of Minnesota and what was left was spent on mining communities. The study also showed that mining was the single largest contributor to the region’s economy. It was responsible for 23 percent of the gross regional product in 2001; in 2007, mining was responsible for 34 percent of the gross regional product. As she drove me back to her lovely cabin on Eagle Nest Lake, Cynthia Stokes, 83, said she believed that the numbers of pro-mining people of Ely  are exaggerated. “Usually, the company goes away after five or six years. It could create negligible jobs and pollution will stay for a long time,” she said. However, she added that she somehow understands the need to kick-start the economy of Ely and as someone who only spend the summer in the town she doesn’t think she qualifies to tell the people what they want. Lessons for Nigeria I think Nigeria has a lot to learn from the arguments for and against mining in Ely. As the federal government moves towards the exploration of solid minerals as an alternative means of revenue in the face of cascading oil prices, I believe some of the arguments going on in Ely should be replicated back home. But unfortunately, I do not see any of those. The government seems to have made up its mind and unlike in Ely are forcing its decision down the throats of the communities where these mining are expected to take place. All I have read is about how much the government stands to make. Very little, if any, attention is being paid to the impact mining would have on the environment and on the lives of the people in mining communities. This is most unfortunate because it seems we have not learned from the havoc wrecked by oil exploration to the rich creeks of the Niger Delta. Neither have we learned anything from widespread deaths due to lead poisoning in Niger and Zamfara States. In Ely, the people are part of the debate. Even those in support of mining are insisting on the highest safety standard. To avoid the debacle that the Niger Delta has since become, the Nigerian government should copy this model.

Please include your name, city of residence and a daytime phone number for verification. Danger zones Wouldn't it be great to pass through any downtown/west-side/east-side/north-side/south-side congested area, I-25 exit/on-ramp, underneath I-25 overpasses, every shopping mall, Walmart, Target, every stoplight, and now nearly all major roads... without seeing young kids, middle-aged substance abusers, men, women, elderly, and their dogs, camped on the median panhandling for money? Notice I said money, that's an important point. Obviously I would never group all people under the same umbrella, but let's say 85 percent of the people panhandling don't want food, water, groceries, a free meal, or information directing them to various Colorado Springs homeless shelters and substance-abuse programs. Sounds like exaggeration but I've tried on many occasions to help with the aforementioned items, including printed-out papers with local resources. Are we waiting for one of these people to be smashed in the roadway before we act? Some innocent driver will spend the rest of his life thinking about a senseless death he caused because we don't "police" our roadways. (CSPD should check with Manitou Springs Police Department and traffic enforcement; they're well-trained in these operations.) Can kids set up lemonade stands in these same places? Can the tamale lady occupy these dangerous areas also? Or, just people under the influence with the most potential for falling into traffic? Come on Springs we're better than this. — William Hoopes Colorado Springs Willing to help The mission of Incline Friends is to advocate for preservation and maintenance of and public access to the Manitou Incline. We recognize that Incline-related visitation has heavily impacted the residents on Ruxton Avenue and in Engelmann Canyon. Please note that Incline-related visitation is not the only issue that creates quality-of-life and public-safety issues — visitors to the Cog Railway and to Barr Trail contribute significantly to the traffic. The city of Manitou Springs has implemented some measures to try to mitigate the traffic on Ruxton, including limiting public parking, providing free parking on the eastern edge of town, along with a year-round, free shuttle from the free parking to the base of the Incline. While these measures have helped, they have not solved the problem. The Incline is a tremendous asset to Manitou, Colorado Springs and the Pikes Peak region. It is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in free marketing and is recognized nationally and internationally. Most cities would love to have this "problem." The Incline, Ring the Peak Trail, Barr Trail, the soon-to-be "Missing Link" trail that connects Barr Trail to the Bear Creek watershed, and Colorado Springs' south slope watershed offer a world-class outdoor recreation experience. Together, they make the region a tremendous place to live and play. This is something to be celebrated, and involved parties are encouraged to work together to find solutions to issues created by the use of these resources. Incline Friends will cooperate in any manner that we can to further a solution. — David Adair President, Incline Friends No bikes in the wild We are blessed with a wide variety of public lands, an incredible heritage that can be passed on to our grandchildren, if we're vigilant. Unfortunately, population growth, energy development, ATV proliferation and other human activities have steadily eroded wildlife habitat on far too many public lands. A new twist in this degradation involves the efforts of the Sustainable Trails Coalition (STC), pushing to allow bicycles in wilderness areas. According to the STC website, "The political stars are currently aligned in our favor on Capitol Hill. We will be working with a Republican-controlled U.S. House and Senate that philosophically favor limited government and oppose severe and overzealous regulation..." Two GOP senators from Utah, Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, are doing the STC's dirty work, pushing a bill to allow bikes in wilderness areas. They don't care about bicyclists, but they are interested in more oil wells, sulfide mines, etc. The proposal is controversial in the biking community, and opposed by hunters, anglers and others who say bikes would degrade wildlife habitat and erode trails. Some 116 conservation and preservation organizations have formally asked Congress to oppose attempts to weaken wilderness protections via this legislation. Here in Colorado, the Aspen-based Roaring Fork Mountain Biking Association, aligned with the International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA), does not support the effort to open wilderness trails to mountain bikes, said Mike Pritchard, the local organization's executive director. Ashley Korenblat, a former IMBA chair, adds: "We don't need to ride our bikes everywhere." Research shows that increased mountain bike and recreational disturbance has a negative impact on big game and other wildlife species. As a result, sportsmen's groups like Backcountry Hunters & Anglers support management planning that minimizes the impacts of mountain biking and other growing recreational demands. We believe wilderness designations work well as currently stipulated in the Wilderness Act and oppose efforts to rewrite the act to allow mountain bike and mechanized use in wilderness areas. — David Lien Chairman, Colorado Backcountry Hunters & Anglers Colorado Springs Come together As I live in and love America, past, present and hopefully the future, I feel obligated to have a candid conversation with my mother country, my (and our) only home. Like every cherished relative, our mother, as great as she is, is not perfect. Try as she might, she can't be all things to all people, but like all good mothers she has to fight for all her children. All people are her children, and we must fight to understand each other. As brothers and sisters, united under one flag, standing, sitting or kneeling. — Joe Debise Falcon Women for change American women have had a lot to celebrate this summer. In July, we saw the first female presidential nominee of a major party. And in August, female athletes were the unquestionable breakout stars of Team USA. Despite these high points we can't take for granted what's at stake for women in America. Women are more likely to live in poverty and work a minimum-wage job. Access to reproductive health care is threatened, and sexual assault pervades our campuses and communities. We need quality legislation and leadership to address these critical issues. We need more women to jump into politics and begin moving up the ladder. That's where Emerge Colorado comes in. We're Colorado's premier candidate training program, giving Democratic women the skills and network they need to run for office and win. We're recruiting for the class of 2017 now. Applications are available at emergeco.org. Let us help you be a force of change. — Jenny Willford Executive Director, Emerge Colorado Denver More Letters » Tweet Letters Speaking of...

Nelson Mandela Home About Us Projects Multimedia Opinion Reports Agenda Contacts Search for: Article written on 14.09.2016 at 08:20 AM by Joshua Massarenti Article tags Feminism multinational corporations Oxfam Tax category: Africa, Economy, Gender, Rights and Society Corporate tax is a feminist matter 0 Sep14 CitiGroup, Coca Cola, ExxonMobil, General Motors, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, Wal-Mart, Pfizer, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Microsoft; of all the things these multinational corporations (MNCs) agree on, two things stand out: a proclaimed devotion to the feminist agenda and a penchant for tax dodging. On the former, all MNC’s claim to dedicate some part of their corporate responsibility and philanthropy duties to the “economic empowerment” of women and girls in poor countries, and to that end, promote business skills, good saving practices and access to loans as a panacea for women’s empowerment and their countries’ development. The steps these corporations take “to advance and empower women” make them role models for gender justice among MNC’s, according to the United Nations Global Compact. But then there’s the tax issue. A few months ago, the NGO Oxfam calculated that between 2008 and 2014 alone, the 50 largest public companies in the US accumulated some $337 billion in tax breaks, while holding a whopping $1.4 trillion in offshore cash reserves. All the companies mentioned above are on the list. Tax dodging by MNCs represents “integral components of [their] profit-making strategies,” and a huge force of socio-economic devastation in particular for the Global South, where such taxes represent a larger share of overall government revenue (16%, according to the IMF, versus 8 % for their high-income counterparts), and where the technical capacity to deal with complex tax offshore investment hubs and other loopholes is weaker. Here, Oxfam argues, unpaid corporate taxes can make the “difference between life and death, poverty and opportunity.” The practice costs poor countries aroundUS$ 100 billion dollars a year. The result, predictably, is that across Africa, the working poor, (over 38% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa) often end up carrying the burden of raising tax revenue while the multinationals go scot-free. In Malawi, for example, where tax incentives for the mining sector allegedly suck out eight times the amount the government collects in revenues every year, some say that “it is the order of the day for small businesses to pay more tax than multinational companies.” Meanwhile, as a new investigation reveals, South African companies make extensive use of tax haven benefits in the Netherlands, where, apparently, “an office with a house plant is enough to satisfy tax inspectors that a company really has operations in [Amsterdam],” rather than just a letterbox company. (By routing money through the Netherlands, companies reportedly push down their tax rate from to as low as 0,6 %. Of the 20 largest companies listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange, 14 have one or more subsidiaries in the Netherlands). Within progressive feminist groups and anti-poverty NGOs, tax justice is now treated as a key development and human rights concern, with many feminists pointing out that it’s women and children who suffer the most, when social services are not provided. Chiara Capraro worked for Christian Aid, whose Death And Taxes report estimated, as early as 2008, that developing countries lost more to false invoicing and trade mis-pricing by corporations (more on that later) than what comes in as development aid. Later, in partnership with Tax Justice Network Africa (who tweet here), they published “Africa Rising” which (amongst other things) outlines steps on how to stop corporations and other elites from abusing tax loopholes. To Chiara, who is now Policy and Advocacy Manager for Women’s Economic Rights at Womankind in London, corporate tax is a feminist matter and a huge potential source of empowerment for women, if given the chance to learn about, and organize around it.

Harris Dozens of RVs have populated the parking lot of Wal-Mart as the Pendleton Round-Up moves into full swing. Buy this photo Staff photo by E.J. Harris Campsites are popping up all over Pendleton this week, and that includes in the parking lot of Wal-Mart. Buy this photo Recreational vehicles flood Pendleton each Round-Up, and plenty park for free and pay nothing in taxes. But others pay hundreds of dollars to set up shop in designated RV parks. The city of Pendleton requires trailer and mobile home businesses collect a transient room tax and the tourism promotion assessment charge, just like hotels. The tax is 8 percent for parks and hotels alike, and hotels pay an additional tourism charge of $1.50 per night per paid room while the parks pay 50 cents per night for each paid mobile home or trailer park space. The city uses the money to fund its convention center and boost tourism efforts. In its city budget, Pendleton projected $98,000 in revenue from the tourism charge for fiscal year 2017. The Pendleton Wal-Mart, 2203 S.W. Court Ave., allows Rocket RV Parking to provide RV and camping space on the south side of the large parking lot. Dozens of campers have staked their claims. Rocket asks for $25 for the length of the stay, but that is only a “suggested donation,” according to the handmade sign at the site. The money benefits Pilot Rock High School, home of the Rockets. Doug and Becky Reynolds are in their second year of operating Lookout RV Park & Storage, 601 Airport Road, which has 28 spaces. The business charges $35 a night to park an RV there during Round-Up. That means $3.30 of each charge goes to the city. Doug Reynolds said no one really knows how much free RV parking is available in Pendleton. While those sites — and some who just park on city streets or empty lots — do not pay their fair share, Reynolds said he and his wife have no plans to complain about it. “We just work hard, keep our heads down,” he said. “We want to add to the solution, not the problem.” KOA campground, 1375 S.E. Third St., has 101 spaces, though some are reserved for people living there month-to-month. Tina Groshen works at the KOA. She said parking there during Round-Up requires a commitment to a seven-day reservation at a cost of $450-$550, whether or not a guest stays the whole time. KOA rents any open spaces this week for $60 a night. She said the campground is “completely booked all the way” for Round-Up. The business has not felt pressure from free RV parking, even outside of Round-Up week. One or two people a month assert they can park for free at Wal-Mart, Groshen said, but KOA campers are a loyal lot. The Pendleton site also is just moments away from Interstate 84 and has full electrical hookups, wi-fi, showers and laundry, all part of the price. Groshen said the park even provides breakfasts on Saturdays from May though September. And during Round-Up, she said, there are breakfasts and dinners every day. The RV parks also purchase an annual city business license. The city’s basic fee is $100 for businesses inside city limits and $160 for those outside. Pendleton Police Chief Stuart Roberts said free parking lots do not require a license. “The way we handle the Round-Up business license issue is we start by generating a master list of all temporary business licenses, which has been amassed since May or so,” Roberts said in an email. “The code enforcement officer then inspects every license/location. Typically, she will find additional ‘pop-up’ vendors who are shut down until a license is obtained.” That process continues, he said, until city hall closes its doors Friday. After that, any new pop-ups police find face a choice: shut down or face a fine. The city also exempts civic and nonprofit groups from the business licenses fee. Those are the kinds of groups, such as Rocket RV, that often operate parking lots during Round-Up to raise funds. RV parking in Pendleton is no longer a Round-Up only event. Although just two years old, Pendleton Bike Week saw attendance jump in its second year, and plenty of campers were involved. “For Bike Week, we filled up,” Groshen said. “And I’ve already got people wanting to come to bike week next year.” Several cities in Oregon have banned overnight parking at Wal-Marts, including in Hood River, Portland and Salem. Local RV park operators, though, expressed ambivalence about such a move, even as Pendleton pushes to become a destination beyond the second full week of September.

Companies such as Walmart and Amazon manufacture next to nothing but sell hundreds of billions of dollars worth of merchandise. The macro trend — the transition from a manufacturing economy to a service-based high-tech economy — has been in place for decades. Millions of jobs that used to be done by people are now done by robots and several million jobs have been outsourced to other countries because of much cheaper labor costs. As labor costs rise overseas many of these jobs are starting to come back. The current government work-force is about 6.9 percent of the population. This is the lowest number in decades. Typically it is between 7 percent and 7.5 percent in the modern era. On the federal side of the equation, there were 5.3 million federal workers in 1962 and there are 4.1 million workers today. Keep in mind our population has grown from 180 million in 1962 people to more than 320 million people today. In terms of government workers not producing anything, I would argue a surgeon, plumber or architect who works for the government produces exactly the same thing as his private-sector counterpart. Gerry Hageman Las Vegas Preaching division If you read Zach Linly’s Sunday commentary, “White people just don’t get racism,” and mentally transpose “black” for “white” — and vice versa — you have a great draft for a white supremacist manifesto. His suggestion that “black people” should disengage with “white America” sounds like segregation to me. Rick Houle Las Vegas All for one I read with interest the Monday Review-Journal article, “City, county try to ease tensions.” While I appreciate the desires of the City Council and County Commission for a “kumbaya” agreement, nothing to date has produced any results. Meanwhile, we and other property owners in the northwest, who have been forcibly annexed into the city over the past few years, are paying property taxes 20 percent higher due to the annexations. For these additional taxes, we get nothing — no additional (or better) fire, police or utility services. When my husband and I attended an informational meeting prior to our property being annexed, we were told that there was nothing we could do about it, just grin and pay for it. When we asked what additional services we would receive for the additional taxes, the only thing the city officials could come up with was “you will get your streets cleaned.” That was false, given we live in a gated community with private streets. We do get to vote for mayor and our City Council representative, so we know where our votes are not going. Perhaps those of us who have either been annexed or are threatened with annexation should consider strongly the views of those running in the next elections and their positions on these forcible annexations. Phyllis Torrey Las Vegas Candidate projection Trying to walk back her “basket of deplorables” comment about Donald Trump supporters, Hillary Clinton talks about how the Trump campaign is based on “paranoia and prejudice.” Last month, Harry Reid commented that there aren’t enough uneducated white male voters to beat Hillary Clinton in Nevada. There is a psychological phenomenon known as “projection.” Paranoia? Hillary Clinton is the one who talks about “the vast right wing conspiracy.” Prejudice? It is obvious from Sen. Reid’s comments that he has a prejudice against white men, and Hillary Clinton’s prejudice is probably based on her husband’s marital and extra-marital conduct. Are the white males uneducated? In my case, educated enough to be at early voting on Oct. 22. Then, I can do my bit to send Hillary Clinton to the ash heap of history. Harry Reid is smart enough to go on his own. Richard C.

Its replacement will open at Viking Court, near Wyoming Boulevard across from Verda James Elementary School. “We are relocating the depot to city-owned property,” the city’s solid waste manager Cynthia Langston said in a news release. “Walmart has been very generous in allowing us to have our recycling depot located there until we could arrange for a permanent location,” Langston said. These are the other recycling depots in Casper: Wyoming Boulevard near the west entrance to the Central Wyoming Fairgrounds. Rocky Mountain Discount Sports. Paradise Valley pool. Meals on Wheels. North Casper soccer fields in the east parking lot along K Street. Huber Park. The Balefill. All depots have self-serve bins for cardboard, white paper, newspaper, magazines, number one and number two plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and glass, Langston said. “All these commodities, with the exception of glass, are taken to Wyoming Recycling and sold for recycling, while the glass is crushed and reused at the solid waste facility,” she said.

A Milpitas officer was patrolling the parking lot of the Walmart at 301 Ranch Drive around 3:40 a.m. Tuesday when he spotted a tan 2000 GMC Yukon. A check of the license plate number revealed it had been stolen Saturday in San Jose, according to police. Police said the occupant of the Yukon provided a false name, but officers eventually identified him as Cole Way Nicholes, who was on probation and wanted for auto theft in Alameda County. A search of the Yukon turned up mail that was possibly stolen in San Jose, according to police. Nicholes was arrested and booked at the Main Jail in San Jose for the warrant and a probation violation, as well as for auto theft, possession of a stolen vehicle, misappropriation of property, providing false identification and driving with a suspended license.

Thursday Sep 15, 2016 at 4:05 PM Sep 15, 2016 at 4:44 PM Greg Stiles Mail Tribune @GregMTBusiness TALENT — Craig Bramscher has a history of building fast things, such as sports cars and electric motorcycles. When it comes to his present lithium-ion battery development, however, the pace is slower — especially for capital investment. Brammo Inc. and Raymond Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota, of Greene, N.Y., announced a deal to advance battery technology for electric forklifts. Raymond-built forklifts, Bramscher said, are both unnoticed and ubiquitous. "Once I started looking around, I couldn't believe how many trucks had 'Raymond' on them," Bramscher said. "If you go in Walmart and see a red forklift running around, those are Raymond forklifts." Many of the forklifts operate in large warehouses, places that need the kind of power Brammo products have demonstrated in other arenas. "It's an ideal application of our technology," Bramscher said. "We're essentially replacing the lead acid batteries used in warehouses that are messy and relatively dangerous." Bramscher declined to spell out financial arrangements, but indicated it's a another step in the right direction. "This moves the company down the path toward profitability and allows us to become a bigger and better supplier to many other and new companies," Bramscher said. It's taken patience to get this far and will require more before Brammo can transition from a research-and-development start-up firm to manufacturer. Last April, Bramscher said the firm had $58 million worth of signed contracts and potential for far more, enabling company employment to surpass 100 in 2017. "It's always challenging to raise capital," he said. "But the demand has never been so well demonstrated. Everything is going to lithium or mobile energy storage — from laptops to trucks and buses." Bramscher has narrowed the field down to a half-dozen categories to pursue: motorcycles, snowblowers, lawnmowers, utility vehicles (such as a Polaris Ranger), quadricycles (similar to Smart cars, topping out at 40 mph), baggage handling vehicles, along with delivery trucks and buses. "We're perfectly suited to develop things with a lot of energy stuck in a small spot," he said. Bramscher said engineering and pilot production programs for customers continue in the spacious former Walmart building. Many customers are located east of the Mississippi River, which may require production in another state. "We definitely plan to ramp up production here," Bramscher said. "As soon as we get the working capital we need, we should be able to scale up quite nicely, and we may well need to do it on the East Coast, as well."

Nearly half of the $12 million raised to support the charter school question comes from the New York-based Families for Excellent Schools, according to an Associated Press review of records filed with the Office of Campaign and Political Finance. Other funders include independent former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and two Arizona-based heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune. There also are strong ties between the administration of Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, a long-time charter school supporter, and groups supporting the question. Baker's hand-picked chairman of the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, Paul Sagan, contributed $100,000 to a group pushing the question. James Peyser, chosen by Baker to serve as the state's secretary of education, formerly served as a trustee for Families for Excellent Schools. Peyser resigned on Jan. 5, 2015, about two weeks after then-Gov.-elect Baker announced his appointment. Baker has defended the Sagan donation, describing criticism of it as "a nothing-burger." He said the focus should on the 32,000 students on charter school waiting lists. "If other people want to make this all about the adults, that's fine," Baker said Monday. "We're going to focus on the kids." The ballot question is about letting Massachusetts add up to a dozen new or expanded charter schools each year outside of existing caps. The biggest source of funding comes from Families for Excellent Schools Advocacy Inc., which made nearly $5.8 million in direct contributions and another $301,020 in in-kind contributions. What's unclear from the campaign finance reports is where the group's funding comes from. In response to an email seeking more information, the group released a statement from its state director Keri Rodrigues Lorenzo, who described Families for Excellent Schools as a nonprofit organization that has operated in Massachusetts since 2014. "Our mission is to ensure that every child attends an excellent school by building coalitions of families and their allies and running campaigns that change education policy," the statement said. "We currently organize families across the commonwealth who are desperate for a better education in their communities." The group is a more familiar presence in New York. This year it filed a federal lawsuit arguing the state Department of Education failed to properly address violence in schools, depriving students of their right to a public education. On the pro-charter side, Bloomberg contributed $240,000; Jim Walton, the son of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, contributed $1.1 million; and Alice Walton, the daughter of Sam Walton, contributed $704,000. Other big contributors include Lynnfield-based Strong Economy for Growth Inc., which gave $650,000; John Douglas Arnold, a principal for Centaurus Advisors from Texas, at $250,000; Education Reform Now Advocacy, of New York, at $250,000; and Boston-based Expanding Educational Opportunities, at $250,000. Companies including EMC Corp., Partners Healthcare, The Kraft Group and Vertex Pharmaceuticals also are backing the ballot question and gave between $50,000 and $100,000. More than two dozen people who listed Fidelity Investments as their workplace contributed a total of nearly $60,000. The three biggest donors to the group Save Our Public Schools, which opposes the ballot question, are teachers' unions. The group has reported raising about $6.8 million. The Massachusetts Teachers Association contributed nearly $4.2 million. The Boston- and Washington-based American Federation of Teachers contributed more than $700,000. The Washington-based National Education Association contributed $1.9 million. The group said the $4.2 million from the Massachusetts Teachers Association comes from members' dues and includes no out-of-state sources.

LUCIE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE) 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ST. LUCIE COUNTY — Joseph Michael Schreiber, who is accused of setting a fire at a local mosque shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks anniversary, will remain in jail without bail, a county judge decided Thursday morning. The 32-year-old Port St. Lucie resident was arrested Wednesday and charged with arson and evidencing prejudice while committing offenses, which is the state’s hate crime enhancement. Schreiber is accused of starting the early Monday fire at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce. Judge Philip J. Yacucci Jr. denied bond Thursday morning, said county Clerk of the Circuit Court spokesman Joseph Abreu. A public defender was appointed to Schreiber temporarily. Schreiber, who was born in New York, has an extensive criminal history on the Treasure Coast, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Most of it occurred in St. Lucie County. According to the FDLE, he was arrested: April 15, 2003, by the Fort Pierce Police Department and charged with shoplifting and resisting an officer without violence. He was accused of taking CDs from the Walmart on Okeechobee Road in Fort Pierce, according to an arrest report. Schreiber pleaded no contest, was convicted of larceny and resisting arrest and given six months of probation.  April 25, 2003, by the St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office on a charge of misdemeanor battery related to domestic violence. His father, Arthur Schreiber, said his son punched him in the eye, which was swollen and red, according to an arrest report. His father, who refused to give a victim’s statement, said his son also had previously assaulted or battered him, according to the report. The younger Schreiber pleaded no contest and was found guilty, but he was released on his own recognizance, according to court documents. Oct. 10, 2003, by the Fort Pierce Police Department, on charges of shoplifting and trespassing. He pleaded not guilty but was convicted and sentenced to nine months in the St. Lucie County Jail. He was credited for 60 days, according to court documents. Oct. 20, 2003, by the St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office for a probation violation. Dec. 5, 2006, by the Port St. Lucie Police Department on charges of larceny and failing to stop and remain at a crash scene after causing injury. He pleaded no contest, and a finding of guilt was withheld by the court. He was ordered to serve a two-year term of probation. July 18, 2007, by the Martin County Sheriff’s Office and charged with larceny after he was accused of taking $480 worth of designer jewelry from the Macy’s department store in Jensen Beach, according to an arrest report. He entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty. He was ordered to prison for a year and a half and was given credit for 74 days in jail. Nov. 27, 2007, by the St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office on a charge of trespassing. He pleaded no contest and was found guilty. He was ordered to pay court fines and fees. Schreiber’s eighth arrest was April 29, 2010, by the Martin County Sheriff’s Office. He was charged with robbery with a weapon after he was accused of removing anti-theft sensor devices from shirts at the Macy’s in Jensen Beach, according to an arrest report. He also was accused of showing a knife to employees who chased him and then riding away on a 2006 Honda motorcycle registered to his father. His charge was reduced to larceny, to which he pleaded no contest and was convicted. He was ordered to serve five years in prison. He entered prison June 11, 2010, and was released Aug. 8, 2014. On Jan. 7 this year, a Fort Pierce woman filed a petition for injunction for protection against stalking, according to court documents. Schreiber was living with his father in the 5700 block of Northwest Zenith Drive when he was arrested. The older Schreiber also has a criminal record after he was arrested on May 3, 2009, on charges that included felonies of resisting an officer with violence and battery on an officer during a traffic stop, according to an arrest report. Officers also found two marijuana joints in his vehicle.

Two sources closely familiar with the negotiations, who were not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed the settlement had been agreed by both sides in principle but had not yet been formally signed. Officer Stephen Rankin shot Chapman dead in the parking lot of a Walmart superstore in the city in April last year during a confrontation over an alleged shoplifting. It was Rankin’s second deadly shooting of an unarmed man. Rankin, 36, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the shooting last month. He had been charged with murder. A jury recommended a sentence of 2.5 years in prison. Judge Johnny Morrison will formally sentence Rankin on 12 October. Rankin’s attorneys have said he will appeal against his conviction. Chapman’s mother, Sallie, and her attorney Jon Babineau declined to comment on the agreement. Babineau had been readying a lawsuit against Rankin, the city of Portsmouth and Ed Hargis, the city’s police chief at the time of the shooting. The lawsuit, on behalf of Chapman’s family, was expected to argue Hargis and city authorities should never have allowed Rankin to work as a police officer. Rankin was terminated from his job after being indicted for murder over the Chapman shooting. The Counted: people killed by police in the United States – interactive Read more In an article that first confirmed Rankin as the officer who killed Chapman, the Guardian disclosed in June last year that alarms were raised within the Portsmouth police department about Rankin’s conduct even before his first deadly shooting of an unarmed man. The Guardian published a series of articles about Chapman’s fatal shooting to coincide with the launch of the Counted, an investigation to document every death caused by police in the US. Earl Lewis, a cousin of Chapman who has acted as a family spokesman since the shooting, credited the articles with setting in motion the prosecution of Rankin. “It instantly changed things,” Lewis said following Rankin’s conviction. “Nobody was listening to what we had to say but your article gave Sallie a voice. If it wasn’t for the Guardian, we wouldn’t be here.” A grand jury previously declined to bring charges against Rankin for fatally shooting Kirill Denyakin, a hotel cook from Kazakhstan, in April 2011. Rankin shot Denyakin 11 times outside an apartment building in Portsmouth after a 911 caller reported that the 26-year-old was banging loudly on the front door. The officer alleged Denyakin charged at him and reached for his waistband.

Judge Lane has systematically ruined women‘s lives who have been before her in family court. Her patterns include changing case details by removing filings from the docket, forcing women to be pro se while the husband has counsel, forced women to be indigent, given custody to abusive husbands, incarcerated women with trumped up charges, ordered women to pay ex-husband‘s legal fees, allowed child abuse and spousal abuse, ordered women to pay atty fees of husband‘s mistresses, caused parental alienation, mothers have PTSD and other physical/emotional repercussions, she has left women homeless, left women without any transportation, forced women to be in family court for years, and much more. I filed an extensive JQC complaint against Judge Lane in 2013, while Jeff Davis was the director of the JQC. I proved that Judge Lane abused her discretion. On August 21, 2008, I filed a motion for a receiver to protect 2.5 million dollars. My case number is 2007CV133371. That motion no longer appears on the docket yet an answer to the motion appears plus a rule nisi. I have a stamp filed copy of the motion and provided the document to Mr. Davis. He did not investigate Judge Lane and actually responded to my complaint that I have the right to appeal! How does one appeal something that has disappeared? I have also met with Chairman Willard and provided the document plus evidence where my signature was forged on a temporary child support document. He told me to bring some evidence because he doesn‘t want a criminal on the bench. I provided boxes of evidence at the JQC study committee meeting on Sept 8. He refused to acknowledge me or review the evidence. I met with Rep. Beth Beskins who is my house representative. She is on the House Judicial Committee. She told me she can‘t do anything. She also told me I should write a book. Judge Lane should be indicted for criminal activity and investigated by the JQC. I won‘t stop until she is exposed for her corruption.

That “red state-blue state” division is a relatively modern TV creation By Joe Blevins@joe_a_blevins Sep 15, 2016 4:30 PM Screenshot: Why Red Means Republican Screenshot: Why Red Means Republican Share Tweet When director Kevin Smith called his 2011 horror film Red State, there was no ambiguity about what that title implied. After all, Americans had been conditioned by then to associate the color red with the Republican party and, more generally, with conservative political values. Walmart, NASCAR, Ray Stevens. These were red-state things. Blue, on the other hand, indicated the Democrats and liberalism. When the next presidential election rolls around in November, the major networks and cable news channels will predictably use those familiar red and blue maps to indicate which states have gone to Donald Trump and which for Hillary Clinton respectively. But this wasn’t always the case. Vox has created a useful and informative video about this troublesome topic entitled “Why Red Means Republican And Blue Means Democrat.” Not only is the red-blue divide a relatively recent innovation, it turns out, but the idea of using colored maps to forecast an election didn’t really start until the 1970s. In the 1960s and earlier, most TVs were black and white. There was no point in using colored maps. But by 1972, when Richard Nixon trounced George McGovern, the majority of Americans owned color sets. Back then, however, CBS used blue for the Republican states. It made sense at the time: Blue was the color of the Republican-led Union army during the Civil War, while red was associated with leftist politics. It was ABC that switched the colors during the 1984 election. Ronald Reagan was a Republican running for reelection that year, and his name started with the letter R… for red. The other networks eventually copied ABC so as to not confuse viewers who were hopping back and forth between channels on election night. So Republicans were now red and Democrats blue. But no one really cared about this until the incredibly close and bitterly contested 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Americans spent a lot of time looking at election maps that year, and the image of red and blue states became seared into their retinas. The video points out that talk-show host David Letterman might have been the first to make a joke about the colorful divide, jesting that Gore should govern the blue states and Bush the red. Political pundits and columnists seized on the terms “red state” and “blue state,” too, and today they’ve become part of political iconography. The change, however irksome, may be permanent.

Tim Ryan want Congress to require automakers to install alarms in cars to alert parents if children are unwittingly left there. (Charlie Riedel, Associated Press) Print Email Sabrina Eaton, cleveland.com By Sabrina Eaton, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 15, 2016 at 5:12 PM, updated September 15, 2016 at 5:22 PM comments WASHINGTON D.C. - To keep children from dying when their parents unwittingly leave them in hot cars, a group of lawmakers including Rep. Tim Ryan want the government to require automakers to install alarms to alert parents if unattended children are in their vehicles. The Niles Democrat joined several colleagues on Thursday to introduce a bill that would require the Department of Transportation to order that new vehicles include such devices within three years. Ryan noted that cars already alert drivers when they leave their keys in the car, their lights on, or their trunk open - none of which are life threatening. Baby found dead in car in Macedonia Walmart parking lot "My heart breaks when I think of the 37 children whose lives are cut short each year because they were trapped in a hot vehicle," said a statement from Ryan. "The unfortunate reality is that even good, loving parents can get distracted. Studies have shown that this can happen to anyone, anywhere." The legislation they've dubbed the "Helping Overcome Trauma for Children Alone in Rear Seats Act," or the HOT CARS Act of 2016, is backed by organizations including Consumers Union, the American Automobile Association and the Center for Auto Safety. In a statement, Janette Fennell, president and founder of KidsAndCars.org, said almost 800 children have died in hot cars since 1990. "Children will continue to die in hot cars unless something is done to help our overtaxed brains," said Fennell. "Education alone will not solve this problem. These unthinkable tragedies can only be prevented with technology. We certainly wish that we could train our memories to 'never forget,' but this is a very human condition we all live with." Police: Dayton-area boy, 3, found unresponsive in hot car dies Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers spokesman Wade Newton observed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently told Congress that "to date, technology has not been proven effective enough" to support such a requirement. He added that research shows "a technology-based solution" would only address about half these tragic incidents," because some of the accidents occur when children sneak into their parents cars and can't get out. He said public education programs like the highway administration's "Where's Baby" campaign are key, and adults should take the following steps to ensure children's safety around cars: Lock vehicles Keep keys away from children – just as a parent keeps medications and harmful cleaning supplies away from children Put a diaper bag in a vehicle's front seat to serve as a reminder of a child in the back seat Put a hand-held cellphone or PDA device in the back seat Call 911 to report children in unattended vehicles "Recent research shows this strategy is working, despite recent records for consecutive hot summer days throughout much of the country," said Newton.

(WAVY) — The City of Portsmouth has reached an agreement in principle with the family of William Chapman II, a source with the city told 10 On Your Side. The source said the city could pay the Chapman family $1 million. Exact details of the settlement are still being worked out. William Chapman (Photo courtesy Chapman’s family) Chapman was unarmed when he was fatally shot by former Portsmouth police officer Stephen Rankin in April 2015 in the parking lot of the Walmart on Frederick Boulevard. Reached over the phone Thursday, a Chapman family spokesperson told 10 On Your Side that the family is disappointed with the amount of $1 million and had sought $2.5 million. Family members feel that a higher sum would be more in line with police shooting payouts seen across the country. “It’s not about the money, it is about the principal,” said Earl Lewis, Jr. “No amount of money can bring back William Chapman.” In August, Rankin was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in Chapman’s death. Jurors recommended he be sentenced to two and a half years in prison. “The amount that I would say, according to my family, that we settled for, should have been much more than that, because we proved that this man did it,” Lewis said. Lewis said that the amount agreed upon right now could go up, but not down. He said he wants to see Walmart held accountable, too. “[Rankin] will be out with his family. William Chapman’s mother will never get the opportunity to ever see him again and sometimes you’ve got to look at life, a life was taken, a teenager, out of our community.” Rankin’s sentencing is set for October. His lawyers plan to appeal the conviction. Lewis said that the family will not have justice until Rankin is behind bars. FULL COVERAGE: Stephen Rankin Trial Jon Babineau, the attorney representing the Chapman family, told 10 On Your Side after Rankin’s conviction that the family was planning to sue the City of Portsmouth, former Police Chief Ed Hargas and former officer Stephen Rankin for negligent hiring, negligent retention and unreasonable use of force. The amount had not been decided at that time, but Babineau said it would be in the millions. WAVY News reached out to Babineau Thursday. He declined to comment. 10 On Your Side also reached out to Earl Lewis, the Chapman family spokesperson, but we have not yet heard back. Portsmouth Mayor Kenny Wright released a statement Thursday, which reads in full: I’m not at liberty to discuss a possible settlement, but would love to resolve this as soon as possible. This family has gone through enough!” 10 On Your Side spoke with taxpayers, who want justice for the Chapman family. “I definitely think that family deserves that money,” said Alan Moran. Another man agreed, but questioned whether it’s fair for citizens to pay for a police officer’s actions. “It’s just a sad story that somebody lost their lives… the cop was not doing what he was supposed to do, trained to do… and then the city gets the bill and the taxpayers have to pay.” Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

Then a judge demanded an overhaul of the education system — and the playbook didn’t have a response. The judge’s demand came last week in the form of a ruling in a case called Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding (CCJEF) v. Rell. The judge, Thomas Moukawsher, called for sweeping changes in how the state doles out education aid, sets graduation standards, evaluates teachers, funds special ed. He reacted in outrage over this year’s transfer of $5 million education aid by the legislature from poor cities like Bridgeport and New Haven to wealthier towns like Hamden during a last-minute backroom deal to gain support for an overall compromise on changes to the two-year state budget. Elliott happens to be running for state representative in Hamden. He’s looking to succeed the retiring House speaker, Brendan Sharkey, who arranged that transfer that outraged the judge ... and sent Hamden an infusion of new schools money. That puts Elliott in a challenging spot as he pursues his general election campaign for Hamden’s 88th General Assembly seat. How does a Sanders progressive craft a response? (The state attorney general Thursday appealed the judge’s ruling, a day after the legislature’s leading Republicans called for him to do so.) Elliott, a first-time candidate (who manages his mom’s Thyme & Season natural foods store in Hamden and owns Shelton’s Common Bond Market), defeated the establishment candidate, Hamden’s Town Council president, last month in a Democratic primary for the seat. He now faces Republican Marjorie Bonadies in the Nov. 8 general election. Elliott won the primary with the help of a swarm of volunteers who, like him, threw themselves into volunteering for socialist Bernie Sanders in this year’s Democratic presidential primaries. They sought to carry that spirit into a local race. Elliott ran on Sanders-like positions such as upping taxes on the wealthy, raising the hourly minimum wage to $15, and passing a law to charge big employers like Walmart for Medicaid, food stamps, or other state help provided to their low-wage workers. Knocking on some doors in town as many as seven times in the primary campaign, Elliott also heard a lot about local issues, and offered responses that fit into his broader social-justice outlook: How the state should address high property taxes in town like Hamden by relying less on the property taxes, more on progressive income taxes (plus by legalizing marijuana and reinstituting highway tolls). How Hamden should be able to collect taxes from its largest problem corporation, Quinnipiac University. But Judge Moukawsher’s decision in some ways pits social justice against Elliott’s constituents’ self-interest: The need to send more state schools aid to cities rather than suburban towns, versus Hamden’s already difficult quest to pay for its own schools amid high taxes and inherited high pension costs. Or does it? In an interview Thursday on WNHH radio’s “Dateline New Haven,” Elliott said he indeed struggles with how to respond to the decision. Then he did respond. With nuance. Regionalism Beckons   An edited transcript of that portion of the conversation follows: WNHH: What was your take on this? Elliott:I know Hamden has demographically changed significantly over the past 10, 15 years. It’s become harder and harder for us to maintain the quality of education. I do think we need more money to come into our education spending. I know that’s getting short shrift. … The guy you’re trying to replace, Brendan Sharkey, did a move to get suburban support for the budget [compromise vote this spring] in return for taking money away from poor cities for schools and giving it to the towns. And Hamden made out. Are you going to tell your voters, “We should sacrifice money from our school system so people in New Haven and Bridgeport can get more”? That is one of the difficulties. On the one hand you have the constituency you serve. On the other hand are ideals for what makes sense for the system. So generally I would say it makes more sense for towns that have more money, are more affluent, to be helping out the cities that do not have that money. To have that equalization. There’s the argument that if you grow up in a family that’s higher up on the economic totem pole, you have built-in advantages. It doesn’t make sense to have more funds diverted to your town. Of course, those people also have access to private schools that they can afford. … But when you live in a town like Hamden, which is probably a little over that average … when we already have the fourth-highest mill rate, people are leaving our town to go to North Haven because the lower mill rate. I talked to a couple of families in Spring Glen one day, in what seemed back to back to back one day. They are leaving because they are saving a few thousand dollars on their property tax bill. It becomes a race to the bottom. It squeezes towns like us where we have limited ways to raise funds for our own education. It does put us in this trap, where I do have this idealistic vision of making those wealthiest towns pay. I wouldn’t say we’re a wealthier town. But we’re certainly going to do be doing better than Bridgeport. It puts us in a bind that we’re already having a tough time raising funds. There is one thing I do agree with Brendan Sharkey on: the idea of regionalization. If we can combine forces, we can make our school system a little more efficient. Does that mean you would have a regional board of ed? Correct. Some of your constituents are going to be really mad. Absolutely. They’’ll say,  “We don’t want New Haven telling us” [how to spend money] …. To me it’s about having a more efficient system that can triage. Who would be in your combined district? Hamden, North Haven, New Haven, East Haven, West Haven … would that be one combined district? I can’t say yes or no. I actually don’t know what the district would look like. The judge did not say you [the state] can’t spend more on schools … He said how you fix it is up to you. … What about spending more money overall on schools? Rather than taking money away from Hamden, you just send more to New Haven? I don’t know my response to that. I guess I thought that was going to be your response. The problem is, even if I believe in that … Each town has to make its own decisions as to paying its municipal workers. So Hamden has a pension problem. This is going to be a common occurrence among lots of towns. We have a lot of expenses going forward that cut into our overall budget. bBecause of that we have to raise those property taxes to cover education, which I think is about a third of our budget, approximately. So what’s going to happen is, if everybody was on a blank slate: I would say, definitely, let’s divert money to towns that need it. I still on a moral sense believe that. But that’s also a reason why I think we need a regional-based system. … I do want say again on a moralistic level, yes, I believe that wealthier towns should be paying more into towns like New Haven. But at the same time, Hamden has a specific difficulty. If we do [take money away], our education system in Hamden is going to get crippled very, very quickly. Under regionalism, in the end would Hamden get more? It might end up being net neutral. It would save us down the line and make sure that we are having funds diverted in a way that is more meritocratic. Are the conservatives and part of the judge’s decision right that we don’t need to spend more money on education overall? [Or] why not spend more money on education in the state and not have inner-ring suburbs get cut? … Is regionalization the answer? Or are we kicking the can down the road — when we have to tax the rich more and change that whole conversation? I don’t think it’s either/or. It’s a combination of a lot of factors. If you bring in some money through the legalization of marijuana, [through reinstituting] tolls, you pass that Wal-Mart bill that will bring in a few hundred million dollars … Cities that are in more need should be getting a higher percentage. I don’t think the answer is just taking from towns. I think there are enough other avenues to get revenue to fund [the state Educational Cost Sharing system]. There is that push-pull, where each town has its own specific problem Click on or download the above sound file to hear the full interview with Elliott and campaign manager Sarah Ganong on WNHH radio’s “Dateline New Haven.” Today’s program was made possible thanks in part to support from Yale-New Haven Hospital.

We’ll never integrate schools in this state when we have to depend on the workarounds of limited open choice and a handful of magnets.  If only we could achieve the equity and economy of scale allowed by a county-wide district or at least merging into a Greater New Haven district!

Yes, your “Achievement First” schools are excellent at hyper-segregating our students by race. http://ctmirror.org/2014/04/09/school-choice-many-schools-hyper-segregated/ You may not attack our successful public schools from your publically-funded, privately-run, nontransparent charter school franchise.  Your recent privileged position as the CT “School Turnaround” Director should also cause you to exercise restraint in your criticism of one of our most essential public institutions. http://jonathanpelto.com/2013/08/20/malloypryors-new-turnaround-director-violated-connecticut-law-by-failing-to-get-proper-teacher-certification/ The students at your high school WALKED OUT last spring in protest of the harsh disciplinary policies your New Haven “Amistad High” imposes on your Black Bridgeport and New Haven youth.  I suggest you spend your time and energy working on fixing your house rather than attacking ours. posted by: Renewhavener on September 15, 2016  9:21pm Have maintained here that Regionalism is merely Socialism from the bottom up.  A flood in lieu of a tidal wave.  It erodes away any incentive to set real priorities, to work hard to balance trade offs or to expect more from individuals. Hamden is in a jam because of decades of mismanagement and dysfunction.  Expecting it to suddenly gain access to other town’s resources and cure its issues is a totally misguided belief.  As is sending in Mr. Elliot to attempt to rescue them from economic issues of this magnitude.  They have $163MM in their pension fund.  Sadly, $125MM of which was borrowed last year and will have to be paid off for a generation.  Oh, and was it mentioned that even at this higher level the fund is barrel at 1/3?  Perhaps it will take a whole three generations of austerity to work off these last three decades of indulgence?  And you thought Greece had it bad: http://www.hamden.com/filestorage/7089/7093/7091/7109/HamdenValuation2015.pdf Growing up in NH, recall being occasionally jealous the way kids are of Hamden and all the gifts they seemed to have.  No longer.  We have our issues, but nothing like what passes for the post great recessionary new normal for these neighbors to the Northwest.  Now I consider how much we ALL owe in unfunded state liability pilled on top of their local shortfall and frankly, I pity them. Separately, my complements to NHI for not referring to this elected office as “Brendan Sharkey’s seat”.  The seat belongs to the citizens of the 88th district.  Both the NHR and CTPost erred in this way, and it should be insulting to anyone who values voting as the most important franchise granted to a citizen of the United States of America: http://www.nhregister.com/government-and-politics/20160809/elliott-bests-pascarella-in-democratic-primary-to-run-for-sharkeys-house-seat http://www.ctpostchronicle.com/ar posted by: Morgan Barth on September 15, 2016  9:58pm Gosh, Chris Willems. I didn’t mean any offense.  I thought regionalism might even be something we could agree on - since it could help share resources and help integrate more schools. (And yes I did mean integrating in my post; thanks for catching the typo.)  I think you teach at an inter-district magnet school—which is somewhat of a regional creation.  By the way, I have nothing but respect for you as a teacher…and did not mean in this post or any others to attack your school or district or any of its hard-working staff or students.  I do wish we could disagree in a more civil manner, Chris.

Open your doors to students from all backgrounds and abilities if you want to stand up for regionalism. posted by: robn on September 16, 2016  7:21am CT has a spending problem, not an income problem. Retirement benefits for the privileged class of state and municipal employees are off the charts out of line with the rest of society and its unsustainable. posted by: OhHum on September 16, 2016  11:09am You’ll need to look in the right direction for regional districts. Woodbridge, Orange, and Bethany are 1,2,3, in per capita income in New Haven County. How are their schools doing? Or are you just looking for the low hanging fruit? posted by: Bradley on September 16, 2016  11:21am I staffed the Education Committee of the legislature when the original ECS formula was developed. While the product of political compromise, the formula did make substantial progress in equalizing educational funding. But over the years, political necessity has resulted in the situation we have today. Unfortunately, political necessity is not going to disappear. Regionalism could help, but a region centered on New Haven will still have fewer resources and greater needs than a region centered on Stamford. posted by: Dwightstreeter on September 16, 2016  11:46am The playbook may not have a response, but this smart and articulate candidate did! Regionalism of government will be required because we cannot support all these expensive and duplicative fiefdoms. It will take new officials to break down the inertia and special interests and reform the system. Just a few hundred more people should do it. posted by: tmctague on September 17, 2016  6:04am Also, is this candidate really unique?  He’s a White male business (albeit a hippy food store).  Hopefully he plans to listen to families and educators before any talk of regionalism. posted by: Brutus2011 on September 17, 2016  12:25pm I think regionalism as talked about here is a bad idea. In my view, for education to be as effective as we all seem to define and want, folks in each community must impute the value of learning to their youth; individual families and the community as a whole. I actually do not want folks who are not part of my/our community to come in and tell me/us what is best for our kids. Of course, other input and new viewpoints are welcome but this business of trying to save us poor folks only perpetuates a victim mentality. There are enough community members here to effect real and positive change in our kid’s overall learning trajectories if we band together and put our kids first. Of course, that is the real issue ... unity and purpose. So far, we have not done very well. Time to man/woman up and take care of our kids and stop looking to others to do it for us. posted by: 1644 on September 17, 2016  4:09pm There is not “trap”, but a choice.  Elliot can represent the impoverished folks of New Haven, and advocate for them, or he can represent and advocate for the people of Hamden.  While Hamden may, in some ways, be better off than New Haven, in other ways it is worse off.  Hamden, like Branford and West Hartford,  has seen a great increase in expensive to educate ESL/ELL students since the ECS formula was created, a formula that does not include a variable for ELLs.  Much of Hamden along Dixwell is decaying and blighted.  I don’t read of developers anxious to build in Hamden the way they have been in downtown New Haven. posted by: fearless on September 19, 2016  8:22am Tmctague.  A hippy store?  Do you mean a hippie store?  He owns a business. A hippie store makes a difference?  Not a legit business?  It’s comments like this that reinforces teacher bashing from the overall community.  Why is your denigration of his business even a part of this conversation? posted by: 1644 on September 19, 2016  9:34am Fearless: Perhaps the food is fattening?  After all, women are hippy, people are hippies. (Corollary to pictures are hung, people are hanged.)  :) posted by: fearless on September 19, 2016  9:48am ???? another relevant comment to the story line posted by: Renewhavener on September 19, 2016  11:45am Ignoring the strange turn this thread has taken, and jumping back to the matter at hand… @Dwightstreeter, “The playbook may not have a response, but this smart and articulate candidate did! Regionalism of government will be required because we cannot support all these expensive and duplicative fiefdoms. It will take new officials to break down the inertia and special interests and reform the system. Just a few hundred more people should do it.” First off this candidate’s “success” is a natural reaction to the post great-recessionary political economy and a rejection of status quo left leadership in a town saturated with mismanagement.  He has yet to articulate anything, let alone do that which he is ultimately able to articulate. In terms of Regionalism, again I ask where does it all end?  There are no edges to this proposal.  By your rationale, are we not all better off if all the states of New England joined forces?  Politically and economically would we not be better off?  We could pool our electoral votes and have 29.  The same as New York and Florida.  Tied for third only behind California and Texas.  At that point why not just lock arms with New York and have the most? The unresolved question is: where does it end? posted by: 1644 on September 19, 2016  12:04pm Renew:  You realize that one New England state would have 10 fewer senators and electoral votes than we have as six separate states?  There is a move in California to break the state into five in part to increase senate representation. posted by: Dwightstreeter on September 19, 2016  12:26pm @Renewhavener: Where it ends is not the issue for regional government, but when does it start. Mass. has County forms of government and it seems to work satisfactorily. No doubt there are many more to be found if you search. posted by: tmctague on September 19, 2016  2:00pm Fearless, I was merely taking a shot at this guy’s business, many would describe me as a bit of a hippie so it wasn’t too serious.  I still don’t think he’s qualified to talk about regionalism, but I don’t know how that could lead to teacher bashing. posted by: fearless on September 19, 2016  8:08pm Public servants bashing business owners not a smart move Some think public servants just live off the taxpayer and dont work hard and get too much money pensions etc   I get what you did I still don’t know why posted by: Renewhavener on September 19, 2016  8:29pm @1644, “Renew:  You realize that one New England state would have 10 fewer senators and electoral votes than we have as six separate states?” Thanks.  Got me.  The point on regionalism lacking edges remains even if my train of logic left some passengers at the station. @Dwtstr, “Where it ends is not the issue for regional government, but when does it start.” With any luck at some point after those in a so called leadership positions begin to understand and set limits.  Regionalist I have spoken with are quick to see ways to put other communities’ resources to use, but have little grey matter to spare for making the resources they have go further.  This is how Hamden and other communities have found themselves in the spot they are in.  Doubt a continued diet of the same, while only eating more from someone else’s table, is going to change their results.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Police in Fairfield, Cali. are searching for a suspect after a disabled man was assaulted during a confrontation over an accessible parking spot. Witnesses told police that on Sept. 14 they saw the suspect and the 64-year-old victim get into an altercation over a parking lot spot outside of a local Walmart. It’s believed the suspect and the woman he was with parked in the spot the victim needed, so he confronted them. Story continues below “He was yelling to the lady, ‘I’m handicapped. This is for handicapped people,’” witness Susan Fowler told KCRA News. “And the lady was just irate and she was cursing at him and screaming, ‘I don’t give a “f” what you are.’” That’s when things turned physical. “[The suspect]…got the guy out of the car and slammed him on the ground,” Chris Bennett, another witness, told KCRA. “I was able to get between them.” The victim was allegedly also put into a chokehold and punched. It’s not known what injuries the 64-year-old sustained, if any. Fowler said she began recording the incident after the victim was pushed to ground. “Justice needs to be served,” said Fowler. Witnesses said they didn’t see a permit for accessible parking in the suspects’ car. When police ran the suspect’s licence plate, the vehicle turned out to belong to someone else. Police said the suspect will most likely face battery charges. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

And that may be the case again if Walmart’s newest idea lives up to its potential. Last week, America’s biggest private employer patented a robotic device that would change the way Americans shop for groceries. Essentially, the device is a hands-free shopping cart that also retrieves containers and abandoned items, and it returns itself to the cart corral. According to CBS News, the “robot revolution” is expected to take 5 million jobs away from human in the next five years. “In the modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer. Customers often require assistance that employees of the store are not always able to provide,” the patent said. “Additionally, due to high employee turnover rates, available employees may not be fully trained or have access to information to adequately support customers. Other routine tasks also are difficult to keep up with, particularly during peak hours.” At this point in time, Walmart has not specifically announced when and where it will be introducing these new robotic devices.

By Kelsey D. Atherton posted Sep 15th, 2016 at 12:55pm United States Patent And Trademark Office Cart On A Roomba Is putting carts on robots enough to save retail in physical stores? Maybe. A shopping cart is mostly empty space. At the end of a shopping run, when the cart is brimming with groceries and goods, it becomes fully useful, but it isn’t until that point, and once it’s full, it doesn’t help the person trying to buy two cartfulls of stuff on their own. Walmart, the physical retail giant, doesn’t want people to worry about the inadequacies of carts while shopping. So they filed a patent for a self-driving robot cart. The patent, filed in March of 2016 and published last week, describes the needs of the shoppers and the stores: [A]vailable employees may not be fully trained or have access to information to adequately support customers. Other routine tasks also are difficult to keep up with, particularly during peak hours. For example, shopping carts are left abandoned, aisles become messy, inventory is not displayed in the proper locations or is not even placed on the sales floor, shelf prices may not be properly set, and theft is hard to discourage. So the robot is a hedge against employee turnover, an efficiency tool, and an explicit protection against customers shopping online. It works, essentially, by putting a Roomba-like robot under the cart, which then drives it about as directed by the shopper. The cart-Roomba is the most obvious physical change needed for this system, but there are others. Some ideas proposed include a separate system of chutes and tracks for the Roomba-like bots, so they can travel around the store as needed to pick up carts or locate other products. The entire system is, in turn, placed in a sensor-rich world, where central computers track inventory and match customer needs to what’s available in the store for the shopper. It is as though every search function when buying something online at, say, Amazon, is instead done in real time by robots and computers while the customer is at the store. The selection is limited by the physical bounds of the space, so there aren’t as many choices as shopping the entire world online. Instead, if this Walmart patent becomes standard retail technology, customers choosing to buy stuff in person get the immediacy of the purchase, facilitated by a visible robot-cart army. That might just be a good enough trade-off for a more limited selection. Or at least, it will be until the novelty wears off.

He is considered a person of interest at this time. RUSSELLVILLE – A $5,000 reward is being offered in an effort to try and find out who is responsible for the burglary of a Russellville pawn shop and theft of a large number of guns. According to information from Michael Knight of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the burglary took place during the early morning hours of Sept. 3 at Mike’s Pawn II. Russellville Police Chief Chris Hargett said the business is located on U.S. 43 just past Wal-Mart, near Akins Funeral Home. Authorities said around 60 guns were taken during the burglary. “After they took the guns, the building was set on fire,” said investigator Sgt. Jake Tompkins. "We don't have any suspects at this time, but we do have a person of interest who we are wanting to talk with." Knight said ATF is offering a reward of up to $2,500, which will be matched by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, for a total reward of up to $5,000. Anyone with information about the burglary and arson is asked to contact the ATF at 800-ATF-GUNS (1-800-283-4867), the Russellville Police Department at 256-332-2230, or Shoals Crime Stoppers at 256-386-8685.

The weak numbers could give the Federal Reserve further reason to hold off on raising interest rates when it meets next week. "All the data seem to say the same thing: Not much is happening in the economy," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "We have no inflation, not a lot of consumer spending, not much production ... The data don't demand that the Fed do anything right now." The Fed reported Thursday that factory production fell 0.4 percent last month. Overall industrial production — which combines manufacturing, mines and utilities — dropped by an identical amount.

The Commerce Department releases retail sales data for August on Thursday, Sept. 15, 2016. (AP Photo/Danny Johnston, File) A second report Thursday suggested that the factory weakness may be extending into September. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that manufacturing in New York shrank in September for a second straight month. New orders and shipments fell sharply. Earlier this month, a survey by the Institute for Supply Management showed that U.S. manufacturing contracted in August for the first time since February. Still, the Philadelphia Fed reported Thursday that its manufacturing gauge climbed in September for a second straight month, suggesting greater factory output in the mid-Atlantic region. In reporting its closely watched measure of retail spending, the Commerce Department said that retail sales fell in August for the first time in five months. Consumers spent less on building materials, furniture and cars. Americans did spend more at clothing retailers, restaurants and bars. "They were buying T shirts and eating out — and that was about it," Naroff said. Noting the slide in retail sales, Barclays Research downgraded its forecast for U.S. economic growth from July through September to an annual rate of 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent earlier. "The report was soft across the board," Barclays economists said in a research report. The Fed will meet Tuesday and Wednesday, after which it will announce whether it will resume raising interest rates. In December, it raised its benchmark short-term rate from a record low, where it had been since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, but hasn't increased it since then. In recent days, some Fed policymakers have said a rate hike should be considered next week. But given recent lackluster economic reports, investors peg the chances of a September rate hike at just 12 percent, according to figures from the CME Group. They foresee a 51 percent chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting. One reason the Fed might hold off: Inflation remains excessively low. The Labor Department reported Thursday that producer prices were unchanged in August. Core wholesale inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose just 0.1 percent in August and 1 percent over the past year. Overall, inflation is running well below the Fed's 2 percent annual target. American economic growth has been sluggish since late last year, slowed by worldwide economic weakness and a strong dollar, which has made U.S. goods pricier overseas. At the same time, the U.S. job market remains solid. Employers have added 204,000 jobs a month over the past year, though hiring dipped to 151,000 in August. The Labor Department said Thursday that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits came in under 300,000 for the 80th straight week — the longest such streak since 1970. Healthy hiring and sluggish growth can be a worrisome combination suggesting that companies need more workers to generate the same amount of product. In fact, American workers' productivity — output per hour of work — has fallen for three straight quarters for the first time since 1979. ___ AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report.

More Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, Sept. 9, but jobless claims remained at levels consistent with a healthy labor market.

(Photo: Tim Adkins/THE TIMES) NASHVILLE — Dollar General plans to hire 10,000 new workers within the next month to support the company's expansion plans. The Tennessee-based discount retailer — which has planned to open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and another 1,000 stores in fiscal 2017 — announced Thursday that it will host hiring events at 600 locations through Sept. 24 where interested applicants can meet with Dollar General managers. A list of events is available at www.dollargeneral.com/grow. The company is looking to fill full-time and part-time positions including store managers, assistant store managers, lead sales associates and store associates. All candidates must also apply online at www.dollargeneral.com/careers. "Dollar General remains focused on our strategy to invest in our employees as a competitive advantage," CEO Todd Vasos said in a statement. "We look forward to providing new employees opportunities to gain new skills, develop their talents and grow their careers through our mission of Serving Others." Dollar General operated 13,000 stores as of Aug. 13. The company’s expansion plans include 6% to 8% square footage growth per year. In 2015, Dollar General opened 730 new stores, remodeled or relocated 881 stores and closed 36. THE TENNESSEAN Dollar General buys 41 former Wal-Mart stores In July, Dollar General announced plans to relocate 40 stores and enter one new market after the company finalized a deal to purchase 41 former Walmart Express locations. At the time, Dollar General said the newly relocated stores would feature a “fresh DG16 layout,” including additional sales floor square footage and expanded offerings such as fresh meat and produce. The company also planned to operate fueling stations in 37 of the 41 locations. The deal included former Walmart stores in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Dollar General’s annual sales grew from $18.9 billion in 2014 to $20.4 billion in 2015. The company's expansion plans come a year after Dollar General failed in its attempt to acquire rival Family Dollar for $9.1 billion after a nearly yearlong takeover battle. Family Dollar shareholders instead approved an $8.5 billion deal with Dollar Tree. Dollar General and Family Dollar sell items across a range of price points, while Dollar Tree prices items at $1 or less.

Advertise Contact Us Subscribe Home News Opinion Living Events Talent Food & Fitness Kick Off National Child Passenger Safety Week By Press Release September 15, 2016 0 For a celebratory kick-off to National Child Passenger Safety Week, Mercy Medical Center Redding will be teaming up with the California Highway Patrol to offer a free car seat checkup event. Qualified staff will inspect car seats to ensure that each child seat is properly installed in the vehicle and that the seat adequately fits the child. The free event will be held Saturday, September 17th from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the Wal-Mart parking lot located at 1515 Dana Drive in Redding. There will also be free car seats available for those who qualify. National Child Passenger Safety Week runs from September 18 through September 24, and this event is being offered in partnership with Mercy Medical Center Redding, the CHP, and Shasta County Public Health. According to local law enforcement, up to 3 out of 4 car seats are currently being used incorrectly. Car crashes are the leading death for children ages 1 through 13, and many of these deaths could be prevented through the proper use of car seats, booster seats, and seat belts. According to Amber Bey, with Mercy Medical Center Redding’s Trauma Injury Prevention Program, “Getting safety and car seat information and instructions to both parents and caretakers is crucial to saving young lives. They are the first line of defense in ensuring our most valued passengers.” Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also shows that among children 4 to 8 years old, evidence proves reduced injury and risk when a child is restrained in a child safety seat instead of a lap belt alone. In California, all passengers 8 years old and younger must use a child safety seat or booster, and they must ride in the back seat of the car when safe to do so. If a child is 8 years old and older and over 4’9” tall or taller, they may wear a seatbelt; however, children 8 years old and younger that are less than 4’9” tall must still use a child safety seat. Effective January 1, 2017, children under 2 years old must use a rear-facing child safety seat, unless they weigh at least 40 pounds or are 40 inches or taller. The free car seat check-up event will be held Saturday, September 17th from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the Wal-Mart parking lot located at 1515 Dana Drive in Redding. The program is made possible by the generous support from donors to Mercy Foundation North. -from press release Comment Policy: We welcome your comments, with some caveats: Please keep your comments positive and civilized.

The shoe industry descended on Capitol Hill on Sept. 14 to make a renewed case for passing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The industry organization Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America organized the day of meetings with Congressional leaders in Washington, D.C., to argue in favor of the hotly debated trade bill, and also to gauge where support lies. According to the FDRA, around two dozen representatives were on hand from brands that included Nike, Adidas and Wolverine World Wide, along with reps from such retailers as Rack Room Shoes, Payless ShoeSource and Walmart. Related New Balance Issues Statement in Response to Pro-Trump Fallout FDRA president Matt Priest said it was crucial for the industry to continue to take an active and leading role in the TPP debate, especially given the rhetoric in the presidential campaign. On Sept. 14, there were dual protests and hearings on the Hill led by opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders and supporter (and lead negotiator) Ambassador Michael Froman from the office of the United States Trade Representative. While many in Congress are expected to ultimately support the deal, members are remaining tight-lipped about their support, hoping to not sway voters one way or the other due to the unpopularity of the deal thanks to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  Congressional leaders and TPP supporters are aiming to pass the deal during the lame-duck session after the November general election, when members know whether they are staying or exiting in the next term. The 12-nation trade deal was finalized last October, but it has become a lightning rod for the presidential candidates, who have used the deal as an example of earlier trade deals that moved U.S. jobs offshore and to bolster protectionist platforms. Priest said while the industry has been pressing the benefits of the deal, it’s also highlighting the major challenges the agreement faces should Congress choose not to act this year. He said while the Senate looks like it will stay in Republican control, there is still enough time before Nov. 8 for things to shift. With members in the House retiring and several supporters in at-risk districts in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio, it’s going to be a rush to the finish line in November. “I don’t think the urgency is there quite yet, but that will change as we head to the lame-duck [period],” said Priest. “The benefits for us haven’t changed, but the political dynamic has. Our forecast is pretty negative if [N.Y.] Sen. [Chuck] Schumer takes over the Senate. We’re pretty frank that after December, we don’t see a clear path forward. And if we punt it, it is three to five years.” Insiders say that the most likely scenario for passage is if Clinton wins the presidency, but even then there is no guarantee. Priest also alluded to the fact that Congressional insiders were still stuck on the biologics and pharmaceutical provisions of the deal. The hangup was stymieing the process, though industry leaders were seen on the Hill this week to negotiate changes. Priest also said there was a lot of concern from Congress and from TPP leaders that a failure of the deal would hurt the U.S. reputation globally and also feed right into China and Russia’s power-seeking narrative.  The next steps for the industry, said Priest, were that many companies would be enlisting employees to support the deal, which would cut tariffs by half a billion dollars in the first year alone, and focus on the letter-writing campaign. “This becomes a credibility issue for the U.S. — and the whole world is watching,” he said.   — Sign up for the FN Newsletter — Business, Uncategorized, North America, FDRA, Matt Priest, TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership Share This Article Email Tumblr WhatsApp LinkedIn Post navigation ← Here’s a Closer Look at the Yeezy Season 4 Shoes Shoe Sales Down in August Despite Back-to-School Shopping & Tax-Free Days → Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Target Isn’t Going To Have Full-Service Grocery Stores, Still Wants To Sell More Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Target Isn’t Going To Have Full-Service Grocery Stores, Still Wants To Sell More Image courtesy of Nicholas Eckhart September 15, 2016 12:00 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup no more supertargets grocery stores grocery shopping grocery sections brian cornell Target CEO Brian Cornell has a message for you if you’ve tried to buy groceries at the discount chain in the past and found the selection or products disappointing: things are better now, and you should give the section another chance soon. Unless you want sushi or rotisserie chickens. Then you should go somewhere else. Grocery sales are about 20% of Target’s business: not a lot, but enough that spiffing up that department could help the company’s disappointing sales results. Yet it isn’t going to give over the amount of floor space that competitor Walmart does, or install deli counters: the department has some fresh fruit and dairy, but stay convenience-oriented. Cornell, who knows the food business because he used to be an executive at PepsiCo and at Safeway, has focused on the grocery sections at Target as a possible source of more sales, and as a department that really needs to improve. “We’ve got to get our guests, while they’re shopping our stores, to walk down that aisle that, perhaps two or three years ago, they stopped shopping, because we didn’t have the selection and the assortment they were looking for,” he told journalists on Wednesday during the company’s annual meeting. At the same event, he also outlined the chain’s plans to build more mini-stores, some of which emphasize fresh foods depending on the market.

I have abstained from it for weeks with the help of a steady intake of strong tea. I have dressed it up with foamed milk, beaten cream, and thick drizzles of caramel; I have dressed it down to draw near to its scalding essence. I have drunk it spiced with pepper, made succulent with butter, and soured with chicory root. I have a cousin who powdered his family’s fishbowl with instant brew because their fish “had a headache.” Like that manic fish, I have grimaced through many headaches of my own. Among non-alcoholic drinks, only water has a greater claim to ubiquity than coffee. The National Coffee Association USA claims, “After crude oil, coffee is the most sought commodity in the world.” Americans import their beans, raw or pre-roasted, from nations all over the earth, and prepare drinks from those beans using all manner of devices: from humble coffee pots to systems festooned with dials and knobs, capable of manufacturing multiple atmospheres of pressure in order for the home brewer to pull a café-quality espresso. The gilded pipes and fittings of this $2,495 apparatus evoke an age of steam power and glass arcades. Ostensibly a tool for keeping one’s focus sharp in the present, coffee is at the center of a culture that inclines backwards and forwards at once. Its aroma can evoke 19th-century marble-topped café tables and chamber music—at the same time, the caffeine acclimates the brain to the endless interfaces of the Internet. That aroma is discernible in the air this morning, wafting out of the door being held open for me as I enter my Toronto church. Of course there will be coffee here: I can imagine few better accouterments for ancient-future faith than this drink of coincidental historicity and futurity. If Jesus Were a Coffee Guy “The age of crappy church coffee is at an end!” my associate pastor tells me when I ask him about what we’re drinking. He sees the church’s refreshments table as a gesture of goodwill towards its guests. “I’d much rather we spend money on hospitality, if we can.” Travelers from the West initially associated coffee with Islam, which caused some suspicion and confusion in the early days of European exposure to the new drink. Grace Toronto Church’s primary demographic is young urban professionals; to cater to them, it is necessary to provide something on the order of café quality drinks. On the fixings table, squat steel carafes contain boxes of 2% milk as well as “5% Milk (Light Cream!).” During the summer, the church even sets out great brown containers of cold brew. According to Tom Standage’s A History of the World in 6 Glasses, coffee’s potable origins can be traced back to the 15th century, in the Yemeni region of the Arabian Peninsula. Purportedly, a scholar and Sufi mystic named Muhammad al-Dhabhani was the first to try boiling the berries his compatriots chewed for stimulation, and the resulting drink was adopted by many Sufis for use in late-night religious ceremonies. By 1510, people were drinking coffee in Mecca and Cairo; soon after, the practice spread throughout the Arab world. Travelers from the West initially associated coffee with Islam, which caused some suspicion and confusion in the early days of European exposure to the new drink. This potential barrier to widespread Western adoption was dismantled in 1605, when, as Standage writes, “Pope Clement VIII was asked to state the Catholic church’s position on coffee.” After tasting a sample provided by a Venetian merchant, “[t]he story goes that he was so enchanted by its taste and aroma that he approved its consumption by Christians.” By the mid-17th century, coffeehouses could be found in London, Amsterdam, Paris, and in cities all over Western Europe. Standage characterizes the coffeehouses of Enlightenment-era Europe as nodes in a new information network he calls the “Coffeehouse Internet.” Anyone interested in the progress of science (or “natural philosophy”) could pay for a dish of coffee at certain establishments, while the literary set would gather at others. Runners with knowledge of major events would dash between coffeehouses to announce the news. Coffeehouses became so deeply associated with the transmission of information that they became known in England as “penny universities”: a penny being the average price of the dish of coffee that granted its drinker access to the never-ending, wide-ranging discussions that happened within. Visiting a café today in a major Western city, it’s easy to see the ways that Standage’s “Coffeehouse Internet” has been displaced by, well, the actual Internet. Patrons sit in private conversation with one another or pull up their laptops, browsing the vast stores of information available to them. The public and egalitarian discussions of trade, politics, and science among strangers happen now online, if they happen at all. However, there is one clear exception to this prevailing trend—one example of the ways that 17th- and 18th-century coffeehouse culture has survived into the present day. I’m talking about church: in theory, a meeting-place for people of all different social classes and political affiliations, where ideas are discussed openly among strangers while urns of coffee bubble along the periphery. My own church serves coffee and tea in the cafeteria of the high school building we’re renting after the service ends in the auditorium. I look around: everyone is talking, and almost everyone is drinking from paper cups swathed in napkins for insulation. The scene is one part French salon, one part daycare, and one part indoor picnic. At a glance, it is impossible to tell the specific role played by the coffee, although it clearly gives everyone a common reason for entering the room as well as something to do with their hands (a significant task, as any person on a first date will tell you). “This coffee is amazing,” my wife tells me, and it’s at this moment that I realize I’m not sure I know what good coffee tastes like. I take another sip. It’s kind of sour and acidic. “Mhmm,” I reply. I ask my pastor later to expand on the church’s strategy re: coffee. What does it represent to him? “Coffee is like a comfort blanket that young professionals carry around after the service, and it gives them courage to interact with one another,” Pastor Kyle replies. “For me, hospitality is guided by the principle that we welcome the stranger as we would welcome Christ. For me, coffee is the way I would welcome Christ.” Jesus would not be disappointed here—at least not if he were a coffee guy. For Peter Schellhase, who serves on the vestry of his Episcopal church and helps with refreshments, “‘coffee hour’ is one of the main ways people in the congregation keep up with one another.” Responsibilities for the provisions circulate through his church; “families are assigned to “host” in turns, which for most looks like making a run to Costco…hosts generally put on quite a spread. When my wife and I host, it’s quite a bit lighter, because we do not have the spiritual gift of Costco membership.” This general approach is reflected in a number of other responses I receive. For Amanda McClendon, who helps to prepare pots of Whole Foods Pre-Ground Breakfast Blend each Sunday in the YMCA gym where her church meets, “it’s more about the ritual of the thing than the quality…I like having something to offer guests. There’s something about giving someone something edible or drinkable when you’re welcoming them into your space that’s powerful and a little more hospitable than just words.”At Schellhase’s church, the coffee comes out after both Sunday morning services. I ask him whether he feels any pressure to serve high-end stuff. No, he replies—“What is the kind that comes in the big blue plastic tubs? The church provides it. I think it’s Maxwell House.” At his church, the coffee isn’t the point at all. Jesus would not be disappointed here—at least not if he were a coffee guy. At his Lutheran church in Montana, pastor Christopher Miller provides Folgers “from the huge coffee urn” after Sunday services in response to what has become a well-rooted expectation. “It’s not as important as the gospel,” he says, “but there will be disappointment if it’s not there.” Pastor Jeff Kerr, whose church brews Costco’s signature Kirkland brand for post-service refreshments, agrees that providing coffee helps to create community: “I always kind of disliked churches where everyone is gone ten minutes after the service is over. The coffee—and sandwiches, fruit, etc.—that we serve after the service makes for a lively community gathering.” Kerr serves his church in this way in spite of the fact that he “personally [doesn’t] care for the stuff.” But, he says, “its effect on our congregation is palpable.”Even so, coffee hour is a ripe time for fellowship, which Miller considers critical: “The ability to share coffee (and goodies) gives people a place to share their lives with each other, something that is hard to do in our crazy lives now. And yet, we believe that the gospel is also communicated in the mutual conversation and consolation of the saints. That’s what coffee facilitates.” Pastor and writer Brian Gregory Thomas keeps “no fewer than two coffee makers operating at opposite ends of the church before and during Sunday School.” Those tasked with coffee service “just roll into Wal-Mart and swipe a big tub of Folgers up off the shelf and use that.” As resolutely normal as the church’s coffee service is, Thomas finds that his pots of Folgers reflect the body of which he is a part: “Our coffee is simple, unassuming, and common. Our people are the same way. Our church is the same way.” Image-Bearing Baristas I understand my friends who don’t think twice about the big tub of Folgers at Wal-Mart—I have likely eyed the same tub. But there are those who disdain such poorhouse fare, who would even consider lower-end coffee a hindrance to ministry. They provide full-service espresso bars, use artisanal beans, and speak of—in coffee culture’s irreverent idiom—the “God shot.” Though their working methods bring high school chemistry class to mind, these churches share the same goals as their Maxwell House-sipping brethren: creating fellowship and opportunities for ministry. “I think coffee, particularly in our context—an inner city church in Australia (the hipster coffee snob capital of the world)—is a form of hospitality,” Nathan Campbell tells me. “The sort of tea and coffee you serve is a demonstration of how much you value those walking through your doors and, potentially, into your community.” Campbell’s church has a full espresso bar, and the expanded repertoire is a boon to ministry among Brisbane’s coffee elites. The beans are locally roasted; before and after services, a team of volunteer baristas prepares drinks to order. Campbell is also involved in the local coffee scene, which he sees as part of his ministry to the community. “I’m currently starting a social enterprise café with a local social justice organization, which will provide training and workplace inclusion to vulnerable people in our part of the city,” he says.Though I initially scoffed at the idea that this method could be affordable to smaller or relatively less affluent churches, Campbell has calculated elsewhere that it is possible to serve espresso-based coffee drinks for about $0.52 AUD a cup (although this doesn’t include the initial cost of purchasing or leasing the necessary equipment). His work is rooted ultimately in his theology: “Done well, with attention to the order and detail required, there’s something about the preparation of coffee that is us bearing the image of God and exercising dominion over creation.” He adds, however, that he is “probably not ‘representative’ of how other pastors approach coffee.” But there are certainly many others who take a comparable approach. Pastor Matt Busby moved to Chattanooga to work at a church with a vision for a space that would “be a gift to the community six days a week.” Monday through Saturday, the church’s location “is a third space/coffee shop/restaurant/venue.” Echoing Campbell, he says they “definitely do not have a normal perspective when it comes to coffee…the coffee shop isn’t just a small side piece of our church. It is our entire space.” “There’s something about the preparation of coffee that is us bearing the image of God and exercising dominion over creation.” The way Busby describes it, The Camp House acts as a kind of low-level onboarding for people interested in the church: If weekday patrons “decide to come to the Mission on Sundays, they walk into a space where they are already part of the community.” He estimates that only about 10 percent of people who visit The Camp House during the week attend Sunday services.Busby sends me photos of The Camp House, Mission Chattanooga’s weekday coffee shop. I see patrons in various states of repose: a typical coffeehouse crowd, smiling and sipping and chatting and typing. The space is warehouse-y, but overhung with chandeliers, in a style that Busy and his colleagues describe as “Byzantine Industrial.” Busby’s church supports local businesses with their purchases. One of those outfits is Mad Priest Coffee Roasters, a company started by Camp House barista Michael Rice. Mad Priest’s goal is to employ refugees who have resettled in Chattanooga, equipping them with transferable skills and helping them to make a way in their new city. Mad Priest’s social justice orientation resonates with Mission Chattanooga’s sense of mandate. As Busby says, “Owning and operating a coffee shop/gathering place at the center of our city is about seeking the flourishing of the community to which God has called us to bear witness.” A Venti for Justice Often supported by contributions and patronage from local churches, social justice-minded organizations like Mad Priest carve out an equitable niche in the gargantuan worldwide coffee economy. Another such group is Underground Coffee. In the early 1980s, inspired by liberation theologians to leave the world of academia in favor of a life with the poor, Bob Ekblad began an agricultural movement in Honduras. Since 1981, Tierra Nueva, as the organization is called, has been “working with the poorest peasant farmers in the wild-west mountains of Honduras, teaching sustainable agriculture, soil conservation, and working pastorally with the most outcasted families in villages surrounding Minas de Oro.” Ekblad moved to Washington State’s Skagit Valley region in the 1990s to begin a new branch of Tierra Nueva’s ministry there among migrant farmworkers, as well as inmates in the jails and prisons. Chris Hoke joined Ekblad as a jail chaplain in the mid-2000s, and soon after, Honduran farmers called with news: they were looking for a place to sell their coffee harvest after becoming some of the best growers in the region. Hoke tells me over the phone that he had come to Washington looking for ways to “engage the Bible and folks on the margins,” especially those who had been recently incarcerated. After spending most of his time young gang members in and out of the jail where they met, Hoke was particularly impressed with an organization in Los Angeles called Homeboy Industries, which creates “microenterprises” that can serve as “gateway jobs” for those whose criminal records would bar access to other employment—helping ex-convicts to learn transferable skills while building their résumés. It was around this time that the coffee farmers from Honduras asked whether any of their friends in the north had any ideas for where they might sell their harvest. Ekblad and Hoke applied for and received a grant from a Presbyterian foundation, bought a five-kilo roaster, hired a former meth cook who came to faith in one of Ekblad’s Bible studies and felt called to a life of ministry, and together the three of them founded Underground Coffee. Underground Coffee’s website describes the company as a “vertically integrated coffee enterprise” with a twofold aspect. The first is Tierra Nueva’s ongoing work in Honduras, the second most violent country in the world. Along with prevailing social and economic instability, the violence is “pushing a generation of Central Americans to migrate north to the United States looking for undocumented work.” Tierra Nueva’s work with famers is intended to develop “agricultural hope in the poorest regions where families can stay and thrive.” On a high peak in the Altamira region of Honduras, Tierra Nueva’s coffee farm employs five year-round employees as well as roughly 45 seasonal workers during the harvest season, which lasts from December to February. Workers wash and process the beans on-site and dry them in the sun. The second aspect of Underground’s work is done back in Washington, where, in alignment with the Homeboy Industries template, men and women whose criminal records would disqualify them from other positions are able to find “gateway employment” working with the Honduran coffee after it arrives in the US. Underground’s employees “roast, weigh, bag, and deliver…fresh, single-origin, boutique-roast coffee,” with the product reaching “homes, churches, and businesses across the country” and “proceeds…funding a new generation of outreach workers at Tierra Nueva.” An “Employees” page on Underground’s site shows photos of a number of alumni, some of whom have gone on to enroll in degree programs and work in different ministries. In Underground’s early days, Hoke tells me, the ministry “was barely clearing 8,000 to 10,000 pounds of green [coffee] bean harvest, only roasting one morning a week, and employing three to four guys for a handful of hours each.” The business was small, relying primarily on business with local churches, and didn’t grow for several years; Underground’s supervisors were pastors, and “it’s hard to run a tight ship when your supervisors are also your employees’ spiritual mentors.” Even so, Underground thrived on a small scale and sold their products primarily to churches throughout the Northwest. Less than two years ago, Fidalgo Bay Coffee—a Seattle-area coffee company—started fishing around for ways to develop deeper partnerships with coffee growers, with a special interest in Honduras. Fidalgo Bay’s CEO was directed to Underground Coffee, and he approached Hoke in a spirit of generosity and compassion: “How can I help you?” he asked Hoke. “How can I serve?” Fidalgo started to pick up slack in various areas of Underground’s business where the pastors and chaplains had no expertise, such as importing, warehousing, and general logistical matters. Eventually the company bought Underground Coffee (which remains an independent social responsibility organization) in partnership with Tierra Nueva, under the Fidalgo Bay umbrella. Thanks to Fidalgo’s high-end infrastructure and larger scale, Underground Coffee is now able to “buy and guarantee Tierra Nueva’s Altamira farm’s entire 12,000 pound harvest,” while continuing to employ a person in its “gateway” model internship—now for 12-16 hours a week. Underground’s current intern “is an outstanding member of the team,” Hoke says. A former local drug dealer, she “had become the house manager in our partner recovery home, but still has court dates, helping acclimate Fidalgo as a business to formerly incarcerated employees’ needs.” Fidalgo has now hired her for full-time work beyond her hours with Underground. While the company’s partnership with Fidalgo has opened up new markets beyond churches in the Pacific Northwest, those local churches—and others across the country—remain the foundation for Underground’s business. One of Hoke’s goals for Underground is for the coffee to be “a Trojan Horse for talking about mass incarceration” in the churches they serve. “Churches are full of a lot of Christians who believe and worship along a certain line of values of liberation, of mercy, of compassion…but [who] vote for a political system that is different—that is unforgiving, that is unmerciful,” he says. “If Tierra Nueva can be a small catalyst for conversations in churches, if it can be a sacrament—beans broken by people God is bringing out of the underground—if this can wake some Christians up to our addiction to unmerciful systems, then that’s our larger mission right now.” With the amount of economic power held by the 300,000+ churches in the U.S., the potential for churches to impact the international coffee trade through mindful purchasing and consuming is enormous. “Coffee is so international—why not delight in looking where your coffee is coming from?” For most folks, the common entry point into ethically-minded coffee purchasing is fair trade coffee. Labels marked with “fair trade” indicate that the coffee has been licensed as meeting fair trade standards, which are meant to ensure that a too-abundant supply of beans does not result in steep price drops for the farmers who harvest those beans. They also prohibit forced labor and child labor. So is buying fair trade coffee a worthwhile investment for churches? “Fair trade is better than nothing,” Hoke says, but the organization that provides the trademarked license still creates “a very tricky gatekeeping system where some of the small farmers can’t benefit.” He recommends entering into a direct relationship with growers—which is what Underground Coffee does with the Tierra Nueva farmers in Honduras—but he admits that such an arrangement is also fraught with importing difficulties. Ultimately, though, Hoke simply “want[s] churches, like all of us, to be conscious of what we’re buying. Churches, this is their number-one drug. If you’re going to be spending x amount of your church’s budget on this, then why not take a sacramentally and socially-connected attitude towards it?” An avid coffee drinker himself, he sees opportunities for wonder as well as justice-minded action in the world of coffee: “Coffee is so international—why not delight in looking where your coffee is coming from?” Eternity Meets Coffee Time I finish my call with Hoke, pack up my things in the lobby of my apartment building, take an elevator to the eleventh floor, and enter my apartment, where my own coffee ritual is about to begin. I fill and activate our kettle, mete out two even scoops of coffee from the orange tin into a small French Press, and preset a timer on my microwave to four minutes. When the water boils and the kettle chimes, I pour the water over the grounds, which swirl into a black-and-tan scurf under the lip of the press. I stir the grounds, wait my four minutes, and depress the plunger on top of the press. I pour my coffee into a mug adorned with the image of an eight-point buck and set it on my desk next to my computer, where I begin to write as my drink cools. This ritual of mine is representative of the millions of private rituals performed every day in cities and homes all over the world. As James K. A. Smith reminds us in his Cultural Liturgies books, it’s by rituals such as these that our hearts are formed and our desires refined. It is in our rituals, as well, that our hearts are revealed. The meaning of the ritual of coffee in the Western church exists only in iterations: Individual communities of believers define it according to their own purposes, needs, and beliefs. For some of those believers, coffee is a simple accommodation offered to friends and strangers alike. For others, it is a means of fellowship under the sign of the age. Still others see potential in it for meaningful engagement with some of the social injustices of our time. The resulting collage of activity renders a definite image when viewed from a height: The picture is of the church performing its mundane acts of transfiguration on everything that it touches and gathers to itself—even coffee. Across the country, tens of thousands of churches will take a busy collective hour this weekend to prepare their coffee service. Men and women will set out stacks of paper cups with corrugated sleeves, trays of ceramic mugs, or towers of Styrofoam cups alongside bowls of sugar packets and sachets of powdered cream. They will adjust steam wands, peel foil seals off plastic tubs, and heave urns into place. They will push open the flimsy accordion-style doors over the counter in the Fellowship Hall, and the crowd will converge.

Dollar General to add 10,000 workers in hiring spree Lizzy Alfs , lalfs@tennessean.com 2:22 p.m. CDT September 15, 2016 Dollar General plans to hire 10,000 new workers in a hiring spree. (Photo: Tim Adkins/THE TIMES) Dollar General plans to hire 10,000 new workers within the next month to support the company's expansion plans. The Goodlettsville-based discount retailer — which has planned to open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 stores in fiscal 2017 — announced Thursday it will host hiring events at 600 locations through Sept. 24 where interested applicants can meet with Dollar General managers. A list of events is available at www.dollargeneral.com/grow. The company is looking to fill full time and part time positions including store managers and assistant managers, lead sales associates and store associates. All candidates must also apply online at www.dollargeneral.com/careers. "Dollar General remains focused on our strategy to invest in our employees as a competitive advantage," Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in a statement. "We look forward to providing new employees opportunities to gain new skills, develop their talents and grow their careers through our mission of Serving Others." Dollar General operated 13,000 stores as of Aug. 13. The company’s expansion plans include 6 to 8 percent square footage growth per year. In 2015 Dollar General opened 730 new stores, remodeled or relocated 881 stores and closed 36. In July, Dollar General announced plans to relocate 40 stores and enter one new market after the company finalized a deal to purchase 41 former Wal-Mart Express locations. At the time, Dollar General said the newly relocated stores would feature a “fresh DG16 layout,” including additional sales floor square footage and expanded offerings such as fresh meat and produce. The company also planned to operate fueling stations in 37 of the 41 locations. The deal included former Wal-Mart stores in Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, and Oklahoma. Dollar General’s annual sales grew from $18.9 billion in 2014 to $20.4 billion in 2015. The company's expansion plans come a year after Dollar General failed in its attempt to acquire rival Family Dollar for $9.1 billion after a nearly yearlong takeover battle. Family Dollar shareholders instead approved an $8.5 billion deal with Dollar Tree. Dollar General and Family Dollar sell items across a range of price points, while Dollar Tree prices items at $1 or less.

Morgan County Sheriff’s Office On September 11 burglary complaint was filed at a Shadyside Lane residence. According to reports, a woman said while she was in Monroe drinking with friends, someone entered her residence and took two gold chains and $350 cash. They also damaged a C320 Mercedes Benz parked at the rear of the house. The woman said she suspects a man who has recently been hanging out with her son.

On September 10 a trespassing complaint was filed at an Aqua Road residence. According to reports, a woman at the residence called authorities because a woman had parked in the driveway and would not leave. A deputy arrived and observed a women and a female friend parked in a 2007 Chevrolet Equinox. The woman said she was waiting to speak  with the complainant. The deputy told the woman that the complainant did not want to have any contact with her and told the woman to leave or she would be charged with criminal trespass. The woman argued, stating that the deputy could not make her leave “because this was her family’s place.” After being threatened a second time with arrest the woman “made some inaudible remarks” and left. The complainant said the woman had been a foster child of the family’s many years ago and that because of some “bad incidents” between the family and the woman after she became an adult, the family was attempting to block any contact from the woman.  The complainant said she had helped the woman with some financial problems in the past but that the “money well had dried up” and she could no longer help. While the deputies were still at the residence the suspect drove by again. This time a deputy made a traffic stop on the woman and reiterated that she needed to leave the area. The woman “made some inaudible remarks” and drove away. On September 9 a burglary complaint was filed at a Mission Road residence. According to reports, a woman said someone entered a residence at Mission Road and removed a 39” Sanyo television that was still in the box, a Trek 21-speed bike and a large, gold-framed painting of horses running.

The company said on Thursday it would hire full-time and part-time employees, including for permanent sales floor positions such as store managers, lead sales associates and store associates. The news comes two weeks after bigger rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it would cut 7,000 back-office jobs to focus more of its resources on the sales floor. Dollar stores operators such as Dollar General and bigger rival Dollar Tree Inc are locked in an intense battle against each other as well as big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart to win over shoppers. Dollar stores have eaten into the market shares of their big-box rivals in recent years, helped by aggressive expansion, improving product assortment and low prices. Dollar General operates more than 13,000 stores in the United States and has laid out plans to open 900 stores this year and about 1,000 more in 2017. The retailer had about 113,400 full-time and part-time employees as of Feb. 26. It has hired 42,000 employees since 2008, or an average of about 5,200 each year.

Serial entrepreneurs and investors, Courtney and Carter Reum, will lead the panel this season. "We love helping companies go from a small idea to a large, profitable company," says Courtney Reum, who left Goldman Sachs to launch his own company, which was acquired last year. Courtney's brother, Carter, echoed Courtney, "Hatched is not just about discovering the next 'big thing,' but playing a formative role in growing the next big consumer brand. Prior to Hatched, shows have failed to capitalize on the opportunity to scale these businesses after they appear on-air, but we see this as the opportunity and think the entrepreneurs who appear on an episode will feel the same!" M13, Carter and Courtney's new brand development company is just one of the new partners this season. New to Season 2 are Dara Trujillo of the Home Shopping Network (HSN), Victor Green and Steve Seigel, prolific investors who will go undercover and surprise the entrepreneurs in the hopes of unlocking once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to scale their businesses. Each episode will feature a prominent guest mentor – from successful entrepreneurs, Fortune 500 CEOs to celebrity investors. Unlike other shows, Hatched focuses on one brand in an exciting new category as the entrepreneur pitches their products to mentors before testing them at the retail pop-up challenge. Mentors analyze consumer feedback and contestants return for a final discussion on the products' potential for investment, popularity and growth. Season 1 led to critical and commercial success with the winning of a Telly and Parent's Choice award, and the successful placement of companies into leading retailers including Walmart and Kroger. "We hope to continue to leverage the power of TV media to help the next generation of great American entrepreneurs break into retail and see their dreams become successes before the audiences eyes," says Anthony Samadani, Executive Producer and Creator. Hatched is created by Mark Koops, Anthony Samadani and Andrew Kavovit and produced by INE Entertainment's Mark Koops, Eric Day and Sheva Mokarram. Season 2 will feature names from Inc.com, Thrive Market Place and Vogue as well as celebrity investor Lance Bass.

Carter & Courtney ReumCarter and Courtney launched their careers at Goldman Sachs. Leaving investment banking with an idea to create "a better way to drink," the Reums built VEEV Spirit, a 70 proof vodka alternative, from that idea into one of the pioneering artisanal alcohol brands in the spirits industry, helping to popularize the açaí berry in the United States and into one of the fastest growing independent spirit brands in the country. While growing VEEV, the brothers began investing in other companies providing first hand experience, guidance and capitalization to many emerging businesses. Early investments include Bonobos, Birchbox, Warby Parker, Pinterest, Lyft, Krave Jerky, Kevita, and numerous others. In 2016, Carter and Courtney sold a majority stake of VEEV Spirits to a larger company allowing them to found M13 and focus on their entrepreneurial stewardship of consumer brands.

If you have been inside your local Walmart or Walgreen’s you’ve already been seeing ghosts, goblins, and zombie accessories plus all that candy that seems like a great idea until you eat a whole bag of it in one sitting. RELATED: Epic couples costumes for Halloween  Being the super-Texans that we are, we came up with a handful of Texas-centric costume ideas for readers in need of some inspiration this Halloween season. When it comes to Halloween costume ideas it’s better to get a jump on planning and execution early before procrastination sets in and you are rummaging through the Spirit Halloween store and all you can find are Hulk hands, a Marilyn Monroe wig and a caveman costume.

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} September 15, 2016 10:25am   Comments Share: Related AMZN Chowdhry: Cisco Is Just Another Victim Of Amazon's Superclouds Comparing The Competition In Home Services: HomeAdvisor, Amazon Home Services And Angie's List Amazon Takes Its Netflix Rivalry Global With 'Grand Tour' (Investor's Business Daily) Bernstein believes Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Now could play a crucial role in consumer packaged goods (CPG) sales. Bernstein analysts led by Carlos Kirjner have analyzed seven retailers' thousands of locations where Prime Now is available. The seven retailers were: Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST). CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS). Kroger Co (NYSE: KR). Safeway Inc (NYSE: SWY). Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA). Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT). "We analyzed every one of the thousands of store locations of 7 retailers [...] and, as one would expect, retailers whose store network tend to be less urban (e.g., Walmart) are significantly less exposed than those whose store footprint is more urban (e.g., Safeway or Costco)," the analysts told clients in a note. Related Link: Amazon's Cloud Competition Has Reason To Worry Amazon Prime Now has assumed importance since it is available to over 20 million households (18 percent of American households) following its aggressive promotional activities. The brokerage believes it has finally reached beyond the experimentation stage. Therefore, the management expects its investments on Prime Now "to be ‘NPV positive." Bernstein said, "Prime Now allows Amazon customers to make incidental, fill-in purchases of items whose need is more immediate – like consumer packaged goods (CPG). It expands Amazon's wallet share of its more than ~60M Prime users and attacks one of the last shopping occasions for which online could not compete effectively with brick and mortar retail." The brokerage pointed out that Prime Now's assortment is rich in CPG, as well as, the items purchased at the eleventh hour. That is primarily because those orders could not be addressed by e-com firms with a delivery window of one or two days. The lead analyst sees "fill-in items" purchase between $50 and $100 billion. The brokerage retained its Outperform rating with a price target of $1,000 on Amazon shares. At time of writing, Amazon was flat on the day at $761.09. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.
