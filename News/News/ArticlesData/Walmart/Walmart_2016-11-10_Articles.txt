Clinton conceded the presidency to Donald Trump in a phone call early Wednesday morning, a stunning end to a campaign that appeared poised right up until election day to make her the first woman elected U.S. president.(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) The definitive article explaining Donald Trump’s success was published two weeks ago in the Oct. 31, 2016, issue of The New Yorker. "The Unconnected: The Democrats lost the white working class. The Republicans exploited them. Can Hillary Clinton win them back?" The obvious and short answer is obvious: No. The longer answer is: She never tried. Election night I received a continuous stream of text messages from relatives and friends from coast to coast asking me “What’s happening?” “Why?” and the most poignant from our oldest daughter, 32-year-old Rachael, “Do Americans really hate women that much?” (No sweetie, just Hillary.) For 35 years, the Republican Party spun a narrative that the loss of jobs, good jobs, was the fault of Democratic regulation and taxes crippling the captains of industry. This tale of fantasy economics long discredited by a myriad of Democrats and some conservatives was never conveyed to working Americans, with the exception for a short duration by Bernie Sanders, and to a lesser degree by Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi and others who never had the national forum of Hillary Clinton. Clinton’s effort to embrace working Americans was short fused and undermined by her own attacks on Donald Trump’s insensitivities and the baggage she accumulated over 20 years. That said, the first successful, though not intentional, effort to sabotage the Hillary Clinton presidency was orchestrated by Bill Clinton when he embraced the George H.W. Bush NAFTA treaty and steamrolled his own party. For 35 years, the Republican Party spun its narrative, fooling the American workers and never being held accountable for its destruction of the American middle class as Democrats cavorted with Wall Street, bankers, and international financiers. For 25 years, the Democratic Party led by the Clintons sucked up to Walmart and Wall Street while claiming to defend the American workers. The Waltons might or might not have voted for Hillary, but rest assured Walmart workers and Walmart shoppers voted for Donald Trump. So did Kmart shoppers. Recall those standard questionnaires with a range of 10 spots from "extremely agree" at one end to "extremely disagree" at the other end and "neutral" in the middle. Now fashion it with "I care about my friends and neighbors" at one end and "I’ve been screwed over one too many times" at the other end. Screwed-over working America did not care that the Republican Party was mostly responsible for their plight, they did not care that the states with failed job growth strategies — like Wisconsin and Kansas — were run by Republican governors who screwed the poor and gave tax breaks to their buddies. Screwed-over Kansans and Wisconsinites, like the rest of America, saw each political party offer up a populist. The carefully orchestrated Democratic Party nominating system was rigged, polite, and stacked — and they rejected their populist, Bernie Sanders. The Republican Party's process was chaotic, impolite, and offensive — and they chose the clear, strong, angry voice: their populist, Donald Trump. The voters chose strident voice, not party. The consequences for the Democratic Party are a disaster. A majority of America did not care who created the mess — they wanted an alternative, they wanted revenge. As the campaign for president came to a close, there were tell-tale signs of the wheels coming off the Clinton campaign bus. There were too many undecideds, who in the end broke against the incumbent, against the establishment. And all those angry white males. Some of them were white men, others were brown and black men, and some were women. But there were too many angry genetic white males and the Clinton campaign ignored them. Then there was the failed media campaign. Two of the cardinal rules of politics were violated by Hillary Clinton, both lessons I learned 40 years ago in my first term in office. First, never attack the voters. No matter what you think of your opponents, do not call their base of supporters indecent, shameless, or deplorable. Secondly, never utter any opinion or position in private that you are not willing to say in public. If that was true in the 1970s it is more true today when everyone in the room has their own recording device. Having failed two rules, the Clinton campaign barreled forward to follow the third rule as the campaign concluded: Always play to your strength. The theme of the campaign was to continue to appeal to equity and social justice, the empathy of the American people. Donald Trump was a never-ending wealth of material for those who cared about their friends and neighbors. There was the attack on the disabled, the Mexicans and Latinos, and especially his crude direction to tell whoever was listening to “Go fuck themselves.” Rest assured none of Donald Trump’s friends ever wrote a book entitled anything like “It Takes a Village.” Those angry white males, those undecideds, that basket of deplorables wanted to read, “How to Get Yours and Screw Everyone in Authority.” Like this story?

If there is a surprise in all of this, it is that the Trump campaign did not double down and rerun the Hillary Clinton campaign's anti-Trump ads. In his New Yorker article, focusing on the divide between white working-class America and the rest of the nation, George Packer recounts: "When I asked her (Hillary Clinton) if this (educational elitism) had helped drive working-class Americans away from the Democratic Party, she hedged. 'I really don’t know the answer to that…'" How Clintonesque. She spent 20 years preparing to run for president. She took money from Wall Street while spinning them one story and her social justice colleagues another. She and Bill did amass a fortune and, when most politicians knew better, even set herself above the rest — not just the commoners but also the rest of the elites. There were the emails and then there were the foreign gifts to the Clinton Foundation while she was secretary of State. When she failed to answer Packer, once again she either lied or fudged. In either case, she was following in the tradition of every U.S. president over the past 35 years — fucking over working Americans. The difference is that whether it hubris, indifference, or arrogance, she did not have the filter to cover it up. Not when she answered Packer, not when she won the nomination, and not when she squared off against Donald Trump. It was obvious last spring that most Americans were mad as hell and there were two candidates who understood that. Bernie Sanders reflected and addressed it in a thoughtful, compassionate manner, not crying for blood, but demanding reasonable reforms. Donald Trump understood it and exploited and manipulated the long-suffering victims of both political parties. With Sanders out of the way, Hillary, who was too removed, too distant from the alienated, disenfranchised workers, sallied forth, offering platitudes and homilies but failing to give the people what they really wanted, the architects of the current economy. Trump never hesitated to sacrifice his bankers, his friends, and his investors. In meantime, none of us have a clue as to Trump’s real intentions on the economy. We know his stated positions on immigration and Supreme Court nominations but not much more. He may well create as much chaos for the Republican Party as he does for the Democrats, creating a very vulnerable GOP in 2018. The problem is Hillary Clinton smashed up the Democratic Party far worse than Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey could ever imagine. Paul Soglin is mayor of Madison.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Walmart recently revealed all of the items that will be available in stores come Black Friday. The weekly ad is chock full of tech, including plenty of discounted HDTVs, smartphones, accessories, streaming gadgets, home cameras and more. I took screenshots of the ad, which you can peruse at your will, but there are some standout deals that I spotted. If you buy a Galaxy S7 or iPhone 7 on AT&T or Verizon, for example, you’re eligible for a $250 Walmart gift card. You need to set an appointment ahead of time, however. Walmart’s Black Friday deals will save you big on tech For folks interested in creating a smart home, the Nest will be discounted from $249 to $199. The Nest Cam will cost $149, down from $299. For gamers, the Xbox One S Battlefield 1 bundle is priced at $249, down from $299. There are more than 65 games priced under $25, too, with many as low as $15 or $8. If you’re in need of a new laptop, Walmart has a variety of Windows 10 machines that are discounted down to as low as $99. Those super-cheap machines don’t always perform well, though, so keep that in mind before buying one. If you love movies, head to Walmart for those, too. More than 260 movies will cost just $3.96. Sure, most of us don’t use DVDs anymore, but if you buy a Disney movie, you can easily grab a digital copy for your smartphone or tablet. Boom, huge savings. And finally, TVs. There are tons of options, including a 4K 60-inch Samsung Smart TV priced at $648, which seems like a pretty good deal to me. Prices range from $98 for a 24-inch display to $798 for a 65-inch Samsung Smart TV, a $200 discount on the latter. Check out the full list in the gallery above, or hit the source to browse the full collection that also includes non-tech items. The sale kicks off at 6pm local time on November 24 in-stores.

Published Nov 11th, 2016 4:57 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon on Friday asked Hoyt Williams, a 93-year-old World War II veteran who works as a greeter in Trion, Ga., if he had any advice for the audience. “Just hang in there,” Williams answered. At the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of November, Wal-Mart Stores rolled out the red carpet for several World War II veterans who work or whose families work within the retailer’s vast ranks. The event was held at the retailer’s Bentonville headquarters. Williams served in the European and South Pacific Campaigns of WW II. After Potsdam, he was not ready to leave the military and return to civilian life so he was shipped to Seattle and then re-deployed to the Philippines until the war ended. Gary Profit, senior director of Wal-Mart’s military programs, said serving in both campaigns is rare, but then again so is someone who at 93 still wants to get more hours on the job. Williams has been a Walmart U.S. employee for the 23 years, a job he told Talk Business & Politics he sought after retiring from a 40-year run in the grocery business in his home town. “I told my wife when we left the grocery business and I was tired of mowing the lawn that it was time for me go back to work. I went down to my local Walmart and the assistant manager knew me. Her family used to buy groceries from me when she was a little girl. She said they could put me to work even though I was 70 years old and they did,” Williams said. He’s grateful the job which he works 4 days a week, but said he’d like to get mores if the store manager would given them. “Pay day is the best thing about the job,” he said. “I also like being with the people, retail is what I know,” Williams said. Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon and Lois Bouton, who served as a “SPAR” with the U.S. Coast Guard between 1943-1945. SPARs comes from the Latin and English translations of the Coast Guard’s motto, Semper Paratus! Always Ready! He said over the past 23 years he’s had several jobs at his local Walmart store working in various departments including sporting goods, hardware, electronics and even fabric before transitioning to greeter nearly 4 years ago. Wal-Mart has made clear its commitments to hire veterans of all ages. In 2013 Walmart U.S. committed to hiring 100,000 veterans in five years, but McMillon said the retailer accomplished that goal in three years. The company reassessed the goal in 2013 to hire 250,000 by 2020, setting the bar higher. Since 2013, McMillon said the retailer has hired 153,000 veterans and 19,000 of them have been promoted. McMillon introduced Johnny Martin, who works in asset management for the Sam’s Club in Oklahoma City. Martin is in the U.S. Army reserves and has served three tours in Iraq – totaling more than 32 months. He has a master’s degree and still had trouble finding work after returning home in 2014. He said Target passed on him, saying he was “too professional” essentially over-qualified for the positions they had open. Martin said he kept a running total of his jobs applications – 152 – before he landed a job at Sam’s Club. “I took an overnight position and thought I would work on finding career employment in the day. But I quickly saw it was working out and was promoted to a department level supervisory role in a short time frame. I was encouraged to apply for the asset management position at the new Sam’s Club but I thought it would go to some with lots more experience. I had only 14 months with Sam’s Club at the time,” Martin said. Martin was called to deploy just after Thanksgiving for a short tour in the Ukraine. “I have found Walmart’s commitment to veterans is not just an empty HR promise,” he said. Other speakers at the Veterans Day event included James McDonough Jr.. director of the Institute for Veteran and Military Families. Together with more than $40 million in funding from the Walmart Foundation, IVMF has programs in North Carolina, New York and most recently San Antonio, Texas. The programs work to help veterans today returning from service transition back into the workforce, school or some other form of service. He said someone retiring or coming home from extended service is jobless and sometimes homeless. While there are many programs and employers to help there is not anyone to help make the connections in what is a very fragmented sector. Helping veterans navigate the services and employment landscape is what IVMS does. Rear Admiral Terence McKnight (retired) also spoke at the event about the service today in the 21st Century. He remembers well the call he got while serving in the Pentagon in 2009 to help try and save merchant Captain Richard Phillips who was under attack by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. During 2007-2011, was in charge of operations to chase modern-day pirates that were a threat to commerce. “We have the greatest Navy in the world but we were not trained to chase pirates. I was the most scared guy out there. The Somali pirates do it out of desperation and annual income of just $350. Half of those pirates who go to sea don’t return. They have nothing to lose,” he said. Keeping the passage clear through the Gulf of Aden is crucial to commerce as some 25,000 ships pass through there annually. At the time of the pirate crusades he said there was not enough Coast Guard and Navy ships policing the region. He said the first and second groups his team captured, were released because the U.S. did not have a plan in place on how to handle those captured. He said those who had the misfortune to be captured by the Russians were not as fortunate. Walmart officials also encouraged the several hundred in attendance to support the “Green Light A Vet” marketing program the retailer introduced this time last year.  Profit said the idea of replacing an outdoor light bulb with a green bulb is hit, so much so that the retailer ran out of green light bulbs last year. Walmart said it sold 2 million green lights last year, and Profit said supplies are good because they have a better estimate on demand.

(Jeff Chiu/AP) By SARAH HALZACK WASHINGTON POST Walmart and Target each plan to kick off their in-store Black Friday sales at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, repeating their start-times from last year and throwing some cold water on the notion that Turkey Day deals blitzes may be falling out of style. Earlier in the season, the Mall of America announced it would be shuttering its doors on the holiday after being open in previous years. Office Depot, too, made a similar reversal of course. But the plans from the big-box behemoths — as well as from Macy’s, Kohl’s and Toys R Us — suggest the Thanksgiving Day shopping tradition is going strong. Walmart said it will be “dramatically increasing” the amount of inventory it has available for online deal hunters, offering some 50 percent more Black Friday merchandise this year on the Web than last year. “We really pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price but then only has a few available for the customers,” said Steve Bratspies, the chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S., during a conference call with reporters. Walmart said its offerings this year would include items such as a Samsung 50-inch 4K television for $398 and movies that cost $1.99. Target, meanwhile, was touting deals such as an iPad Air 2 for $274 and 30 percent off apparel. Oh, and remember that giant $10 teddy bear that was all over social media last Black Friday? The retailer is bringing it back, and has bought 20 percent more inventory this time around. Both chains will start their online Black Friday sales in the early morning hours on Thanksgiving. And both will be offering a steady trickle of discounts over the next two weeks to encourage customers to get in the holiday spirit. In earlier announcements about their seasonal plans, Target and Walmart stressed they were trying to focus on making their promotions simple this time around. In the past, it seems, shoppers have been confused by a cavalcade of coupons or staggered sale starting times. At Target, that means returning to the “10 days of deals” program, something the retailer tried last year in which it touted a single big promotion each day starting the weekend before Thanksgiving. Walmart is also aiming for simple: Besides its limited-time Black Friday discounts, it plans to keep the rest of its price cuts in place for the duration of the November and December rush. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts that stores will ring up a healthy 3.6 percent increase in sales this holiday season. That would be an improvement from last year, when sales growth was up just 3 percent. We should soon get a clearer idea of what kind of momentum big retail has headed into this all-important time of year: Macy’s is set to report earnings Thursday morning, and Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others will do so in the following week.

The retailer, known for stampedes at its front doors in the wee hours of Black Friday morning, is changing a tried-and-true formula to attract shoppers surfing the Internet from the comfort of their homes in their pajamas. This year, Walmart will increase the number of items with Black Friday discounts allocated to online shoppers by about 50 percent, said U.S. Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies. Black Friday deals will be available days before the calendar actually hits Nov. 25, diluting what was once a one-day, deal-hunting frenzy. And as retailers have begun offering the same promotions online, they’ve made the idea of braving in-store Black Friday crowds less compelling for some shoppers. “If you’re a retailer, it doesn’t matter where you’re getting your business from, just that you’re getting the business. (Making sales available online) is much more in tune with what the consumer is looking for,” said Neil Stern, senior partner at Chicago consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. Walmart isn’t alone. For the first time, J.C. Penney will make its Black Friday specials available online at midnight Nov. 22 — more than a day before shoppers can get them in stores at 3 p.m. on Thanksgiving. And Kohl’s is letting online shoppers in on its 6 p.m. Thanksgiving “door-buster” deals for the first time this year, too. Like last year, Walmart, Target and Sears will give online shoppers a head start. Black Friday prices will be available online in the early Thanksgiving morning hours and in stores at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving. “We know that customers don’t exclusively shop in one channel — they shop online and in stores. Having omnichannel deals provides a consistent experience for our customers so they can shop any time and any way they choose,” said Kohl’s spokeswoman Melanie Hochschild. At some stores, such as J.C. Penney, Kohl’s and Sears, all Black Friday door-buster prices can be found online. Walmart will have most of those deals online, but some will still require a trip to the store. Target, J.C. Penney, Walmart, Kohl’s and Sears also offer certain online-only Black Friday deals before Thanksgiving through their apps and websites. Most people plan to start their holiday shopping before Black Friday week, and about 30 percent expect to make most of their purchases before the week begins, according to a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers. And while the consulting firm expects fewer shoppers on Black Friday itself this year, that doesn’t mean stores will be quiet. Of the people who expect to shop during the week of Thanksgiving, a majority plan to do most of that spending on Black Friday. But more of the likely Black Friday and Thanksgiving shoppers surveyed by Accenture said they expect to shop online than in stores.

Now, the e-commerce behemoths are training their sights on everyday indispensables — groceries and household items. Over the past few months, both have poured hundreds of millions of yuan into a price war aimed at dragging shoppers away from supermarkets and corner stores. As sales of other goods reach saturation point for JD.com and Alibaba, groceries are the next battleground, said Ms Xu Xin, CEO of the venture capital firm Capital Today, which has invested in JD.com. Conquering the market for fresh food and other grocery items may eventually enable e-commerce companies to take control of as much as half of China’s total market for consumer goods sales, as Alibaba chairman Jack Ma predicted, Ms Xu said. In a letter to shareholders last year, Mr Ma declared that “over 50 per cent of China’s consumption will be conducted online within 10 years”. To reach that goal, “there will absolutely be a war between Alibaba and JD.com”, said Mr Cheng Shaoxiong, north China chief for the supermarket division of Tmall, Alibaba’s business-to-consumer site. He said online grocery sales are the last frontier for e-commerce companies. CHEAP, FAST COURIERS Online retail is flourishing in China, thanks to the country’s highly efficient and low-cost courier industry. Last year, online purchases accounted for 10.8 per cent of China’s 30 trillion yuan (S$6.15 trillion) in retail sales, a 32 per cent increase over the previous year, according to the National Statistics Bureau. For fast-moving consumer goods, including toiletries, soft drinks and fresh food, nearly 20 per cent of the purchases were made online. By 2020, online sales of fast-moving consumer goods will grow at a much faster pace than apparel and electronics to expand five-fold from today and reach 1.2 trillion yuan, according to Yihaodian, one of China’s pioneering online grocery sites. Fresh food and grocery items with quick turnover and higher profit margins have long been the competitive strength of large supermarket chains such as Wal-Mart and Yonghui Superstores. For e-commerce companies, moving into the sector requires heavy investments in logistics, warehousing and distribution. Alibaba and JD.com have made tit-for-tat moves to gain a foothold in the burgeoning online grocery market. On Oct 19, Alibaba and smaller rival Suning Commerce Group said they had established a new e-commerce joint venture with an investment of 1 billion yuan to manage Suning-owned stores on Alibaba sites. The venture is expected to combine the strengths of both companies. It is also a step forward for a partnership formed last year, when Alibaba became Suning’s second-largest shareholder through an equity swap. The next day, JD.com stepped up its partnership with Wal-Mart. It opened Wal-Mart-branded stores on JD.com, using its huge logistics network to offer fast deliveries for Wal-Mart in some cities. Wal-Mart also invested US$50 million (S$69.5 million) in the JD.com-backed online grocery specialist, New Dada. JD.com and Wal-Mart had formed a strategic alliance in June when Wal-Mart sold its China online grocery store, Yihaodian, to JD.com. Alibaba is the unrivalled titan in China’s online retail market. In the fiscal year ended in March, the company’s combined sales from its business-to-consumer site Tmall, consumer-to-consumer site Taobao and group-buying service Juhuasuan totalled 2.95 trillion yuan. That dwarfed JD.com’s sales of 462.7 billion yuan, generated mainly from business-to-consumer transactions. But JD.com is expanding at a faster pace. In the quarter between March and June, JD.com’s gross merchandise volume, a measurement of total sales value, grew 47 per cent from March to June a year earlier. Alibaba’s rose 24 per cent. “JD.com is coming within shooting range of Alibaba,” said a source close to Alibaba’s top management. Since the beginning of this year, Alibaba has set detailed monthly targets to counter JD.com, this individual said. Despite their healthy sales growth, both companies face the same challenge — a slower expansion of users after years of explosive growth. Alibaba had 423 million active users while JD.com has 188 million, according to company documents. TESTING THE WATERS Alibaba tested the supermarket waters in 2012 by launching Tmall grocery services in Shanghai and Hangzhou. But the “business proved to be very difficult due to high logistics costs”, said a former Yihaodian manager who declined to be named. It was not until July last year that the grocery business was listed as one of Alibaba’s four pillars of online retailing, along with Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan. That year, Alibaba spent 1 billion yuan in Beijing alone to subsidise grocery vendors and shoppers. Between 2012 and last year, Alibaba made heavy investments in logistics and warehouse facilities, enabling it to sell fresh produce, according to a staff member at Tmall. JD.com quickly set up its own online supermarket division in October last year. According to company financial reports, in the first quarter of this year, JD.com’s grocery sales rose 70 per cent from the previous year, while Alibaba’s supermarket sales grew 220 per cent. The expansion into groceries by the two e-commerce giants crushed smaller players. Wal-Mart-backed Yihaodian’s market share in the country’s e-commerce market shrank to less than 0.3 per cent in 2015 from 2.6 per cent in 2013, according to the e-commerce research website 100ec.cn. In the first quarter this year, the site barely recorded any growth from a year earlier. That prompted Wal-Mart to sell Yihaodian to JD.com in June in exchange for JD.com equity worth about US$1.5 billion. The strategic alliance with Wal-Mart is expected to give JD.com shoppers wider access to imported Wal-Mart products and provide more ammunition for JD.com’s battle with Alibaba. After the deal, JD.com announced a 1 billion yuan investment in Yihaodian over the next three months and an ambitious goal of developing JD.com as the largest grocery retailer in three years, according to JD.com vice-president Feng Yi. Alibaba quickly promised 2 billion yuan in subsidies for shoppers on its Tmall Supermarket site and 2 billion yuan of new investments to improve logistics and the supply chain. The price war has escalated since September as Tmall Supermarket poured 180 million yuan into discounts for grocery shoppers from Sept 1-9. At the same time, JD.com offered 50 per cent discounts on grocery items. Some experts have questioned the price-war strategy. “The gross profit margin of grocery items is less than 20 per cent,” said Li Chengdong, an independent e-commerce analyst. Offering such big discounts “is like burning money”. A source close to Tmall Supermarket said Alibaba can afford the discounting because of the parent group’s profitability. But concerns over heavy spending are greater for JD.com, which has yet to make a profit after 12 years in business. In June, JD.com’s share price on the New York Stock Exchange slumped to a historical low since its September 2014 listing. An APS Asset Management report had called money-losing JD.com “wildly overpriced”. The stock revived in August after the second-quarter financial report indicated a narrowing loss. Last year, JD.com lost US$1.4 billion, while Alibaba recorded a net profit of US$11.1 billion. FINE-TUNING STRATEGY After more than a decade, Alibaba and JD.com have developed distinct identities in online retailing. Alibaba’s Tmall and Taobao are the must-go places for many apparel shoppers because of their selection, offered by millions of vendors. JD.com has won more shoppers seeking branded electronic products. Alibaba has been focusing on operating platforms for numerous vendors and shoppers, while JD.com mainly sticks to direct sales backed by its highly effective, self-operated logistics network. But as the grocery war unfolds, both companies have sought to fine-tune their respective strategies and gradually move in each other’s direction. JD.com’s Mr Feng said the company’s supermarket division aims to challenge Alibaba’s strengths in cosmetics and apparel by expanding product variety. Meanwhile, Alibaba recently said it sees growth potential in home appliance and smartphone sales. The company has actively expanded using its logistics division, Cainiao, which now operates more than 128 warehouses across the country. Backed by Cainiao’s delivery capacity, Tmall Supermarket has adopted a JD.com-style direct-sales model, offering fresh produce sent directly from its own warehouse rather than a third-party supplier. At the same time, JD.com has been gradually changing its business structure by inviting more third-party vendors onto its platform. According to company data, third-party vendors accounted for 45 per cent of JD.com’s gross sales in the third quarter, up from 40 per cent a year ago. As the two companies’ strategies converge, both may increasingly face the same challenges, experts said. For instance, JD.com’s standardised customer services have long been blamed for a lack of interaction with shoppers, failing to lure users to surf among its product catalogue, as they usually do in Taobao and Tmall. At the same time, the huge number of vendors on Alibaba’s platforms has made controlling counterfeit or substandard products a longstanding headache. The e-commerce giants’ efforts to reshape their businesses echoed Alibaba chairman Ma’s call for e-commerce companies to adapt a radical change in the global retail industry as the boundary between online and offline sales becomes increasingly blurred. “In the coming years, we anticipate the birth of a reimagined retail industry driven by the integration of online, offline, logistics and data across a single value chain,” Mr Ma wrote to Alibaba shareholders in a letter last week. “With e-commerce itself rapidly becoming a ‘traditional business,’ pure e-commerce players will soon face tremendous challenges. This is why we are adapting.” CAIXIN mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most China&India READ COMMENTED “India really means business”: Iswaran ‘World’s cheapest smartphone’ to be launched in India ‘Voldemort’ attacks up ante in China-Japan propaganda war ‘Uncultured’ youth misled by religious extremists to blame for Tiananmen attack ‘This is our country!’ says Chinese official as Obama lands World Bank probe into Tata tea project finds it failed to protect Indian workers Workers laying roads in southern India rescued from debt bondage Trump, China's Xi establish sense of mutual respect: Trump statement Taiwan’s ruling party urges China to respect Hong Kong’s democratic aspirations Taiwan's ruling party urges China to respect Hong Kong's democratic aspirations Smog lifts, but companies' view of polluted Delhi skies is dim Moving to Shanghai?

(Photo by Elaine Thompson, The Associated Press) The state's voters passed Prop. 67, the plastic ban bag, but O.C. bucked the trend. (Photo by Elaine Thompson, The Associated Press) By DAVID WHITING / STAFF COLUMNIST Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The Walmart cashier tosses groceries so fast into a plastic bag turnstile, it spins like a merry-go-round. A box of a dozen Clif Bars, one bag. Walmart’s raisin bran, the next bag. Bananas, another bag. Three items, three plastic bags. I’m in bag heaven. But my wife – who thinks we can’t keep treating the planet like a garbage dump – is horrified. Yet in a surprising twist to Tuesday’s elections, she’s in the minority in Orange County. Yes, California voters last week easily approved Proposition 67, the plastic bag ban. Yet in Orange County, voters overwhelmingly made it clear we love our plastic bags. Statewide, 52 percent of voters agreed it’s time to stop spreading around thin bits of plastic. In Orange County, a whopping 58.6 percent of voters said keep the plastic. For a county with a fragile diversity of wildlands, streams, estuaries, beaches, tide pools, ocean, it’s time to understand why the state’s plastic bag ban makes serious sense. That’s especially true for us plastic bag lovers. O.C. JOINS MAINSTREAM, ALMOST Know-nothings scoff at Orange County bucking the environmental awareness trend. Republicans, they say, don’t care about bags that destroy ecosystems, kill birds, harm fish. That’s silly. Plenty of Republicans are environmentalists. But even if environmental issues were divided along political lines, the Orange County of today is far different than the Orange County of my grandparents. In last week’s election, more people in the O.C. voted for Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump. That’s right, the county with an airport named after John Wayne and home to the library and museum of Richard Nixon is Clinton country. Put another way, Orange County is no longer an outlier in California politics. For better or worse, we’ve joined the Golden State’s mainstream. Orange County followed statewide voting patterns in 13 of the 17 initiatives. We said yes to marijuana; we decided porn stars don’t need to wear condoms; we even voted for further restrictions on firearms and ammunition. But – oddly – when it came to plastic bags, only 323,378 of us said ban them. Another 458,527 said keep them. My review of precinct breakdowns found that the only clusters in Orange County where the bag ban initiative flourished was near UCI and in Laguna Beach. Reasons vary for our love affair with plastic bags. We use them for lunch, for storage. Many of us like plastic bags because we think they are convenient. Some – like me – use them to scoop up dog poop. When I cleaned up after two dogs, it seemed like I couldn’t get enough of what I thought of as free bags. But nothing’s free. The plastic bag industry in California is an estimated $15 million a year business. It’s no surprise that a pro-bag lobby called the American Progressive Bag Alliance spent millions of dollars to delay SB 270, a bill approved by the California legislature a few years ago to ban bags. That’s right. The initiative we voted on last week was a do-over. With plastic bags going away, I decided to give cloth bags a try. Guess what? Other than having to remember to bring the darn things, I discovered I like cloth bags. Unlike plastic bags and the corresponding busted milk jugs, cloth bags don’t break. Best of all, they hold more groceries – and that means fewer trips from the car to the kitchen. A lot fewer trips. That’s just the beginning. JUST ONE WORD – PLASTICS There are 42 miles of beachfront in Orange County and if you’ve ever walked the sand, swam offshore, surfed, then you probably have hollered, “jellyfish,” only to discover a very yucky plastic bag. Bill Hickman is Southern California regional manager for the Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on ocean and beach. One of its main missions is to reduce single-use plastics and increase the recycling of all plastics. That includes banning plastic bags. I tick off Orange County’s voting numbers for Proposition 67 and Hickman admits, “It’s frustrating Orange County hasn’t come around.” Despite the promise of plastics in the classic film “The Graduate,” Hickman explains when it rains, plastics are swept to the beaches along concrete riverbeds and into the ocean by storm drains. “Those little plastic bags are an immediate threat to wildlife, sea turtles.” The regional director lives in Ventura County and once spotted a cormorant that had been strangled by a plastic bag. So with the bag ban, should I buy those blue dog poop bags? Hickman says blue bags aren’t much better – unless they end up in an industrial dump. Instead, he offers a free solution: Look around, it’s surprising how many bags we have – bread bags, produce bags, bags from cereal boxes. Hickman offers another reason Orange County voters said no to the bag ban: We bought into the bag lobby’s claim that the bag ban is a money grab. Ouch. But according to ballotpedia.com, “Supporters raised $3.66 million, while opponents received $6.14 million. Most of the opposition’s funds came from plastic bag companies.” The state’s official election guide offers this official statement from Proposition 67 opponents: “It is a $300 million per year hidden tax increase on California consumers who will be forced to pay a minimum 10 cents for every paper and thick plastic grocery bag they are given at the checkout.” That may be true – but not if we bring our own bags. I suggest cloth.

How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock Walmart will as often is the case shave off 99c of the Nintendo suggested price. The white $99 New Nintendo 3DS is listed here and the black $99 New Nintendo 3DS is listed here. The title of the listings is a bit curious. Walmart calls the $99 3DS "New Nintendo 3DS Super Mario Edition." The 3DS is decorated with Mushroom Kingdom characters and imagery. Why Walmart calls it Super Mario is unclear.  The New Nintendo 3DS system combines portable gaming in a compact size with 3D technology, added control features and interchangeable Cover Plates. Take 3D photos, connect with friends, and enhance your gaming experiences with added amiibo support. The 3DS is recommended for kids seven and older, because of the 3D display. Walmart is known break sales embargoes, but we don't believe that Walmart will start to sell the New Nintendo 3DS before Nov. 25, Black Friday 2016. In an earlier report we compare the new $99 New Nintendo 3DS to other 3DS bundles. There is good chance that there will be a better deal on a New Nintendo 3DS XL with game comes in at a better deal.

November 11, 2016 08:00 ET Orbital Tracking Corp. Reports Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results Quarterly Revenue Grows 32%, Reaching Record Levels Driven by Strong EU Sales Despite Ongoing Currency Devaluations AVENTURA, FL--(Marketwired - November 11, 2016) - Orbital Tracking Corp. (OTCQB: TRKK) ("Orbital Tracking" or the "Company"), today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Third Quarter 2016 Highlights In August, Global Telesat Communications Ltd. ("GTCL"), the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, was selected by the Electoral Commission of Zambia ("ECZ") to provide more than 200 satellite phones, satellite broadband terminals, associated airtime and customer support services to ECZ and its staff during the country's presidential elections which took place on August 11th. This is the largest sale of its kind awarded to GTCL in Africa. In September, Orbital Satcom Corp. ("OSC"), the Company's U.S.-based wholly owned subsidiary, expanded its North American online retail channel through Walmart's invite-only Marketplace at www.walmart.com. The Walmart online marketplace joins a growing list of U.S.-based e-commerce marketplaces operated by Orbital Tracking under the OSC brand including sites on Amazon.com, eBay and Sears.com. "We are pleased with the top-line growth recorded in the third quarter of 2016, traditionally one of the Company's strongest, as sales volumes reached record levels. Demand in our global markets in Europe remained high and were bolstered by significant new contracts in emerging markets such as in Africa with the ECZ and in the US as we continue to expand our presence in North America," said David Phipps, Chief Executive Officer of Orbital Tracking Corp. "Our global growth plans for Orbital Tracking Corp. remain on track despite the continued negative impact of devaluation of the GBP is having on GTC sales and our margins as reported in our financial results. We continue to invest in the business, expanding both our product portfolio and market reach which will help mitigate continued currency volatility while helping ensure we continue to deliver the best satellite communications and tracking solutions available combined with unmatched service and support that our customers expect." Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results For the three months ended September 30, 2016, consolidated revenues reached record levels, increasing 32% to approximately $1,299,373 as compared to approximately $982,775 as reported for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 28% to approximately $3,783,230 vs approximately $2,955,453 reported in the comparable 2015 period. Although product volume sales were at record levels during the third quarter, results continued to show the negative impact of depreciation in the GBP and EUR against the US$. Comparable revenue for the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries, GTCL and Orbital Satcom Corp.("OSC"), increased 53.5% to approximately $998,878 and decreased 1.6% to approximately $326,833, respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Total GTCL sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased 34% to approximately $2,082,863. Total sales for OSC for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased 13.6% to approximately $991,422. The Company recorded net loss before income tax of approximately $338,672 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of $300,584, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss of $1,452,463 as compared to a net loss of $955,185. The increase in losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is attributable to interest and professional fees related to the Company's convertible debt and preferred share subscriptions in December 2015, offset by a decrease in stock based compensation.

The remodel provides expanded hardware and automotive departments, a refreshed electronics department and six new self-checkout stations. Customers will also appreciate improved customer service areas, including Money Services and Walmart Pickup. Shopping is more convenient than ever as Prince Frederick residents can shop millions of items on Walmart.com, many of which can be shipped for free to any Walmart store through Walmart Pickup. The store also has a remodeled pharmacy with a full range of products and services and immunizations offered in a private consultation room. Walmart pharmacists are ready to assist customers with product and prescription questions. Prince Frederick residents can easily transfer prescriptions and order refills on the go with the Walmart mobile app. “We are looking forward to re-introducing our store to the community with expanded offerings and a fresh look. Our everyday low prices will remain the same, but we’re adding greater convenience and a new and improved local grocery shopping experience,” said Tim Crowley, store manager. Join the Grand Opening Celebration Local associates will provide a special welcome to members of the Prince Frederick community with a grand reopening celebration. A brief ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held on Friday, Nov. 11, at 7 a.m. followed by family activities and free food samples while supplies last. On Saturday, Nov. 12 from 10 a.m. – noon and Sunday, Nov. 13, from noon to 5 p.m., customers can enjoy a grand reopening event with sampling and family friendly activities and special guests, the Prince Frederick police and fire department that will offer safety tips and fire prevention information. Job Opportunities At Walmart, associates have access to competitive wages, affordable benefits and the chance to build a career. More than 75% of store management teams started as hourly associates, and 40 percent of those promotions went to associates within the first year of their employment. Committed to the Community Walmart is committed to serving the Prince Frederick community and will support organizations through an approximate $2,000 investment in the coming months. The commitment to community goes beyond philanthropy. This investment is a whole company undertaking that is woven into Walmart’s day-to-day business activities, creating value by accelerating job mobility, developing suppliers and small businesses, lowering the environmental footprint of Walmart’s operations and more.   This entry was posted on November 11, 2016 at 7:18 am and is filed under All News, Business, Calvert News, Community, County, More News, Press Releases, z 600X120 Top Ad Top.

This year Walmart has debuted some of its most tempting deals on TVs, toys, electronics and more on its smartphone app so savvy shoppers can get a head start on their holiday gift lists. Stores will open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving and there will be a few items available only at the brick-and-mortar locations but you may be able to find everything you’ve been looking for at Walmart.com where you can shop all day Thursday, November 24. Here’s a taste of the Black Friday deals to check out at Walmart. TVs Hot deals on big-screen TVs include a Samsung 50” Smart 4KTV for $398, a discount of $230. Walmart also offers four Special Buys: a Phillips 55” Smart 4KTV for $298, a Vizio 60” HDTV for $298, a 50” HDTV for $225 and a 40” HDTV for $125. The brands on the last two were not named and will vary from store to store. Plus a 40” Hisense or Class Element HDTV is also $125. If you choose a non-smart TV, you can still stream hundreds of movies and TV shows with the Roku Express Plus, now just $25. Complete the entertainment package with a Sanyo Blu-ray disc player for $35. Hundreds of DVD titles are on sale starting at just $1.96 and Blu-ray titles starting at $5.96. Gaming Walmart is always one of the best places to score the lowest price on all things gaming and this year is no exception. Sure to be a hit it is a PlayStation 4 Slim Uncharted 4 500GB bundle with $30 gift card for $249, a saving of $50. The XBox One S 500GB white Battlefield bundle is also on sale for $250, a discount of $50. Select top video game titles are now $27 each, a discount of $32.88. This includes assorted newly-released video games. Walmart stores will be offering wristbands for select items to in-store customers two hours ahead of time.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Hatchimals Walmart Black Friday Deal Is Most Surprising Posted: Nov 11 2016, 12:41am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 13 2016, 8:43am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links.   Buy This Now On Amazon The Hatchimals Black Friday deal advertised in the Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad raises a lot of questions. The Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad advertises Hatchimals for $48.88. This is a head-scratcher as Hatchimals are the hottest holiday toy of 2016 and are sold out for the most part. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals Walmart's Black Friday event has a dramatic scale. The retail giant operates over 5,000 stores in the United States. For Walmart to decide to feature Hatchimals in their ad needs be based on a the availability of a very large inventory of Hatchimals.  Hatchimals Eggs are on sale for the Black Friday price already now at walmart.com, but to find the deal in stock is difficult. As reported, I managed to find a $48.88 Hatchimal online at walmart.com earlier this week. Spin Master, maker of Hatchimals, has warned consumers that the demand for Hatchimals is outpacing demand in the Holiday season and sets exceptions for increased supply coming in 2017. Walmart must be hoarding Hatchimals in their warehouses for the Walmart Black Friday sale.  There is no information about how many Hatchimals Eggs each Walmart store will have in stock and if the Hatchimals Black Friday deal will also be available online as it is now, in case there is stock. Walmart did mention the $48.88 Hatchimals Black Friday deal in the Black Friday 2016 ad announcement, which gives the deal additional attention. Walmart knows based on their decades of Black Friday sales experience, that things can quickly go wrong when extremely popular deals are in short supply in stores. We have seen physical violence as recently as last year of shoppers fighting for items in Walmart stores. The Hatchimals Black Friday deal is prone to trigger out of control situation. Hatchimals resell for about $150 on Amazon and eBay. This means that not just parents will be gunning for the Hatchimals in the Walmart Black Friday sale, it will be scalpers as well. Prices of Hatchimals are likely still to increase closer to the Holidays. Depending on the amount of Hatchimals coming into the reseller market after Black Friday, there might be a brief drop in prices.  So far only Walmart has announced Black Friday Hatchimals deals. Target for instance did not decide to advertise Hatchimals in the Target Black Friday 2016 Ad. We have a feeling that the ToysRUs Black Friday 2016 Ad will feature Hatchimals. ToysRUs has a history of offering hard to find holiday toys as doorbusters on Black Friday. Update: The ToysRUs Black Friday 2016 Ad just leaked and does not advertise Hatchimals. Walmart is so far the only store to offer Hatchimals on Black Friday. The Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale begins midnight on Thanksgiving Day online and at 6pm in stores. You can browse the full 36-pages of the Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad online. Walmart will once again open on Thanksgiving Day. The 6pm store opening time is the same as last year. Wristbands for doorbuster deals could be handed out as early as 2 hours before the Walmart Black Friday 2016 sale begins. Ask at your local Walmart store when wristbands have been handed out last year to prepare your shopping schedule. The big three Black Friday 2016 ads are released.

The pickup machine, which remains without an official name, is playing catch up to the changing ways that millennials are shopping at retailers. Stationed inside Walmart store number one, off Walnut Street in Rogers, the large orange pick up machine is hard to miss. It currently is the only one located in any Walmart around the world, and remains in test mode. A growing demand for online shopping and picking purchases up in-store has the retail giant finding ways to streamline the process. "We're jumping up from one or two [in-store pickups] a day to 15 to 20," said Justin Wright, manager of the pickup department. "That's just pickups today." Only general merchandise, which excludes grocery items, can be added to the machine. The process starts when a pickup order is submitted online to the Walnut St. location in Rogers. Employees are then notified and retrieve items for the order, wrap it or box it, and then put it in the machine. "As soon as it's been processed and BIN'd, the customer will be notified within 15 to 20 minutes," Wright said. "When they arrive, they'll check in and an employee will help get their order." Wright said that in other stores, pickup items are behind the customer service desk, but using the pickup vending machine has already proved to be a time-saver for both employees and customers. No extra cost for using the service is added to a customers bill. "It helps the customer, in and out, even if they're done shopping, they can pick their stuff up," Wright said. "It's very time saving, and it doesn't keep your associates locked down so they can help in other spots."

Arturo Garcia Updated: Nov 11, 2016 Share - - Claim: A woman pulled a Muslim woman's hijab inside a Walmart and told her, "Go hang yourself with it around your neck." unproven Example: [Collected via Email, November 2016] Origin:On 9 November 2016, a Muslim woman named Maha Abdul Gawad posted the following story on Facebook of a confrontation she alleged took place at a WalMart store in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 presidential election won by Donald Trump: My first racist encounter after our new joke of a president, as I am at Wallmart [sic] today a woman came up to me and pulled my Hijab of and said "this is not allowed anymore, so go hang yourself with it around your neck not on your head" I am traumtized. [sic] He post was soon shared thousands of times and was also posted on Walmart's Facebook timeline. The company has not responded to that post, but a company spokesperson told snopes.com on 10 November 2016 that they was trying to establish contact with Gawad to obtain more information about the alleged incident. Walmart also sent snopes.com the following statement on 11 November 2016: We take what has been alleged seriously We attempted to look into this matter but have been unable to verify that the claim posted to Facebook by a customer actually took place, and the page has been removed. Gawad has not responded to our request for an interview. Police in her community (which we will not reveal to protect her safety) said they had not been contacted regarding such an encounter. Gawad's post is one of several stories of anti-Islam (and other) harassment that have circulated online since Donald Trump was elected president. Another Muslim woman described a similar incident in New Mexico on Twitter, in a post that has been shared more than 17,000 times. Guys, a trump supporter tried pulling off my hijab... This is not a joke anymore, all non-whites have become targets. Stay safe ? — bye (@Palestixian) November 9, 2016 The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), a leading American Muslim advocacy group, has already called on Trump to "repudiate" such attacks. The group's communications director, Ibrahim Hooper, told us: We're hoping that perhaps Donald Trump as president will be different than he was while campainging for the presidency. We'll just have to see. We're just gonna maintain our defense of civil rights and religious freedom and any time those rights are challenged, we're gonna speak up and take legal action. Hooper did note that one woman recanted her initial account of an attack at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. But even that case, he said, could be connected to an increase in phone calls CAIR has received from Muslim Americans facing mental health issues: I think it is symptomatic of the real anxiety and stress in the American Muslim community. It kind of brings this issues to the surface.

Published Nov 10th, 2016 6:05 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas In an effort to boost online sales and give shoppers an easier experience Walmart U.S. has added a mobile check-in feature for its stores with an online grocery pickup service. The retailer announced the launch Thursday (Nov. 10), three weeks ahead of Thanksgiving. Sam’s Club has offered mobile check-in, but this is Walmart’s first attempt at the service for its growing grocery pickup business that will be available in 100 markets by the end of the year. Walmart recently turned on the mobile check-in option in all of the markets offering online grocery pickup at stores. Once a shopper places an online grocery order and receives a confirmation that it’s ready for pickup the customer uses the Walmart Grocery app to “check-in” when they are about to go to the store. The “check-in” status then signals store employees to begin assembling items in the customer’s order. As the customer pulls into the pickup area the employee is there waiting ready to load the grocery order into the customer’s vehicle. Walmart is hoping an easier process for customers to order online and pickup groceries will pay big dividends. Tina Budnaitis, Walmart store manager at the Pleasant Grove supercenter in Rogers, said the soft test of the mobile pickup was popular with customers once they tried it. She said it saves them three or four minutes in the pickup process, or maybe longer if the order also includes Walmart.com general merchandise item like a chair that has to be pulled from the back of the store. “Customers who use the mobile check-in can now have their grocery order and general merchandise ready to load when they pull into the bay. We still offer the in-store pickup option with the kiosk and waiting area at the front of the store for those who want to come inside and buy a few more items they have left off the list,” Budnaitis told Talk Business & Politics. When asked how she expected the service would be used ahead of Thanksgiving, she said each holiday pickup is growing in popularity with customers because it also helps them have more time planning for the holiday meal and less time shopping for the ingredients. “We have some customers who basically do their entire holiday cooking order online, including the turkey. We expect that will continue,” she said. Logistically, Budnaitis said the mobile check-in option sends a ping to a store once the shopper is on their way. The previously packed order is pulled onto the cart, the frozen and refrigerated items are added last. Once the shopper pulls into the parking lot another ping is sent to the employee’s tablet to alert them to head for the pickup delivery area. “We require shoppers pull into the bay and we are there waiting when they do, within a second or two,” she added. Michael Bender, Walmart.com executive, said earlier this year that 90% of Walmart grocery pickup users are repeat customers. Walmart has not said how many of its store customers are using the service. Walmart continues to offer promotions in some markets to spur demand for the service with incentives of $10 or more for using it or referring it to friends. Walmart continues to say its own feedback relative to pickup is overwhelmingly positive. Getting people to try the service the first time is perhaps the largest hurdle given that consumers are creatures of habit and shopping for groceries online is still far from mainstream. Keith Anderson, vice president of strategy and insight for Profitero, told Talk Business & Politics that pickup grocery is more costly for Walmart to operate than the traditional store model because of the added labor costs for picking and processing the online orders. He said Walmart isn’t offering pickup necessarily to get new customers but to give its customer base another way to purchase groceries. “It’s not a purely defensive play against competitors. It’s about retaining the shoppers they already have,” Anderson said. Other retail experts applaud Walmart’s grocery pickup strategy that is now also offered in select markets by its largest U.S. grocery competitors, H-E-B, Kroger and Publix. Another aspect of offering the mobile check-in option is that it drives shoppers to the Walmart mobile app, where they can use WalmartPay, activate Savings Catcher and automate prescription refills. Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail, said the retailer can also gain benefits from the mobile check-in feature in addition to the customer benefits, but the added service will require additional pressure on Walmart to execute flawlessly and consistently on a store-by-store basis, regardless of store traffic volumes and staff levels. Shoppers are doing their part, Walmart will be expected to do the same, she said. “Although privacy concerns might be a major obstacle, it will be interesting to see if geolocation and the ability for Walmart to track a shopper’s journey to the store will be a possibility,” Spieckerman added.

Posted on October 31, 2016 By Dana Williamson BURNS FLAT—WANTED: Missionary. Must be friendly with outgoing personality. Must love people, know the Bible and yearn to share the love of Jesus with others, praying for them and inviting them to church. Apply at Walmart. While it is unlikely that Walmart or any retailer would pay for an ad like this. If they did, Hazel Fleming would fit the bill perfectly. A member of Burns Flat, First for nearly 30 years, Fleming spends a part of most days at the Walmart in Elk City, just a few miles down the road from her home church. “Because she’s done such a great job witnessing to folks there, we’re going to commission her as our ‘Walmart missionary,’” said Carl Thionnet, interim pastor. Carl Thionnet, director of missions for Concor-Kiowa Association, and interim pastor at Burns Flat, First, stands in front of the church building where he was baptized as an 8-year-old. The original structure was maintained as the church built on to it with a new worship center and educational space Thionnet, director of missions for Concord-Kiowa Association, has been interim pastor at Burns Flat, First since the first Sunday in July. During that time, Sunday School attendance has grown from about 30 to more than 70, and the church has baptized nine people, with Sept. 11 designated as “Baptism Day.” One of those baptized was a lady Fleming met at Walmart and invited to have coffee. Fleming asked her several questions, including if she liked Sunday School and if she was saved. Her answer to the latter question was “I try to be.” Fleming encouraged the woman, who was a Jehovah’s Witness, to attend Sunday School, which she did for a few weeks before coming to a Wednesday night service. After that service, Thionnet talked with her, and she accepted Jesus as her Savior. Some of the others baptized were preteen prospects who had made professions of faith at camp and Vacation Bible School, but who had never had any follow-up. “Our members started making follow-up visits and found several who wanted to be baptized,” said Thionnet. He said the mother of one of the boys who was baptized had just died, and he was crushed because she wouldn’t be able to see him baptized. “Church members stepped in and helped the family anyway we could, and since they didn’t have any place to hold the funeral, we had the services here at the church.” Fleming, who is the church’s pianist, said she started going to Walmart after her husband died, because “that’s where the people are.” “I would go drink coffee there and get involved with people,” she explained. “Everyone has a story, and God showed me how to pray for people in the check-out line. Everybody needs encouragement and a smile.” Fleming said she is especially drawn to women with broken hearts, those who have known tragedy.  One of the people she has been ministering to is a woman who works in the meat department and has cancer. Her grandson was recently baptized in the church as a result of Fleming’s witness. Occasionally the tables are turned on Fleming, and she is the one ministered to. She was recently on crutches, and a man in the congregation noticed her using her crutches to get to the piano. “Someone began taking out my trash, and I thought it was our pastor at the time,” Fleming recalled. “Then one day, while I was in line at Walmart, this man said to me, “I’m your mystery man.” “That turned heads in this small town,” laughed Fleming. “I didn’t know the man, but later learned he attended our church. He is a one-armed, born-again Catholic, and was helping me because I was on crutches.” Thionnet said since he has been interim, the church has been through the Connect>1 Evangelism Campaign’s 3151 Challenge, and he preaches a lot about reaching people. Thionnet has a special place in his heart for the Burns Flat church because that is where he was saved as an 8-year-old boy. He grew up in Burns Flat and attended school there. “There are enough people in Burns Flat to make a difference,” he said. “The success we’ve had over the last few months is because everybody is working together.” He said they are in the talking stages of starting a new Sunday School class for young adults, as a result of four young couples who have started attending. “I’m having fun, and it’s exciting to see people taking hold of what we are trying to do,” Thionnet said. Fleming gives credit to Thionnet for encouraging members to be involved with people. “He might be out driving around and stop and talk to someone and pray with them,” she noted. “Brother Carl is approachable. He listens to people, and they are comfortable with him.” The two seem to have a mutual admiration for each other. “Much of what has happened over the last few months is because God has gifted Hazel with a desire to talk to people and tell them about Jesus,” Thionnet said.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking Washington Post Nov 10, 2016 at 4:04 pm | Print View Wal-Mart and Target each plan to kick off their in-store Black Friday sales at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, repeating their start-times from last year and throwing some cold water on the notion that Turkey Day deals blitzes may be falling out of style. Earlier in the season, the Mall of America announced it would be shuttering its doors on the holiday after being open in previous years. Office Depot made a similar reversal of course. But the plans from the big-box behemoths — as well as from Macy’s, Kohl’s and Toys R Us — suggest the Thanksgiving Day shopping tradition is going strong. Wal-Mart said it will be “dramatically increasing” the amount of inventory it has available for online deal hunters, offering some 50 percent more Black Friday merchandise this year on the Web than last year. “We really pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price but then only has a few available for the customers,” said Steve Bratspies, the chief merchandising officer at Wal-Mart U.S., during a conference call with reporters. In earlier announcements about their seasonal plans, Target and Wal-Mart stressed they were trying to focus on making their promotions simple this year. In the past, it seems, shoppers have been confused by a cavalcade of coupons or staggered sale starting times. At Target, that means returning to the “10 days of deals” program, something the retailer tried last year in which it touted a single big promotion each day starting the weekend before Thanksgiving. Wal-Mart also is aiming for simple: Besides its limited-time Black Friday discounts, it plans to keep the rest of its price cuts in place for the duration of the November and December rush. Target and Wal-Mart will start their online Black Friday sales in the early morning hours on Thanksgiving. And both will be offering a steady trickle of discounts over the next two weeks to encourage customers to get in the holiday spirit. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts that the nation’s retailers will ring up a healthy 3.6 percent increase in sales this holiday season. That would be an improvement from last year, when sales growth was up just 3 percent. Your next Business articles McDonald's tests Big Mac with a Sriracha ...

Welcome Home North Carolina – also known as NCServes – launched as a pilot program last year with the help of an initial $1 million grant from the Walmart Foundation. The foundation is contributing the extra money to expand the program because of its early success, foundation officials announced this week. The program has helped more than 450 service members, veterans and their family members. The latest money will support veterans in the western N.C. Piedmont, the N.C. coast and in San Antonio, Texas, officials said. [RELATED: $1 million gift to launch vet support plan] Welcome Home North Carolina is a three-year initiative guided by the Institute for Veterans and Military Families, a New York-based organization that solves issues facing former service personnel and their families. A national search by the Walmart Foundation revealed Charlotte is ahead of many other communities in its work to coordinate services for veterans, Kathleen McLaughlin, the foundation’s president, said when the program launched last year. She cited the work of Charlotte Bridge Home, a nonprofit created in 2012 to help recently discharged vets return to civilian life, and strong corporate support, particularly from Bank of America.

Home Mail Search News Cricket Movies Lifestyle Celebrity Flickr Mobile Answers More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us National World US Elections Finance Cricket Lifestyle Sports Good News Videos Autos Walmart is kicking off Black Friday immediately — but there's a catch Hayley Peterson10 November 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share   Walmart just kicked off some of its Black Friday deals more than two weeks before the shopping holiday. But there's a small catch: the deals are available only to users of Walmart's app for now. The discounts available through the app include a Hitachi 65-inch 4K Ultra HDTV for $599 ($400 savings), an Xbox One S 500 GB Minecraft console with a bonus controller for $279 ($20 savings), and an Acer 15.6-inch Core i5 laptop for $299 ($150 savings). The rest of Walmart's Black Friday deals will become available to all customers online at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day, the company said. The in-store event featuring "doorbuster" deals like $230 off a $628 Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV will kick off at 6 p.m. that day, which is in line with what the company did last year. Some industry experts have said the significance of Black Friday is diminishing as an increasing number of retailers start offering holiday discounts days and weeks before the shopping day. But Walmart's chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said Black Friday remained the biggest shopping event of the year. "We think it's still the biggest event in retail that customers get really excited about," he said Wednesday in a call with reporters. walmart black fridayMore (An employee adjusting a large ribbon on a television display at Walmart in preparation for Black Friday in Los Angeles in 2014.REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn) In preparation for this year's demand, the retailer has increased its Black Friday merchandise by 50% on Walmart.com over last year. "I said it before and I will say it again: We will win the season on price — on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday, and every day before and after," Bratspies said. "That means delivering the Black Friday deals we're known for in stores, online, and on our app. And, we've secured significant availability of these items.

Woman allegedly tries to grab cop's gun during arrest Sara Nealeigh , Reporter 12:28 a.m. EST November 11, 2016 Zenobia D. Gore (Photo: Photo courtesy of the Ross County Sheriff's Office) 165 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE CHILLICOTHE - Amidst an altercation with officers Wednesday, a woman allegedly attempted to grab an officer's gun and is now facing a felony charge. Chillicothe Police reports say the woman, 36-year-old Zenobia D. Gore, was detained in Walmart's loss prevention office during a theft investigation when the incident occurred. Gore was later charged with aggravated robbery, a first-degree felony, and theft, a first-degree misdemeanor. The incident began when a Kohl's loss prevention officer alerted Walmart to the possible theft after seeing people open packages of fishing wire and line in the store and place the items in Kohl's bags, according to reports. An officer and detective responded to Walmart at 2:42 p.m. and spoke with loss prevention officials, Gore, and two men about the reported theft. The men, Shawn A. Snow and Stephen V. McComis, allegedly selected three packages of fishing line and two packages of fishing wire from Walmart, concealed them and walked out of the store without paying for the items, the reports said. While Snow and McComis were picking up the fishing items, Gore allegedly grabbed a package of toothpaste and a body spray. Gore was initially detained after she allegedly tried to return the fishing supplies to the Walmart service desk. McComis and Snow were taken into custody as they tried to leave the store after the return. Gore told police the men didn't say the items she returned were stolen, but she "kinda knew" they were and was going to be given money for making the transaction, according to reports. Following the officer's interview with Gore, she became upset and yelled that she didn't want to go back to jail, reports said. She was told to sit on the bench, to which she complied but became more upset. She screamed, grabbed a pack of toothbrushes officials said she attempted to steal from the store, and tried to brush her teeth, according to reports. As the officer struggled with Gore, the detective heard the officer yell "let go of my gun" twice. Once the detective detained Snow, who was also seated on the bench, the detective helped the officer secure Gore. Gore, Snow and McComis were eventually put into police cruisers and taken to the Ross County Jail. While in the cruiser, Gore began hitting her head, according to reports. Pepper spray had little to no effect, but when she was taken out of the cruiser was able to calm down. Chillicothe Fire Department EMS crews were called to treat a laceration. Gore refused to be taken to the hospital and was taken to jail, reports showed. McComis and Snow were both charged with one count of theft, a first-degree misdemeanor. Stephen V.

Walmart sells a variety of Egyptian cotton sheet sets. It used to sell more, but in September, the company pulled two brands' 400 thread count sheet sets off store shelves for possibly containing "non-Egyptian cotton fibers."  The two brands ��������� Better Homes and Gardens and Canopy ��������� had their sheets manufactured by Welspun India. Walmart offered a refund to any customer who had purchased the products. SEE MORE: This Hair Care Company Could Owe Its Customers Millions The class action lawsuit alleges Walmart "questioned the fiber content" of the products as early as 2008 but kept them on the shelves until this year. When Walmart pulled the sheets in 2016, a Wall Street Journal reporter asked the company about its 2008 investigation. A company spokeswoman told the publication, "Welspun was able to show us its supplies of Egyptian cotton were sufficient to meet all of Walmart's orders. At that time, we were reassured." But the woman alleges either Walmart did know about the lower-standard cotton in 2008, or it "did not conduct an adequate investigation or maintain sufficient quality control practices" at the time. The lawsuit claims Walmart only stopped selling the products after its competitor Target found in August that the Welspun-made sheets contained "inferior and less expensive cottons." The woman also accuses Walmart of violating the U.S. Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, because the sheets it sold falsely claimed to be "100% Egyptian cotton." The lawsuit seeks damages for any customers who purchased the linens.

CST November 10, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST For Walmart shoppers, the post-Thanksgiving Black Friday shopping frenzy starts today, Thursday. After midnight, shoppers who have downloaded the Walmart app can grab some Black Friday specials, including a $79 seven-foot trampoline, an Acer laptop for under $300, and a 65-inch Hitachi 4K Ultra HDTV . The offerings are just a hint of what's to come. Most of the discounts will become available at 12:01 a.m. Thanksgiving day, with the in-store "doorbuster" specials kicking off at 6 p.m. that evening. With some shoppers griping about the bait and switch at some retailers that advertise a dea,l but have so few items they’re gone in minutes, Walmart says it will make sure it’s well stocked. The world’s biggest retailer says it will have nearly 2 million tablets and computers, 3 million video games and and over 1.5 million TVs at the ready for purchase in store and online. Though some retail watchers have said that Black Friday is losing some of its luster, with shoppers grabbing deals on Cyber Monday and even Thanksgiving Day, Walmart says that the traditional kick off to the holiday shopping season remains a main event. “I don’t expect to see any kind of decline (on) Black Friday,’’ said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer for Walmart U.S.  Though shopping via keyboard continues to increase, “traffic continues to grow in the stores while we continue to grow our online business.’’ CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS 4-year-old killed as mom is robbed Search for missing mother from Spring Mother accused of stashing exotic animals Woman accused of punching police horse faces judge HISD trustee's tweet compares Trump to Hitler Cy-Fair ISD teacher charged with sexual assault How Trump's immigration plan impacts Houston Trump gives first interview since winning presidential election More Stories Bishops elect Houston's Cardinal Daniel DiNardo to… Nov 15, 2016, 9:17 a.m. Robbers kill little girl, wound sibling and mom Nov 14, 2016, 9:11 p.m. Family disturbance, shooting kills 1 near Katy Nov 15, 2016, 10:05 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Lawyers for the Ohio Casualty Insurance Company and Liberty Insurance Underwriters asked a judge on Wednesday to enforce subpoenas served on Morgan and his fellow passengers for documents involving the settlement - rumored to be as much as $90 million - according to filings seen exclusively by DailyMail.com. Wal-Mart coughed up the sum after one of its truck drivers crashed into a limousine carrying 30 Rock star Morgan, his assistant, the driver, and comedians Harris Stanton, Ardie Fuqua and James McNair at the New Jersey turnpike in 2014. Scroll down for video  Morgan was spotted driving around New York in his Lamborghini in July 2015. Wal-Mart's hasty settlement has been blasted by its insurers who say the retail giant paid out without conducting proper checks One of Walmart's drivers crashed into Morgan's limousine (pictured in an image released by the NTSB to show the damage), leaving the comedian with a brain injury and fractures The insurers, who are trying to avoid taking the hit for the payments, believe Morgan's health problems can be disproved. Morgan is pictured in July 2014, one month after the crash McNair died in the crash, while Morgan suffered a broken leg, several broken ribs, and a brain injury. He spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab before he could return home. He was also forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold. The star has spoken about how he had to learn how to talk and walk again following the medically induced coma doctors placed him in. But Wal-Mart's hasty settlement has been blasted by its insurers who say the retail giant paid out without conducting proper checks - including that Morgan was spotted walking around New York and driving through the city in his Lamborghini, as well as appearing at the Emmy awards shortly after the settlement. The DailyMail.com previously reported Morgan was refusing to release medical records subpoenaed as part of the legal battle over the Walmart settlement.

Marijuana could be used to help NFL stars¿ pain: Players¿... Share this article Share The exact settlement figure has not been revealed but in court documents they call it a 'staggering and unprecedented' amount to cover Morgan's injuries and his loss of earning potential, and say they are not equipped with the proper information to pay out the sum. They accuse Wal-Mart of not getting their approval of the amount of settlement paid to Morgan and his friends, and therefore they don't believe they are responsible for the settlement payments. Last month, the insurers wrote a letter to the judge explaining they have an issue due to Tracy Morgan refusing to hand over his medical records to them, which they need to build their case in the legal battle.  In their latest missive they complain that subpoenas for the documents they requested were served over seven months ago and they have received nothing since then.  Comedian Tracy Morgan (pictured left in September) is accused of refusing to hand over medical records and other documents ordered as part of a legal battle over a multi-million dollar crash settlement paid out to him by supermarket Walmart In October Morgan hit the stage to a sold out audience at Dover Downs - the exact same stage he performed at before being involved in the fatal traffic accident in 2014 Morgan (center) welcomed fellow comedians, Ardie Fuqua (left) and Harris Stanton (right), on stage with him. Fuqua and Stanton were involved in the fatal accident with Morgan in 2014 Prior to the October show starting, Morgan shared a photo to Instagram, where he is seen kneeling and bowing his head over the empty chair dedicated to McNair  Wal-Mart said they clearly had responsibility for the accident, which is why they did the right thing and settled the claims. They also say they were threatened with numerous legal actions including by the Estate of James McNair, noting that none of the claims against them went to trial because they chose to settle all of them as a 'business decision'.  The supermarket chain accuses their insurers of being 'unnaturally obsessed' with the case, and say they are dragging it out and looking for excuses not to pay the money. Wal-Mart said four of their other insurers paid out on their policies, with the only exception being Ohio Casualty. Ohio Casualty says it wants more information, including all documents related to the settlement between Morgan and Wal-Mart and all medical records following the accident.  They also want all Morgan's federal and state tax returns from 2009-2014, all documents showing his future earning potential, and ll financial documents that relate to his earning for the five years prior to the accident - plus the list of medicines he was prescribed after the crash and any examinations he received afterward, including financial records, bills and invoices related to his mental condition, illnesses and disability. In mid-October Morgan returned to the stage at Dover Downs, where he performed to a packed-out audience - the exact same stage he performed at before being involved in the fatal crash. He also shared a photo to Instagram of himself kneeling and bowing his head over an empty audience chair dedicated to McNair.  Morgan's friend,  comic James McNair died in the crash when a tractor-trailer driven by Walmart employee Kevin Roper slammed into the back of their limo van (pictured on its side) Morgan spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home. Pictured is the Walmart truck after the crash But behind the scenes, the insurers are complaining that Morgan's lawyer is saying he has none of the documents they are requesting. The insurance company's attorney is demanding the judge either order them to search their devices again for the documents or they be made available for a deposition where they can be questioned why they have no responsive documents - which they believe is 'impossible'. 'They were provided important documents by Wal-Mart, they provided to Wal-Mart important documents, and Wal-Mart and its attorneys exchanged numerous emails', the insurance company explains in the court filings.  They are also on the hunt for documents related to any request that he appear on Saturday Night Live or The Emmys, as well as any relating to his ability to drive a Lamborghini after the accident 'without creating potential harm to the public'.  The insurers are demanding the judge order Morgan and his attorney to finally hand over the information, or be ordered to take a deposition and explain why there are no records.  Read more: Tracy Morgan 'refuses to release documents subpoenaed as part of legal battle with Walmart' | Daily Mail Online Share or comment on this article e-mail 92 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

Driving the growth is the ramp up of fast grocery delivery services by Amazon and others and the expansion of curbside pickup by Wal-Mart Stores. Also, tech-savvy consumers have an increased comfort level with buying fresh foods online and see ordering groceries through an app as a way to save time and avoid checkout lines. "Online grocery will take off this holiday season, with consumers buying more turkeys, cranberry sauce and stuffing online than ever, as a result of Wal-Mart, Kroger and others ramping up their e-grocery services," said John Mercer, a senior analyst and research head at Fung Global, a retail and technology think tank. Source: Walmart.com Employee fills online grocery order at Wal-Mart store Indeed, Wal-Mart has expanded the range of items this year so consumers looking to avoid crowds at the grocery store this Thanksgiving can order for curbside pickup not just a turkey and all the fixings but a roasting pan, gravy boat and other food prep items. With a minimum $30 grocery order, the pickup is free and available the same day. The Arkansas-based retailer sells upward of 30,000 food items — including fresh produce, meats, dairy, organic groceries and gluten-free items, among other things. It uses personal shoppers to fulfill the order and currently serves about 600 locations, including some just added within the last several weeks. "We've really expanded our footprint and our offering in a very aggressive way just this past year," said Ravi Jariwala, a spokesman for Wal-Mart. "I would say we are probably one of the fastest-growing online grocers in the U.S., just based on the fact that at the start of the fall last year we were in five markets. Today we're in 100." "We believe that the grocery category is likely to be one of the next key areas of e-commerce growth" -Jessica Schoen Mace, Nomura analyst Online grocery purchases are expected to rise nearly 20 percent this year, according to market researcher Technomic. In contrast, the traditional brick-and-mortar supermarkets are projected to see just 2 percent growth in consumer spending. Analysts say the holidays are particularly important for the online grocery delivery sector because there may be more consumers using it not just for restocking the refrigerator and pantry but for fill-in orders when they forget something from the supermarket and don't have time to run out and get it. As it turns out, online grocery shoppers also spend more on average than regular brick-and-mortar store customers and are more apt to continue shopping in cyberspace after they've experienced the service, according to research group Kantar Worldpanel. "We believe that the grocery category is likely to be one of the next key areas of e-commerce growth," Nomura analyst Jessica Schoen Mace said in a research note last month. As of June, only about 1.4 percent of groceries in the roughly $800 billion grocery market were purchased online in the U.S., according to Kantar data. Fung Global expects that number to reach 2 percent or more in 2017. "Consumers are starting to get more exposure to produce that's selected by a third party — and there's more trust," said Erik Thoresen, a principal at Technomic. "I think this will be an important year for us to kind of get a sense of what consumer usage and adoption will be moving forward." Thoresen calls Amazon a "game changer" in terms of knowing what's possible when it comes to buying groceries and getting them delivered the same day. The e-commerce company offers grocery delivery services under several programs, including AmazonFresh, Prime Now and Prime Fresh. While Amazon's grocery delivery services are not available in all markets, the Seattle-based company has been expanding in the past year and its logistics system has enabled it to provide faster delivery of a large number of food items — both packaged and fresh. Also, Amazon lowered its grocery subscription fee last month, a move analysts saw as an attempt to stay competitive with Wal-Mart. "We're very happy with the Amazon Fresh and we have now expanded quite a bit," Amazon.com CFO Brian Olsavsky said last month in discussing the company's third-quarter earnings. Yet there are signs Amazon maybe seeing growing pains with its direct-to-consumer grocery deliveries. For one, AmazonFresh's website cautions, "Due to customer demand, delivery windows may be limited." Amazon did not respond to requests for comment for this story. Besides Amazon, other warehouse-based food delivery services include Peapod, Fresh Direct and MaxDelivery. Also, newer entrants have stiffened competition in the category "We will do nine figures of revenue this year," said Chieh Huang, co-founder and CEO of Boxed.com, a wholesale delivery service selling grocery products and other household items. Just 2 ½ years ago the business was still in Huang's New Jersey garage and now the company operates four fulfillment centers nationally and delivers in all the lower 48 states. At Kroger, the company's ClickList online grocery service is growing and allows consumers at more than 500 locations to select from more than 40,000 items and pick up orders at stores. Last week, the Cincinnati-based supermarket operator told analysts at its investor conference that the ClickList rollout is progressing well Also, Instacart, an app-based retail delivery service, has partnered with Kroger and several other major retailers including Whole Foods, Costco and Target, and this fall began expanding in key U.S. markets. "For the stores, it's a way to maintain their market share," said Patricia Orsini, an analyst at eMarketer. "That's why you're seeing all this growth happening." Target offers Instacart in three markets at present and the retailer also allows customers to select an Order Pickup option for packaged food items, or nonperishables. There's also a cash-back online service known as Shop.com, which has ties to Wal-Mart, Jet.com (recently acquired by Wal-Mart) and others. It gets a commission from retailers starting at 2 percent and sells over a million items, including snacks, beverages and baby foods, as well as other packaged foods and nongrocery products. "We stick to mainly the dry goods area," said Eddie Alberty, vice president of strategic partnerships at Shop.com. "For us it's kind of a walk, crawl and run approach."

Seriously, we've been dying to share this with you all day. "I said it before and I will say it again, we will win the season on price – on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday and every day before and after," said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S. "That means delivering the Black Friday deals we’re known for in stores, online and on our app. And, we’ve secured significant availability of these items. We pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price and then only has a few available." Walmart Black Friday Hours In-store deals start at 6pm local time and, yes, you'll need to get a wristband well ahead of that time to get some of the juiciest doorbusters. However, if leaving your family Thanksgiving to score a cheap TV isn't your cup of tea, the majority of deals will be available online beginning at 12:01am ET on Thanksgiving morning. Walmart said in a Wednesday morning press call there will be 50% more deals on Walmart.com than last year. Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz.

Fletes, cfletes@post-dispatch.com Walmart, Target and Best Buy to kick off Black Friday sales on Thanksgiving By Sarah Halzack • Washington Post Nov 10, 2016 (…) Buy Now Cristina M. Fletes Jesselito Rectín, 45, of Overland, shops at Target in Brentwood on Thursday, Nov. 26, 2015. Photo by Cristina M. Fletes, cfletes@post-dispatch.com Walmart and Target each plan to kick off their in-store Black Friday sales at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, repeating their start-times from last year and throwing some cold water on the notion that Turkey Day deals blitzes may be falling out of style.  Electronics retailer Best Buy says most of its store will open at 5 p.m. on the holiday, close at 1 a.m. on Friday, then reopen at 8 a.m. Friday. Earlier in the season, the Mall of America announced it would be shuttering its doors on the holiday after being open in previous years. Office Depot, too, made a similar reversal of course. But the plans from the big-box behemoths — as well as from Macy's, Kohl's and Toys R Us — suggest the Thanksgiving Day shopping tradition is going strong. Walmart said it will be "dramatically increasing" the amount of inventory it has available for online deal hunters, offering some 50 percent more Black Friday merchandise this year on the Web than last year. "We really pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price but then only has a few available for the customers," said Steve Bratspies, the chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S., during a conference call with reporters. Walmart said its offerings this year would include items such as a Samsung 50-inch 4K television for $398 and movies that cost $1.99. Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Target, meanwhile, was touting deals such as an iPad Air 2 for $274 and 30 percent off apparel. Oh, and remember that giant $10 teddy bear that was all over social media last Black Friday? The retailer is bringing it back, and has bought 20 percent more inventory this time around. Both chains will start their online Black Friday sales in the early morning hours on Thanksgiving. And both will be offering a steady trickle of discounts over the next two weeks to encourage customers to get in the holiday spirit. In earlier announcements about their seasonal plans, Target and Walmart stressed they were trying to focus on making their promotions simple this time around. In the past, it seems, shoppers have been confused by a cavalcade of coupons or staggered sale starting times. At Target, that means returning to the "10 days of deals" program, something the retailer tried last year in which it touted a single big promotion each day starting the weekend before Thanksgiving. Walmart is also aiming for simple: Besides its limited-time Black Friday discounts, it plans to keep the rest of its price cuts in place for the duration of the November and December rush. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts that stores will ring up a healthy 3.6 percent increase in sales this holiday season. That would be an improvement from last year, when sales growth was up just 3 percent. We should soon get a clearer idea of what kind of momentum big retail has headed into this all-important time of year: Macy's is set to report earnings Thursday morning, and Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others will do so in the following week.

Black Friday 2016, which will take place on November 25, is now only 17 days away. While Black Friday is still the most famous day of the year to complete your holiday shopping, many of the sale events will actually begin on Thanksgiving, with others stating as early as Wednesday of that week. Ads have already leaked from a variety of major retailers, including Kohl’s, JCPenney, Costco, Sam’s Club, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Dell, and Bed Bath & Beyond. Even though those are important stores, shoppers are anxiously awaiting the ad releases for Walmart, Best Buy, and Target. Today’s election means none of those ads will be released today, but the good news is they all should be out by Friday. You can see a full selection of the latest 2016 Black Friday ads at BestBlackFriday.com, and Walmart, Best Buy, and Target should be added to the list within the next few days. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. Walmart’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Walmart’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. [Image via Walmart] Walmart’s ad was released on November 11 last year in the middle of the night. A mistake by Walmart actually caused it to be posted on their Twitter account earlier in the evening, but they officially released it on their app a few hours later. Since they usually wait until Best Buy and Target release their ads, Walmart is most likely targeting Thursday, November 10, or Friday, November 11, for their release date. Unless the ad is somehow leaked early, the best place to see it early is by downloading the official Walmart mobile app, via the Walmart website. Their sale is probably going to begin at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving again this year, with online sales potentially starting as early as the Wednesday before Turkey Day. Walmart is also probably going to bring back their “1-hour guarantee” for select doorbusters. This means that a select few in-store-only doorbusters will have their prices guaranteed from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Thanksgiving. If they sell out before the first hour is complete, you will be able to purchase the item in question at a later date for the Black Friday doorbuster price. Walmart is expected to have an abundance of online doorbusters this year, but their free shipping minimum is not exactly a desirable amount. As CNBC reports, you will have to spend at least $50 in order to receive free shipping. Target and Best Buy are both offering free shipping with no minimum order size this holiday season, so it is something to keep in mind when shopping online on Black Friday this year. If you cannot wait until Thanksgiving and Black Friday, Walmart is currently offering a selection of early bird online specials on their website. While some of the offers may be enticing, you are much better off waiting two weeks. Best Buy’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Best Buy’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. [Image via Best Buy] Best Buy’s ad was released on November 10 last year in the very early morning hours. While it has been leaked by third-party websites in the past, Best Buy has posted it on their website in recent years. It is usually only a preview copy of their ad, as the full print copy is not released until a week or so before Black Friday. Regardless, it will contain the majority of the deals. Based on previous years, Best Buy’s ad should be out on Wednesday, November 9, or Thursday, November 10. Rarely has it come after Walmart’s ad, and it usually comes out right after Target releases their ad. While nothing has been confirmed, there have been rumors stating that Best Buy will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. That is the same time they opened last year, so it would not be out of the question. As they did last year, they will most likely offer an assortment of doorbusters on their website. Stores have been moving away from in-store-only sales, and Best Buy has been a willing participant. Additionally, Best Buy should also have a selection of online exclusives, which makes their sale even more intriguing for many shoppers. And finally, Best Buy is offering free shipping with no minimum order size for the duration of the holiday season, as reported by Time Magazine. Target’s Black Friday 2016 Ad Projected Release Date In order to give you an idea of what Target’s ad will look like, you can find a screenshot of the first page of their ad from last year below. [Image via Target] Target’s ad was released on November 8 last year. Rarely does the Target ad leak by a third-party website, as they will post it themselves on their website. In recent years, they have also started an early Black Friday sale on the day they release their ad scan. It usually only contains around 20 to 30 items, but it gives shoppers a taste of what they can expect on Black Friday. Target’s ad should be out on Wednesday, November 9, or Thursday, November 10. It usually comes out before Best Buy and Walmart, so expect this one first. As Reuters first reported, Target will offer free shipping on all orders this holiday season. This matches Best Buy and is better than Kohl’s free shipping minimum of $75, Amazon’s free shipping minimum of $49, and Walmart’s free shipping minimum of $50. If you are behind on your Black Friday coverage this year, take a look at a few posts by the Inquisitr in order to get up to speed.

While leaks had been slow this year prior to Tuesday’s election, the past 24 hours have seen ads from Walmart and Target. As expected, Best Buy is never one to let their competitors steal the spotlight. The 49-page Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad can be seen on BestBlackFriday.com. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. Best Buy’s Opening Time As they did last year, Best Buy will begin their Black Friday sale at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving. This comes an hour earlier than Target and Walmart’s opening time of 6 p.m., and it is among the earlier openings for major retailers. Toys R Us and Macy’s will also open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving this year. While their retail stores will not open until 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, their online site will be open for business the entire day. The sale will continue throughout the night into Black Friday. If history repeats itself, Best Buy will likely have an assortment of sales on the Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday of Thanksgiving week too. It is unknown what time Best Buy will close on Thanksgiving night, but the ad states that Black Friday doorbusters will begin at 8 a.m., which is the same time as last year. Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Ad Important Information and Review [Image via Best Buy] As seen on the first page, Best Buy is offering an assortment of televisions. The most interesting one may be the Toshiba 49-inch Class LED 2160p 4K Ultra HD TV. It will be on sale for $199.99, which is a discount of $250 from its normal retail price of $449.99. This deal is in-store only, which is somewhat surprising with the trend of retailers offering many of their doorbusters online. Another intriguing deal is the LG 60-inch Class LED 2160p Smart 4k Ultra HD TV for $599.99, which is a discount of $400 from its normal retail price of $999.99. This deal is not listed as in-store only, so there is a good chance that you can buy it online. While this will not be the cheapest price for a 60-inch 4K HD TV this year, it does come from a premium brand in LG. Sharp 55-inch Class LED 1080p Smart TV for $249.99 [Image via Best Buy] Best Buy will be selling a Sharp 55-inch Class LED 1080p Smart HD TV for $249.99, which is a savings of $250 from the normal price of $499.99. While this is not a 4K TV, it is still a solid unit. It is also unlikely that another store will beat this price for a 55-inch TV from a premium brand like Sharp. This TV is exclusive to Best Buy and will be available at 8 a.m. on Black Friday. Other Important Deals While these deals may not be as exciting as the ones listed above, they are ones that you should keep your eye on. Samsung 55-inch Class LED 2160p Smart 4k Ultra HD TV for $479.99 (save $320) Popular Movies Starting at $7.99 Free $250 Best Buy Gift Card + Samsung Gear VR with Installment Agreement for a Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge Dell Inspiron 15.6″ Touch-Screen Laptop for $349.99 (save $150) Amazon Fire 7″ Tablet for $33.33 (save $16.66) Save $125 on All 9.7-inch iPad Pros Canon EOS Rebel T6 DSLR Camera Bundle with Free 32 GB Memory Card for $449.99 (save $250) Important Best Buy Shipping Information As reported by CNBC, Best Buy will offer free shipping on all orders with no minimum this holiday season, and that includes Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Compared to the competition, this is a great deal. Walmart currently has a free shipping minimum of $50 for online orders. Amazon has a minimum of $49, and Kohl’s will have a minimum of $75. Out of the major stores, only Target will also offer free shipping on all orders with no minimum. While it may not sound like a huge deal, paying shipping charges on Black Friday can kill an otherwise great deal. Since shipping charges at most stores will only be added to small orders, the chances of shipping costs offsetting the discount are extremely high. As usual, Best Buy’s Black Friday 2016 is already looking strong, and it is going to be a top place to purchase you electronics this year.

Like, really seriously. This year is no exception, and looking through Walmart's Black Friday deals right now, you can tell stores are going to go insane on Thanksgiving. Walmart has provided a list of all its biggest discounts already, even though Black Friday is still weeks away. The headline deals include some truly stupid savings on TVs, a couple cool gadgets that would look good under a Christmas tree, and a whole lot more. DON'T MISS: President Trump could be really bad news for T-Mobile Let's start with the TVs. The blockbuster deal here is a 55-inch Philips Smart 4K TV for $298, which is a very small amount of money to pay for something so big and with so many pixels. I actually own the 65-inch version of that same TV, and while the picture isn't anything to write home about, it's still a great TV for watching movies, and the smart features mean easy YouTube and Netflix. But really, for the price, it could call you names every time you turn it on and still be a great deal. There's other TVs that are going to be available, with most of the best deals on lower-end panels. There's a 60-inch Vizio for $398 and a 50-inch 4K Samsung for $398 as well. Video game consoles are also seeing good prices, with the PS4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4 bundle set for sale at $249 (and a $30 gift card), and the Xbox One S White 500GB Battlefield bundle for $249. Those are equal with the best prices we've seen for console bundles. Drones are another category that Walmart is going big on, with the DJI Drone Phantom Standard 3 for $369, Promark 3D Virtual Reality HD Drone for $99, and Sharper Image Video Drone for $30. More than just the price, though, Walmart execs are promising widespread availability on the best products. Steve Bratspies, the CMO of Walmart, said that "we’ve secured significant availability of these items. We pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price and then only has a few available." To help curtail some of the mad rushes through stores we've seen, Walmart will be using wristbands for some of the more in-demand items. Customers can get a wristband for an item from an associate, then go find the thing, and make it to checkout in two hours. Sales will begin online at 12.01AM ET on Thanksgiving morning, with physical stores opening at 6PM local time on Thanksgiving Day. Sales aren't only limited to Black Friday, though. In the runup to the event, Walmart will be offering some exclusive sales through the Walmart app. Good deals include a 65-inch Hitachi 4K TV for $599, and the Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Console with an extra controller for $279. The full list of headline sales is below: · 11 Televisions including 4K Ultra HDTVs, such as a Phillips 55-inch Smart 4KTV for $298 (special buy) and a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV for $398 ($230 savings). Other television offers consist of a Vizio 60-inch HDTV for $398 (special buy), a 40-inch HDTV for $125 (special buy) and 50-inch HDTV for $225 (special buy). · Toys including the toy of the season, Hatchimals, for $48.88, Disney Princess Cinderella Royal Dreams Dollhouse with Furniture for $88 ($61 savings), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles RC Mikey for $39 (a Walmart exclusive at a $10 savings) and Razor Hovertrax 2.0 Hoverboard for $273 ($125 savings). · Drones including the DJI Drone Phantom Standard 3 for $369 ($130 savings), Promark 3D Virtual Reality HD Drone for $99 (a Walmart exclusive at a $49 savings) and Sharper Image Video Drone for $30 (special buy). · Connected Home items such as the Nest 3rd Generation Learning Thermostat for $199 ($50 savings) and Nest Cam for $149 ($50 savings). · Video Game Consoles and Games like the PlayStation 4 Slim Uncharted 4 500GB bundle for $249 ($50 savings) plus a $30 gift card and the Xbox One S White 500GB Battlefield bundle for $249 ($50 savings). Walmart will also offer nearly 90 video games starting at $8. · A $99 iPhone 5s 16GB on Straight Talk Wireless ($50 savings). · 10 Laptops and Tablets including the Samsung Chromebook 3 for $119 (special buy), HP 15.6-inch Touch Laptop for $249 (special buy) and iPad Mini 2 32GB for $199 ($70 savings). · More than 750 DVDs and Blu-ray Movies starting at $1.96. Read More · Fitness Wearables including the Fitbit Charge 2 for $129 ($20 savings), Fitbit Alta for $99 ($30 savings) and Fitbit Flex 2 for $69 ($30 savings). · Pajamas and Slippers such as $4.75 Licensed Kids Pajamas and $7 Ladies’ Novelty Character or Emoji Slippers (special buy). · Home and Outdoor Favorites including $9.76 kitchen appliances (special buy), Hotel Style 1,100 Thread Count Sheet Set for $25 (special buy), Hotel Style Down Alternative Comforter for $20 (special buy) and Pioneer Woman 27-piece Porcelain Enamel Nonstick Cookware Set for $89 (special buy).

The 34-page Walmart Black Friday 2016 ad can be seen on BestBlackFriday.com. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. This comes after Target’s 40-page Black Friday ad was posted, as reported by the Inquisitr. Out of the major store ads, only Best Buy, Macy’s, and Toys R Us have not been released, but they should appear online within the next few days. Walmart’s Opening Time As Walmart has done over the past few years, they will start their Black Friday sale this year at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving night. With the exception of Macy’s, this has been par for the course with major retailers, and stores are reluctant to open earlier. The backlash has been strong against stores opening on Thanksgiving night, and Walmart will not be pushing up their hours this year. Shoppers that cannot wait until 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving can shop on Walmart’s website the entire day. While 12:01 a.m. on Thursday morning is the official start date for their online sale, they actually had a round of doorbusters on Wednesday night last year. Nothing is guaranteed, but there is a strong possibility that Walmart offers at least a few doorbusters on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving this year. Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Important Information and Review [Image via Walmart] As seen on the first page, Walmart’s featured television deal is the Philips 55-inch 4K Class Smart TV for $298. The retail price is not listed, so the discount is currently unknown. Regardless, Philips is a solid brand, and the price of $298 is excellent for this television. For comparison purposes, the Target Black Friday 2016 ad, via Savings.com, is offering the Hisense 4K UHD 50″ Smart TV for $249. Hisense is an inferior brand, and Target’s deal is $50 cheaper for five less inches. As seen in the Kohl’s Black Friday 2016 ad, via Savings.com, they are offering the Haier 49-in. 4K Ultra HD TV + $75 Kohl’s Cash for $249.99, which is a discount of $100. The decision should really come down to Walmart and Kohl’s. While Walmart is offering the better television, it is $50 more. Kohl’s is offering a similar television for $50 less, but the brand is questionable. The fact that Kohl’s is also including $75 in Kohl’s Cash could make this the superior offer if you are a frequent Kohl’s shopper. This gives their TV a net price of only $174.99. Sony PS4 Slim Uncharted 500 GB Bundle + $30 Walmart Gift Card for $249 [Image via Walmart] As they often do, Walmart is including a $30 gift card with their featured PS4 Slim deal. While this bundle is available at most other stores for the same price of $249, which is a modest discount of $50, Walmart’s gift card addition makes it a much better deal. Regardless, Kohl’s still has them beat, as they are offering the same bundle for $249.99, but they are also including $75 in Kohl’s Cash. Factoring in the gift cards for each bundle gives the following net purchase prices. Walmart’s Deal – $249 – $30 Gift Card = $219 Net Purchase Price Kohl’s Deal – $249.99 – $75 Kohl’s Cash = $174.99 Net Purchase Price Kohl’s is offering the superior deal, but it really comes down to which store you prefer. Other Important Deals While these deals may not be as exciting as the ones listed above, they are ones that you should keep your eye on. Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV for $398 (save $230) Xbox One S White 500GB Battlefield bundle for $249 (save $50) Element or Hisense 40-inch Class HDTV for $125 Select Top Video Games for $27 (save $32.88) Roku Express Plus for $25 (save $14) Samsung 60-inch Class Smart 4K TV for $648 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles RC Mikey for $39 (save $10) HP 15.6-inch Touch Laptop for $249 Fitbit Alta for $99 (save $30) Important Walmart Shipping Information With Walmart offering more online deals on Thanksgiving and Black Friday than ever, shipping is becoming a very important topic. Best Buy and Target are both offering free shipping with no minimum order size this year, but Walmart is holding out. As CNBC reports, you will have to spend at least $50 on Walmart’s website in order to qualify for free shipping this year, which is on the higher end among stores. The other option is to sign up for Walmart’s two-day free shipping program, which is called ShippingPass. Walmart is currently offering a free 30-day trial, but there is an annual fee of $49 after the trial ends. Since this will cover Thanksgiving and Black Friday, it is one option if you are looking to enjoy free shipping at Walmart this year.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Sarah Halzack November 10 Follow @sarahhalzack A Black Friday event at a Walmart in Bentonville, Ark. (Gunnar Rathbun/AP Images) Walmart and Target each plan to kick off their in-store Black Friday sales at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, repeating their start-times from last year and throwing some cold water on the notion that Turkey Day deals blitzes may be falling out of style. Earlier in the season, the Mall of America announced it would be shuttering its doors on the holiday after being open in previous years. Office Depot, too, made a similar reversal of course. But the plans from the big-box behemoths — as well as from Macy’s, Kohl’s and Toys R Us — suggest the Thanksgiving Day shopping tradition is going strong. Walmart said it will be “dramatically increasing” the amount of inventory it has available for online deal hunters, offering some 50 percent more Black Friday merchandise this year on the Web than last year. “We really pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price but then only has a few available for the customers,” said Steve Bratspies, the chief merchandising officer at Walmart U.S., during a conference call with reporters.  Walmart said its offerings this year would include items such as a Samsung 50-inch 4K television for $398 and movies that cost $1.96.  Target, meanwhile, was touting deals such as an iPad Air 2 for $274 and 30 percent off apparel. Oh, and remember that giant $10 teddy bear that was all over social media last Black Friday? The retailer is bringing it back, and has bought 20 percent more inventory this time around. Both chains will start their online Black Friday sales in the early morning hours on Thanksgiving. And both will be offering a steady trickle of discounts over the next two weeks to encourage customers to get in the holiday spirit. In earlier announcements about their seasonal plans, Target and Walmart stressed they were trying to focus on making their promotions simple this time around. In the past, it seems, shoppers have been confused by a cavalcade of coupons or staggered sale starting times. At Target, that means returning to the “10 days of deals” program, something the retailer tried last year in which it touted a single big promotion each day starting the weekend before Thanksgiving. Walmart is also aiming for simple: Besides its limited-time Black Friday discounts, it plans to keep the rest of its price cuts in place for the duration of the November and December rush. The National Retail Federation, an industry trade group, forecasts that stores will ring up a healthy 3.6 percent increase in sales this holiday season. That would be an improvement from last year, when sales growth was up just 3 percent. We should soon get a clearer idea of what kind of momentum big retail has headed into this all-important time of year: Macy’s is set to report earnings Thursday morning, and Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others will do so in the following week.

The world's largest retailer said Thursday that its website will kick off its online Black Friday sale three hours earlier than last year, at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Thanksgiving Day. That's hours before its in-store doorbuster deals begin at 6 p.m. that evening. This is just the second year that Wal-Mart has offered the majority of its Black Friday promotions online, as consumers are increasingly dividing their budgets between stores and the web. To help accommodate this elongated shopping window, Wal-Mart has ramped up the amount of merchandise dedicated to filling online orders by 50 percent. Like Wal-Mart, Target is also offering certain Black Friday deals on its website Thanksgiving morning. Online sales across the industry are seen increasing 15.6 percent on Thanksgiving, to $2 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insights. "Our goal is not to advertise a great price and then not have the product for the customer," said Steve Bratspies, Wal-Mart's chief merchandising officer. That includes its stores. Wal-Mart will once again offer wristbands for certain popular products, guaranteeing every shopper who receives one will get that item. The retailer will also bring back its store maps, which highlight the location of in-demand products such as TVs and toys. These maps were accessed by millions of shoppers last year, the company said. Wal-Mart's stores stuck with their 6 p.m. start time — the same as Target — because it allows shoppers to scoop up last-minute groceries for Thanksgiving dinner in advance of the sale, Bratspies said. Wal-Mart has been open on Thanksgiving Day for nearly 30 years. The company also reiterated its promise to win on price. Black Friday deals include a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4K TV for $398 (or $230 off), a new shipment of the popular Hatchimals toys and the Fitbit Charge 2 for $129, a discount of $20. And for the first time, Wal-Mart will launch early Black Friday deals on its mobile app starting this Thursday. Wal-Mart's increased focus on the web comes as consumers are expected to allocate an equal amount of their budgets toward online and physical stores for the first time this year. It also follows the company's $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, which was completed in September. That deal was meant to jump-start Wal-Mart's digital sales growth, which had been petering off. During the previous holiday season, Target's online sales shot 34 percent higher, while Wal-Mart's increased just 8 percent. Unlike Target, Wal-Mart did not offer free shipping on every digital order. It is sticking to those guns again this year, saying customers can get their orders for free by picking them up in store, or meeting a $50 minimum. Despite Wal-Mart's extra focus on the web, Bratspies reiterated the importance of in-store Black Friday shopping. He pointed to the retailer's recent spate of earnings results, in which online sales and in-store traffic both edged higher. In addition to its online push, the company is dialing up customer service and product demonstrations in its stores this season. "It's still the biggest day in retail," he said. Best Buy will also open on Thanksgiving Day, letting shoppers into its stores at 5 p.m. for the third straight year.

 Walmart is kicking off Black Friday immediately — but there's a catch Hayley Peterson Nov. 10, 2016, 12:01 AM 65,079 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart is kicking off its Black Friday deals this week. AP Walmart just kicked off some of its Black Friday deals more than two weeks before the shopping holiday. But there's a small catch: the deals are available only to users of Walmart's app for now. The discounts available through the app include a Hitachi 65-inch 4K Ultra HDTV for $599 ($400 savings), an Xbox One S 500 GB Minecraft console with a bonus controller for $279 ($20 savings), and an Acer 15.6-inch Core i5 laptop for $299 ($150 savings). The rest of Walmart's Black Friday deals will become available to all customers online at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on Thanksgiving Day, the company said. The in-store event featuring "doorbuster" deals like $230 off a $628 Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV will kick off at 6 p.m. that day, which is in line with what the company did last year. Some industry experts have said the significance of Black Friday is diminishing as an increasing number of retailers start offering holiday discounts days and weeks before the shopping day. But Walmart's chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said Black Friday remained the biggest shopping event of the year. "We think it's still the biggest event in retail that customers get really excited about," he said Wednesday in a call with reporters. An employee adjusting a large ribbon on a television display at Walmart in preparation for Black Friday in Los Angeles in 2014. REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn In preparation for this year's demand, the retailer has increased its Black Friday merchandise by 50% on Walmart.com over last year. "I said it before and I will say it again: We will win the season on price — on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday, and every day before and after," Bratspies said. "That means delivering the Black Friday deals we're known for in stores, online, and on our app. And, we've secured significant availability of these items. We pride ourselves on not being the retailer who advertises a great price and then only has a few available." Here's Walmart's top Black Friday deals that will be available in stores and online on Thanksgiving, according to the company: 11 Televisions including 4K Ultra HDTVs, such as a Phillips 55-inch Smart 4KTV for $298 (special buy) and a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV for $398 ($230 savings).

Walmart is joining in on the sale action, with the company offering its trademark discount on TVs — this year, offering several 4K models, along with deals on consoles and computers. Walmart is using a two-pronged strategy for its Black Friday sales this year: a first wave of deals that begins right now and runs until Thanksgiving, and a second set of Black Friday discounts that start on Thanksgiving Day. The big-box retailer is also making a strong online push, with extra inventory being dedicated specifically to Walmart’s website. The online sales begin at 12:01AM on Thanksgiving morning, while those planning to brave stores in person can start taking advantage of the deals on Thursday night at 6PM. Like last year, you’ll need to download Walmart’s app to take advantage of the online deals, which is also where you’ll be able to find the full list of discounts. We’ve listed the best of here: Early Deals (November 10th-November 24th): Hitachi 65-inch 4K TV for $599 (usually $999) Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle with extra controller for $279 (usually $299) Apple TV (4th-generation) 32GB for $112.49 or 64GB for $149.99 (usually $149.00 / $199.00) Black Friday Deals (November 24th-November 25th): TVs Samsung 50-inch 4K Smart TV for $398 Samsung 60-inch 4K Smart TV for $648 Philips 55-inch 4K LED Smart TV for $298 Vizio 60-inch 1080p TV for $398 Element 50-inch 1080p HDTV for $225 Hisense 40-inch 1080p HDTV for $125 PCs and Tablets Samsung Chromebook 3 for $119 iPad Mini 2 32GB for $199 (usually $269) Game consoles / video games PlayStation 4 slim Uncharted 4 500GB bundle plus a $30 gift card for $249 ($50 savings) Xbox One S White 500GB Battlefield bundle for $249 ($50 savings) New PS4 and Xbox One games for $27 (including Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, and Madden 17) Xbox One and PS4 controllers for $39 (usually $59) Accessories and more Nest Thermostat (3rd-gen) for $199 (usually $249) Nest Cam for $149 (usually $199) Roku Express+ for $25 (usually $39) Fitbit Charge 2 for $129 (usually $149) Fitbit Alta for $99 (usually $129) Fitbit Flex 2 for $69 (usually $99) DJI Phantom Standard 3 drone for $369 (usually $499) Google Chromecast for $25 (usually $35) Microsoft Office 365 Home 1-year subscription for $59 (usually $99) In this Storystream Black Friday 2016: All the best deals in one place Microsoft’s Black Friday deals include Xbox One and Surface discounts Walmart’s Black Friday deals include 4K TVs and discounted consoles Target’s Black Friday deals include discounts on Xbox One S, iPad Pro, and 4K TVs View all 9 stories More From The Verge Google will soon ban fake news sites from using its ad network China's right: smartphones are a big reason Trump can't win a trade war Donald Trump is about to control the most powerful surveillance machine in history A Tribe Called Quest’s new album is tear-jerking, essential protest music Watch Dogs 2 is exactly what the original game should have been Predicting Westworld: so it’s Lost Now Trending MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future WhatsApp opens up video calling to everyone The Walking Dead Redemption Club season 7, episode 4: Service Two-thirds of the world's internet users live under government censorship: report Microsoft is bringing Visual Studio to the Mac This Article has a component height of 19.

Business leaders at the event, hosted jointly by CDP and the We Mean Business coalition in partnership with the UN Global Compact and CGEM, agreed that with the Paris Agreement now in force, the priority was to move from adoption to speedy implementation. They also set out seven specific areas in which government action would help them. Business has a significant role to play in enabling the global economy to achieve – and exceed – its climate goals. As a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, the private sector is a crucial partner in securing a prosperous and sustainable low-carbon economy for all. Jill Duggan, Director of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group, which brings together 24 leading European businesses employing 2 million people worldwide, said: “With the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, the world now has a legal mandate to bring about a zero carbon future. This is a fantastic business opportunity. What is now required from corporate leaders is a real step change in the way they deal with climate change. They must move from an incremental, compliance approach to a transformational   approach, the only one that can deliver a sustainable, prosperous world.” More companies are committed to leadership on climate action than at any time in history. But, there is more to be done to fully realize the global business potential to contribute to putting the world on track towards the Paris goal of limiting the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. A recent report by CDP in partnership with We Mean Business revealed that the large majority of companies already have targets in place to reduce their carbon emissions, but that current business plans fall short of what is needed for business to deliver on the world’s new low-carbon goals. Frances Way, Co-chief operating officer, CDP, said:  “The race is on for global corporations to seize the opportunities presented by the sustainable transition. While the majority of companies are out of the starting blocks and on the low-carbon path, clear policy intervention is needed to spur even greater ambition and help drive business over the below-2˚C finish-line.”  Businesses are Committed to Ambitious Action on Climate Change The private sector is ready to partner with governments across the globe to deliver emissions reductions at scale. The number of companies making climate commitments through the We Mean Business coalition has more than doubled since COP21. In total 471 companies with over $8 trillion in market capitalization have undertaken well over a thousand ambitious commitments to climate action. These companies represent every sector and geography globally. Businesses Already Implementing Their Commitments The Science Based Targets initiative continues to see tremendous momentum since Paris, representing the clearest path for companies to support the Paris agreement. To date, almost 200 companies have joined the initiative, and in the past year, growth has been at a rate of over 2 new companies per week. Walmart, the largest company by revenue and the largest private-sector employer in the world announced its science-based target on the same day as the Paris Agreement came into force. Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart said: "Walmart is the first retailer with an emissions-reduction plan approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2015. Under the approved plan, Walmart will use a combination of energy-efficiency measures, together with a commitment to source half of the company's energy needs from renewable sources, to achieve an 18 percent emissions reduction in its own operations by 2025. Additionally, Walmart will work with suppliers to reduce emissions by 1 Gigaton by 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off US roads and highways for a year”. 70 companies across 20 sectors from nearly 30 countries have aligned with the Business Leadership Criteria on Carbon Pricing, a set of ambitious standards to help companies set, advocate and report on a price on carbon, developed by the UNGC together with UNEP, the UNFCCC secretariat and Caring for Climate partners – CDP, Principles for Responsible Investment, The Climate Group and UN Foundation. To promote business resilience to climate change, the UN Global Compact made a call for companies to commit to responsible corporate adaptation in June 2016. Adapting to climate impacts offers many benefits to the private sector, such as improving operations and competitiveness, leveraging new business opportunities, building corporate reputation and protecting value chains. To date nearly 10 companies have committed to promote business resilience to climate change. Business has Seven Specific Asks of Governments at COP22 To fully realize the private sector’s potential to deliver emissions reductions at scale, corporate action needs to be reinforced by sound national climate policies.  Many companies have committed to take action that supports the delivery of the Paris Agreement, moving further and faster than their government’s require. Their contribution will be vital to the delivery of the Paris goals. To fully realize the private sector’s potential to deliver emissions reductions at scale, corporate action will need to be reinforced by sound national climate policies.  In support of climate action and to harness their full potential, business leaders look to governments to: Scale up enabling policies through the Global Climate Action Agenda and the Technical Examination Process on mitigation to drive pre- 2020 mitigation ambition Fully implement NDCs through domestic legislation and regulation to incentivize an immediate response from the private sector to the ambition of the Paris Agreement Drive towards net zero emissions by communicating long-term low GHG development strategies Connect non-state action to an increase in ambition with every 5-year NDC cycle, starting in 2018 Mobilize climate finance at scale from public and private sources. Enact meaningful pricing of carbon Build climate-resilient economies and communities About the Global Climate Action Agenda France and Morocco's global climate champions have set out their detailed agenda to boost cooperative action between governments, cities, business, investors and citizens to cut emissions rapidly and help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and build their own clean energy, sustainable futures. The action agenda is an important support and catalyst to the early and effective implementation of the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement. Message from the climate champions Hakima El Haite and Laurence Tubiana “A year after COP 21, the great dynamic of climate action is now growing strong. As we all gather to Marrakech time has come to start to take stock of what has been achieved during the last year. To be consistent with the long-term goals, all actors will have to work together, not only to achieve the national targets of the national climate action plans (Nationally Determined Contributions), but also to go further and bridge the gap of emissions. This sense of urgency should guide us all in accelerating immediate efforts and delivering ambitious action. We must identify what concrete policy options and what tools we will have to mobilize in the short term. The science is clear: the path towards achieving the long-term goals should bring us to peaking greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. This is a challenge, and we are not there yet. On the current trends, we will be in 2030 between 11 to 14 GT above Paris-compatible pathways. The purpose of these events is to strengthen all efforts and take them to the next level to stay on track for the objectives: stay well below 2°C and if possible 1,5°C, increase adaptation and resilience capacities and reorient financial flows. It is our responsibility, as champions, to make the link between the real world and the COP process. Political leaders from all around the world should hear and be inspired by the solutions at our reach.” Hakima El Haité, Morocco, and Laurence Tubiana, France, are High-level Climate Champions Notes for editors About We Mean Business We Mean Business is a coalition of organizations working with thousands of the world’s most influential businesses and investors. These businesses recognize that the transition to a low carbon economy is the only way to secure sustainable economic growth and prosperity for all. To accelerate this transition, we have formed a common platform to amplify the business voice, catalyze bold climate action by all, and promote smart policy frameworks.

CDP now holds the most comprehensive collection globally of primary corporate environmental data and puts these insights at the heart of strategic business, investment and policy decisions. About CGEM CGEM, the General Confederation of Enterprises of Morocco, represents the private sector towards public and institutional authorities. It speaks on behalf of its 88,000 direct and affiliated members and seeks to provide an economic environment conducive to business growth.

Launched in 2000, it is the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world, with more than 8,000 companies and 4,000 non-business signatories based in over 170 countries, and more than 85 Local Networks.

It’s silly to compare the $17.99 “rollback” price tag on the flag to how much it costs to represent the faith and freedom with which our country has been so richly blessed. The freedoms we enjoy are priceless – and we have God and our Veterans, past and present, to thank for all the blessings we take for granted. It’s fitting that Veterans Day is in the same month as Thanksgiving – when we are able to pause and reflect on a portion of the things with which we’ve been blessed. CLICK HERE TO JOIN CALEB'S FACEBOOK PAGE! I will display my American flag that is technically 17 dollars and 99 cents, but let’s be honest, my American flag is priceless and I can look at it and know that it did not come without sacrifice – freedom isn’t free – and I don’t have the words to adequately express my gratitude, so I’m just going to leave you with this POWERFUL message from one of our Vets to the anti-Trump protesters/thugs burning the flag: 🇺🇸America First from a Patriot🇺🇸 ck roo 👉🏻@TCBTRUMP👈🏻 speaks truth about American Patriotism and respect.#ThursdayThoughts#SemperFi pic.twitter.com/fJDKuDwpuV— MAGS 🚨MAGA🚨 (@magnifier661) November 10, 2016 To our Vets, ‘Thank you!

Published Nov 11th, 2016 2:57 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Chris Sultemeier, executive vice president of logistics for Walmart U.S., will retire Jan. 31 – the end of the company’s fiscal year. The announcement was made by Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon at the retailer’s annual Veteran’s Day event held Friday at the corporate headquarters. Since 2012, Sultemeier has been responsible for all distribution centers and fulfillment centers as well as all domestic and global ocean transportation functions. Prior to that he was senior vice president of transportation services with responsibility for the retailer’s domestic transportation, the private fleet global transportation. He joined Walmart in 1989 working in various roles of Walmart and Sam’s Club in logistics and merchandising. There has been no word from Walmart on who will replace Sultemeier next year. Prior to joining Walmart he served as a U.S. Army Captain and is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point with a degree in mechanical engineering. He service on boards includes the University of Arkansas Supply Chain Center and the Rogers-Lowell Area Chamber of Commerce. Sultemeier took the stage at Friday’s event to interview retired Brigadier General Anne MacDonald, who was a former West Point cadet. MacDonald said she grew up an Army brat and was recruited to be among the first female class of cadets at West Point 40 years ago. She described the experience as difficult on many levels, but said the lessons learned there helped to shape who she is today. Chris Sultemeier, executive vice president of logistics for Walmart U.S. “I loved putting on that uniform everyday through 30 years of active service. But you can’t keep it on forever,” MacDonald said. Aside from reaching Brigadier General status, MacDonald holds several certifications in military air assault and is a former helicopter pilot with a military combat unit. MacDonald said being part of the first class of female cadets at West Point was eye opening. After only accepting men since 1802, her guidance counselor in 1976 encouraged her to apply given her family’s military background. “I thought they wanted me, but when I got there it was not very welcoming to say the least … it was hard to be accepted but we hung in there and it was worth it,” she said. Her advice to veterans and civilians is keep pushing toward goals, saying there will be falls, but remember to fall forward so that it’s easier pick yourself up and continue.

Follow TechnoBuffalo I knew the NES Classic would be difficult to find—but not this hard. Super Mario Bros. 3 will have to wait another day. The truth is I wasn’t anticipating trying to find the NES Classic this morning. I figured I’d wait it out and get one closer to the holidays —maybe online or by waltzing into Walmart. But that mindset is just plain naive. If you think smartphones are difficult to find at launch, you haven’t tried getting a Nintendo console on launch day. I barely succeeded in getting a Wii when it launched in 2006. While heading to work this morning, I got a call from TechnoBuffalo’s Executive Editor Todd Haselton asking if I wanted to try finding the NES Classic at a nearby store. I was up for the adventure so we went right over to Target at the Irvine Spectrum in Orange County, California. It was about 20 minutes before the store opened at 8 a.m., and the line was already about 40 people deep. That wasn’t a good sign. We figured that, with some luck, the store might have enough units even though we were pretty far back in line, which was growing with every passing minute. By the time 7:50 a.m. hit, a Target employee came outside and started handing people little green pieces of paper. One by one, the people in front of us received a ticket, guaranteeing them the NES Classic. We weren’t so lucky. This particular location only had about 30 units, not nearly enough for the crowd that had gathered outside the store. The same Target employee announced that although units were spoken for at this particular location, another Target about ten minutes away had many more. So that’s where we went. When we got there, the store was already open, so we made a mad dash inside, where dozens of people were lined up at the check-out stands. After about ten minutes of hushed anticipation, the last unit was sold—and we once again came up empty-handed. And we weren’t the only ones bouncing around from store to store. A guy behind us said he checked Walmart and a few other stores around the area with no luck. Another woman said she got up extra early to get the NES Classic but came up short. Many other disappointed customers were also turned away. We checked a nearby Gamestop that was opening at 10 a.m., but there were around 40-50 people waiting, so chances were slim there’d be enough units. There was plenty of demand but very low supply—and that sucks for people who have been waiting months to get their hands on the mini-console. Sure, you can go on eBay where the Classic is marked up by several hundred dollars, but paying upwards of $500 for an emulator is a bit extreme. Line for NES Classic at Target pic.twitter.com/pYOtBn2wgj — Todd Haselton (@robotodd) November 11, 2016 Low supply, astronomical demand What’s funny—or sad—is that the NES Classic is just a tiny Linux computer—although it’s more powerful than it looks. Not helping matters was the lack of a pre-order campaign, which meant consumers had to go to stores and hope for the best. Consumers like me, who left disappointed. All this bother for games you can easily play on your computer with the help of an emulator. But that’s the power of nostalgia. Cram 30 classic games into a small plastic enclosure and people will go wild (myself included). Luckily, there will be more units over the coming weeks, according to a statement from Nintendo provided to TechnoBuffalo. But before the busy holiday season? Who knows. Joey Davidson, TechnoBuffalo’s head of gaming, brought up a question about artificial scarcity. After traveling from store to store all morning, one has to wonder how it’s possible Nintendo wasn’t able to make more in time for launch, especially when the NES Classic was announced months ago. Unless Amazon has units in stock today, I’ll probably continue to bounce from store to store, in search of an experience I enjoyed growing up. I can easily download OpenEmu for Mac or something similar for Windows. But where’s the fun in that?

Published Nov 11th, 2016 11:42 am pgatling@nwabj.com / @tbarkansas An Oklahoma-based investor has paid $56.8 million to acquire the nine-story Bentonville Plaza office building and 16 additional acres, near the the headquarters of Wal-Mart Stores. Square Deal Capital Inc., founded in 2013 in Oklahoma City, purchased the multi-tenant building at 609 S.W. 8th St. and surrounding land in two separate deals, which both closed Thursday (Nov. 10), according to Benton County land records. The 275,000-square-foot Bentonville Plaza (3.18 acres), the tallest building in Bentonville, and contiguous land totaling 7.51 acres sold for $54.8 million. For $2 million, Square Deal bought an adjacent 8.68 acres to the south along U.S. Highway 71 Business, property that once included the George Nunnally Chevrolet auto dealership. The site is largely a crumbling parking lot and has been vacant for more than five years since Nunnally moved to a new Bentonville location on Moberly Lane in July 2011. The seller in both deals was FBE Limited LLC of New York, a privately held real estate and capital management company. FBE Limited also owns Bentonville Commerce office park, an eight-building group of properties with 120,000 SF on 10.8 acres, just off South Walton Boulevard behind two strip mall centers, the Bentonville Post Office and Burger King. Sage Partners, a commercial real estate management firm headquartered in Fayetteville, will continue to provide full-service management and brokerage services for Bentonville Plaza, which is about 98% occupied, according to Sage Senior Vice President Grady Mathews. Simmons Bank partially financed the purchase with a $36 million mortgage. Square Deal representatives declined to comment, and instead referred questions to Mathews. “There is obvious value to owning property in Bentonville,” Mathews said. “Walmart is here, and this is a group that understands our market. This will be a good addition to the portfolio of Class A office space they already have.” Mathews said plans for the Nunnally property and other acreage surrounding Bentonville Plaza are still being discussed, adding the idea is do something within the next year. Construction on Bentonville Plaza began in May 2003 and the building opened to tenants the following year. Pitcairn Properties Inc. of Jenkintown, Pa., was the developer, and the building was designed by Sydness Architects of New York in collaboration with Harrison French of Bentonville. The property includes the IDK Café restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a fitness center with key card access. Mathews said the building has 34 tenants. The largest is Tata Consultancy Services, an IT services, business solutions and outsourcing organization based in India. The firm has prominent signage near the top of the building’s exterior, and its offices occupy the entire ninth floor, about 30,000 square feet.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 11, 2016 12:17pm   Comments Share: Related WMT Retail Earnings On The Docket: All The Important Dates You Need To Know Are Monthly Retail Sales Noise Or News? The Week In Review And The Week Ahead (Seeking Alpha) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is set to announce its third quarter financial results on November 17. Barclays projects third quarter EPS of $0.97 versus Street view of $0.96. The brokerage models US comps ex-fuel of +1.3 percent, and EBITDA margin contraction of 40 bp. Analyst Karen Short laid out three scenarios for shares when Wal-Mart releases its earnings: "[U]p (moderate %): US comps ex-fuel accelerate on a stacked basis (above 1.3% consensus) with a y/y EBITDA decline at a LSD percent or better and the 4Q EPS guidance range puts 4Q $1.33 consensus at the midpoint (4Q guidance range of ~$1.25-$1.40)”; "[F]lat (reasonable %): US comps ex-fuel moderate slightly on a stacked basis (in line with consensus) but remain above 1% in 3Q with a y/y EBITDA decline at a LSD percent and the 4Q EPS guide brackets $1.33 consensus on the high end (4Q guidance range of ~$1.20-$1.35)”; "[D]own (moderate %): a y/y EBITDA decline in excess of a LSD percent (driven by gross margin deterioration), US comps in line with consensus and $1.33 (consensus) is at the high end of 4Q EPS guidance range." The retail giant’s results would benefit from improved traffic from higher customer scores, new shoppers and additional spending from existing customers. On the other hand, food deflation, competition from discounters and e-commerce will pressure earnings and comps. Meanwhile, some investors were disappointed by the company's FY 2018 EPS guidance (flat year-over-year), but its outlook was unchanged when exclduing e-commerce spend. However, Short believes slowing unit growth and an increase in remodels will help comps in FY 2018. But, the analyst says these investments would position Wal-Mart to be a long-term omni-channel winner. Short has an Overweight rating on Wal-Mart shares, with a price target $82.

There are a few other places it can be purchased, but for now the only online location is Amazon. This release comes just in time for the holiday shopping season or – some might argue – a bit too early for the holiday shopping season. How is a true retro Nintendo fan supposed to wait several weeks before getting one of these as a stocking stuffer? According to Nintendo, the following is an appropriate way to introduce this new version of the old NES: “Are you ready to go back in time? Grab your neon sunglasses and jelly bracelets. Things are about to get radical.” Yes they are going to get so very radical indeed. The console has been released this morning to Amazon and physical stores will have stock by Sunday, at the latest. Each console includes a single controller and the system, which itself is relatively tiny. It’ll still look like the original NES, but it wont be nearly so bulky. Instead of being the size of a couple of Kleenex boxes, this console is now the size of a small stack of CD jewel cases. In the box comes the NES Classic Edition system, one NES Classic Controller, an HDMI cable, an AC adapter, and 30 pre-installed games. The 30 pre-installed games will be all the user is able to work with, ever – this isn’t the sort of console you buy and buy new games every few weeks. The set of games here is the set you’ll have, from the start until the end. Unless we get into hacking the device and modifying what it does, which is also entirely possible, but not recommended by Nintendo. This sort of thing happens all the time with every single console ever. But for now, Nintendo’s set of games is what you’ll get. UPDATE: According to GameSpot’s senior reviews editor Peter Brown on Twitter, it’ll be impossible to add new games. Unless you like to get in deep and dirty to hack away at the machine physically. Which might not be the worst idea in the world if you want to go all-in, hardcore. The above gallery shows the games included with this console, all 30 of them from launch. This console will cost users $60 USD and is said to be coming to Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, and Target first. But Walmart is inevitable, and Amazon is the only store with stock right this minute.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     How To Find Nintendo NES Classic Edition In Stock Posted: Nov 11 2016, 8:29am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Nov 12 2016, 11:20am CST, in News | Black Friday   This story may contain affiliate links. Credit: Nintendo   As expected the new Nintendo Entertainment System completely sold out right at launch. Update Nov 12: NES Classic sells now on the Amazon Marketplace. Don't Miss: Best Amazon Black Friday 2016 Deals The launch day Nintendo NES Classic Sales events at Amazon and Dell have sold out in minutes. Amazon offered the Nintendo NES Classic Edition at 5pm ET on Nov. 11. The NES Classic sale on Amazon at 5pm ET on November 11 was a disaster. The NES mini was only in stock for seconds and many customers lost it in their cart during checkout. The demand by far outstripped the supply Amazon had available. There are no new scheduled NES Classic sales known. It is back to using in stock trackers such as zoolert. Note, in the case of the NES Classic, mobile and email notifications are too slow. You need to use the webpage alert feature and keep the page open on your computer. Switch on the sound alert. When you hear a notification sound, flip to the browser tab where zoolert is open and find out which store as stock. Then its just a matter of luck and a fast mouse hand. The in stock notification on the Nintendo NES Classic Edition page on amazon.com is also too slow for ultra-high demand items like the NES Classic. For some reason there are no marketplace offers yet on the NES Classic on amazon yet. There are plenty of reseller offers on the hard to find Hatchimals. The Nintendo NES Classic is so rare that prospectors asking thousands of Dollars on eBay for it. There is one listing asking $13,000 for a NES Classic. This is insane. More reasonable offers on eBay for the NES Classic are around $300. Auctions on the NES are going over $250. The premium buyers end up paying is more than $200. The NES Classic is much more over priced than the hard to find Hachimals. Resellers have started on Nov. 12 to offer NES Classic deals on the Amazon marketplace starting at $189 plus $12 shipping. Other deals for the NES Classic on the Amazon marketplace are $250 and up.  There are already many accessories for the NES Classic. The My Arcade GamePad Classic Wireless Controller for the NES Classic Edition Gaming System is available for pre-order on amazon.com for $14.99 and ships November 30. Find more NES Classic accessories to enhance the trip to the 80s. Especially extension cables for the controller are a necessity according to reviews of the new retro Nintendo Entertainment System. Going wireless is though the way to go, especially at a low price of $15. Nintendo has issued a statement on Twitter on November 11 acknowledging the shortage of the NES Classic Edition.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases DEADLINE ALERT: Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC Reminds Investors of Class Action Against MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI) & Lead Plaintiff Deadline-November 14, 2016 NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Attorney Advertising — Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC reminds investors that a securities class action has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on behalf of those who purchased shares of MoneyGram International Inc. (“MoneyGram” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:MGI) pursuant and/or traceable to the secondary public offering completed on or around April 2, 2014 (the “Offering”). This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).   The Complaint alleges that MoneyGram allegedly made false and misleading statements and omissions regarding Walmart’s possible entry into the money transfer business and the likely effect it would have on the Company. On April 17, 2014, two weeks after the Offering, Walmart publicized that it was initiating its own money transfer service on April 24, 2014. Following this news, MoneyGram’s stock dropped close to 30%. No Class has yet been certified in the above action. To discuss this action, or for any questions, please visit the firm’s site: http://www.bgandg.com/mgi or contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Investor Relations Analyst, Yael Hurwitz of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at 212-697-6484 or via email info@bgandg.com. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address and telephone number. If you suffered a loss in MoneyGram, you have until November 14, 2016 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC is a corporate litigation boutique.

COMMENT Getting mobile marketing right is imperative to modern business success Ben Lobel As a small business owner, you might feel like your mobile marketing efforts are falling by the wayside. It’s difficult to compete with corporate marketing strategies from companies like Walmart and Amazon. You’re in luck because today helpful software provides nearly everything you need for small business success. 1. Leverage mobile apps to promote When it comes to mobile marketing, an app is probably the first marketing tool that comes to mind. As of 2015, more than 51 per cent of consumers are accessing marketing information from mobile devices – people access their smartphones more than their computers. The great news is that you can probably find drag-and-drop application development software with templates designed specifically for your niche. You can use a branded app for sharing promotions, providing easy access to your responsive website, receiving order information, or anything else you can think up. App uses are endless. Whenever I mention mobile apps, I like to share the genius way that Metro Trains in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia raised brand awareness through a ‘public service announcement’ launching Dumb Ways to Die. The app was intended to engage audiences that didn’t want to hear any kind of safety message. It went viral. You probably don’t want your app to look like an ad for your business. 2. Use mobile advertising networks to complement your ad campaigns When it comes to advertising for mobile, your best bet is to get on board with mobile advertising networks. Some 98 per cent of ad blocker use comes from desktop devices, meaning that only 2 per cent of those with ad blocking tools use them on their mobile devices. Your ads are more likely to be seen on mobile, so why not invest wisely? A mobile ad network will basically connect your ads with others who can share on their apps and mobile sites for a small profit. Let the network take care of the placement of your ads within your parameters. Then, sit back and watch the traffic roll in. 3. Take advantage of text messaging services The most widely and frequently used feature on smartphones is text messaging. Text messages have extremely high open rate – they are opened an astounding 98 per cent of the time while emails have an average open rate of only 28 per cent. That’s why SMS marketing pays off if you use it right to promote your business. Leveraging a bulk SMS service you can take the hassle out of text messaging automation, contact management, and access everything from your computer, rather than sending individual messages from your phone. Just make sure that everyone you contact has opted in to receive communications to their cell phone so that you’re in compliance with privacy laws. 4. Don’t forget to check the responsiveness of your website You can use Google’s mobile-friendly test to find out if your website is responsive for the majority of the traffic you receive (remember, more people are on mobile devices than computers). If you find that your site is less than optimal for traffic from smartphones and tablets, and you take the steps to remedy the issue, you could see major increases in your page rank. Using a website that isn’t optimised for mobile could cost you more than half of your traffic, increase your bounce rate, and decrease your search engine rankings. This isn’t a risk worth taking. 5. Pay attention to your analytics tools data If you’re not already analysing traffic to your mobile website, apps, and mobile web content, you need to. Your website, social media profiles, and mobile apps should be monitored by some sort of analytics tool so that you know what’s working to increase traffic and sales, and which efforts aren’t doing your campaigns any justice. 6. Get listed in local directories Mobile friendly local directories like Yelp and search engines have location-based targeting, maps, and reviews. These elements can be key when running a successful small business. Online business reviews affect the trust of up to 72 per cent of consumers. So, if you’re not managing your own small business listings in places where the public can leave reviews, you could be missing out on one of the best mobile brand building experiences available. Being in local searches will give you an advantage, especially if you’re in a populated location. When someone does a mobile search for your type of business, as a basic rule, the closest listings will show up first. Registering your business in local searches means you’ll be the first to catch people’s attention when they’re nearby. 7. Implement online ordering… Offline In the case that you are offering some sort of service (food, beauty, etc.) and the foot traffic is somewhat heavy, you can offer an online shopping cart offline. Most people will have a smartphone handy, so use a QR code or short URL on your food or service menu for easy access. You can also offer a public tablet or mobile device that will automatically direct customers to your order screen. Around 93 per cent of restaurant visitors will order digitally if offered a dedicated device. 8. Minimise the steps to arrive at your website with QR codes When it comes to offline advertising, most people will access your site from mobile devices. Rather than force people to type in the entire URL of your site or specific content, offer QR codes as an alternative. Some 39 per cent of women and 56 per cent of men have scanned QR codes, which can make the mobile browsing experience much more convenient. Conclusion As you employ the above tools, your mobile marketing campaigns will see fast gains. Just stay up to date with technology, and remember – the less your marketing looks like traditional advertising, the more it will engage customers and lead to sales.

White people need to speak out Paula Young Lee Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics: Elections 2016, Homophobia, LGBT, president-elect donald trump, Racism, Sexism, Xenophobia, Life News, News White people voted Donald Trump into office — not all white people, of course, but white people. To nearly everyone’s surprise, however, the good white people secretly sighing over Trump’s bigly manliness weren’t the people of Wal-Mart or any other ignorant hillbilly redneck stereotype, but stay-at-home wives crushing on the billionaire lifestyle, breadbasket  evangelical Christians and white-collar workers with retirement portfolios. In other words, the Donald mesmerized the college educated, solidly middle class and suburban bourgeoisie into voting for him. As Paul Mason noted in a trenchant analysis, Trump won “because millions of middle-class and educated US citizens reached into their soul and found there, after all its conceits were stripped away, a grinning white supremacist.” The data backs Mason up. The Trump phenomenon was never solely about economics; the global rise of right-wing xenophobia and white racial identity politics has played some role as well. Ironically, this fact is so plain that most pundits apparently assumed that a Trump presidency could never happen in the U.S. precisely because the American Dream is — or rather, was — predicated on a Judeo-Christian model that accepts all comers in its nondiscriminatory ecumenical embrace. “Give me your tired, your poor/ Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” The famous lines written by Emma Lazarus on the base of the Statue of Liberty are riffs on Matthew 11:28. “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” Xenophobia and selfishness are, simply, un-American values. But the American reality has always been about violently affirming the political power of whiteness. One supposes that this is what Trumpers meant when they applauded the Donald for “telling it like it is.” Arguably, he won because of, and not in spite of, his bigotry, sexism, vulgarity, anti-intellectualism, willful ignorance, false piety, charlatanism and incompetence in business. By reveling in his abject failures as a human being yet refusing to apologize for them, his very existence was a weirdly honest acknowledgement that the American Dream was always just that — a dream. The “real” America ached to be acknowledged. And this gritty body politic was not America the Beautiful but America the Bully. On Nov. 9, Day One of Trumpland, people of color started turning to social media to report physical assaults, verbal abuse and hate crimes being perpetrated against them. (See a growing list of depressing tweets being collected here. More stories are being collected on a dedicated Tumblr called “It Has Begun 2016.”) New York Daily News columnist Shaun King’s Twitter feed has been serving as a hub for self-reported racist attacks, most of which are subsequently confirmed via local news outlets and police reports. They are not, despite the conspiracy theories inevitably advanced by Trumpers, hoaxes and false flag operations concocted by Hillary Clinton supporters in an attempt to cast Trump in a bad light. Only the willfully blind can fail to see that President-elect Trump has made racism culturally permissible, given that attackers often explicitly connect their hateful acts to his leadership. For example, here is a G-rated one: “Aren’t you [black and brown people] supposed to be sitting in the back of the bus now? Like Trump is president!” The reports go on and on and on. Around the country, spray-painted swastikas are appearing, including one proclaiming, “HEIL TRUMP.” A nonwhite author of my acquaintance just discovered that her college visit was canceled because someone draped a noose around the neck of a black doll and left it in an elevator. Ellen Oh of We Need Diverse Books tweeted that well-dressed white boys were walking past people of color at the mall and hissing, “Trump” at them. Racist messages are appearing in schools, such as one scrawled on a black student’s locker in a high school in Minnesota, saying “F**k N*****s.” Offended by the language? Be offended that a teenager thought this was OK to write. There are dozens upon dozens of similar reports of foul invectives being hurled at children of color around the country, as well as unconfirmed reports that eight trans kids responded to the news of Trump’s election by committing suicide. All this and more, in just 36 hours, at the time of this writing, in Trumpland. Even manicured lawns and swollen bank accounts can’t protect bourgeois families from being exposed to the racist bile because the bile is being hurled by their own. The town of Wellesley, Massachuestts, is one of the wealthiest and most attractive suburbs in the country. It is the home of Wellesley College, a private women’s liberal arts college and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s alma mater. Yesterday, two young white men drove a blue pickup onto the serene oasis of Wellesley campus, while prominently flying a Trump flag from the truck bed along with Confederate regalia. Violently inserting themselves into the well-tended landscape, the two white men laughed and screamed as they sped by startled female students, so proud of themselves for acting like racist jerks that they made a video of it. Various Wellesley students reported that they harassed women of color and openly queer women, calling one student a “dyke.” Then “they parked in front of the house for students of African descent and jeered at them, screaming ‘Trump’ and ‘Make America Great Again.’ When one student asked them to leave, they spit in her direction.” Dear white people, it’s time for you to come get your boys. Earlier this year for Salon, comedian W. Kamau Bell and best-selling author Adam Mansbach argued that Trump was “a white people issue.” That it was now incumbent on white people to feel embarrassment over Trump strictly on the basis on their shared whiteness, they said. To feel a racialized responsibility for him the same way that any person of color is made to feel whenever another black or brown person ends up on the news. For white people to recognize that Trump was not an aberration but the pinnacle of white institutionalism. That it was time, in other words, for good white liberals to “come get their boy,” to sit him down and set him straight before things became worse. Well, they’re worse. Newly released from the tyranny of “leftist political correctness,” apparently white men are not only unleashing their resentment against highly accomplished women by openly harassing them, but they are also rightly expecting to be rewarded for their misogyny. This is the lesson of former “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush and President-elect Trump, both of whom profited quite handsomely from doing exactly that. These charmers are not the hardscrabble sons of the Confederacy but the educated scions of wealthy East Coast families. I’m talking about Bush and Trump, of course, but also about the Wellesley spitters: They are currently enrolled at nearby Babson College, which has not identified them to the press. Meanwhile, on social media, students at Babson are circulating their names and their reputed connections. Their exploits are known because they bragged about them. There are multiple eyewitnesses and photographs. They directly invoked Trump as motivating their racist actions. They are not George Soros and John Podesta wearing “Mission: Impossible” masks. Yet their fellow students at Babson apparently do not expect the administration to discipline them, let alone the local police to do anything. Their fraternity, to its credit, did expel them, according to The Boston Globe. This bunkered institutional response, this systematic marginalization of the most vulnerable, this dismissiveness of those without social standing, without deep local roots, without entrenched professional networks and the reflexive goodwill of authorities — this whole nexus of things unsaid and the reality of legal rights as a selective political net is why nonwhite American citizens, as well as LGBTQ and religious minorities, and people with disabilities are now legitimately fearful for their safety in this country. To read the litany of humiliations and attacks on people of color will induce fear in any person possessed of some degree of empathy. But what is truly terrifying is to realize, with the cold pain of a searing truth slicing like a knife through your eye, that nice white people are going about their day, loftily pretending that none of this is happening. These incidents are ugly. Nice white people prefer to live where Life is Beautiful™. Even once white people are made aware of the sudden proliferation of racist and sexist abuse being done in Trump’s name, the majority react by seeking to minimize its effects. It’s just name calling, bitch. Grow a spine, snowflakes. What does Trump have to do with it? He didn’t spit on you, did he? Because white institutionalism will protect its own, using the PR of public patronage to whitewash its sins. Many of these incidents are taking place in schools, and the perpetrators are white teenagers and children. They are feeling out the limits of permissibility, testing out the new rules. The lack of response from other white people is tacit confirmation that being a racist is the new cultural norm as well as a social necessity to prove your bona fides as one of Trump’s minions and future member of “Trump Youth.” Good white people must start calling this out before the full rage is unleashed after Trump is sworn in, doing the work to make it clear to other white people, through action, words and deeds, that that neo-Nazism, white nationalism and all the rest is not condoned by what remains of the American experiment in democracy. This work is difficult. It’s easier for white people to mock and belittle, lest you have to confront your peers and say to their face: This is not OK, we are better than this, that Trumpers are not the racist bullies the Hillbots accuse us of being. By saying nothing and doing nothing, however, you merely confirm that yes, actually, you are. I know a lot of Trump voters yet can’t name a single one who repudiated the Ku Klux Klan’s formal endorsement of Trump, who decried the celebrations of white nationalist leaders following his election or said one word regarding the anti-Semitic threats being spewed at Jewish journalists throughout Trump’s campaign. Good white people must stop telling themselves that overt racism is the behavior of a few outliers or claiming that it’s the work of impoverished rural whites who don’t know any better. When children in schools around the country repeatedly chant, “Build a Wall” in order to taunt their Latino peers (as reported by the Detroit Free Press), this is good evidence that the racist rot is broadly cultural, not localized and exceptional. And these behaviors are learned. Paula Young Lee is the author of "Deer Hunting in Paris," winner of the 2014 Lowell Thomas "Best Book" award of the Society of American Travel Writers.

CST November 11, 2016 Chaz Gilley (Photo: WFAA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST FORT WORTH, Texas -- Police have a arrested a second suspect in connection with the murder of a Fort Worth teen last month, and according to an arrest affidavit they were "laughing and bragging" about their crime. Lajerrian Morgan, 24, was arrested Wednesday and charged with capital murder. A few weeks ago, James Murphy, 37, was arrested and also charged with capital murder. "It's senseless; they did it for nothing," said Chesala Markham, mother of victim Chaz Gilley. Gilley, 18, was gunned down in broad daylight on East Berry Street in Fort Worth. He was riding his bike home from Wal-Mart, where his mother said he had gone to cash a $400 paycheck. "They killed my boy because they wanted what he had, and they didn't want to earn it themselves," Markham said.   In a jailhouse interview three weeks ago, Murphy denied any knowledge about the crime. "I can't tell you something I know nothing about," he said. But an arrest warrant affidavit says otherwise. An informant told police that Murphy and another Blood gang member were selling drugs at the apartment complex where Chaz Gilley lived with his family. "They saw a 'white boy' looking at his check," the informant told police, and followed him to Wal-Mart "and waiting for him to cash his check." Police say security video from inside Wal-Mart shows two men shadowing Gilley and watching him count money. The video then shows Gilley departing the store on bicycle with the men following in a black car. According to the affidavit, the men used the car to knock him off his bike, and then they chased him and shot in multiple times as he tried to run away. The informant said that a few days later, they were "laughing and bragging" about the crime. "To go around bragging about it to other people," Markham said with tears in her eyes. Gilley flagged down help and was taken to the hospital, but doctors were not able to save him. "You took somebody's life.  It's not a joke, it's not a game," Markham said. "My son will never grow up. He'll never have a family." Now, Markham is determined that Murphy and Morgan pay. She vows that she'll be in the courtroom during any trial to come, and she wants them to face the death penalty for taking her son's life and then laughing about it. "To me, they're going to get it easy compared to what my son had," she said. "My son lived the last minutes of his life in fear and in pain."

And it’s not exactly a shock that they will both be opening at the same time. The goal here is to not allow the other one to open earlier to collect more revenue dollars. So if you are done with your Thanksgiving meal at 6pm, that is the exact time the doors will be opening for both big box stores. I have never gone shopping on Thanksgiving, I love the holiday too much, and the leftovers even after dinner. I have been shopping on Black Friday many times and I will probably do more of that this year but I just refuse to interrupt other peoples holiday so I can save a few dollars.

He doesn’t have to ask. People are drawn to his 1946 Chevy Sedan Delivery and all of the autographs covering its olive green panels, and soon they’re selecting a spot to add their own.

Sam Aughe, 199th Light Infantry. “This isn’t about me,” he says. But it could be. * * * He and this car have a history. He first wanted it nearly 50 years ago, when he 17, before the Army sent him to Vietnam. “It was just different,” Aughe said. “It’s an ugly car, actually. So ugly, it’s neat.” It was the butcher’s car then. Tony Bohac would drive around Saline County making deliveries in the yellow Chevy, sometimes returning to Crete with a load of live hogs in the back. Aughe tried to buy it, but Bohac wasn’t selling. Then the teen enlisted in the Army. He had planned to make the military his career. The artilleryman was in his second year in Vietnam, lobbing shells into the jungle, when he was hit by the recoil of his howitzer. The force flipped him through the air and he landed on his back, upside down, against the blast wall. His career plans changed. “After I got hurt, the Army didn't want me. And I didn't want the Army, either.” He didn't return to a hero's homecoming then. He didn't feel any of the honor he's trying to bestow with his Chevy now. “I was asked: 'How many women and kids do you think you killed?'” Back in Crete, he married Dolores Coffey and they started a family. He worked for the city, and then as a lineman, and then for the co-op, fixing cars. He's retired now, but still works on cars for family and friends. Which is how he ended up at his old friend Fran Siedhoff's garage about two years ago. And how he was reunited with the '46 Sedan Delivery. “I went down there and there it was. I didn’t even know he had the damn thing. I told him I was interested.” Siedhoff had found the Chevy in a scrap yard. He recognized it as the butcher's, so he bought it, tracked down the title, swapped motors to get it running again – and then parked it for about 30 years, until Aughe stumbled upon it. “I just had it in storage and Sam wanted it, and I said, 'Fine.'” * * * The thought came to Sam Aughe during a sleepless night. He'd owned the car for a couple of weeks and had been planning its restoration: Fresh yellow paint, like it had looked when he first saw it in the late 1960s. But then this new thought from out of nowhere: Make it look military, make it honor those who served. So he covered it in Army olive, with a white star on each door. He painted the grille and fenders red, white and blue. He spent about 400 hours getting it road-worthy. He let his granddaughter christen it a year ago with the name of her other grandfather. Then the names multiplied -- people stopping him in parking lots to ask about the car, Aughe giving them the marker, and his invitation. A man signed for his father and uncle, both shot down over the same target on the same day, both ending up in the same prisoner-of-war camp. A woman honored her husband and brother, killed by the same IED in Iraq. Another told him her relative fought in the Civil War. “But she wasn't going to add it, and I said, 'Why not?' And she said, 'He fought for the Confederacy. And I said, 'I don't care.'” He's had state troopers sign it and federal agents. He's had members of foreign forces sign it. But mostly, he's handed his black markers to those who served all branches of the U.S. military, including the Coast Guard. They all leave their names, but some add where they served and when. Others sign for their loved ones who were killed in action or are still missing or have since died. He felt good, like his mission was accomplished, when an old vet signed the car and told him: “At least now I know my name will be on something other than a damn tombstone.” But Aughe plans to keep driving his Chevy and keep collecting signatures until he runs out of room. Then he'll give it to a military museum. That won't be anytime soon. The rolling memorial is more than 16 feet long, draped in what seems like an acre of sheet metal. Plenty of places for more names, more honor. “And I do have a lot of space inside, too.” Reach the writer at 402-473-7254 or psalter@journalstar.com.

Spending on Alibaba platforms, including Tmall, Taobao and Ali­Express, topped 120.7 billion yuan (US$17.8 billion), a 32 per cent rise on last year’s sales. More than 82 per cent of the sales were conducted through mobile devices, with purchases using smartphones 99 billion yuan, according to Alibaba’s live data. Launched in 2009, the day-long event held annually on November 11 is considered a benchmark for the country’s continuing swing towards online shopping, and is seen by economists as a bellwether of consumer demand. WATCH: Chinese spend 120.7 billion yuan on Singles’ Day as Alibaba reveals their new global strategy This year’s selling spree kicked off at midnight in Shenzhen with a gala event featuring a host of celebrities, including English football legend David Beckham, basketball star Kobe Bryant, actress Scarlett Johansson and rock band One Republic, to drum up international attention. There was an immediate wave of pre-orders that shoppers had placed ahead that propelled the first billion dollars of transactions in less than five minutes, said Alibaba, which also owns the South China Morning Post. Spending took place across the spectrum of retail goods, from soya sauce to shampoo. Singles’ Day has become an emerging billion-dollar battle ground for Alibaba and its chief rival JD.com in their hunt for new growth areas. The spending this year had also been expected to be higher partly because of the quality of goods being offered to attract the rising middle classes, who are thirsty for everything from sparkling water from Fiji to biscuits from Britain.   The anticipated fight for sales, particularly in the grocery segment, escalated three weeks ago in the lead-up to Singles’ Day, when Wal-Mart Stores said it set up a store in Beijing in a tie-up with JD to deliver imported goods to shoppers “within hours”. On the same day in Hong Kong, Alibaba brought into spotlight its alliance with Costco Wholesale, the largest warehouse retailer in the United States, as well as other grocery brands, such as Procter & Gamble, that were expected to be at the forefront of promotions, including offering steep discounts and products not yet available in China. The pacts with western consumer multinationals is just part of a multibillion-dollar campaign rolled out by Alibaba, which has vowed to outspend its rivals to gain an upper hand in the online grocery war.   This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Singles’ Day shopping frenzy breaks records with US$17.8b in sales   Most Popular Viewed 1 Modi’s key aide blames poor planning for India’s currency crisis 2 RIP: Hong Kong’s shopping industry, as e-retailers tighten their grip 3 China’s economy risks being washed aside by a Trump tsunami 4 Relaxed mainland port rules could slice 14pc off Hong Kong’s container throughput, says report 5 Trump’s America: the good, the bad and the ugly Shared 1 Modi’s key aide blames poor planning for India’s currency crisis 2 RIP: Hong Kong’s shopping industry, as e-retailers tighten their grip 3 Relaxed mainland port rules could slice 14pc off Hong Kong’s container throughput, says report 4 China’s economy risks being washed aside by a Trump tsunami 5 Chinese regulator bans futures brokers from providing margin financing Commented 1 Thousands turn out to decry Hong Kong independence 2 Beijing’s top man in Hong Kong accuses Legco localists of treating community like ‘idiots’ 3 Walking a mile in Beijing’s shoes could serve Hong Kong politicians well in future 4 Clinton blames FBI director for presidential election loss 5 Death of China’s first female J-10 fighter pilot Yu Xu sparks call for more training Promotions Register for a free copy of XXIV 2017 now Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like China Pacific Rim nations urged to revise TPP without US before Trump cuts trade ties 12 Nov 2016 - 12:29am 15 Society Why China’s rise means Hong Kong stars like Jackie Chan will be the last of their kind 13 Nov 2016 - 7:23pm 14 Hong Kong Despite fears, new air traffic control system to be launched at Hong Kong airport on Monday 11 Nov 2016 - 11:26pm 3 Motoring choices, plug-in hybrid vehicles help to accelerate clean mobility In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Hong Kong Did CY Leung mess up his own oath?

Research Brief Key Findings Three-fourths of retail clinics are located in the Southern and Midwestern United States. Retail clinics typically serve younger adults who do not have a primary care provider. For a select group of conditions, retail clinics deliver care of equivalent quality compared with other settings. Availability of a retail clinic does not deter people from going to the emergency department. Though promoted as a means of decreasing health care spending, retail clinics slightly increase health care utilization and, consequently, health care spending. Retail clinics are medical clinics located in pharmacies, grocery stores, and "big box" stores, such as Target and Walmart. These clinics offer extended weekend and evening hours, walk-in availability, and short wait times. Many visits to retail clinics are in the evenings and weekends, when primary care offices are not available. The clinics treat a limited range of health conditions, such as minor infections and injuries, and provide vaccines and other preventive care. Care is delivered by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. Prices are typically fixed and transparent. Retail clinics have been proposed as an alternative to costly emergency department care for nonemergency conditions. It has been estimated that up to 20 percent of emergency department visits for a nonemergency condition could take place at a retail clinic or urgent care center, potentially generating cost savings as high as $4.4 billion annually. Retail clinics are playing a steadily growing role in the health care marketplace. The first retail clinics opened in 2000; by 2010, they numbered close to 1,200. Recent estimates predict that there will be more than 2,800 clinics by 2017, nearly double the 2014 levels. Convenience, accessibility after hours, and clear pricing appear to be the most important drivers of growth. Consumers are relatively happy with their overall care experiences. But retail clinics have also generated controversy. Provider groups, such as the American Medical Association, have raised concerns about quality-of-care issues, including the overprescribing of antibiotics, lost opportunities for preventive care, and the disruption of existing patient-physician relationships. Conversely, champions of the retail clinic model have pointed to their potential benefits: Retail clinics may function as a provider for lower-income patients and those without a primary care physician and could also provide a less costly alternative for patients who otherwise would go to emergency departments. By replacing more expensive emergency department visits, the hope is that retail clinics may decrease health care spending. To provide a factual basis for assessing retail clinics, RAND Health researchers conducted a series of studies focusing on four areas: A profile of retail clinics: Where are retail clinics located, what services do they offer, and who owns them? Patient characteristics and service use: Who uses retail clinics, and what services do patients obtain? Quality and delivery of preventive care: How do retail clinics compare on these dimensions with other health care settings? Costs: How do retail clinic costs compare with the cost of services in a physician's office or in an emergency department? Are there potential savings if retail clinic visits can substitute for more expensive care in other venues? Figure 1. Figure 1. U.S. Retail Clinics Are Concentrated in the Southern and Midwestern United States SOURCE: Data from Martsolf et al., 2016. Most Retail Clinics Operate in the Southern and Midwestern United States in Large Metropolitan Areas RAND analysis of 2014 data shows that the vast majority (74 percent) of the 2,737 retail clinics in the nation were located in the South and Midwest (Figure 1). More than a third of all clinics were located in five states (California, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas). These results largely echo prior RAND research on retail clinic locations. That work used cross-sectional data from industry and foundation sources to analyze the characteristics of 982 retail clinics operating in the United States (as of August 2008). RAND's analyses revealed the following findings. Geographic Distribution About 35 percent of the U.S. urban population lived within a ten-minute driving distance of a retail clinic. Retail clinics tended to be located in higher-income urban and suburban settings, with higher concentrations of white residents and fewer black and Hispanic residents. Only 12.5 percent were located in medically underserved areas. For comparison, 21 percent of the U.S. population lives in such areas. Even after adjusting for the location of pharmacies and supermarket chains, clinics were less likely to be located in medically underserved neighborhoods than in other areas. Services Clinics offered treatment for a limited set of conditions for which they had treatment protocols, including acute respiratory infections — which accounted for 60 percent of all retail clinic visits — other minor illnesses, immunizations, sports physicals, and screening services, such as lipid or diabetes screening. The majority of retail clinics accepted commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid coverage, and all accepted cash payment, regardless of insurance status. Ownership Two organizations — CVS and Walgreens — operated about three-quarters of all retail clinics. Adding clinics operated by Kroger, Walmart, Target, and RiteAid accounted for 93 percent of retail clinics nationwide. Note that, as of 2016, Target's clinics are operated by CVS. Typical Retail Clinic Patients Are Younger Adults with No Regular Provider Who uses retail clinics, and why? RAND researchers analyzed details of more than 1.3 million visits to retail clinics from 2000 to 2007 and compared information from that analysis with national data on visits to primary care physician offices and emergency departments. According to the study's findings: The largest group of clinic users was young adults, age 18–44, who accounted for 43 percent of patients. Nationally, this group made up only 23 percent of patients who visited primary care physicians. Only about one-third of clinic users said that they had a primary care physician. Two-thirds of retail clinic visits were paid for with health insurance, compared with 90 percent of visits to primary care physicians. About 90 percent of visits to retail clinics were for preventive care and for ten simple acute conditions: upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, bronchitis, sore throat, immunizations, inner ear infections, swimmer's ear, conjunctivitis, urinary tract infections, and blood tests. The same conditions accounted for 18 percent of visits to primary care physician offices and 12 percent of emergency department visits. Retail Clinics Offer Comparable Quality of Care for Some Medical Conditions Critics of retail clinics are concerned that they offer sub-standard care and that using a retail clinic disrupts patient-physician relationships. The evidence suggests otherwise: Quality of care: RAND analysts evaluated claims data from enrollees in a large Minnesota health plan who received care for one of three common conditions: otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear), pharyngitis (sore throat), or urinary tract infection. Based on 12 quality-of-care measures, retail clinics, physician offices, and urgent care centers had similar quality ratings; quality scores were lower for emergency departments. Antibiotic prescribing: Acute respiratory infections, such as bronchitis and rhinosinusitis, are the most common reason that patients seek care in the United States and account for 60 percent of all retail clinic visits. Physicians often overprescribe antibiotics for these conditions, and experts were concerned that overprescribing would be even more frequent in retail clinics. The research did not support this concern. Using data from the medical records of physician offices, retail clinics, and emergency departments, researchers found that the share of patients who were prescribed antibiotics was similar for retail clinics, physician offices, and emergency departments. In fact, care at retail clinics was more guideline-concordant. For such conditions as bronchitis, for which antibiotics are never indicated, retail clinics had a lower antibiotic prescribing rate than physician offices. Vaccinations: Retail clinics have been viewed as a promising venue for administering vaccinations. A study examined how many vaccinations were delivered at the largest retail clinic chains from 2007 through 2009, what percentage of clinic visits included vaccinations, and which vaccinations were the most common. In the time period studied, vaccinations were administered in about 40 percent of visits; the most common vaccination was for influenza. Those receiving vaccinations were typically not "outside the medical system" but instead may have chosen to receive a vaccination at the retail clinic because it was more convenient than the doctor's office. Retail clinics could deliver more vaccinations if they counseled patients during acute care visits about the benefits of vaccinations. Continuity of care: Some physician groups have expressed concerns that using retail clinics will disrupt existing patient-physician relationships. However, multiple studies have found that the majority of retail clinic patients report not having a primary care provider. Retail clinics seem to be serving a population that does not seek care in a doctor's office but might otherwise seek care in emergency departments. Retail clinics might reduce the likelihood that a patient will go to a primary care physician first for a new condition and decrease subsequent continuity of care. However, patients who visit retail clinics appear just as likely to receive preventive care or proper management of diabetes. Retail Clinics Increase Both Health Care Use and Health Care Spending Policymakers and insurers have viewed retail clinics as a way to decrease health care spending: Less expensive care for low-acuity conditions, such as bronchitis and urinary tract infections, in a retail clinic could substitute for more expensive care in a physician's office or an emergency department. However, RAND research has not supported this idea. A recent study compared emergency departments with a retail clinic nearby to emergency departments with no retail clinic nearby. There was no notable reduction in visits for minor conditions to the emergency departments in close proximity to retail clinics. More broadly, the key to cost savings from retail clinics is substitution. Retail clinics generate cost savings only if less expensive clinic visits substitute for more costly care from physicians or emergency departments. On the other hand, retail clinic visits could also increase costs if they generate new health care use by patients seeking care when they otherwise would have stayed home. To gauge substitution versus new utilization, RAND followed two groups of enrollees — users and nonusers of retail clinics — among 1.3 million Aetna enrollees in 22 cities in 2010 and 2011. The groups had similar low-acuity conditions. Figure 2. Increased Utilization in Health Care Clinics Partially Offsets Savings SOURCE: Ashwood et al., 2016. Researchers found that about two-fifths of retail clinic visits for these conditions were substitutions for physician office or emergency department visits. The other three-fifths of clinic visits reflected new utilization, not substitution (see Figure 2). Given that retail clinics focus on making it easy to access care, it is not surprising that some individuals who might have done nothing about their condition sought care for it because it was convenient. The costs of the new health care utilization more than offset the savings from substitution (Figure 2). There was a relatively small net increase in patient spending ($14 per person per year). Many payers are including retail clinics in their provider networks and encouraging enrollees to use them. To the extent that the provider's goal is to reduce health care spending, encouraging retail clinic use might not be effective. Summary and Implications RAND's body of work substantially strengthened understanding of the patients served by retail clinics, the quality of the care that those patients receive, and the clinics' net cost effects: Younger adults and those without a regular care provider are typical users of retail clinics. Overall, retail clinics are not improving access to care for the medically underserved; retail clinics are more likely to be located in relatively affluent sections of large urban areas. Retail clinics provide care that is of equivalent quality to the care provided by physician offices and emergency departments. Retail clinics have not led to any substantive decline in emergency department visits. More than half of clinic visits for low-acuity conditions represented new health care utilization. As a result, contrary to expectations, retail clinics increased health care spending per person per year.

Amazon kicked things off just one day removed from Halloween and now, major retailers including Best Buy, Target and Walmart are following suit. Best Buy is planning to open doors on Thanksgiving Day at 5 p.m. and remain open until 1 a.m. Friday before reopening again at 8 a.m. Shoppers won’t have to wait that long as more than a dozen deals from Best Buy’s Black Friday ad are already available now. Deals available as of writing include a Surface Pro 4 for $599.99 (down from $999.99), Bose SoundSport In-Ear Headphones priced at $39.99 (regularly $99.99) and a 70-inch Vizio 4K TV that can be yours for $999.99 (a savings of $300). Target, meanwhile, will be opening at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day for the third year in a row. Early Access deals, which run through today only online and in stores, include a Jetson V6 Hoverboard with Bluetooth for $284.99 (regularly $399.99), various PlayStation 4, Wii U and Xbox One games for $35 each and 25 percent off all Apple TV models. Walmart's Black Friday in-store deals begin at 6 p.m. (stores will remain open all day on the holiday) with online deals going live that morning at 12:01 a.m. Eastern. There are plenty of deals available online as of writing although irritatingly enough, you can only view them through Walmart’s mobile app. If you’re willing to grab the app, you can snag deals like a 65-inch Hitachi 4K TV for $599 (a $400 savings), $150 off an Acer 15.6-inch laptop with Core i5 processor and an Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft bundle with bonus controller for $279. As always, the retailers are holding back their best Doorbuster deals until closer to Black Friday.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 11, 2016 -- 00:22 GMT (16:22 PST) | Topic: Hardware Walmart's Black Friday ad includes an Apple iPad mini 2 sale and $119 Chromebook deal. The Black Friday ad wars are finally starting to heat up, with Walmart's ad surfacing shortly after Target's. Like its rival, it has more tablet deals than ads leaked earlier in the cycle -- including Apple's iPad -- along with specials on several low-cost laptops. While Target has three different iPad models on sale, Walmart just has one -- not surprisingly, the Apple's cheapest model. The iPad mini 2 is discounted to $199, 79 cents less than what Target is going to be offering it for. Walmart makes up for it with a number of Android tablet specials, including a 7-inch RCA for just $28. It also has the Samsung Galaxy Tab E Lite 7-inch slate for $69 (99 cents lower than at Staples, with a $10 Google Play thrown in) and the Lenovo Tab 10 model for $99 ($50 off the regular price). Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals Also listed are a trio of tablets with bundled wireless keyboards, including a RCA Cambio 10.1-inch device that runs Windows 10 for $99, though that's only about $10 less than the current price on the Walmart website. There are a pair of Android 2-in-1 deals in the form of a 10.1-inch SmarTab with Intel Atom processor for $72, and a 11.5-inch RCA Galileo Pro for $98. Given their surging popularity, Chromebooks have been largely unseen in Black Friday ads thus far. Walmart has one, however, at a low price of $119. For that price ($60 less than Samsung is currently selling it for online), the Samsung Chromebook 3 gives you an Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of built-in storage, and a 11.6-inch display. If you want a cheap Windows 10 laptop instead, you'll have to pay a bit more ($199) for the HP 15-ba018wm with AMD E2-7110 processor, 4 gigs of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and 15.6-inch display. Walmart has three additional budget notebook listed in Black Friday ad, each with a 15.6-inch displays. These include the HP 15-f222wm with an Intel Pentium N3540 CPU, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and touchscreen for $249, and an Acer laptop with Intel Core i5 chip, 6GB of memory, and 1TB hard drive for $299. Finally, for a little more ($349), there's the HP 15-ba051wm with AMD A10-9600P processor, 8GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and choice of chassis color, along with a wireless mouse, 16GB flash drive, and a sleeve included in the price.

Reports Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results / Conference Call Begins Today at 4:30pm EST WAYNE, PA -- (Marketwired) -- 11/10/16 -- ICTV Brands, Inc. (OTCQX: ICTV), (CSE: ITV), a digitally focused direct response marketing and international branding company focused on the health, wellness and beauty sector, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Third Quarter 2016 Highlights: Positive cash flows from operations of $104K Launched our website for the United Kingdom end of Q3 Incremental E-commerce sales of $163K which includes Bed Bath and Beyond, Walmart, JCPenney and Overstock and now Costco Canada which was launched in 3Q Streamlined expense structure resulting in $143K in decreased G&A expenses from prior year quarter Brick and Mortar retail sales of $78,000 Management Commentary: Richard Ransom, President, stated, "Over the last year, our sales and marketing platform has expanded far beyond our traditional direct response television model. Today ICTV is proud to partner with over ten major North American retailers which distribute our flagship product DermaWand, as well as several of our other brands. We feel the investment in our omni channel platform has laid the foundation for ICTV to bring new products to market all around the globe. The work our team has done in this respect has positioned us to make the announced acquisition of the PhotoMedex consumer assets, including the world renowned no!no! hair removal brand, and creates the ability for ICTV to take advantage of similar opportunities in the future." Reported Financial Results: Third Quarter 2016 Compared to Third Quarter 2015: Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $4.2 million, compared to $3.6 million in the prior year quarter, and $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. The year over year increase is attributable to higher media related expenditures, increased international sales and retail and e-commerce sales as the Company continues to broaden its media footprint with its push into additional e-commerce and retail outlets in the fourth quarter.

USPS, FedEx, UPS Open November 11? BuzzWorthy 21 0 0 November 10, 2016 Veterans Day Post Office Hours: Is There Mail Delivery Friday? USPS, FedEx, UPS Open November 11? Cheryl P Is the post office open on Veterans Day and will USPS, UPS, and FedEx deliver mail and packages on Friday, or is everything closed on November 11? Although many retail stores, including Walmart and Target — and even a few banks — will be open on the federal holiday, there always seems to be a bit of confusion over whether the U.S. Post Office and other package delivery companies will be open for business. Veterans Day is one of 10 federal holidays in the United States and is always observed on November 11, and this year, it falls on a Friday, which means many federal employees have a three-day weekend to look forward to. If you need to mail a letter or are waiting for a package to arrive, here’s the scoop on what to expect when it comes to Veterans Day mail and package deliveries from U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, and UPS. This #VeteransDay honor veterans and military members with #ServiceCrossStamps! https://t.co/8gkzWpWfij pic.twitter.com/9NjCqMLJS4 — U.S. Postal Service (@USPS) November 10, 2016 According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, most federal employees work on a Monday through Friday schedule. That means if the holiday falls on a weekday, most non-essential government personnel will get the day off, including the majority of postal workers and the person who delivers your mail. The U.S. Postal Service will be closed on Friday, November 11, in observance of Veterans Day, and that means all post office branches will be closed. Mail won’t be delivered to businesses and residences on Friday but will resume on Saturday, November 12. Check with your local USPS branch office for Saturday hours if you need to check your post office box or mail a package. Of course, you can always drop your mail or small package in a blue drop box found in various locations across the nation (use the USPS collection box finder here), but it won’t be on its way to its destination right away. According to the USPS, postal workers assigned to work on federal holidays may empty collection boxes “to avoid overflow conditions,” but mail won’t be processed through the postal system until the next business day. Of note, the U.S. Postal Service delivers many packages to Amazon customers, and users posting on this thread of the Amazon forum state that some customers have received packages via the USPS on both Sundays and federal holidays, but it’s best to check with Amazon to find out when your package is due to be delivered. What about the United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express (FedEx)? Will these package delivery companies be out and about on Veterans Day? Glad UPSers and @RepPeteKing could be a part of @PVA1946's #OperationRampitUpforVeterans — helping veteran Jerry Gorski. @UPS_Foundation pic.twitter.com/j7agRxBmkX — UPS Public Affairs (@UPSPolicy) November 7, 2016 Both UPS and FedEx shut down on many federal holidays, but Veterans Day isn’t one of them. You’ll see white FedEx trucks and those familiar brown UPS trucks out and about on Friday, November 11 — drivers will be delivering package according to the normal weekday delivery schedule. According to Federal Express, the company provides normal pickup and delivery service on four federal holidays: Veterans Day, Martin Luther King Day, and Presidents Day, and Columbus Day. Most FedEx offices will be open on these holidays as well. United Parcel Service operates on a similar schedule and, according to the UPS holiday calendar, all packages will be delivered according to schedule on Friday, November 11. Most UPS stores will be open for business if you need to pick up a package that is on hold or ship one out. The next holiday observed by the U.S. Postal Service is Thanksgiving, November 24. FedEx and UPS will also be closed on the holiday. There is no doubt that postal employees and those who work for FedEx and UPS will be resting up that day ahead of what will be yet another busy package delivery season. #TreesForTroops is our way to say thank you to those serving our country. Retweet this post, and we’ll add this message onto a tree. ???? pic.twitter.com/6NwQ3065Dc — FedEx (@FedEx) November 7, 2016 If you plan on shipping out gifts and/or Christmas cards this year, the USPS has already posted its shipping cutoff dates for the 2016 holiday season: Domestic first-class mail (cards and letters) needs to be postmarked by December 20 to guarantee Christmas delivery, and the cutoff date for packages shipped within the United States via Priority Mail is December 21. According to UPS, the last day to ship 2nd Day Air packages to be delivered before Christmas Day is December 21. As far as FedEx goes, Packages that are shipped First Overnight, Priority Overnight, or FedEx 2Day will be delivered on Christmas Eve, December 24, but the deadline to ship your package out varies by zip code.

Thanksgiving Hours 2016 Here is when some of the best deals will begin Nov 10, 2016, 1:41 pm EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has announced its Thanksgiving hours for 2016. Source: Flickr The retail giant announced a slate of deals on this year’s upcoming Black Friday sale, along with the hours in which it will be open this Thanksgiving. Turkey Day seems to be pushed more and more into the background as a larger number of stores deem it OK to open up its doors on the most important holiday in the U.S. Starting early in the day — at 12:01 a.m. — on Thanksgiving morning, Black Friday deals will be available on Walmart.com. Stores will be available throughout the day, but the deals won’t be in effect until 6:00 p.m. local time on Thanksgiving Day. “I said it before and I will say it again, we will win the season on price – on Black Friday, on Cyber Monday and every day before and after,” said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S. Specifying what he meant by that, Bratspies said that the company is known for its deals in stores, online and on its app. The availability of more items and the low prices that come along with them are two of the moves that will ensure the company performs well this year. Check out some Black Friday deals offered by Walmart, including a very affordable 4K TV. WMT shares surged 1% Thursday. Thanksgiving is only two weeks away now.

(Scott Schild | sschild@syracuse.) Print Email Kevin Tampone | ktampone@syracuse.com By Kevin Tampone | ktampone@syracuse.com The Post-Standard Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 10, 2016 at 11:30 AM comments Several major Black Friday shopping destinations have revealed their plans in the last 24 hours and it's no surprise they include Thanksgiving openings. Sears, Target, Best Buy and Wal-Mart will be open on the holiday again this year with plenty of deals available for bargain hunters. Best Buy will open at 5 p.m., while Target and Sears will follow at 6 p.m. Wal-Mart is taking a page from Amazon's playbook and kicking things off early. Shoppers can get some deals starting today through the company's app, according to USA Today. Most of the chain's stores have been open 24 hours on Thanksgiving itself for years. This year, in-store deals will start at 6 p.m. on the holiday. Online sales start at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving. All four retailers had the same in-store hours in 2015. Although a handful of retailers have backed off from Thanksgiving hours in the last year or two, most of the big names are sticking with the holiday strategy. Experts say that as Amazon has pushed promotions earlier in the month, brick-and-mortar retailers feel pressure to keep pace. The effect has been to transform Black Friday significantly. Although it's still a big day for in-person shopping, deals and sales are now spread throughout the entire holiday weekend and season.

The first incident occurred shortly after 2 a.m. when police responded to a report of a man hitting and kicking vehicles on New South Street. The caller told police that she saw the suspect stand on the hood of her vehicle and kick the windshield, cracking it, Capt. John Cartledge said. The suspect, Daniel Cashman, 38, of 145 South St., told responding police that he was upset over the way the polls in the presidential elections where shaping up. Cashman was arrested and charged with malicious damage to a vehicle. The second incident occurred shortly before 7:15 a.m. when police received a report of a customer assaulting another inside the Walmart on North King Street. The alleged victim told police he was assaulted by a man who had been standing in one of the aisles. When the victim asked the suspect if he was going to move, he did so, but then hit the victim in the back of the head and he "saw stars, Cartledge said. The suspect, who had been crying, told a store employee that he was distraught over Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. "How do I explain to my daughter that we have a sexist bully as our president?" the man said, according to the police report. William G. Park, 51, of 8 Blackberry Lane, was arrested on a charge of assault and battery on a person older than 60.

Hilarious photos show how badly-spaced writing can turn innocent signs into something VERY rude Internet uses have been sharing their examples of  kerning gone wrong Many instances see a 'c' and an 'l' placed too close in the word 'click'  People called Clint have also found that their name can cause problems By Martha Cliff for MailOnline Published: 06:51 EST, 10 November 2016 | Updated: 13:05 EST, 10 November 2016 e-mail 950 shares 84 View comments At a first glance you wouldn't be blamed for thinking these signs were showcasing some very rude slogans. However, these seemingly insulting slogans are in fact the entirely innocent victims of badly laid out words. Kerning, or sentence spacing, is what helps identify one word from another in a sentence but it's obviously gone out of the window in these cases. In this case a pack of 'flickering' fairy lights rather resembled a pack of f***ering lights Netizens have taken to the web to share the most jumbled sentences that have ended up extremely offensive. In many cases a 'C' and an 'L' placed too closely together in the word 'click' has resulted in the sign appearing to refer to the male appendage.

Top Livingston County Area News Get the Latest on 93.5 FM Lyon Twp. Man Arrested After Hitting Elderly Couple, Fleeing The Scene November 10, 2016 Charges have been issued against a Lyon Township man who struck two elderly people with his truck and then fled the scene.

Deputies were able to determine the identity of the driver, who is a 65-year-old male and a resident of Lyon Township. Officers located his unoccupied pickup parked nearby and searched the interior of the vehicle. Deputies contacted the registered owner who identified the driver. Deputies then called the driver, who agreed to come to the Lyon Township Substation several hours after the incident to speak with the officers. The driver, whose license is currently suspended, admitted to hitting the pedestrians. He has had a prior conviction for Driving While License Suspended. The driver was arrested and lodged at the Oakland County Jail for Leaving the Scene of a Personal Injury Accident, a second offense of Driving While License Suspended and an unrelated misdemeanor warrant for an alcohol related charge. Both victims were transported by paramedics to St. John’s Providence Park Hospital for treatment and are listed in stable condition. The incident remains under investigation.

The National Retail Federation expects industry holiday sales to grow 3.6% this year to US$655.8bil (RM2.79tril).  In order to avoid running out of stock on popular holiday items, which is a problem for many retailers, Wal-Mart has sufficiently stocked itself with items for Black Friday both in-store and online, Steve Bratspies, the company's chief merchandising officer, told reporters during a conference call on Wednesday.  In an example of Wal-Mart's purchasing scale, the retailer has stocked more than 1.5 million televisions and 3 million videogames, Bratspies said.  In a briefing in October, Wal-Mart laid out plans for the overall holiday shopping season this year and said it will make tens of thousands more items from its online assortment available for same-day store pickup, and will offer more lower-priced items instead of deals.  Last month, Target said it will offer more deal-driven promotions and extend its free shipping window to January this year.  Wal-Mart and Target will kick-off their Black Friday promotions on Thanksgiving day at 6pm in their stores. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read RM8mil dragon attraction Italy make four changes for South Africa test MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites S&P, Nasdaq higher as tech stocks recover; Dow pauses SP Setia’s sales spike to RM943mil in Q3 HSBC: China-led RCEP in focus as TPP fades MP Evans rejects KL Kepong’s sweetened takeover offer (Update) Most Viewed in Tech Best smartphones for the holidays Sex hook-up websites' login credentials hacked Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump WhatsApp adds secure video calling Xiaomi opens its Mi Store on Lazada Lenovo unveils the IdeaCentre Y710 Cube gaming PC Twitter gets new 'Sun and Moon' Pokemon stickers Snowden warns of increase in US domestic spying after Trump victory Nintendo Wii at 10: the iconic games Western Digital redesigns its external drives Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

'As he was leaving, he was saying that I and our baby that I am pregnant with have to die,' she told police in the application for the court order. 'He has grabbed me by my neck in an attempt to kill me.' Scroll down for video  History of violence: Suspect Michael Cwiklinski (pictured left) died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he allegedly opened fire on two officers and killed his pregnant wife, Dalia Sabae (right), after she had obtained an order of protection against him  Police vehicles line streets of the Canonsburg, Pennsylvania neighborhood where two Canonsburg police officers were shot when they responded to a domestic call early Thursday Law enforcement personnel gather after the shooting where offices were 'ambushed', authorities said Sabae, a pharmacy worker and an expectant mother, went to stay at an emergency shelter after her latest confrontation with her husband, but she returned home after a few days.  When her husband were served with papers related to the restraining order, investigators believe he snapped, grabbed a long rifle and drove to Sabae's home.   Cwiklinski shot two Canonsburg police officers who responded to a report that the couple were fighting early Thursday, killing one of them. Cwiklinski and Sabae were later found dead, the man of a self-inflicted wound. His wife was three months pregnant at the time of her death.  Officer Scott Bashioum, 52, a seven-year veteran officer and married father of four, died at a hospital. Officer James Saieva underwent emergency surgery Thursday and was listed in stable condition Friday.  Hundreds gathered at the borough building Thursday evening. A military memorial already festooned with American flags for Veterans Day had also become a memorial for Bashioum, as people dropped off flowers, stuffed animals, signs and other mementos. An electric message sign blinked with the words, 'Please keep Scott Bashioum and his family in your thoughts' and 'Godspeed to our injured officer.' State police said Cwiklinski ambushed the officers, essentially waiting for them to arrive and opening fire even immediately. The fact that Cwiklinski 'laid in wait and fire upon the officers as they arrived speaks for itself,' state police Capt. David Heckman said.  The surviving officer, who was reportedly shot in the stomach, was flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh. His name has not been released, but he is currently in intensive care at Allegheny General Hospital with injuries not believed to be life-threatening After shooting the officers, Cwiklinkski ran from the scene and a manhunt ensued. Following a six-hour search, officials confirmed Thursday morning that Dalia Sabae and Cwiklinski were found dead inside the home, according to KDKA. Cwiklinski, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly shot the woman, who was three months pregnant, and eventually turned the gun on himself. Attorney David Wolf said he had known the couple since November 2015, when Cwiklinski was charged with simple assault and harassment for swinging a bag of groceries, reportedly containing 'heavy cans', and hitting Sabae in the eye outside a Walmart. Following that incident, Sabae filed a protection from abuse order, describing how her husband attacked her with the grocery bag after she offered to help him carry it, reported KDKA. That case was eventually resolved with the assault charge being dropped and Cwiklinski pleading guilty to harassment. He was sentenced to anger management classes and required to have a mental health evaluation, Wolf said. The attorney added that he had encouraged Sabae to get another protection order and said Cwiklinski was there when he ran into the couple at the county courthouse. Cwiklinski and Sabae, an Egyptian citizen, had met online, Wolf said.  In June, Cwiklinski was cited for harassment in connection with another dispute with his wife, according to the Observer-Reporter.  The slain police officer has been identified as 52-year-old Scott Leslie Bashioum (left). Surviving Officer James Saieva (right) is listed in stable condition after surgery Leslie Bashioum, a father of four, was pronounced dead at Canonsburg Hospital shortly after 4am, less than an hour after the shooting, the Washington County coroner said.  James Saieva, the surviving officer who was reportedly shot in the stomach, was flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh, county Coroner Tim Warco said. He was listed in stable condition after surgery at Allegheny General Hospital. Trooper Melinda Bondarenka told reporters the officers were immediately met with gunfire when they arrived at the scene just after 3am Thursday. 'Upon their arrival, the two officers were ambushed,' Bonderanka said. 'They were shot with an unknown type of firearm.' Bashioum and the other officer were responding separately to the 911 call from neighbors when they were 'ambushed upon their arrival' and immediately shot, Bondarenka said. Cwiklinski was charged with simple assault and harassment for swinging a bag of merchandise and hitting Sabae (left and right) in the eye outside a Walmart in November. She was reportedly three months pregnant The officers had arrived almost simultaneously, though authorities said other details of the initial confrontation were not immediately clear.  A firefighter responding to the scene told KDKA that when the shooting started, one of the officers was 'bleeding badly.'  'The shooter had everyone pinned down when they were trying to get him. I don't know where he was shot,' the firefighter said.  Police were seen near at least two homes in the borough about 20 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. A SWAT team was also on the scene and a police helicopter was patrolling overhead during their search for the suspect. Earlier in the morning as authorities searched for the suspect, homes in the Woodcrest Drive area were evacuated while residents in the surrounding area were warned to stay in their homes. It is understood one officer has died following this morning's shooting on Woodcrest Drive. A pregnant woman inside the home has also died During the manhunt for the suspect, residents had been warned to stay in their homes The Canon-McMillan School District canceled classes on Thursday because of the heavy police presence Authorities said the duplex may have been 'booby-trapped' but declined to provide details. Gas cans were reportedly found inside the house and inside the suspect's car, according to WPXI. KDKA reported, citing unnamed sources, that Cwiklinski packed his vehicle with gas cans and propane tanks, and opened fire on the car, trying to blow it up, but his plan failed.  The bomb squad from neighboring Allegheny County was called to safeguard the scene before police entered and found the couple dead, police said.    Angela Kelly, of Strabane, places flowers in front of the Canonsburg Municipal Building in honor of the officers shot on Thursday   Share or comment on this article e-mail 38 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

Back then, it was all about the Black Friday midnight madness. We went back in our archives to remember what Black Friday was like in the ’90s. There was a big crowd at Walmart in Kunia at midnight. You didn’t have the option to order online and pick your purchase up later. Liberty House was still at at Ala Moana Center. Remember KB Toys? But deep down, decades later, the hype and hate for one of the biggest shopping days of the year hasn’t changed. “We’ve only been to Liberty House so we’ve got to walk the rest of the mall,” said one shopper. When asked how much longer she plans to shop, she replied with a laugh, “Maybe another five, six hours, maybe till 9 o’clock.” “She’s in Liberty House spending all my money, but I came along to make sure she doesn’t go over the credit limit,” said an (unwilling) shopper. “I was supposed to be at the golf course, but I had to cancel my tee time.” Another thing that hasn’t changed is parking. It’s still a pain trying to find a spot.

Gray Thursday. Whether it leaves you tickled pink or seeing red, the preeminent shopper's holiday will once again ooze into Thanksgiving Thursday. But the retail bleed won't stop there. "A few years ago, the biggest threat to Black Friday was Thanksgiving," says Eric Jones, co-founder of BestBlackFriday.com, a deal tracking site showcasing "leaked" retail advertisement scans, sales analyses and superior deals. "While Thanksgiving remains a worthy foe, both days are now in danger of losing consumer spending to 'Black November,' which is an entire month of sales that bear the 'Black Friday' name in some fashion." More Information Most major retailers, like Walmart and Target, began touting pre-Black Friday sales, early doorbuster deals and one-day-only steals weeks ago. "Black Friday prices will be available earlier than ever this year," says Jones and you can expect some Black Friday events to begin before Thanksgiving Day and last through Cyber Monday. The spending may spread, and it may be possible to complete a lot of your November shopping before Thanksgiving, but nothing will trump the deals you can nab on Turkey Day, says Jones. Like last year, doors at most major retailers will swing open before you've had a second helping of pumpkin pie. Bad news for bargain-hunters who would rather drift into a tryptophan-induced slumber. "Many shoppers do not like stores being open on Thanksgiving, but it is an important day to shop if their goal is to save the most money possible," says Jones. "The major retailers will continue to offer their absolute best doorbusters on Turkey Day, so it is really a requirement at this point." Dogged deal hunters may not need to rush to scrub the dishes and head to the brick-and-mortar stores for the best doorbusters, though. A slew of retailers started offering the most coveted products online last year, and will likely do so again, with a few exceptions. "Certain retailers — notably Kohl's — did not offer their top doorbusters online last year," says Jones. "Some stores will continue to be stubborn, but that is now the exception, as opposed to the rule." What else can shoppers expect this holiday season? Three of my favorite sale-scouring sources — BestBlackFriday.com, Bfads.net and BlackFriday.com — offer these predictions: • 1: Sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday are going to be well into the billions this year. On Turkey Day, shoppers will spend an estimated $2.07 billion online and $1.58 billion in stores. As for Black Friday, shoppers will likely spend $3.08 billion online and $9.2 billion in stores. • 2: Thanksgiving weekend shoppers will have access to more than 52,000 advertised Black Friday deals (49,000 in 2015), including 15,000 deals under $20. • 3: Expect a record 7,000 Black Friday doorbusters with more available online and via mobile device than ever before. • 4: To compete for your attention, stores will offer an increased number of store exclusive products — especially toys — and bundle deals on electronics that include gift cards and special accessories. • 5: The price on popular 4K HDTVs will continue to slide with many models priced below $500. Expect off-brand, 32-inch standard televisions to be priced below $100. • 6: A low-end laptop should start at around $90 this year. Most average laptop door busters will be around $150. If you are looking for an actual quality laptop, it is going to cost around $350. • 7: Expect 1,500 video game deals with more than 500 under $20, $200 Xbox One bundles, $300 PS4 bundles and new Xbox One S bundles at $300 and PS4 Pro bundles at $400. • 8: The best prices for toys are in December — specifically the middle two weeks — but Black Friday still has some solid deals. Shoppers should be aware that the current toy book sales do not have great prices, so they should avoid them. While Toys "R" Us is known for their toys, Belk, JCPenney, and Kohl's actually had higher average discounts on toys last year. • 9: Amazon will offer its Kindle Fire for $35, Fire Sticks for $20 and Kindle Fire Kid's Tablets for less than $60. Also, look for smart home devices like the NEST, Amazon Echo and wireless WiFi home security systems at their lowest prices of the year. • 10: The new Apple iPhone 7 will be offered with significant signup bonuses such as store gift cards, free accessories or no money down.

Prev of images Next Last weekend I spent the most delightful day watching videos about dogs at the Dog Film Festival in Sacramento. It was a magical collection of dog-themed films from around the world. One of the most meaningful was one that featured veterans and their therapy dogs. Many returning veterans are traumatized by the experience of war, death and constant fear. According to K9S For Warriors, one in five veterans suffer from PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder), and 22 veterans commit suicide every day. Enter the therapy dog who is specially trained to recognize the symptoms of stress or overload. K9S For Warriors is dedicated to saving lives of both veterans and dogs. Over 90% of the dogs in the K9 program are shelter dogs. Who could ask for anything more? K9 For Warriors is saving shelter dogs and our brave veterans returning home. I was overcome with emotion when I watched several of the veterans interacting with their buddies. One veteran actually started crying as he described the emotional bond between him and his dog. Their bond was obvious, and his dog just adored him. How wonderful is that? I was thrilled by the concept of save a dog, save a vet. If you know anyone who could benefit from this program or you would like to support the program, please go online to learn more at MyK9MyHero.com. I promise you will be amazed by the results this program produces. Happy Veterans Day to all of our two-legged and four-legged heroes!

SHOUT OUT TO Pat, an avid reader of this column alerted me about the many dogs, cats and birds that have been victims of poisoning recently.

Please be careful when you let your pets outside and report any suspicious activity to the authorities. LOOKING FOR A HOME Roo is a two-year-old, domestic lon-ghaired brown-gray tabby.

(ABC7 File photo) 0shares   tweet now! 0shares   tweet now! WASHINGTON(ABC7) — Traditionally, Thanksgiving has always been about turkey, pumpkin pie, football and spending time with family. However in recent years, shopping for deals has become a new Thanksgiving Day tradition. Retailers started opening on Thanksgiving to maximize profits by giving shoppers looking for big sales and door-buster deals, deeper discounts than what could be found on Black Friday. However in recent years, many retailers across the country have decided to reverse this trend by encouraging employees to spend time with their families by keeping their doors closed on Thanksgiving Day. TheBlackFriday.com is reporting that so far this year, 52 retailers including Costco, Home Depot, Ikea, Crate & Barrel, BJs, Nordstrom, REI, and TJ Maxx will be closed on Thanksgiving. According to Nerd Wallet, the beginnings of “Gray Thursday” started in 2006 when Walmart, Target, Toys R Us and Best Buy opened their doors at 5 a.m. on Black Friday. Then in 2009, Toy R Us was the first major retailer to open at midnight on Black Friday. But it wasn’t until 2012, that the concept of “Gray Thursday” was born, when major retailers Walmart and Target decided to stay open for 24 hours on Thanksgiving. Along with the introduction of “Gray Thursday,” Thanksgiving weekend has become a major shopping weekend for shoppers as they not only got deals on “Black Friday” but on “Small Business Saturday” and “Cyber Monday.” Due to “Blue Laws,” stores in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine are required by law to close all of their stores on Thanksgiving. Here is the list of retailers that will be closed on Thanksgiving: A.C. Moore (Allow employees to spend time with family) American Girl AT&T (Customer Service Closed; Select Retail Locations Closed) Bed Bath & Beyond (Select Locations) BJ’s Wholesale Club Burlington (Allow employees to spend time with family) Cabela’s (Retail closed; Call Centers Open) Christmas Tree Shops (Select Locations) Costco Crate and Barrel Dillard’s (Allow employees to spend time with family) GameStop (5 a.m. Black Friday opening) Gardner-White Furniture (8 a.m. Black Friday opening) Guitar Center Hobby Lobby Home Depot HomeGoods (Allow employees to spend time with family) IKEA Jo-Ann Fabric & Craft Stores Lowe’s Mall of America Marshalls (Allow employees to spend time with family) Mattress Firm Menards Neiman Marcus Nordstrom (non-store employees working ) Outdoor Research P.C.

He was a senior adviser, fundraiser and board member for Future 45, the super PAC backed by Joe Ricketts and Sheldon Adelson that became the largest big-money vehicle supporting Trump. Collins used to be executive director of the NRSC and currently lobbies for Google, JPMorgan, the United Launch Alliance (a Lockheed Martin and Boeing joint venture) and the Council for Investor Rights and Corporate Accountability (representing activist investors including Paul Singer, Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman). Story Continued Below On the agencies task force, Bud Albright, who’s chairing HUD, is a lobbyist with Ogilvy Government Relations representing Calpine Corporation, Delta Star, Deltic Timber and the National Association of Water Companies. ALSO ON THE TRANSITION: On the policy side, according to an organization chart I obtained: — Danielle Cutrona, counsel to Sen. Jeff Sessions on the Judiciary Committee is in charge of “Immigration Reform & Building the Wall" — Paula Stannard, a lawyer at Alston & Bird who was deputy general counsel and acting general counsel of HHS, has been tasked with health care reform. — Bert Mizusawa, a major general in the Army Reserve, is leading defense and national security, assisted by Sandra Luff, another Sessions aide. — Rolf Lundberg, who is responsible for trade reform, worked at the Chamber of Commerce until 2013 and spun off his own lobbying firm representing Choice Hotels and the International Franchise Association. — Jim Carter, tasked with tax reform, is an in-house lobbyist for manufacturing company Emerson. — VA reform goes to Bill Hatfield, a former lobbyist and director of the Selective Service System under George W. Bush. — Michael Catanzaro is responsible for energy independence. At CGCN, he lobbies for the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, Hess, Encana, Noble Energy and Devon Energy. His team includes Mike Ference of S-3, who lobbies Halliburton, Koch Industries and Marathon Oil. — Brian Johnson, Chief Financial Institutions Counsel for House Financial Services Committee, has financial services. — Rob Gordon, staff director/senior policy adviser for House Natural Resources Committee, Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, has regulatory reform. — Gerard Robinson of the American Enterprise Institute is leading education, supported by Townsend McNitt, former deputy chief of staff at the Education Department. — Martin Whitmer, a lobbyist at Whitmer & Worrall, is running transportation and infrastructure. He represents the American Association of Railroads, the National Asphalt Pavement Association and the Utilities Technology Council. — Ken Klukowski, senior counsel and director of strategic affairs for the First Liberty Institute, is in charge of “protecting constitutional rights.” The policy team is led by Ado Machida, a top domestic policy aide to former-Vice President Dick Cheney and ex-lobbyist. Andrew Bremberg, a policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and former HHS staffer, leads "executive legal action," and Carlos Diaz-Rosillo, a lecturer at Harvard University, is "executive autority adviser." It's not yet known whether Trump will change Obama's ban on lobbyists in the administration. But the abundance of lobbyists on the transition could preview his posture. “If you’re one of those names, wouldn’t you be expected to go work as a senior adviser to the president?" a Republican tax lobbyist told PI. "Wouldn’t that be a pretty solid expectation based on the way past transitions have worked? And a lot of people on that list are lobbyists. “There’s a recognition by Trump and his team that we don’t know everything and we need to lean on policy experts who do. If they happen to be lobbyists, whatever," the lobbyist continued. "That’s just the way things are," Besides lobbyists, there are a lot of Bushies on the transition, too. All this despite Trump's anti-establishment "Drain the Swamp" rhetoric.

He worked on appropriations, energy, homeland security, tax, regulatory reform, telecommunications and cybersecurity bills, including the ABLE Act and Steve Gleason Act. “He is absolutely plugged in to the dynamics of the House Republican Conference and the Leadership team,” founder Lisa Kountoupes said. The firm represents CVS Health, AdvaMed, Intel, Best Buy and Exelon. — Wal-Mart promoted Bruce Harris to vice president of government affairs, responsible for all federal government advocacy. BLACKLIST: Some Trump allies are plotting to block Republicans who didn't support him from top posts or lucrative consulting gigs, Ken Vogel and Ben Schreckinger report for POLITICO. “My phone is ringing off the hook with people who were on the outs asking how they can get into Trump world,” said one operative who worked with Trump’s campaign. “I’m telling them there is no f---ing way they’re getting inside.” AROUND THE BULLHORN: More election analysis from downtown... CGCN's Sam Geduldig: "The Republican upstarts who gave GOP leaders fits are more invested in Trump’s success than anyone in the party. As a result, they have the most to gain from helping the President-elect move his agenda — and the most to lose, if he doesn’t. This is a dramatic shift that would have been inconceivable under any other newly elected President. "Republican infighting has been a major impediment to congressional action in recent years. We believe Trump’s election could bring a temporary suspension to those disagreements." Baker Botts' Jeff Munk: “President-elect Trump moderated his tax proposals over the course of the campaign and to some extent conformed them to the House ‘Blueprint’ for tax reform. But his plans to cut the corporate tax rate, and repeal the alternative minimum tax, while repealing most business credits, may run up against the realities of Congressional politics and budget process. “President-elect Trump may find more agreement over ending deferral of tax on foreign business income and imposing a one-time tax on accumulated foreign earnings in a more populist Congress. His call to end capital gains tax treatment for carried interests could find broader support.” Cornerstone Government Affairs: "The best indication for how the Trump White House will govern may come from how he decides to work with Republican Congressional leaders, namely Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Trump has spent a good part of the past six months openly lamenting the lukewarm support given to him by Ryan and others from the “establishment” wing of the party, and has threatened retribution for those who he believes are unsupportive of his message. Tension among Trump, Ryan, and the archconservative Freedom Caucus in the House has led to speculation of a possible leadership change for the 115th Congress, but the Speaker looks likely to retain his gavel for the time being. "If Trump and Ryan are able to work out their differences, the Speaker may be able to take advantage of the opportunity to implement his lengthy policy platform, “A Better Way.” The President-elect has indicated he is willing to defer much of the policymaking to Congress, and as a result Ryan may be given the ability to pass a number of his long-desired reforms, such as efforts to simplify the tax code and cut down on business regulations. "On the Senate side, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has come out of this election stronger than ever, as he maintains control over the upper chamber of Congress despite losing two Senate seats in Illinois and New Hampshire. McConnell did a far better job of supporting a Trump candidacy than Ryan, and as a result likely stands to have much more pull in prioritizing his policy goals with the Trump White House. Of importance to McConnell, however, will be building a relationship with new Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the 48 Democratic Senators who still maintain the ability to block many Republican policy proposals with the threat of a filibuster." Bruce Mehlman of Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas: "Trump got out his vote, Clinton did not. A change-minded electorate saw her as more of the same and opted for a new direction. Oh, and everything we thought we understood about campaigns was wrong." LAME DUCK: GOP leaders plan to move lame duck legislation that funds the government at current levels into early next year, part of a strategy to split up any shutdown showdowns and a debt ceiling hike, POLITICO’s Ben Weyl, Burgess Everett and John Bresnahan report. “The word of the day at least is that it would be a high preference of the leadership to keep the [continuing resolution] as clean as possible,” said Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.). Also on the agenda next year: dealing with spending caps for defense and domestic spending. LEADERSHIP: After weeks of threatening to take out Speaker Paul Ryan, the Freedom Caucus appears to be rallying behind him, POLITICO’s Rachael Bade and Heather Caygle report. “The most pressing priority for many of the House Freedom Caucus members is accomplishing significant things in the first 100 days [of a Trump administration],” said Freedom Caucus co-founder Mark Meadows. “To focus on [challenging] leadership — as long as that leadership is extremely supportive of the Trump administration — would be a misplaced effort.” INFRASTRUCTURE: Donald Trump’s $1 trillion infrastructure plan is getting flak from conservative groups like Heritage Action for America and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, POLITICO’s Kathryn A. Wolfe and Lauren Gardner report. "Conservatives do not view infrastructure spending as an economic stimulus, and congressional Republicans rightly rejected that approach in 2009,” said Dan Holler, whose group is the political arm of the Heritage Foundation. Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) and House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) both gave the proposal some words of encouragement on Thursday. DOWNSIZING: Targeted Victory, the GOP’s go-to technology consulting firm that arose from Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, will be splitting into two companies in January, POLITICO’s Darren Samuelsohn and Daniel Lippman report. Co-founder Michael Beach will start a new company offering original digital ad technology services. Partner Zac Moffatt will shift Targeted Victory's focus to political consulting, digital marketing, fundraising and media planning. KOCH WORLD: Charles Koch told donors and staffers his political network will play a larger role in policy as Republicans sweep Washington, Fredreka Schouten reports for USA Today. WHEELS: In a letter to Trump’s transition team, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers asked the President-elect to roll back fuel efficiency standards issued during the Obama administration, The Hill’s Devin Henry reports. “The combination of low gas prices and the existing fuel efficiency gains from the early years of the program is undercutting consumer willingness to buy the vehicles with more expensive alternative powertrains that are necessary for the sector to comply with the more stringent standards in out-years,” the group wrote. KUDOS: Diane Rinaldo, Director of U.S. Government Relations at SAP, was named winner of the 2016 Women of Influence by the Executive Women's forum. She works on cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and used to staff the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

Donald Trump's surprise victory in a tight presidential election defied Wall Street expectations, not only regarding who would lead the country, but the market's reaction to that leader. Instead of latching onto the uncertainties, the market vaulted higher on the president-elect's promise of changing the tax code and launching a huge spending program to stimulate the economy. Interest rates rose and market talk turned to inflation and higher growth. Trump's transition will be a big focus for markets in the week ahead, and of particular interest will be any guidance on whom he plans to name for key Cabinet jobs. Some of those names could be market moving, given the emphasis during the campaign on things like trade and deregulation. There is also a busy economic calendar, with the highlights both Tuesday's retail sales report and CPI inflation data Thursday. Getty Images Traders signal offers in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index options pit at the Chicago Board Options Exchange following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Chicago. The retail sales data and also the comments from merchants, who report earnings during the week, could provide important insights into how consumers weathered the election season. Retailers reporting earnings include Home Depot on Tuesday, Target on Wednesday and Wal-Mart on Thursday. Stocks in the past week surged, with the Dow rallying 5 percent to a new high, its best gain in five years. The Dow ended Friday at 18.847, and the S&P 500 was up 3.8 percent at 2,164. The Nasdaq was up 3.7 percent, but the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a more than 10 percent gain. At the same time, U.S. Treasury yields zipped higher, particularly at the long end. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.15 percent, the highest level since January, from a pre-election level of 1.8 percent. Literally overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, market sentiment shifted, and so did the stocks that were in favor. Financials ripped higher, up 11.3 percent for the week on the outlook for higher rates and less regulation. That was the best week for the sector since the bull market began in 2009. Industrials bounced nearly 8 percent, and the Industrial Select SPDR Fund ETF had its best week in five years. Health care jumped 6 percent on Trump's vow to eliminate parts of Obamacare and on relief that Hillary Clinton did not win. She was outspoken on drug pricing and viewed as negative for drugs and biotech. The IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF jumped 14.4 percent in its best week ever. There was selling in some tech names like Facebook, Amazon.com and Netflix, as investors shifted into new market leadership. "What you've also done here is you've priced in growth based on a resumption of animal spirits that may or may not occur. The point is what we do know this is a [president] who is likely to regulate less, not more. This is also an environment where interest rates have risen sharply enough that we could probably say with pretty high conviction that the lows in interest rates that you saw in July were very significant lows, the psychology around interest rates is turning," said Julian Emanuel, equity and derivatives strategy at UBS. Emanuel is keeping his year-end target for the S&P 500 just slightly higher than Friday's close at 2,175. With the markets now pricing in higher interest rates, Fed officials take to the speaking circuit in the coming week and they are being watched to see if they endorse the idea of a December rate hike, as several have already. Fed Chair Janet Yellen testifies before Congress Thursday,Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer speaks Tuesday, New York Fed President William Dudley speaks Friday and there are more than a half dozen others appearing throughout the week. "If the Fed doesn't raise rates in December, they're never going to raise them," said Jeff Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine, in an appearance on CNBC. Gundlach also said he believes the run up in yields is about 80 percent over, but the move higher should also resume next year. Strategists say the time is right for the Fed to move, given the positive reaction in markets to the changes coming in Washington. "What's important for active managers, important in that their decisions have been governed and their difficulty in generating alpha in the last four or five years, has been very much a function of the psychological slog of ultra-accommodative monetary policy being the single most determinant of asset prices," said Emanuel. "The thought of that ending is really the thing that, for us, has caused a lot of sector rotation. There's been a ton of turn in the market. it's also changed the psychology. … The people we talk to are more engaged in trying to come up with alpha generating ideas more than in the entire period of the post financial crisis." As U.S. yields rose, emerging markets were also stung by a sharp jump in rates. Their currencies were slammed, especially the Mexican peso, which was down more than 10 percent on the week. Investors will be watching out for any comments from Trump on many topics, including trade. In an interview Friday with The Wall Street Journal, he said he would potentially impose tariffs on products of companies that relocate overseas. Oil slumped in the past week, sliding 15 percent amid supply concerns. West Texas Intermediate futures were trading just above $43 late Friday. The S&P energy sector, however was up 2 percent even with the breakdown in crude futures. "If it breaks $43, it will be a huge worry," said Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS. He said stocks could move higher but there will be bumps along the way, particularly if oil remains under pressure.

Members of the Salvation Army Advisory Board join the mayor in putting the first donations in one of the kettles that will raise money for the less fortunate this season. From left: Maralin Manning, John Pasciucco, Mayor Koch, Capt. Tim Ross, commanding officer, Salvation Army Quincy Corps; Amy Huber and Don Uvanitte. Quincy Sun Photo/Robert Bosworth The Salvation Army’s Quincy Corps announces its annual Red Kettle Campaign is underway. The Salvation Army Red Kettle is an important event in Quincy, and bell ringers can be seen at various locations throughout the city during the holiday season. The money raised during the Red Kettle Campaign is a critical source of funding for vital programs and services for tens of thousands of families, youth and senior citizens in Quincy and across Massachusetts each year.  This includes meals, toys and other holiday support for those in need, along with funding for food pantries, social services, and education programs throughout the year. “We see new people in need of The Salvation Army’s services each day,” said Captain Timothy Ross, Corps Officer of The Salvation Army Quincy Corps Community Center. “Each circumstance is a bit different.  Some parents have seen their hours reduced and can’t make ends meet, and others don’t have enough income to cover the rising cost of food and utilities. We are excited to get the red kettles back out there so that we can continue to help all those in need.” Donations from the Kettle Campaign fund a variety of local services, including The Salvation Army’s preschool program in Quincy. The Salvation Army expects that the number of people in need across the Commonwealth will be at or near record levels this year. Funds raised during the holiday season support needed services and transformational programs all year round. “With only six weeks to raise funds that need to last all year, it’s critical that we get off to a strong start this year,” added Captain Nicole Ross. “We are fortunate to live in such a caring and supportive community and we’re asking our friends and neighbors to help us achieve a successful Red Kettle Campaign in Quincy.” Salvation Army officials stress that any contribution will help — and donations of time are accepted as gratefully as donations of money.  You can find a Red Kettle outside of all Stop & Shop and Shaw’s/ Star Markets locations in the Quincy, Braintree, Weymouth, and Hingham area as well as Roche Brothers and Walmart in Quincy.  Other locations include the South Shore Plaza and the Walmart in Weymouth.  Online Red Kettle donations can be made at www.salvationarmyma.org/Quincy. “Reaching out to those in need by volunteering to ring bells is a wonderful way to connect with the community, to give back, to share blessings, and to be blessed in return,” said Captain Timothy Ross. To volunteer this Christmas season, contact Captain Timothy Ross at 617-472-2345 or by email at Timothy.Ross@use.salvationarmy.org. The Salvation Army is also grateful for the support of Quincy’s area businesses that have sponsored many of our kettles this year.  Sponsors include Quincy Credit Union, Colonial Federal Savings Bank, Quincy College, The Quincy Sun, Curry Hardware, NorthEast Community Bank, Dr. John Pasciuccio, DDS, Rotary Club of Quincy, Keohane Funeral Home, and the Law Offices of Morgan J. Gray, P.C., and Eastern Insurance. The Red Kettle tradition began in 1891 when Salvation Army Captain Joseph McFee wanted to help feed needy citizens in San Francisco. McFee remembered the ferry landings in Liverpool England, where people would sit with small kettles that travelers would toss spare change into to help the less fortunate. Placing his own kettle on Market Street in Oakland California, McFee was able to help individuals on Christmas. The idea traveled to Boston in 1897 and the Red Kettle Campaign has been a tradition ever since.   For more information, please visit www.salvationarmy.org/Quincy This entry was posted in This Just In by rbosworth.

By 2018, there will be 2.5 billion smartphone users worldwide, according to eMarketer Inc. They will be navigating to restaurants, Snapchatting their vacations, checking movies playing at the nearest cinema, RSVPing on Meetup or looking up product availability at area Walmart stores. According to the Pew Research Center, 90% of smartphone owners use them to get information related to their location. Now, companies are starting to tap the location-based services (LBS) on consumers' phones in order to send them relevant offers and messages. According to the Location Based Marketing Association's (LBMA) latest trends report, 75% of marketers agree and believe that location-based marketing is an important business issue for 2016. Location-based technologies use wireless transmission, such as between a smartphone and a beacon or Wi-Fi access point, to pinpoint a user's location. A mobile app that has access to a phone's location services can provide navigation as well as location-specific content, like coupons or product reviews. In fact, there are myriad uses for LBS in marketing, advertising and customer engagement. MEPLAN GmbH, a German trade services provider, created the expoNAVIGATION app to help conference attendees find their favorite exhibitors faster. A user searches a database of exhibitors and enters a list of those he wants to visit. The app uses beacons to plot the shortest route around the floor, thus optimizing the customer's time and, hopefully, boosting sales for exhibitors. The Aquarium of Western Australia (AQWA), based in Hillarys, Australia, has a mobile app that guides visitors along several themed tours (like the Shipwreck Coast or Animal Extremes tours) with interactive activities for kids. Created by Apps Ppl, a developer of cloud-based mobile apps, the AQWA app is part of a larger mobile app -- "Everythere" -- that tourists use to research activities around Perth and to get directions. Location is the only piece of data that lets you know where people are throughout the day so you can engage [with] them. Asif Khanpresident, Location Based Marketing Association But it's the ability to combine location data with other customer information collected from a mobile app or store loyalty program that has the biggest potential for personalizing how businesses engage with their customers. People often use smartphones to browse the web, make online purchases and pay at the checkout counter. That information, and more, can be accessed and used to understand the buyer's habits and shopping preferences. "[LBS] can tie your entire marketing strategy together," said Asif Khan, president of the LBMA. "We're using location to blend brick and mortar with e-commerce and digital." The data can also be aggregated and combined with other consumer information and used to analyze consumer behaviors and trends. Investment in location-based technologies will rise significantly in the near future, according to Juniper Research Ltd., based in Hampshire, England. The firm expects the LBS market to jump from $12.2 billion in 2014 to $43.3 billion by 2019, with context-aware mobile services being the main driving force. Potholes in the road to location-based technologies Nevertheless, businesses have been cautious about adopting LBS, despite their interest. Forrester Research's report "Make Smart Wireless Location Technology Decisions" found that just 3% of businesses surveyed were actually using beacons, while another 11% were piloting them. This is because location-based services are actually a collection of technologies -- some old, some new and others still in research and development. It's a rapidly developing market, one that can quickly confound an unsuspecting marketer or business owner. The most common technologies are the following: GPS: GPS systems are commonly used for maps and other outdoor navigation. They can't penetrate walls and aren't accurate enough for use in small spaces, so they're not used for indoor tracking. Wi-Fi: Already generally offered free to customers, Wi-Fi is often used for simple tracking of store traffic. One downside is it can't identify unique individuals if they're using an iPhone, and accuracy can vary. Bluetooth beacons: Used primarily for indoor navigation, beacons have an accuracy range of one to several meters, depending on the product and whether fingerprinting or triangulation techniques are also used. Available in sizes as small as a matchbook, they can be hidden behind pictures or in lights. According to Forrester's June 2016 report "Make Smart Wireless Location Decisions," some beacons can send only basic data and can't accept updates, while others are more flexible. Beacons also require maintenance. "You have to place them, manage them, change batteries in them. They're operationally intensive," explained Andre Kindness, principal analyst at Forrester, which estimated an annual maintenance cost of $240,000 for keeping beacons operational in a 1,000-square-meter store versus $60,000 for Wi-Fi. On the other hand, Wi-Fi nodes run $900 a piece, according to the same study. Two emerging technologies are visible light, emitted via smart LED lights and potentially capable of tracking with an accuracy of a few centimeters, and ultrasound waves, which send out chirps that are picked up by a phone's audio receiver. Both are promising technologies, said Bruce Krulwich, chief analyst at New York-based Grizzly Analytics Ltd., which specializes in mobile technologies like location-based services and IoT. However, both have their drawbacks, as well. For visible light, businesses have to replace their lighting with smart LED lights and controllers. Meanwhile, ultrasound may trip on other ambient sounds. With more work, however, both may achieve performance better than today's Bluetooth-based solutions, said Krulwich. Fear of big brother Consumer concerns about privacy are another challenge for location-based technologies. To work well, the apps need access to the phone's location services, and consumers can deny apps access. According to the Pew Research Center, over one-third of adults and 46% of teenagers turn off location services due to fears over privacy. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's (LACMA) mobile app requires both Bluetooth and location services to be fully functional. To encourage participation, the museum pre-empted the usual terse system messages users get asking if they want to share location data with one that asks, "Would you like to receive location-based data?" "We created it to be less intimidating," said Tomas Garcia, digital media product developer at LACMA. He added that it's also faster than using individual service prompts. In fact, users will give up their location data for the right incentive. A Forrester brief, "Fuel Contextual Marketing with Location Data," found that most phone owners would do so in exchange for benefits like discounts, a loyalty program, rewards for visiting a store or to get navigational aid in a store. A location-based future? Location is rapidly becoming the most valuable piece of information for consumer marketing. Social media platforms and many mobile apps, like weather and news, already collect a user's location information, said Khan, and they make it available in aggregate form to advertisers. "We describe location as the cookie for the physical world. Location is the only piece of data that lets you know where people are throughout the day so you can engage [with] them," he said. Behavioral data, such as location, is fast becoming more important in marketing than standard demographics, said Maribel Lopez, head of mobile marketing research firm Lopez Research, based in San Francisco. "Behavioral demographics are much more interesting," said Lopez. "You may find that Android users do this, iOS users do that, people who are in my store 10 minutes do one thing, while those who stay much longer do another." But that also means marketers must think through their messages to target customers' preferences without making them feel stalked. "The greatest challenge will be to figure out what messages you want to send and where," said Lopez. "It's the most contextual engagement you can have, and people expect engagement, not a generic message or coupon."  Next Steps Use location data to bring customers closer -- but not too close The location-based services dilemma: Privacy vs. convenience How customer trust factors into location data This was last published in November 2016 Dig Deeper on Mobile CRM software All News Get Started Evaluate Manage Problem Solve The bright and potential dark side of mobile location-based services Mobile LBS poses challenge for companies, consumers alike Mobile location-based services teeter on ethical line Maximize growth through sales collaboration Load More View All Maximize growth through sales collaboration Blockchain as a service may be in your future -- like it or not Nordstrom mines Beacon benefits in personalized customer service New digital marketing trends for 2015 emerge with full force Load More View All News Cubs merch store homers with location-based mobile marketing Going multichannel will improve customer experience -- but not without a plan Holiday shopping season signals future of mobile engagement Putting customers on the map with geolocation mobile apps Load More View All Get started Sales intelligence software converts prospects into customers LBS technology still in trial phase for most companies LBS powers personalized intranet design Cubs merch store homers with location-based mobile marketing Load More View All Evaluate The bright and potential dark side of mobile location-based services Mobile LBS poses challenge for companies, consumers alike Mobile location-based services teeter on ethical line Mobile, social CRM table stakes for customer engagement strategy Load More View All Manage How to address the mobile customer experience Going multichannel will improve customer experience -- but not without a plan Holiday shopping season signals future of mobile engagement Mobile devices are uprooting your CRM business processes Load More View All Problem solve PRO+ Content Find more PRO+ content and other member only offers, here.

'As he was leaving, he was saying that I and our baby that I am pregnant with have to die,' she told police in the application for the court order. 'He has grabbed me by my neck in an attempt to kill me.' Scroll down for video  History of violence: Suspect Michael Cwiklinski (pictured left) died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he allegedly opened fire on two officers and killed his pregnant wife, Dalia Sabae (right), after she had obtained an order of protection against him  Police vehicles line streets of the Canonsburg, Pennsylvania neighborhood where two Canonsburg police officers were shot when they responded to a domestic call early Thursday Law enforcement personnel gather after the shooting where offices were 'ambushed', authorities said Sabae, a pharmacy worker and an expectant mother, went to stay at an emergency shelter after her latest confrontation with her husband, but she returned home after a few days.  When her husband were served with papers related to the restraining order, investigators believe he snapped, grabbed a long rifle and drove to Sabae's home.   Cwiklinski shot two Canonsburg police officers who responded to a report that the couple were fighting early Thursday, killing one of them. Cwiklinski and Sabae were later found dead, the man of a self-inflicted wound. His wife was three months pregnant at the time of her death.  Officer Scott Bashioum, 52, a seven-year veteran officer and married father of four, died at a hospital. Officer James Saieva underwent emergency surgery Thursday and was listed in stable condition Friday.  Hundreds gathered at the borough building Thursday evening. A military memorial already festooned with American flags for Veterans Day had also become a memorial for Bashioum, as people dropped off flowers, stuffed animals, signs and other mementos. An electric message sign blinked with the words, 'Please keep Scott Bashioum and his family in your thoughts' and 'Godspeed to our injured officer.' State police said Cwiklinski ambushed the officers, essentially waiting for them to arrive and opening fire even immediately. The fact that Cwiklinski 'laid in wait and fire upon the officers as they arrived speaks for itself,' state police Capt. David Heckman said.  The surviving officer, who was reportedly shot in the stomach, was flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh. His name has not been released, but he is currently in intensive care at Allegheny General Hospital with injuries not believed to be life-threatening After shooting the officers, Cwiklinkski ran from the scene and a manhunt ensued. Following a six-hour search, officials confirmed Thursday morning that Dalia Sabae and Cwiklinski were found dead inside the home, according to KDKA. Cwiklinski, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly shot the woman, who was three months pregnant, and eventually turned the gun on himself. Attorney David Wolf said he had known the couple since November 2015, when Cwiklinski was charged with simple assault and harassment for swinging a bag of groceries, reportedly containing 'heavy cans', and hitting Sabae in the eye outside a Walmart. Following that incident, Sabae filed a protection from abuse order, describing how her husband attacked her with the grocery bag after she offered to help him carry it, reported KDKA. That case was eventually resolved with the assault charge being dropped and Cwiklinski pleading guilty to harassment. He was sentenced to anger management classes and required to have a mental health evaluation, Wolf said. The attorney added that he had encouraged Sabae to get another protection order and said Cwiklinski was there when he ran into the couple at the county courthouse. Cwiklinski and Sabae, an Egyptian citizen, had met online, Wolf said.  In June, Cwiklinski was cited for harassment in connection with another dispute with his wife, according to the Observer-Reporter.  The slain police officer has been identified as 52-year-old Scott Leslie Bashioum (left). Surviving Officer James Saieva (right) is listed in stable condition after surgery Leslie Bashioum, a father of four, was pronounced dead at Canonsburg Hospital shortly after 4am, less than an hour after the shooting, the Washington County coroner said.  James Saieva, the surviving officer who was reportedly shot in the stomach, was flown to a hospital in Pittsburgh, county Coroner Tim Warco said. He was listed in stable condition after surgery at Allegheny General Hospital. Trooper Melinda Bondarenka told reporters the officers were immediately met with gunfire when they arrived at the scene just after 3am Thursday. 'Upon their arrival, the two officers were ambushed,' Bonderanka said. 'They were shot with an unknown type of firearm.' Bashioum and the other officer were responding separately to the 911 call from neighbors when they were 'ambushed upon their arrival' and immediately shot, Bondarenka said. Cwiklinski was charged with simple assault and harassment for swinging a bag of merchandise and hitting Sabae (left and right) in the eye outside a Walmart in November. She was reportedly three months pregnant The officers had arrived almost simultaneously, though authorities said other details of the initial confrontation were not immediately clear.  A firefighter responding to the scene told KDKA that when the shooting started, one of the officers was 'bleeding badly.'  'The shooter had everyone pinned down when they were trying to get him. I don't know where he was shot,' the firefighter said.  Police were seen near at least two homes in the borough about 20 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. A SWAT team was also on the scene and a police helicopter was patrolling overhead during their search for the suspect. Earlier in the morning as authorities searched for the suspect, homes in the Woodcrest Drive area were evacuated while residents in the surrounding area were warned to stay in their homes. It is understood one officer has died following this morning's shooting on Woodcrest Drive. A pregnant woman inside the home has also died During the manhunt for the suspect, residents had been warned to stay in their homes The Canon-McMillan School District canceled classes on Thursday because of the heavy police presence Authorities said the duplex may have been 'booby-trapped' but declined to provide details. Gas cans were reportedly found inside the house and inside the suspect's car, according to WPXI. KDKA reported, citing unnamed sources, that Cwiklinski packed his vehicle with gas cans and propane tanks, and opened fire on the car, trying to blow it up, but his plan failed.  The bomb squad from neighboring Allegheny County was called to safeguard the scene before police entered and found the couple dead, police said.    Angela Kelly, of Strabane, places flowers in front of the Canonsburg Municipal Building in honor of the officers shot on Thursday   Share or comment on this article e-mail 38 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

Over the next few days, a rash of racism, sexism, abuse, and hatred spread across the country. Many of the following stories were collected by activist Shaun King; more can be found on his Twitter timeline. Here is a look at the first three days of Donald Trump's America. And be warned: The language and images below are highly upsetting. Sadly, they are all too real. Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016 "I told them to back off when one of the men pushed me towards the wall. The woman then pulled my hair throwing all different kinds of racial slurs saying things like, 'Can you even speak English?' or 'Nobody even cares for your kind, you're hardly human, just an animal.' I started to cry and the threats just continued. I pushed back, trying to run or go through them, but I was immediately pushed back. Two older men came running to me and they tried to break up the commotion. One of the men was protecting me, as the woman was still trying to pull my hair saying, 'I can't believe you'd even protect something like that. Now that Trump's president, you won't have to see that!' The man protecting me pushed her back and she stopped.

 Amazon’s cloud is funding its war on Walmart, rival says Eugene Kim Nov. 11, 2016, 2:52 PM 4,328 facebook linkedin twitter email print Amazon CEO Jeff BezosGetty Images In case you still think Amazon is still predominantly an ecommerce site, here's something that'll change that. According to Deutsche Bank, Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services, has become so big that some people think it is subsidizing the company's retail operations. It wrote in a note Thursday: "One AWS rival, making the point that the cloud infrastructure business has proven to be far more profitable than everyone thought, argued that the margin story at Amazon has now flipped, such that 'AWS is now underwriting Amazon’s war on Walmart.'" In fact, AWS is now the most profitable and fastest-growing business at Amazon. AWS had $3.2 billion in revenue last quarter, only a fraction of the $29 billion Amazon's retail business generated in the same period. But it saw far higher margins, with about $1 billion in operating income, compared to Amazon retail's $360 million. On top of that, AWS is still seeing a whopping 55% year-over-year growth rate, which means it still has a lot of room to grow and will likely continue to be a crazy profit-generating machine for a while. In other words, Amazon can keep pumping AWS's profits into its retail business, a market known for notoriously thin margins and intense competition. The irony is, AWS began its life as a way for Amazon to make extra money on the huge infrastructure it had built as a way to support its retail operations. Amazon Tax This isn't the first time the investment community talked about this. Social Capital's VC investor Chamath Palihapitiya went so far as to say he would bet his entire capital on Amazon if he had to choose one company precisely because of this dynamic. "The reason I think this has nothing to do with e-commerce, although e-commerce is their way of dog fooding the real reason: AWS," he said in a Quora Q&A session earlier this year. Palihapitiya even compared AWS to a "tax"because it's so widely used by every company that it'll eventually turn into a fixed annual cost for most businesses. He said: "AWS is a tax on the compute economy. So whether you care about mobile apps, consumer apps, IoT, SaaS etc etc, more companies than not will be using AWS versus building their own infrastructure. If you believe that over time the software industry is a multi, deca-trillion industry, then ask yourself how valuable a company would be who taxes the majority of that industry." To understand just how big AWS is compared to its competitors, this chart by Synergy Research Group should give a clue. In its latest quarterly analysis, the market research firm said AWS accounted for 45% of the revenue generated by public "infrastructure as a service" (IaaS) providers, bigger than the next three players combined, which are Microsoft, Google and IBM.

Within a few minutes of opening, most locations were completely sold out. Ever since the reveal of the new system this summer, anticipation has been extremely great, and Nintendo appears to have underestimated how popular it would be. Still, it’s possible to get one. Yes, many went out on Friday morning to try and pick up an NES Classic of their own, but some were sent home with empty hands. Target, Best Buy, Walmart, Kmart, GameStop, and numerous other retailers sold out in quick fashion, and many employees simply answered the phone by saying, “We sold out in less than five minutes, dude.” I love you @NintendoAmerica but WHY???! #NESterday #NESmini #nesclassic pic.twitter.com/WqrQEpyl3m — Chava Mercado (@chavachievement) November 11, 2016 According to Polygon, Nintendo should have realized the popularity and excitement of the new system when they announced it four months ago. Some believe it would have been easy and expected for the company to ship out enough of the NES Classic Edition systems so they could get them to all consumers. Meanwhile, some locations had no more than 10 units to sell. Some had just six or even five, but all hope is not lost. As reported by CNET, Amazon is going to give fans a chance to pick up an NES Classic Edition of their very own on launch day, but they will need to work fast. At 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, Amazon will open availability for the $60 mini Nintendo system that is packed with 30 old-school games such as Metroid, Super Mario Bros., and the original Legend of Zelda. Amazon is making sure that everyone gets a fair shot at it too, and that is why they didn’t accept pre-orders. [Image by Nintendo] Amazon sent out emails to anyone who said they were interested in the NES Classic Edition and gave them the instructions for landing one on launch day. There will be “very limited quantities” according to Amazon, but again, they’re making this an open and fair game. One-click ordering has been turned off by Amazon, and they are limiting sales to just one per customer for the time being. They urge everyone to have their credit card and billing address information up to date so the process can be completed in a quick fashion. The short supply has brought out those looking to profit from Nintendo’s decision to release the system in small numbers. A lot of people have purchased multiple amounts of the NES Classic Edition and are selling them on online auction sites for double and triple the price, and some have had price tags as high as $1,000. Limited Stock Brings Out the Inevitable NES Mini Scalpers https://t.co/Z1uZKjwBuk #NES #Retro #NESMini pic.twitter.com/8ONLxHz9Wi — Nintendo Life (@nintendolife) November 11, 2016 If you don’t get one from Amazon later today and don’t wish to spend hundreds of dollars for one, there are other ways to prepare yourself for the next wave of NES Classic Edition systems. Sign up for email alerts – Target, Best Buy, Toys R’ Us, and other retailers allow you to sign up for alerts that will email you when an item becomes available. Check daily – One never knows when new shipments will come in, so check online availability and call stores every day. Never trust one response – As quickly as the systems were flying off the shelves on Friday, many online systems couldn’t keep up. Target’s website and app kept showing availability at stores when there were no longer any in stock. If a store shows some in stock online, call first to be sure before driving out. With more than a month to go until Christmas, there will still be numerous chances to get an NES Classic Edition mini system from Nintendo. Stores will have them back in stock, but you’re still going to have to move quickly if you want one now. Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and others will give you more opportunities, and your best bet right now is to sign up for alerts and be prepared when your phone buzzes.

Shop with a Cop Foundation Silicon Valley For the past eight years, the Shop with a Cop Foundation Silicon Valley hosts more than 100 under-served children for a holiday shopping spree with local Bay Area police officers. For many of the children, this special opportunity becomes the only holiday experience they will have. Some participants are selected from the Readers Are Leaders reading campaign at local elementary schools, where they “earn” their way to the shopping spree. Other children participating are living in traumatic crisis from the loss of a parent, domestic violence and other tragedies. With a uniformed police officer by their side during the shopping spree, each child receives a $125.00 Target gift card to shop for gifts for their family members and for themselves. The whole premise is to humanize the people behind the badge so that children can grow up trusting the police. This unique program brings the holiday spirit to children who need it most, and hopes to build safer communities for our future. We are registered 501- (C)-3 charitable org. 669-226-2663.

We’ve already seen Black Friday deals from T-Mobile and HTC leak, while brick and mortar retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy have shared some of their deals. While Amazon is expected to have a wide range of items with big discounts on Black Friday, they’ve specifically highlighted the discounts that will be available for their own products including Kindle, Amazon Echo, Echo Dots, and deals on Fire TV and Fire tablets. Here’s a quick peek at what Amazon will offer. Amazon Black Friday Deals November 20 – Kindle Paperwhite for $99 – $20 off November 24 – Amazon Echo for $139 – $40 off November 24 – Echo Dot for $39 – $10 off November 24 – Fire TV stick with Alexa remote for $29 – $10 off November 24 – Fire HD 8 for $59 – $30 off November 24 – Fire tablet for $34 – $16 off It’s worth noting if you’re considering expanding into a smart home ecosystem, right now Amazon’s Alexa offering is much more fleshed out than Google Home.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Salvation Army needs ringers Friday Nov 11, 2016 at 11:40 AM Nov 11, 2016 at 11:40 AM Roger Bluhm/@roger_dcglobe The Salvation Army of Dodge City is seeking volunteer bell ringers to help with the 2016 Red Kettle Christmas Campaign, which runs Nov. 23 to Dec. 24, except Sundays and Thanksgiving Day. Volunteers will ring bells at six locations. Volunteers can select hours and days based on their own schedules between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Most locations have a two-hour minimum for bell-ringing. The six locations are Walmart, Dillons, Farmer’s Country Market (formerly Thrifty King), Hobby Lobby, Waters True Value and Village Square Mall. "This is a great opportunity for individuals, families, groups, churches and friends to get together and give back to our community," said Lieutenant Enrique Coreano, Corps Officer of The Salvation Army. "Bell ringing has been a long-standing tradition around the world, and our volunteer bell ringers within our community are an essential part of this holiday campaign. "The funds raised through our Red Kettle Campaign not only support The Salvation Army for the upcoming year, but also help us provide other services throughout the year, including things like disaster response, food assistance through our onsite food pantry, help for the homeless, emergency rent and utility assistance, youth programs such as overnight camps and character building programs, targeted case management, and furniture, clothing and basic necessities through our Thrift Store." The Salvation Army of Dodge City is hoping for a good start to the Red Kettle drive this year. In the previous two drives weather and a lack of bell ringers hindered the fund raising campaigns from the start. The Red Kettle Campaign is a tradition that began in San Francisco in 1891, and has spread across the United States, as well as to Korea, Japan and many European countries. In the United States, The Salvation Army now assists more than 4.5 million people during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season. To volunteer and serve as a bell ringer, call their office directly at 620-225- 4871. The Salvation Army is also accepting donations for its Christmas Campaign. To contribute, you may mail a check to The Salvation Army, P.O. Box 14, Dodge City, KS 67801 or donate online at www.donatedodge.com. The Salvation Army is also launching an online platform called Red Kettle Reason, which allows individuals, groups and businesses to host a "virtual red kettle" online and invite friends, family and colleagues to donate.

Since going on sale at a variety of major retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and EB Games, the reissued console has sold out. In other words, it’s 1985 all over again (there are rumours Amazon.ca will be selling the console later today). Priced at $79.99, the tiny NES Classic Edition comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES titles, including Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid and Mega Man. It also supports HDMI output, obviating the need for users to dig up a TV that supports RF and RCA input. One other nice addition is a Suspend Point system, which allows you to save a game at any point. This seems like a minor addition but is actually a major quality of life improvement over how games from that era handled saving a player’s progress. The Nintendo Entertainment System launched in Japan on July 15th, 1983 and quickly became the best-selling game console of its time, selling some 61.91 million units across the world before it was finally discontinued in 2003. Related: Nintendo reveals nostalgia-fueled Mini Famicom SourceWalmart, Best Buy Sean-Paul Damn it…..Was definitely hoping to grab one of these The Iceman Cometh Fact is if you want one of these you’re going to have to pay alot more than $79.99. I managed to score one on eBay last night for $180 which is a premium for sure but really the only option it seems. Nintendo clearly is holding back inventory on this stuff. St. Misery Couldn’t wait huh? I highly doubt they’re holding back inventory, once the Xmas season is over this will be a forgotten memory. The Iceman Cometh I’d rather pay a bit more than be seen standing outside an EB Games at 530 in the morning. That kind of thing is plain stupidity. Hanseul Choi This only promotes the scalpers. This isn’t a limited edition where everyone can just wait some time where it will be readily available. Besides, you were able to wait all these years without them right. So how much will it hurt to wait another month or so. I also grew up with these games but I will never pay extra to these scalpers as it is just insane and the system doesn’t even worth that much. The Iceman Cometh Well I paid a mere $100 more whereas some are willing to pay three times that amount which is insane I agree with you generally speaking but I see stock of these being limited no matter what and I have better things to do with my time than run around to stores hunting for one Hanseul Choi If you have disposable money to spend extra I can’t say much to that. But I rather wait and not buy from these scalpers as this just makes things worse. Also no one can’t predict whether the stocks will be limited in the future. This is not a new gaming console and perhaps a very old NES unit that people buy for nostalgia so I don’t see them being so limited in the future as the demand will come down eventually. It is also a closed system where there will be no new games so no point to rush and get the unit. John Smith Say that to the Wii.. nearly took 2 years to have them stay on shelves. Lexcyn I tried my luck at WalMart this morning at 7:30 and they were sold out… everyone then went across the parking lot to EB and there were about 40 people in line. I said screw it and left. Later went back to WalMart and spoke with someone in electronics, they said they are scheduled to get shipments fairly regularly so I am not worried about getting one (eventually). MoYeung I prefer the red and white Japanese version. The Iceman Cometh Who cares. Is it a gaming unit or a piece of furniture? MoYeung More furniture than an emulated gaming hardware from 1983. SuperDSpamalot Why can’t they just sell the emulation software and the ROMs? Setup a Nintendo Steam-like service with built in emulators for all their old systems. Rev0lver Because they want to make more money and they know their business. callak _ You mean like the eShop for the WiiU or 3DS? The Iceman Cometh Greed. Pretty simple. Mario Gaucher I have a friend that went to EB Games this morning at 5:30am to wait outside of the store… there was already at least 10 person before her. John Smith I remember how rare the Wii U was before the holidays of 2006.. shrewd marketing, flawed supply chain, inflating demand? Either way, this is not the first time Nintendo is doing this to its customers. Ernie What sucked is that BB stock didn’t go on sale till 4am my time AST. Then read that it was sold out in seconds. What a crock. Dimitri You know most BB stores had stock but held some units for their workers?. I know this as i used to work there and my buddy said they got over 15 units but around 9 of them went to workers inside that got them before customers did. Sad to see they are still doing this. The Iceman Cometh Yeah that’s bullshjt Dimitri Most locations at Best Buy are like this sadly. They give their employees first picks and some employees even hide the stuff so that way they can grab it. So let’s say the warehouse team has 30, some staff will take them off of the shelves and hide them behind products to grab after and make it look like they had them or have their family pick it up. Working at Best Buy I have seen alot. Lol. Omar Damn, and I’d probably get fired for hiding a box of cookies working at Safeway lol… Dimitri Lol. At Best Buy if you are close to the managers, you can get away with anything sadly. Troll Like how close are we talking? Dinner and date? Or the whole shebang with physical intimacy? Dimitri Everything in between and all. Sadly if you are close to a manager and in their liking side or buddy-buddy then u can get away with alot. Mark Anley Made it to Walmart at 10 minutes before opening and there were 14 people in line. Luckily, they had 18 units on hand! Hooked up, played Punch-Out, Beat Mr. Dream…never lost a step :p Anonymous Got mine at 3:00 am this morning online from Best Buy. Confirmed my order, went back to check (roughly 4 minutes) and they were sold out. I was lucky. SmartOneBC No issue, went to Walmart 7am and had 80. I bought 10. 8 went up on eBay so I can make a buck for a change lol zero which walmart ?? Jon Duke I’ll take “things that never happened for 100$”. They announced it was one per customer due to high demand. LS650 Sure. Considering that most stores were issued no more than 10, and all stores were instructed not to sell more than one per customer, I find your story very believable. MR D Had a stack of them at my local Walmart. I got one. I went back later to get another and they were all gone. hardy83 Meh. I’ll get it when they restock. Nintendo is desperate for profit this holiday season with the Wii U basically dead, 3DS slowing down and Amiibo sales slowing as well. This is easy money for them and they will try to build more as fast as possible. lukeysboat managed to snag one online from ebgames last night right after 12am. was pretty brutal though….the website basically crashed. was very lucky Ernie Saw it on amazon for 2 seconds added to my cart. POOF NOT IN STOCK ANYMORE!!!! canucks4life Such BS 🙁 ShmiggsMcBiggs Wow…Amazon actually went down for about 25-30 seconds there… meh…low demand I suppose. And I just wanted a second controller…. Wireless Gadget Went to two Walmart in the morning, both sold out. Went back to my local EB Games and was able to pick one up, took me 2 hours zipping around Markham. Yes I know, this was to satisfy my childhood wish…and Christmas is around the corner… Maybe I’ll regift… Nah. Ricky Bobby Amazon is trolling everyone hard right now Jake Jensen Managed to get one from Amazon after having the item forcefully removed along every step of the checkout process at least 100 times. Ernie ME TOO. It was a tedious process though. Ernie Just got confirmation my order went through. Just waiting for tracking info!!! Jake Jensen Nice! I actually managed to somehow select free next-day shipping too, so it will arrive tomorrow! Ernie I got 1-2 shipping as well. No tracking number yet though. Jake Jensen Oh that sucks, sorry to hear! I got a shipping email this morning so it’s on its way. Still crossing my fingers that it doesn’t get “lost in the mail” Ernie Good luck. I talked to Amazon and they told me mine is shipping. They didn’t have the stock to fill my order. Im pissed now. moviegab haha i went through the same headache and managed to get one around 6:30 Omar I did not expect it to be this popular, at all. I get the nostalgia factor, but wow. heynow00 Toys r us is always a place people forget The Iceman Cometh They have no stock either It’s a joke really J-Ro If they do SNES, I am doing whatever it takes to get one LS650 The ‘shortage’ has been deliberately engineered by Nintendo. They put out a limited number, act all surprised and claim they didn’t correctly estimate demand, and will magically release some more just before Christmas after the product has been hyped up. Nintendo (and other companies) do this quite frequently with new releases. Don’t pay the rip-off prices asked for by the eBay scalpers.
