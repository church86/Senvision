Now, add another -- Wal-Mart Academy. The company announced last September that it planned to open two training centers in Kentucky this year -- one at the Wal-Mart on Kentucky 54 and the other in Middletown, just outside Louisville. Seth DeLoach, academy manager in Owensboro, said the local training center opened on April 27. "We serve 32 stores in Kentucky and Indiana," he said "We can have 15 to 30 students per class, up to 90 a week." Department managers and hourly supervisors spend up to two weeks at the academy -- one week on general information and one on their specific jobs. It's a mixture of classroom work and hands-on experience, DeLoach, a 21-year Wal-Mart veteran, said last week. "They spend a lot of time on the sales floor," he said, Rocky White of Owensboro has been with Wal-Mart about a year. He was recently promoted to manager of the Pick Up Today online orders department, where he supervises four people. White recently completed his first week of training. "I was glad to get the opportunity," he said. "The academy gave me all the tools and information I need for my job. I'm more confident now." DeLoach, formerly co-manager of the Frederica Street Wal-Mart, said the staff at the Academy is still growing. He's not sure what the final staff head count will be. Before the academy was created, DeLoach said, training was computer-based learning and on-the-job training. "This creates a better experience for our customers," he said. "We've seen a big impact on their (employees') engagement with customers. We want to run all stores uniformly." Wal-Mart remodeled 2,572 square feet at in the back of the Kentucky 54 store for the academy. There was no new construction. DeLoach said the former storage space was available because "we don't keep merchandise in the back as long. We move it to the sales floor more quickly now." When graduates return to their home stores, he said, they will have a small graduation ceremony. "Everything we do begins with our associates," Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said in a recent news release. "That's why we have invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today's retail environment. Wal-Mart is a place where anyone can fulfill their potential." The curriculum includes expanded training to cover more than 65 positions, including customer service manager, online grocery pickup and assistant store manager, the news release said. The company said it plans to have 200 academies opened across all 50 states by the end of summer. Since 2016, it said, more than 52,000 associates have graduated, with more than 225,000 on track to complete training this year.

The company, founded in 1962 by Sam Walton, has been gobbling up smaller and niche players in e-commerce in an effort to reach online shopping market leader Amazon. Whether those efforts are paying off will be a focal point when Wal-Mart Stores reports quarterly earnings on Thursday. A bit more than half of all funds spent online in the United States now goes to Amazon, according to the bank Macquarie. Part of Amazon's success stems from its breadth of offerings, which includes the Kindle that people use for reading and the Prime service that broadcasts popular television shows, said Krista Fabregas, e-commerce staff writer at FitSmallBusiness.com. "It's because Amazon has been doing such a great job at injecting itself into our everyday life," she told AFP. "Wal-Mart is not part of everyday life, nor is Macy's, nor is Gap, nor the other stores. We don't have a connection with any of them throughout the day." - Shopping spree - Wal-Mart has been doing some shopping of its own, in an effort to make up ground against Amazon. It spent $3.3 billion last year to buy Jet.com, which was started by e-commerce entrepreneur Marc Lore, whose previous company was sold to Amazon for $550 million. Lore is now chief executive of Walmart eCommerce US, where he oversees 15,000 employees split between Silicon Valley, Boston, Omaha and Bentonville, Arkansas, where Wal-Mart is based. His annual salary at $237 million is 10 times that of Wal-Mart chief executive Doug McMillon. In less than five months, Lore has directed Wal-Mart to a number of acquisitions, including Shoebuy.com ($70 million), ModCloth ($45 million) and MooseJaw ($51 million). Wal-Mart is also in talks to acquire the menswear chain Bonobos for $300 million, according to a person close to the matter. Part of Wal-Mart's objective is to become a go-to place online for "essential" products, such as toilet paper, beauty products, groceries and holiday gifts and children's toys. "We are focusing on the type of products that customers buy most," said Wal-Mart spokesman Ravi Jariwala. "We want to make sure that we have the best prices, shipping to your home or offering a pickup discount." Wal-Mart in February scrapped a subscription delivery program that was a rival to Amazon Prime in favor of a guarantee of free two-day shipping for orders of more than $35. Under the program customers can also pick up orders below $35 for free if they go to one of Wal-Mart's 4,700 US stores. - Amazon keeps edge - These efforts may cut into Amazon's lead in e-commerce, but overtaking Amazon appears unlikely anytime soon. "They have invested heavily on channels. It will restore growth that was necessary for survival," said Keith Anderson of e-commerce analytics firm Profitero. "I don't see anything that suggests that Wal-Mart would catch up to Amazon or beat Amazon, but it's still very early," he said. The vigor of Wal-Mart's online investments today contrasts with its initial reticence in e-commerce, which was due to worries that growth of online shopping would cut into sales at brick-and-mortar stores. Wal-Mart also was slow to introduce platforms for individual vendors who sought a venue for goods and did not introduce such an online marketplace until 2015, much after Amazon. Hannah Donoghue, director of advisory at Planet Retail RNG, said it is still relatively early in the game as far as e-commerce. Amazon is "the strongest right now, they are far ahead but there are a lot of innovations underway," Donoghue said. "I don't think Amazon will be the only one. There will be another strong player." For now, Wall Street is giving the edge to Amazon, valuing the technology giant at $453 million, compared with Wal-Mart's $230 million. That's in spite of Wal-Mart's far greater overall revenues, which were $485.9 billion in 2016, more than 11 times those of Amazon.

Sean Clarke, chief executive of Asda, who was parachuted into the retailer last July, has scrapped plans for any briefings in a move to duck questions about the group’s future strategy and level of support from American owner Walmart. Analysts expected Mr Clarke to restore Asda’s sales by launching a “Def Con 1” price war against rivals and using some of Walmart’s deep pockets to finance its turnaround. But the retail boss has instead focused on incremental changes, with a focus on maintaining profits for its parent group, rather than growing sales. Asda boss Sean Clarke Clive Black at Shore Capital said that Asda had been suffering because “Walmart extracted far too much money out of Asda, which led to an underinvestment in store standards, weak produce availability and low staff morale”. He added: “This became a vicious cycle that Sean Clarke walked into at a time when the competition was intensifying.” Walmart received £450m from Asda in 2015, its biggest dividend in 12 years despite fierce competition from the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. The supermarket is on Thursday expected to report a 3pc to 4pc slump in full year like-for-like sales although it will also report that the business has “stabilised” in recent weeks after three-and-a-half years of sales declines. Asda grew year-on-year sales for the first time since October 2014 by 0.8pc last month after a strong online performance, according to industry figures by Kantar. However, its sales growth still lagged all the other food retail chains, including its “big four” rivals Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. It invested £30m in improving its premium “Extra” food range over Christmas and launched a “Farm Stores” range of fresh produce to compete with Tesco’s farm ranges.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch Stock Updates For Saturday, May 13 Posted: May 13 2017, 9:05am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The latest Nintendo Switch stock tracking information for online and in stores for Saturday, May 13th. Today the Nintendo Switch is available online as part of bundles. On May 13 GameStop offers two Nintendo Switch bundles. Both bundles ship within 24 hours.  Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com The Nintendo Switch has been on sale on Friday, May 11 again at 5pm ET. Walmart's Nintendo Switch flash sale was over in minutes.  The Switch was available as a custom bundle. Through the Walmart app the $299 Switch consoles have been available too. We were able to purchase a $299 Nintendo Switch using our new Tracker app.  Later our Switch order got cancelled because of alleged credit card information missing. We already checked with American Express and everyhting is in order. We are now in the process to find out with Walmart customer support what happened. Many shoppers report that their orders got cancelled.  Nintendo believes the Nintendo Switch will be as big as the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. Looking at the current shortage, the Japanese video game maker has a long road ahead of them to ship 101 million Nintendo Switch consoles. The positive reception and praise of the Nintendo Switch fuel the demand for the mobile and home console hybrid. Nintendo is also busy marketing the Nintendo Switch with hands-on events and at the E3 2017. Find below the latest Nintendo Switch online availability updates and stock tracking updates for stores. Nintendo Switch Stock at Online Stores On May 12, 2017 the Nintendo Switch is available online as part of two bundles starting at $479.99 online at gamestop.com.  At this point no online retailer is selling the $299.99 Nintendo Switch consoles. The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. Online stores restocked the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in time for the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on April 28. Since then the Switch console was out of stock online, besides the TRU bundle offer, according to data from The Tracker. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $90 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $100 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have risen slightly. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news. How to find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Online We developed the The Tracker app to make finding stock of rare products online as easy and stress free as possible. Download the free app for Apple iPhone or Android phones. From the list products you select to be notified for the Switch with Grey Joy-Con and/or Neon Joy-Con. That is it. It is set and forget. At the moment we detect the Nintendo Switch console in stock at major online retailers, you receive a notification on your smartphone. Now you are just a tap away from buying a Nintendo Switch. You can also see the current availability of the Nintendo Switch consoles in the web version of The Tracker: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con, Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con. Nintendo Switch in Stock at Stores GameStop is restocking the Nintendo Switch since Thursday in stores too. The Nintendo Switch is also only available as part of bundles at GameStop retail locations. The Nintendo Switch is available in 133 Walmart stores, 193 Target stores, 142 GameStop locations according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracker iStockNow (7:30am ET). The number of Walmart stores dropped dramatically yesterday from over 1,000 stores to about 130 mid-day on May 11. The number of stores stayed the same today. We assume Walmart stores did not receive any significant Switch shipments. The Nintendo flagship store in New York said on April 28 in a tweet to have the Nintendo Switch in stock each morning. People in New York or visitors can give this purchase option a try. Social media posts from people who visited the flagship store confirm the availability of the Switch at the Nintendo store in New York. Some even report that they saw the Switch still on the shelves late afternoon. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news.

For investors in Amazon, the most important number to remember is 20. When online sales hit 20% of all purchases in a given retail category, a surge in Amazon growth is sure to follow, according to L2 Inc., a business intelligence firm. It’s a threshold indicating “Amazon is going to displace a legacy retailer,” said Cooper Smith, L2’s director of Amazon research. “Twenty percent is when Amazon steps on the gas ... when consumer behavior is changing.” This pattern has held true for Amazon AMZN, +1.45% since the very first sector CEO Jeff Bezos disrupted, books, which passed the 20% mark between 2007 and 2008. Amazon’s rapid expansion into a “store for everything” continued as online sales passed 20% for consumer electronics between 2010 and 2011, and cloud services, which Amazon dominated from the moment it launched Amazon Web Services in 2006, each time fueling a turning point for the Seattle company. Don’t miss: How Amazon conquered books, electronics and the cloud Now the same trend is playing out in clothing and accessories, with online sales nearing the 20% threshold, said Smith. But the 20% milestone is proving more and more challenging to reach — nowhere more so than in the food and grocery market. What 20% means for Amazon’s foray into fashion The consumer transition to Amazon for clothing is happening fast, according to an April 28 report by Morgan Stanley. Amazon is the second largest U.S. apparel retailer, behind only Wal-Mart, with Amazon taking share from department stores and Target as it rises in prominence. Nearly half of 1,000 adults surveyed in Morgan Stanley’s latest Alphawise survey (46%) reported having bought clothing from Amazon in the past year. About the same percentage (47%) said they expected to buy more clothes from Amazon and fewer clothes from other retailers in the next 12 months. Online retailers have overcome much of the resistance to clothing sales with perks like free shipping and the ability to use your home as a fitting room, rather than actually having to trek to a store — and Amazon has capitalized on those benefits over the years through its Prime program. Cowen & Co. estimates Prime membership at about 50 million as of the fourth quarter of 2016. Traditional retailers, meanwhile, are struggling to win the business of young shoppers who say they’d rather spend money doing things than buying things, and remain disenchanted with the experience of shopping in physical stores. As a result, retailers that expanded their businesses by building more stores are now scaling back. More than 3,500 closures have been announced by department stores including Macy’s Inc. M, -3.04%  , Sears Holdings Inc. SHLD, -6.59% and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. JCP, -13.99%  ; specialty stores such as those run by Gap Inc. GPS, -2.68% and Ralph Lauren Co. RL, -3.57%  ; and chain-store operators that have filed for bankruptcy or liquidated, including Payless ShoeSource, Aeropostale Inc. AROPQ, +5.77% and Sports Authority. See: Nike and Coach are fighting Amazon by creating stores that appeal to all the senses Also: From a risk-of-bankruptcy standpoint, the retail business is the new oil and gas Retailers with the resources to do so, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.55% and Target Corp. TGT, -0.46% , are gearing up to fight Amazon for market share, with both companies putting billions of dollars behind the effort. Wal-Mart invested on the price side of the equation. The company made a $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com and, more recently, scooped up a number of niche fashion sites, including ModCloth and Moosejaw. The company is also said to be in talks to purchase men’s-wear retailer Bonobos. Also: Wal-Mart is beating the pants off Amazon in apparel, and it’s fighting to keep it that way Plus: Wal-Mart to offer discounts for online orders collected at stores Target, meanwhile, keeps adding to its list of private labels, with exclusivity central to its $7 billion overhaul strategy, along with store remodels and a competitive-pricing push. Read: Target is adding stores, but analysts say it should be cutting locations instead Amazon‘s head start, though, could make it all but impossible to dislodge. “Amazon is the main beneficiary of e-commerce growth,” Smith said. KeyBanc Capital Markets estimates that Amazon already has at least 14 private-label brands. “We think that apparel may serve as one of the single biggest incremental growth opportunities in Amazon’s retail business,” KeyBanc analysts including Managing Director Edward Yruma wrote in a March note. Amazon’s private-label goods range from men’s dress shirts to women’s underwear. “These categories lend themselves to repeat purchases, have fewer national wholesale brand competitors, and can leverage Amazon’s data advantage,” the note said. Also: The retail sector is shedding jobs like it’s a recession Amazon declined to comment on its fashion strategy. Apparel is more complex than the media or electronics categories that Amazon tackled early on, so the company is going after items that are “highly commoditized,” like socks and shoes, said Smith. But even though online sales of clothing are nearing the 20% mark, Amazon still faces many challenges in the category. Recent research by Cowen & Co. found that 76% of consumers polled preferred to go to a store for clothes, shoes and accessories. “While longer term, we anticipate consumer preferences will likely continue to shift online, we believe traditional stores will continue to play an integral role in the retail experience,” they said. Still, with opinion shifting about Amazon’s style credibility, shopping habits are following suit. The number of people saying that style is not an Amazon attribute is shrinking. “We think this speaks to how Amazon’s fashion efforts are having an impact on consumer behavior and their willingness to shop for fashion on the site, which over time could lead to even faster apparel growth,” said the Morgan Stanley report. See: Amazon’s most sought-after clothing brands include Nike, Adidas and Under Armour Companies that aren’t being steamrolled are doing something that Amazon can’t. Brands like Everlane and Warby Parker, for example, offer something unique — and that breeds loyalty. Everlane promises “radical transparency,” explaining why items are priced as they are, with a breakdown of such line items as material and labor costs. Eyeglasses purveyor Warby Parker will ship five frames to customers for free to try at home. And there are some experiences that can’t be replicated online. For example, the success of off-price retailers like T.J. Maxx, a TJX Cos. TJX, -2.72% company; Burlington Stores Inc. BURL, -3.45%   ; and Ross Stores Inc. ROST, -2.67% can be attributed to what experts call the “treasure hunt” nature of shopping in those stores, analysts say. “Most pockets of retail success today have some sort of protective moat around their business that helps them fend off Amazon,” said Jared Wiesel, partner at Revenue Analytics. “Take home improvement. While I can certainly buy a power drill online, if I am starting a kitchen remodel, Amazon is unlikely to reap any of my spend.” Fewer and fewer categories nowadays have the cushion that home improvement enjoys. Food fight If changing consumer behavior is key to getting people to buy goods online, there’s a long way to go before online grocery shopping goes mainstream, or reaches the 20% threshold that favors Amazon’s prospects. Online sales account for less than 1% of the $1 trillion grocery market in the U.S., one of the lowest online market shares in all of retail, according to a Moody’s note in March. The credit-rating agency doesn’t expect this online market to grow to more than a 2% or 3% share over the next five years. The company’s standard playbook may not be as effective in the food space, analysts say. Read: Bottled water is now more popular than soda — why you should avoid both “We think most of the growth in online grocery sales will be limited to certain densely populated metropolitan areas, where income levels are more conducive to higher-priced online grocery purchases,” the Moody’s report said. Building a grocery business is going to require major investments in distribution centers, delivery trucks that can bring perishables to customer doorsteps, and other logistical developments that will hamper profits. Curbside pickup is one online model that Moody’s analysts believe can lead to online grocery success. Wal-Mart has planted its flag in the online food and consumer-goods area with its Jet purchase and with curbside pickup, which the company continues to expand. With this service, shoppers pull up to a store, but don’t even need to get out of their cars as a Wal-Mart staffer loads groceries into the vehicle. Recently, Amazon announced the launch of AmazonFresh Pickup, which remains in beta at just two Seattle locations. “It’s going to be a slower disruption than [in] consumer electronics and media,” L2’s Smith said. “But I wouldn’t bet against Amazon’s efforts to disrupt groceries.” Amazon shares have gained 28% in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.15%  has gained about 7%.

Big-box giants like Costco and Wal-Mart are chronically in need of employees, but the retail industry has been poaching workers from the fast-food sector in recent years. Retail is dying? Tell that to fast food By Leslie Patton Bloomberg News 19 hrs ago (…) Daniel Acker / Bloomberg News Daniel Acker / Bloomberg News Customers cussed at him and threw ice cream at him. Finally, Don-Wesley Andrews had enough. He quit McDonald’s in Sacramento, Calif., for a job at Wal-Mart. Like many other Americans, the 22-year-old Andrews improved his life just by moving to retail from fast food. Longer lunch break, paid time off, even a quarterly bonus — and no french fry fragrance clinging to his clothes. “Wal-Mart’s not perfect, but compared to fast food, it’s much, much, much better,” Andrews said. There’s plenty of talk about the retail industry dying, with malls closing and the slump stressing iconic chains like Sears and J. Crew, but healthier big-box giants such as Wal-Mart and Costco are still chronically in need of employees, at least for now. The number of U.S. retail jobs was about the same last year compared with 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. What’s really bedeviling retailers is annual turnover — at 65 percent, it’s the highest since before the Great Recession — making it necessary to keep hiring. The chains are so hungry for good help they’re poaching workers from fast-food restaurants. “Those jobs tend to be more transitional, they tend to be more fluid, and as a result there tends to be higher turnover,” said Michael Harms of Dallas-based researcher TDn2K. “Even though you hear headlines like retail is dying and the robots are coming, there’s still a lot of things that need human touch points. It’s a dogfight over good employees.” When it comes to pay, stores have the edge. U.S. retail sales workers earn a median $10.37 an hour, while food workers, including those at fast food, make $9.35, according to new data from the BLS. Andrews said he earns $12.12 an hour at his new job. Perhaps not coincidentally, Wal-Mart, the largest U.S. private employer, added about 200,000 American jobs over the last decade. Italian fast-casual chain Fazoli’s is trying to fend off retail, according to Dave Craig, vice president of human resources. “It’s a free-for-all right now,” Craig said. While the company is paying 20 cents to 30 cents more than last year, its employees still make $9.20 an hour, on average. That’s less than the minimum of $10 an hour Wal-Mart started giving people last year. Fazoli’s is trying to retain employees. The chain might nix cotton T-shirt uniforms for a Dri-Fit option that employees don’t have to tuck in. Black jeans, instead of slacks, are a possibility, too. And workers may get paid more often — the company is testing a program that gives employees some of their earnings at the end of each shift in a debit card. Boston Market Corp. is buttering up employees, too. It’s handing out as much as $100 to those who get the best customer-survey scores. The chicken chain is spending more to advertise jobs on Facebook, Glassdoor and Twitter and is giving raises. Workers now earn $10.01 an hour, on average — about 75 cents more than last year. Pay increases in fast food are fueled by more than just the competition from retail. Higher minimum wages across the U.S., a better economy and a smaller labor pool to draw from — due to fewer immigrants from Mexico — also have an impact. “You have big distribution centers, you have retailers, you have other restaurant concepts, you have grocery stores, and they’re all looking for great people,” said Jason Lessman, the chain’s vice president of human resources. “It’s just as tough as I’ve seen it in my 12 years of doing recruiting. It’s definitely a war for talent.” In 2014, Starbucks upended its workers’ dress code to include looser rules for tattoos, along with colored ties and scarves and black denim. It further loosened the rules last year inviting employees to “make a statement with hair color.” McDonald’s said last month it was upgrading its uniforms in the U.S. to be more modern and comfortable — an effort to retain workers. “You’re going to see the labor market further tighten,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said in an April earnings call. At the same time, the domestic dining industry is struggling. March same-store sales dropped 0.6 percent, marking the fourth-straight month of declines, according to data from researcher MillerPulse. Profit is being hurt by the extra costs to attract and keep staff to flip burgers, assemble sandwiches and bake pizzas. That’s definitely the case in Sacramento, where many of Andrews’ Wal-Mart colleagues used to serve burritos and chalupas. “There was this joke that they literally stole half the Taco Bell crew,” he said. “There’s a lot of people that used to do fast food that made their way to the retail side.” The Business Journal Business Journal Apr 7, 2017 Business magazine for businesses in the Greater Keene, Brattleboro, and Peterborough area Most Popular Articles Images Videos Commented Articles Two new stores headed to Monadnock Marketplace Two people injured in Keene crash this morning A mentally ill woman's harrowing final days: 'God Knows Where I Am' Keene's Barrett has loose ends to tie up ahead of pro golf career Former police chief convicted on four charges of sexual assault Two taken to hospital after head-on crash near Keene roundabout Former area police chief's sex assault trial opens Former Keene man sentenced for heroin distribution For Swanzey family, Relay for Life honors Janna Karen R.

The world's biggest retailer is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader, analysts said. Another rival, German discounter Aldi Inc, is aiming for prices 21 percent below its U.S. competition and is aggressively expanding its presence. Lidl and Aldi have already upended Britain's grocery retail market, hurting incumbents like Tesco Plc (TSCO.L) and ASDA, the British supermarket arm of Wal-Mart. Lidl (which rhymes with "needle") is owned by Germany's privately held Schwarz Group. It operates more than 10,000 stores in 27 countries. The German chain's U.S. CEO, Brendan Proctor, will address Lidl's U.S. expansion plans at a New York press event on Tuesday. According to the company's website, it is hiring workers in 38 cities in the eastern U.S. states of Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia. "The growth of Aldi and Lidl will require existing U.S. grocery retailers to start asking themselves how they can do things differently to control costs – from marketing and merchandising to operations and logistics," Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail consultancy Bricks Meets Clicks, said in an interview on Friday. Lidl is expected to post U.S. sales of roughly $1 billion in 2018, $2 billion in 2019 and $4 billion 2020, assuming it opens just under 100 stores per year, according to a recent note by retail think tank Fung Global Retail and Technology. This would put Lidl in close range of U.S. grocery chains like Ingles market, which had revenue of $3.2 billion in 2016; Sprouts Farmers Market with $4.3 billion in sales last year and SuperValu Inc (SVU.N), which posted sales of $4.8 billion, the report said. Analyst estimates suggest Lidl is eyeing more than 330 U.S stores by 2020. The retailer has opened three distribution centers in Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia.

(Dennis Nishi/IBD) REINHARDT KRAUSE 12:20 PM ET Reprints If Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen shops at Amazon.com (AMZN) like most Americans, she might pick up insights from the e-commerce behemoth to help her set future interest rates. In fact, Yellen & Co. might want to include Amazon in the mix when discussing oil, housing, health care and other inflationary costs that can signal whether to tap the brakes or let the economy keep rolling. "Amazon is killing lots of businesses. In the process, it may also be killing inflation," Ed Yardeni, noted economist and president of Yardeni Research, said in a recent report. Using Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' playbook, Amazon has pummeled rivals with price cuts enabled by its smart logistics and relentless drive toward efficiency. Labor-displacing warehouse robotics give Amazon a cost advantage, and it aims to one day deploy delivery drones to extend its edge all the way to the customer's doorstep. Amazon's casualty list already is formidable. Over the years, Amazon has left consumer-facing retailers such as Borders, Circuit City and Sports Authority in the dust. Department chains have been closing stores, unable to answer the e-commerce challenge. Now Amazon is taking on gargantuan retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Costco Wholesale (COST). These big-box retailers are trying to fight back, and their main tool is cutting prices. And Amazon is impacting more parts of the U.S. economy as it expands from books, toys and electronics into apparel, groceries and entertainment. Cowen & Co. calls the "$1.3 trillion U.S. grocery market Amazon's biggest potential source of revenue upside." While Amazon's effect on the retail sector has grabbed headlines, there's also Amazon Business to consider. The online sales channel for business customers is sending prices down for industrial products, pressuring companies like W.W. Grainger (GWW). There's also Amazon Web Services, the fast-growing cloud computing business. A Citigroup report in April called the impact of AWS and cloud services "deflationary" on the information technology industry. Giant Scale For now, Fed officials say a tightening labor market has put upward pressure on wage costs. The Fed has hiked interest rates once this year, and is expected to do it twice more. The unemployment rate fell to 4.4% in April, below the structural rate and matching the lows of 2006-07. Yet some economists contend that Amazon's use of automation as it pushes into new markets looms as a long-term factor in restraining job and wage growth. Amazon's scale is unmatched. It's most conspicuous in the retail space. "Traditional retailers will struggle to compete with a business that generated an estimated $225 billion in global gross merchandise value in 2016, growing 29% year-over-year and has the discipline to operate at a 1% margin," said a recent Morgan Stanley report. The CEO of entertainment provider Liberty Media (LMCA), Greg Maffei, called Amazon a "ridiculously scary" rival at a financial conference May 9. Amazon "has an ability, because of its scale, to invest at incredibly low or negative rates of return — because they can cross-subsidize, and the market is willing to suspend disbelief in future profitability," Maffei said. Economist Yardeni, meanwhile, compares Amazon's scale to that of China. "Amazon arguably has done as much as the Chinese to kill jobs and keep a lid on inflation by enabling fast and easy price discovery for anyone with a cellphone," he said. Wal-Mart Impacted Amazon has quickly gained traction in apparel and is now the second-biggest retailer behind Wal-Mart. Now it's taking Wal-Mart head-on. A longtime price discounter itself, thanks to Chinese manufacturing partners, Wal-Mart has seen profits shrink amid Amazon's online onslaught. Wal-Mart in April began offering price discounts for 10,000 items that consumers buy online and then pick up in stores. By June, Wal-Mart plans to expand web discounting to 1 million items. Since it purchased e-commerce startup Jet.com last year, Wal-Mart has ratcheted up its battle with Amazon. Wal-Mart in January rolled out free, two-day shipping for orders over $35. Amazon last week cut its minimum order to $25. Another big-box retailer, Costco, is dealing with Amazon's push into new food categories. While Costco has a strong membership program, its best counterpunch is pricing, says a Piper Jaffray report. "Costco is cheaper than Amazon in consumables," the report said. Making It Easy Making competition intensify is the fact that consumers doing comparison shopping can do so on mobile phones as well as on home PCs. "Certainly online vs. in-store shopping has been a trend for over a decade. What seems new is the comparison shopping that is pervasive," said Don Rissmiller, economist at Strategas Research Partners. "This could be related to Amazon, but it's also that we have mobile devices with fast, readily available networks, and the apps to check the price of various items," Rissmiller said. "What we do know is the retail deflator turned negative in recent years and the Fed should absolutely pay attention." Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, says it's clear that Amazon's success is weighing on prices for many retail goods. "But the impact on overall inflation is small," Zandi told IBD. "The retail goods that Amazon provides account for only about 15% of the consumer basket," Zandi said. "So, if Amazon is responsible for reducing retail goods inflation by 1 percentage point per annum — an aggressive assumption — then this will reduce overall inflation by 0.15%. Not inconsequential, but not a game changer." Deflation In The Cloud In another part of the economy, information technology, Amazon also is a disrupter. Amazon's cloud-computing business is by far the biggest provider of computing resources via the internet, followed by Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and others. As corporate America outsources more computing work to AWS and other highly automated cloud services, companies buy less hardware and software for internal data centers and cut back on IT staffing. In the March quarter, IBM's (IBM) hardware business fell nearly 17% to $2.5 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of cloud adoption. How do the likes of IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) fight back? By cutting prices. "Cloud is deflationary and collapses markets," said a Citigroup report in April. "Labor, with 85% deflation in the cloud, has the most significant disruption from cloud economics," says the Citi report. It says 15 IT staffers in a public, shared cloud service can replace 100 in a private data center. AWS will rake in some $37.5 billion in revenue by 2020, up from $17 billion this year, estimates Citigroup. Since 2006, AWS has been steadily cutting prices for cloud services, with Google and Microsoft following suit. Customers pay cloud service providers as little as pennies an hour per server or as much as $1-$2 an hour, depending on the type of workload. Even with low prices, AWS operating income doubled in 2016 to $3.1 billion, owing to massive scale. "Perhaps most importantly, AWS' juicy operating profit margin of more than 25% gives Amazon a way to fund its new ventures and a retail business that has notoriously skinny margins," said Yardeni. "The cash and financial flexibility AWS provides ensure that Amazon will be a lethal competitor in the retailing industry for many years to come." Even More Influence Long-range, Amazon's influence on job growth and the economy could grow if rivals duplicate its strategies to stay competitive. In fact, Amazon is pushing in the direction of its competitors, driving its automation beyond warehouses and into the retail space. Amazon hopes to eliminate store cashiers at Amazon Go convenience stores now being tested. Amazon Go stores use sensors to track items as shoppers put them into baskets. The shopper's Amazon account gets automatically charged. Amazon recently was granted a patent for automated, "on-demand apparel manufacturing." The patent highlights plans to go beyond clothing into other fabric-based products, such as footwear, bedding and home goods. Amazon is also bringing more of its logistics and delivery operations in-house. "We're in the early stages of drones disrupting the trucking industry and transportation costs," David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, told IBD. "We're reaching an inflection point with robotics and automation, artificial intelligence and the shared economy. Most of these are massive supply-side deflationary developments." Rosenberg says Amazon is part of a new industrial revolution that could push wages down. "Amazon and e-commerce are part and parcel of the fourth industrial revolution," he said.

Business Home LBoard PAS: Selangor excos remain so that DAP doesn’t do ‘bad job’ FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Wal-Mart pushing hard to catch Amazon in e-commerce AFP | May 14, 2017 Part of Wal-Mart's objective is to become a go-to place online for "essential" products, such as toilet paper, beauty products, groceries and holiday gifts and children's toys. NEW YORK: Wal-Mart Stores, the 800-pound gorilla of retail, is running hard to catch up in an increasingly crucial segment where it is neither the biggest nor the best: e-commerce. The company, founded in 1962 by Sam Walton, has been gobbling up smaller and niche players in e-commerce in an effort to reach online shopping market leader Amazon. Whether those efforts are paying off will be a focal point when Wal-Mart Stores reports quarterly earnings on Thursday. A bit more than half of all funds spent online in the United States now goes to Amazon, according to the bank Macquarie. Part of Amazon’s success stems from its breadth of offerings, which includes the Kindle that people use for reading and the Prime service that broadcasts popular television shows, said Krista Fabregas, e-commerce staff writer at FitSmallBusiness.com. “It’s because Amazon has been doing such a great job at injecting itself into our everyday life,” she told AFP. “Wal-Mart is not part of everyday life, nor is Macy’s, nor is Gap, nor the other stores. We don’t have a connection with any of them throughout the day.” Shopping spree Wal-Mart has been doing some shopping of its own, in an effort to make up ground against Amazon. It spent $3.3 billion last year to buy Jet.com, which was started by e-commerce entrepreneur Marc Lore, whose previous company was sold to Amazon for $550 million. Lore is now chief executive of Walmart eCommerce US, where he oversees 15,000 employees split between Silicon Valley, Boston, Omaha and Bentonville, Arkansas, where Wal-Mart is based. His annual salary at $237 million is 10 times that of Wal-Mart chief executive Doug McMillon. In less than five months, Lore has directed Wal-Mart to a number of acquisitions, including Shoebuy.com ($70 million), ModCloth ($45 million) and MooseJaw ($51 million). Wal-Mart is also in talks to acquire the menswear chain Bonobos for $300 million, according to a person close to the matter. Part of Wal-Mart’s objective is to become a go-to place online for “essential” products, such as toilet paper, beauty products, groceries and holiday gifts and children’s toys. “We are focusing on the type of products that customers buy most,” said Wal-Mart spokesman Ravi Jariwala. “We want to make sure that we have the best prices, shipping to your home or offering a pickup discount.” Wal-Mart in February scrapped a subscription delivery program that was a rival to Amazon Prime in favor of a guarantee of free two-day shipping for orders of more than $35. Under the program customers can also pick up orders below $35 for free if they go to one of Wal-Mart’s 4,700 US stores. Amazon keeps edge These efforts may cut into Amazon’s lead in e-commerce, but overtaking Amazon appears unlikely anytime soon. “They have invested heavily on channels. It will restore growth that was necessary for survival,” said Keith Anderson of e-commerce analytics firm Profitero. “I don’t see anything that suggests that Wal-Mart would catch up to Amazon or beat Amazon, but it’s still very early,” he said. The vigor of Wal-Mart’s online investments today contrasts with its initial reticence in e-commerce, which was due to worries that growth of online shopping would cut into sales at brick-and-mortar stores. Wal-Mart also was slow to introduce platforms for individual vendors who sought a venue for goods and did not introduce such an online marketplace until 2015, much after Amazon. Hannah Donoghue, director of advisory at Planet Retail RNG, said it is still relatively early in the game as far as e-commerce. Amazon is “the strongest right now, they are far ahead but there are a lot of innovations underway,” Donoghue said. “I don’t think Amazon will be the only one. There will be another strong player.” For now, Wall Street is giving the edge to Amazon, valuing the technology giant at $453 million, compared with Wal-Mart’s $230 million. That’s in spite of Wal-Mart’s far greater overall revenues, which were $485.9 billion in 2016, more than 11 times those of Amazon.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Wal-Mart scheduled to report Q1 earnings May 18 Shutterstock photo What’s Happening Mega-retailer Wal-Mart ( WMT ) is scheduled to report its first quarter results before the market opens on May 18. Analysts call for earnings of $0.96 per share, down from $0.98 during the same period last year. The stock has appreciated 10.1% on the year. Technical Analysis WMT was recently trading at $75.62, down $1.43 from its 12-month high and $12.90 above its 12-month low. Technical indicators for WMT are bullish and the stock is in a strong upward trend. The stock has recent support above $73.00 and recent resistance below $77.05. Of the 21 analysts who cover the stock, 10 rate it a „strong buy”, nine rate it a „hold”, and two rate it a „strong sell”. The stock receives S&P Capital IQ’s 5 STARS „Strong Buy” ranking. Analyst’s Thoughts So far this earnings season has not been good for brick-and-mortar retailers, as the „Amazon effect” continues to weigh on the sector, but Wal-Mart has the chance to turn things around for the sector. The company has invested heavily in recent years on its e-commerce business, which has started to pay off, and puts the company is a good position to compete against the e-commerce giant. Pay close attention to not just the quarterly profit and sales figures, but also any updates the company gives on its e-commerce growth, as that will be a primary factor driving the stock after the report. The consensus calls for earnings of $0.96, but the street has a slightly higher whisper number of $0.98, which is the number Wall Street really wants to see for the quarter. Stock Only Trade If you’re looking to establish a long stock position in WMT, consider buying the stock under $75.75. Sell if it falls below $68.25 or take profits if it gets to $87.25. Bullish Trade If you want to set up a bullish hedged trade on WMT, consider a September 60/65 bull-put credit spread for a 25-cent credit. That’s a potential 5.3% return (15.3% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 14.0% to cause a problem. Bearish Trade If you would prefer to take a bearish stance on WMT at this time, consider a September 85/90 bear-call credit spread for a $0.20 credit. That’s a potential 4.2% return (12.1% annualized*) and the stock would have to rise 12.2% to cause a problem. Covered Call Trade If you are upbeat on the stock, but would prefer to build in some protection in the event of an earnings miss, consider a September $77.50 covered call. Buy WMT shares (typically 100 shares, scale as appropriate), while selling the September $77.50 call for a debit of $73.95 per share. The trade has a target assigned return of 4.8%, and a target annualized return of 14.0% (for comparison purposes only).

Eli Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators calling for them to reject education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos, calling her “unprepared and unqualified.” (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Much of the funding for California's pro-school choice groups and candidates comes from a handful of very wealthy donors, including the founders of Netflix and The Gap and children of Wal-Mart creator Sam Walton. An Associated Press analysis of top donors to school-choice ballot measure campaigns around the country found 48 individuals and couples provided most of the reported contributions to those initiatives since 2000. Some of those top donors are major backers of pro-school choice candidates in California. In the past, California teachers unions have spent big to defeat high-profile school choice candidates. Last year, several state legislative candidates backed by school choice advocates beat union-backed candidates. Looking ahead to 2018, some of the most active school choice donors are already contributing to pro-charter candidates for governor and state schools chief. The California Teachers Association and its allies defeated a 2000 ballot measure backed by venture capitalist and former state board of education member Timothy Draper to launch a school voucher program in California. Draper contributed $23 million to the effort — the most one person has ever contributed to a single school choice measure. But teachers unions spent even more in opposition. Draper said he became dissatisfied with the public school his kids attended, where he said school boards, teachers unions and textbook makers were looking out for themselves rather than children. He put his kids in private school instead. "I realized that's not fair," Draper said in an interview. "I get to yank them out, and no one else does." Vouchers could allow other schools to break up the traditional public schools' "monopoly," he said. Since 2000, Draper has not been a major player in school-choice politics — partly because of the high cost of his ballot-box failure. Three years ago, Draper put his own money into an unrelated measure to divide California into six separate states. That one didn't make the ballot. Although his vouchers initiative failed, Draper says his efforts helped pave the way for the charters in California. Charter schools are publicly funded but typically run independently of the traditional public school system. Studies on how effective they are compared with traditional public schools have found mixed results. Since the failed ballot measure campaign, other wealthy California families and individuals have spent millions to support groups that contribute to pro-school choice candidates in state races. Netflix founder Reed Hastings has donated more than $5.8 million to a California Charter Schools Association political committee during the past two election cycles. Donald and Doris Fisher, the founders of clothing retailer The Gap, have donated more than $6 million to groups like California Charter Schools Association Advocates and EdVoice, an advocacy group that supports charter schools. Donald Fisher died in 2009. Eli Broad, founder of SunAmerica and KB Home, also has donated millions to those groups. Hastings, Broad and Doris Fisher all live in California.

Jim Carr Walton and Alice Walton, children of the Wal-Mart founder, have contributed millions to California organizations that advocate for school choice. The siblings, who are based in Arkansas and Texas, respectively, each gave $1.4 million to EdVoice last election cycle. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has contributed at least $2 million to pro-school choice groups and candidates in California since 2013. Most of that money has gone to California Charter Schools Association committees. Pro-charter school groups and their allies spent millions on the 2014 campaign to elect Marshall Tuck, a former Los Angeles schools executive who advocated education reform, to head the state's public schools. Tuck lost to California Teachers Association-backed Tom Torlakson. Pro-school choice groups EdVoice and the California Charter Schools Association Advocates spent more than $3.4 million on the Democrat-on-Democrat race in California's 14th Assembly District in the San Francisco Bay Area to support Tim Grayson and oppose Mae Torlakson. The CTA backed Mae Torlakson, Tom Torlakson's wife, spending nearly $1 million in the race. Grayson won. EdVoice also outspent the California Federation of Teachers backing Bill Dodd over Mariko Yamada in California's 3rd Senate District north of San Francisco. Dodd prevailed in the Democrat-on-Democrat race. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, an advocate for charter schools, has already started to see money from prominent school choice donors pour into his 2018 campaign for governor. Hastings has donated $36,400. Broad, who contributed to three of Villaraigosa's past mayoral campaigns, has contributed $112,400 to the 2018 gubernatorial bid along with his wife, Edythe Broad. They've also contributed $29,200 to Tuck's campaign to run again for public schools chief in 2018. ___ Associated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, N.J. , contributed to this report.

Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it.

Eli Broad, a ... more Photo: Richard Vogel, AP Handful of rich school-choice donors spend big in California 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Much of the funding for California's pro-school choice groups and candidates comes from a handful of very wealthy donors, including the founders of Netflix and The Gap and children of Wal-Mart creator Sam Walton. An Associated Press analysis of top donors to school-choice ballot measure campaigns around the country found 48 individuals and couples provided most of the reported contributions to those initiatives since 2000. Some of those top donors are major backers of pro-school choice candidates in California. In the past, California teachers unions have spent big to defeat high-profile school choice candidates. Last year, several state legislative candidates backed by school choice advocates beat union-backed candidates. Looking ahead to 2018, some of the most active school choice donors are already contributing to pro-charter candidates for governor and state schools chief. The California Teachers Association and its allies defeated a 2000 ballot measure backed by venture capitalist and former state board of education member Timothy Draper to launch a school voucher program in California. Draper contributed $23 million to the effort — the most one person has ever contributed to a single school choice measure. But teachers unions spent even more in opposition. Latest news videos Draper said he became dissatisfied with the public school his kids attended, where he said school boards, teachers unions and textbook makers were looking out for themselves rather than children. He put his kids in private school instead. "I realized that's not fair," Draper said in an interview. "I get to yank them out, and no one else does." Vouchers could allow other schools to break up the traditional public schools' "monopoly," he said. Since 2000, Draper has not been a major player in school-choice politics — partly because of the high cost of his ballot-box failure. Three years ago, Draper put his own money into an unrelated measure to divide California into six separate states. That one didn't make the ballot. Although his vouchers initiative failed, Draper says his efforts helped pave the way for the charters in California. Charter schools are publicly funded but typically run independently of the traditional public school system. Studies on how effective they are compared with traditional public schools have found mixed results. Since the failed ballot measure campaign, other wealthy California families and individuals have spent millions to support groups that contribute to pro-school choice candidates in state races. Netflix founder Reed Hastings has donated more than $5.8 million to a California Charter Schools Association political committee during the past two election cycles. Donald and Doris Fisher, the founders of clothing retailer The Gap, have donated more than $6 million to groups like California Charter Schools Association Advocates and EdVoice, an advocacy group that supports charter schools. Donald Fisher died in 2009. Eli Broad, founder of SunAmerica and KB Home, also has donated millions to those groups. Hastings, Broad and Doris Fisher all live in California. Jim Carr Walton and Alice Walton, children of the Wal-Mart founder, have contributed millions to California organizations that advocate for school choice. The siblings, who are based in Arkansas and Texas, respectively, each gave $1.4 million to EdVoice last election cycle. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has contributed at least $2 million to pro-school choice groups and candidates in California since 2013. Most of that money has gone to California Charter Schools Association committees. Pro-charter school groups and their allies spent millions on the 2014 campaign to elect Marshall Tuck, a former Los Angeles schools executive who advocated education reform, to head the state's public schools. Tuck lost to California Teachers Association-backed Tom Torlakson. Pro-school choice groups EdVoice and the California Charter Schools Association Advocates spent more than $3.4 million on the Democrat-on-Democrat race in California's 14th Assembly District in the San Francisco Bay Area to support Tim Grayson and oppose Mae Torlakson. The CTA backed Mae Torlakson, Tom Torlakson's wife, spending nearly $1 million in the race. Grayson won. EdVoice also outspent the California Federation of Teachers backing Bill Dodd over Mariko Yamada in California's 3rd Senate District north of San Francisco. Dodd prevailed in the Democrat-on-Democrat race. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, an advocate for charter schools, has already started to see money from prominent school choice donors pour into his 2018 campaign for governor. Hastings has donated $36,400. Broad, who contributed to three of Villaraigosa's past mayoral campaigns, has contributed $112,400 to the 2018 gubernatorial bid along with his wife, Edythe Broad. They've also contributed $29,200 to Tuck's campaign to run again for public schools chief in 2018. ___ Associated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, N.J. , contributed to this report.

Police arrested Denise Shala Joy Farmer after she checked into the Beachcomber Motel and had numerous televisions and laptop computers in their original packaging. She was arrested without incident, and was found to have multiple outstanding arrest warrants from four Oregon counties, said Gold Beach Sgt. Tracy Wood. Found in the hotel room were big-screen televisions, laptops, printers and other electronics valued at more than $2,000 and purchased from a Walmart in Newport. They also found several bank cards, checks, checkbooks and other personal items, most of them belonging to Coos Bay area citizens. Some documents recovered might be linked to a residential burglary reported in March in Coos County, and a forged check was allegedly used to purchase items at a store in Gold Beach. Charges she might face include first-degree theft by receiving, identity theft, first-degree forgery and unlawful possession of methamphetamine. Other charges are pending for cases in Coos, Lane and Lincoln counties. 17228537 View next article in Local News print version The Curry Coastal Pilot This image is copyrighted.

"But on a case by case basis, there's still plenty to cheer about with individual stocks," the "Mad Money" host said. "Anything related to social, mobile, cloud, artificial intelligence, continues to get a boost. But anything related to physical bricks-and-mortar merchandising remains hopelessly disliked, with the once-stellar Nordstrom taking the group down again today." E-commerce and the cloud reign supreme, but with Deutsche Bank's downgrade of General Electric to a "sell" rating, it looks to Cramer like enterprise and individual spending is slowing. With these diverging forces in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar next week: Monday: Trivago The hotel booking company will report its first quarter earnings. After sitting down with the CEO of its parent company, Expedia, Cramer felt good about Trivago's impending report. But after competitor Priceline's management team gave downbeat guidance in their earnings report, the "Mad Money" host became less certain about the strength of the travel arena. "Which is right? Expedia or Priceline? Rivals. Why don't we let Trivago decide, and if it's good, I suggest you go right back to the stock of Priceline at this discount, because it has been a monster long term winner over the years," Cramer said. Tuesday: Home Depot, Stanley Black & Decker, TJX Companies Home Depot: The home improvement giant kicks off the week's retail earnings with what Cramer expects to be a strong report. "I always encourage people to buy this stock, but not all at once because you know what? Home Depot, up here, [has] become quite volatile. So maybe you pick up some Monday and then some after they report," he advised. Stanley Black & Decker: An analyst meeting at this industrial tools manufacturer could prompt the stock to take off thanks to a recent wave of positive acquisitions and Home Depot's presumably strong tools sales, Cramer said. TJX: Off-priced goods have been the savior of this Cramer-fave retail company and parent of discount chains TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. "I've been waiting for the huge breakout that TJX will give us with all of these brick-and-mortar stores that are being closed, because they've got to offload their goods and they give them to TJX for cash, so they'll be able to sell name-brand stuff for even cheaper than you can get it on Amazon," Cramer said. "It has not happened yet. TJX's stock has been so-so. That said, I'm betting on a strong second half of the year and think you need to get in ahead of it." Wednesday: Target, Cisco, Rexnord Target: Even though some on Wall Street are predicting a turnaround for Target and blessing the stock because of its seemingly safe 4.3 percent yield, Cramer is not so convinced. "All I can say is that big dividends sure didn't do much good for the people who own shares of Kohl's or Macy's. So as tempting as Target might be, I am not going to sanction a buy of it," he said. Cisco: The software giant reports after the close, and while competition in the cybersecurity space has driven a lot of investors away from the stock, Cramer is sticking to his guns. "My charitable trust has owned Cisco for ages and we're going to ride it out given that CEO Chuck Robbins has been remaking this company as a soup to nuts offering for any enterprise that's trying to embrace the internet of things in a secure way," the "Mad Money" host said. Rexnord: President Donald Trump has been targeting this manufacturing company on Twitter for moving jobs to Mexico, and Cramer wants to see if it will respond at all in its earnings report. Thursday: Wal-Mart, Alibaba, Applied Materials, Salesforce.com Wal-Mart: Of all the companies vying to compete with Amazon, Cramer thinks Wal-Mart may actually have a chance. The company will report before the opening bell and explain to shareholders how its brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce subsidiary Jet.com are boosting business and giving Amazon a run for its money. "I think it's too early to tell, of course, if they'll win, but the stock, after languishing for ages, has become a big winner, up almost 10 percent for the year. Wal-Mart, in the end, is a bargain store, and what really matters is that bargain stores are working in this environment," Cramer said. Alibaba: This e-commerce giant will report earnings, and it is the only Chinese stock Cramer recommends for the simple reason that business is booming. "They have a very good handle on e-commerce, perhaps second only to Amazon, and, of course, their home market in the People's Republic is incredibly strong," the "Mad Money" host said. Applied Materials: In the golden age of semiconductors, a company that makes machines that make the chips should be strong as ever, so Cramer expects a good earnings report. Salesforce.com: Yet another tech name benefiting from the rise of the cloud, Cramer expects excellent numbers from Salesforce's earnings report. "Remember, the stock does act weirdly, though, even on good quarters, so don't attempt to trade it. Just own it," Cramer advised. Friday: Deere & Company, Foot Locker, Honeywell Deere: For ages, anything the agriculture machinery company reported meant very little to the market, even if management insisted things were looking up. "Then one day, investor interest simply switched, and now whatever Deere says is greeted with adulation and any caveats are totally ignored. It's remarkable," Cramer said. "I suspect the stock goes higher again unless they tell us that they're shutting the company down. I mean, that's how much this story is loved." Foot Locker: Cramer says that this is one of two stores that is bucking negativity around mall-based retail. After Kohl's management said business from Under Armour and Nike was good and Adidas reported a strong quarter, Cramer expects positive things from Foot Locker's report. Honeywell: Friday's analyst meeting at this multinational will be the first one run by new President and CEO Darius Adamczyk. After hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb's activist fund suggested the company split, Cramer is curious to hear Adamczyk's thoughts on the matter. Cramer's bottom line? "I think that when earnings are finished, maybe Wall Street will start focusing on the White House again, if they can focus themselves. Right now, though, the only thing this market cares about is the numbers," Cramer said. "If the numbers are good, stocks go up regardless of the Comey fracas or the state of the Russia probe. And if they're bad, they get taken to the woodshed, or even go straight into the chipper-shredder."

Strongsville, Wadsworth, Chardon, Elyria, and Avon are the only locations in the Cleveland area that offer the free service. Strongsville’s Store Manager Robert Christmas said by next spring all Cleveland area locations will have it.   “First day, we had 17 customers use the service and (Friday) we had another 15 customers use the service -- so starting off slow but steady,” said Christmas. To use the service customers have to go to walmart.com/grocery and then order the items they want. When the order is ready the store calls the customer, and then brings it to their car. Busy mom Siovhon Kurtz said the pick-up service makes it easier for her to go shopping with her young son. “I was able to shop from my couch last night,” said Kurtz. Christmas said that home delivery is something that the company is exploring for the future. Download the Cleveland 19 News app and First Alert Weather app. Copyright 2017 WOIO. All rights reserved.

It happened three times, in fact. Once from checking, twice from savings. My bank is Best Rewards Credit Union in Brook Park. I've been a customer there for 20 years. The ATM withdrawals occurred in Florida, minutes after I used the card up here in Northeast Ohio.The bank caught it and we got it straightened out and my money was refunded. Then a couple weeks later, I got a notice from my identity theft monitoring service that a new credit card account had been opened in my name, with a WalMart credit card through Synchrony Bank.  Then another hard inquiry appeared on my credit report, again through Synchrony Bank. As it turned out, the first credit card that had been issued was sent to an address in Florida, but it hadn't yet been activated. The second card hadn't been issued because Synchrony Bank caught it before the account was opened. What should I do? A.B., Brook Park A: You should go into full-blown, five-alarm fire mode. Clearly, someone has way too much personal information about you -- your name, address, Social Security number, debit card number and, perhaps most troubling, your ATM PIN. Plus, this person has criminal intent. The person has already committed crimes against, including theft, bank fraud and mail fraud. What's weird here is that this person has more than one source of information about you. Your Social Security number isn't contained in your debit card. Your PIN shouldn't be any place except in your brain. So either this is an inside job or, more like, occurred because of a skimmer when you used your debit card and PIN someplace. But that still doesn't explain how they got your address and Social Security number. It's also disconcerting to me personally because parts of your tale are eerily similar to what happened to a close relative of mine a couple of months ago. My relative didn't encounter the debit card fraud. But like you, a credit card was opened in his name through a bank in Nevada and sent to an address in Florida. And even though it took 10 days after the card was mailed for this fraud to come to our attention (thanks to his identity theft monitoring), the thieves hadn't yet used the card. In fact, the card hadn't yet been activated. Also like you, the same thieves (using the same Florida address) tried to open another credit card, this time through Pentagon Federal Credit Union. The application was denied because my relative wasn't a member of the credit union. Very bizarre. This all makes me think these are bread crumbs pointing to a new scam, a new identity theft ring, out there. So here's what you need to do (these are the same things we did for my relative). In order: TODAY: 1. Immediately put fraud alerts on your credit files through all three credit bureaus. You can do this by phone or online. You need to contact only one of the bureaus; the first one must contact the other two. A 90-day fraud alert is free. Experian.com/fraudalert 1-888-397-3742 TransUnion.com/fraud 1-800-680-7289 Equifax.com/CreditReportAssistance 1-888-766-0008 2. Contact all of your existing banks, credit cards, investment firms, etc., and alert them that you've got some big time identity theft going on and want to add extra security to your accounts, extra passwords, etc. You want it to be flagged if anyone tries to change your mailing address, request a new card, etc. 3. Change your passwords on any accounts that you access online. 4. Change your PINs on any ATM cards. ASAP IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS: 5. Fill out an identity theft affidavit online through the Federal Trade Commission. https://www.identitytheft.gov If you don't have a computer, go to the library for this. It's worth it. I was super impressed with this process because after you fill out the form with the names of the banks involved, their addresses, it spits out pre-written form letters for you to mail to each bank and each credit bureau. This was a fantastic help for me and my relative. Even though I know what to say, it was just a huge time-saver during a stressful time. 6. Make copies of the FTC affidavit. 7. Mail the letters to each bank involved, with a copy of the FTC affidavit. 8. Make a police report. Tell the police department you need it for the the banks and credit bureaus. Yes, you realize that it's unlikely they will be able to investigate your case. That's OK. You're still entitled to have a police report filed. NOW AND FOREVER 9. Watch out for anything odd in the mail -- a letter about an account you didn't apply for, a letter from a company thanking you for your recent phone call if you didn't call them. 10. Keep an extra close eye on all of your bank and credit card accounts. For the next couple of months, I'd check them online every day. Then you can ratchet back to every few days. NEXT WEEK 11. It may take a week or so for a copy of the police report to be available for you to pick up. Make copies of the police report. 12. Mail letters to each of the three credit bureaus requesting a credit freeze. The FTC site will give you choices to generate letters for extended fraud alerts or credit freezes. I don't think freezes are the right thing for everyone, but they definitely are for you. Because you are a victim of identity theft, you should be exempt from the normal $5 charge per bureau. You should include a copy of the FTC affidavit and police report with each letter. https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html https://www.freeze.equifax.com/Freeze/jsp/SFF_PersonalIDInfo.jsp 13. When you get your credit reports, go over them carefully for any discrepancies, especially accounts or inquiries you don't recognize, or balances that aren't correct. Dispute any inaccurate or questionable information per the instructions provided. 14. When you get the responses from the credit bureaus about your credit freezes, make sure to file the passwords away in a safe place. You will have an incredibly difficult time getting those files unlocked if you ever need to get another credit card or shop for insurance.

Itâ€™s a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates arenâ€™t serious about delivering high-quality education,â€ he said. â€œTheyâ€™re simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this.â€ (AP Photo/Ted S.

The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) J. Scott Applewhite Share Tweet Share Email Comments For two decades, a loose-knit group that includes some of the country’s wealthiest people has underwritten the political push for school choice, promoting ballot initiatives and candidates who favor competition for traditional public schools. But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers’ unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump’s administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. “As much as we are aligned on change, we aren’t always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight,” said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states, including Wisconsin, plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That’s up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. Biggest donors Wal-Mart’s Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft’s Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family’s massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because “the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high,” said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and CEO, who called the voucher proposals “a dramatic effort to undermine public education.” Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures’ opponents. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation’s two largest teachers’ unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. Heart of debate For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. “Most Americans have that already,” Oberndorf said in an interview. “They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It’s really only poor people who don’t have choices.” Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers “a stupid idea.” Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. “No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It’s a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren’t serious about delivering high-quality education,” he said. “They’re simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this.” DeVos factor The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were home-schooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her “unprepared and unqualified.” DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an “A-plus.” Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. “Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be ... is going to be good for education,” Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos’s American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks. “who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level.” The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. It’s unclear how much support or opposition such a plan will generate, in part because most people don’t know much about the topic. A poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and released this week found that 58 percent of respondents said they knew little or nothing at all about charter schools and two-thirds reported the same about private school voucher programs. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose home-schooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. “I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?” DeVos said.

Even as fierce political battles rage in Washington over school choice, most Americans know little about charter schools or private school voucher programs. Still, more Americans feel positively than negatively about expanding those programs, according to a new poll released Friday, May 12, 2017. (Photo: Evan Vucci / AP file photo) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE For two decades, a loose-knit group that includes some of the country’s wealthiest people has underwritten the political push for school choice, promoting ballot initiatives and candidates who favor competition for traditional public schools. But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers’ unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump’s administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. Betsy DeVos has long history of financing politics “As much as we are aligned on change, we aren’t always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight,” said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That’s up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. The Biggest Donors In this Sept. 16, 2015 file photo, Eli Broad and his wife, Edythe, stand for a photo amid Jeff Koons sculptures at his new museum called "The Broad" in downtown Los Angeles. Eli Broad, a charter school advocate has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charter schools.  (Photo: Richard Vogel / AP) Wal-Mart’s Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by the Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft’s Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family’s massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. Microsoft’s Bill Gates speaks to Liz Claman of the Fox Business Network in this Monday, May 8, 2017 file photo. Gates avoids political contributions.

Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because “the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high,” said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals “a dramatic effort to undermine public education.” Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures’ opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation’s two largest teachers’ unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. The Heart Of The Debate For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. “Most Americans have that already,” Oberndorf said in an interview. “They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It’s really only poor people who don’t have choices.” In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. “There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families,” said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. “School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options — including schools within traditional school systems — offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life.” Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers “a stupid idea.” Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. “No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It’s a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren’t serious about delivering high-quality education,” he said. “They’re simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this.” Devos Deepens Divide The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her “unprepared and unqualified.” With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, “much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America’s children could be undone,” wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate.

Political Contributions The Associated Press examined political contributions over a 10-year period by the people who have been major contributors to advance school choice measures such as public charter schools and programs to use taxpayer funding to pay for private school tuition. Some key findings: — Forty-eight individuals or married couples donated at least $100,000 from 2000 to 2016 to support statewide ballot measures advocating for the creation or expansion of charter schools or taxpayer-funded scholarships that can be used for K-12 private school tuition. — Those contributors account for more than three-fifths of funding to support the ballot measures since 2000. — The support from those contributors totaled nearly $64 million, nearly equal to the amount all opponents of the measures reported spending. — Despite the proponents’ spending, voters rejected seven of nine statewide school-choice ballot measures. — The contributors also are major givers to officeholders, candidates and political causes. They donated a total of nearly $225 million from 2007 through last year. The biggest portion of their contributions went to candidates, party and general ideological political action committees. Some of the candidates they supported are known for their support of school-choice measures. — Their spending was roughly even over that period on school choice causes, other education measures that were not specifically advocating for school choice, and causes that are not linked directly to education. — Teachers unions, which represent 4.5 million employees, reported giving about 2½ times as much to political campaigns and committees as the 48 individuals and couples gave over the 10-year period. — The wealthy school choice advocates also put millions into nonprofit groups that advocate for, study and fund school-choice measures. — The school choice advocates generally support public charter schools, which are run by different rules than traditional schools and often fall outside the oversight of local school districts. But their views diverge on the role of vouchers, which use taxpayer money to pay tuition at private schools. Still, the dividing lines are not always neat: Some contributors who say they oppose vouchers have given money to groups that support them. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Photo / Facebook A teen mum who was forced to steal groceries to feed her family has been stunned by the generosity of the officer who she faced in court. Sheena Davenport, from Alabama, says her and her boyfriend stole groceries to feed her young daughter after falling on hard times. The pair were arrested when they were caught with hot food they'd taken from Walmart. But during her court appearance heartbreak soon turned to delight. The empathetic officer, Katrina Culbreath, asked Davenport why she stole food from the store. "I told her it was for my daughter. She told me to meet her outside after court was done," Davenport told InsideEdition.com. Davenport said officer Culbreath told her to get into her car and follow the patrol car down the road. "We ended up at the grocery store. I started crying. I realised she was going to buy food for me and my family," she said. "She told me to 'grab a buggy and let's go shopping'. Officer Katrina spent $189 on food for [my family]." The mother added: "After I told her she didn't have to do it, she started telling me her struggle and how she made it through. Continued below.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Don’t have a solid state drive? These five… Don’t have a solid state drive? These five SSDs will help you get with the times, on any budget By Tyler Lacoma — Updated May 13, 2017 12:01 pm Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Are you looking for a massive upgrade to your computer storage? We probably don’t have to tell you about the lightning-fast speeds that solid state drives provide: The best SSD options are now bigger, more affordable, and more compatible than ever, which makes this a good time to buy. If you’re looking for a storage option that also comes with a significant speed boost, we have the top options in several different price ranges for you to consider. Note on hard drive capacity: Some companies quote capacity after overhead, and others before. This leads to uneven rounding practices, and explains why you see some drives at 256GB and some at 250GB. Even then, it’s rare for a drive to have exactly its stated capacity, though variance is generally less than 10GB. Under $150: Samsung 850 EVO 250GB ($108) This 2.5-inch SSD gets a lot of attention as a broadly excellent upgrade choice for a variety of needs. Samsung has plenty of experience creating solid state drives, and the 850 EVO is one of the best SSD products yet, combining both simplicity and quality performance. The interface for this drive is SATA 6Gb/s, with a sequential read speed of 540 megabytes per second and a write speed of 520 MB/s. Reviews have shown it to be one of the quickest SATA drives available. Like most of the SSDs on our list, the Evo comes in several different size options ranging from 120GB to 2TB of storage, with costs varying accordingly. We picked the 250GB version for a couple reasons. It’s a good size for an all-purpose SSD designed for the general user, and it provides a widely-shared base storage number to help you compare it with other models. While MSRP says the drives cost $100 and $150, don’t worry — this model is frequently available just under $100, making it the best option for an SSD under $100. Buy it now from: Amazon Best Buy Walmart Under $200: Samsung 850 Pro 256GB ($150) Get used to the Samsung models, because they keep getting top marks in multiple price ranges. The 850 Pro gets praise as an ideal upgrade for a performance-focused computer made for games or entertainment. It utilizes Samsung’s 3D V-NAND memory — it’s the first in Samsung’s library of SSDs to use it — interfaces via SATA III, and has a sequential read speed up to 550 MB/s and a write speed up to 520 MB/s. Except for a few data format differences, you may think this model isn’t much different from the Evo we just talked about. But those data differences add up to a generally faster, slightly more capacious model that’s a better fit for high-end computers – and very attractive in light of falling prices that help make the Pro and Evo more direct competitors. The 850 Pro comes with options ranging from 128GB to 2TB. Again, the 256GB model, which can be found between $150 and $160, stood out as a well-rounded option. Buy it now from: Amazon Best Buy Walmart Under $300: Western Digital Blue 1TB SSD ($280) This is another great SSD model that gets frequent recommendations for upgraders and has our full support. Note that we picked the 1TB for more robust storage options, but there are three different sizes available depending on your needs. It’s available in SATA or M.2 configurations, and two smaller sizes — 256GB and 512GB. The Western Digital Blue 1TB SATA version offers sequential read speeds up to 488 MB/s and write speeds up to 520 MB/s. It’s not exactly the fastest drive on the market, but it’s quick enough to keep up with most users, especially for such a killer price. Read our full review Buy it now from: Amazon Under $400: Samsung 950 Pro 512GB ($324) If you need more space than a few hundred GBs and are interested in a high-quality, forward-looking SSD, we highly recommend the 950 Pro 512GB from Samsung. Some of the specs are indeed similar to the 850 Pro model, including 3D V-NAND, but the differences are stark. The 950 gets sequential read speeds up to 2,500 megabytes per second and write speeds up to 1,500 MB/s, making it one of the best SSD options in terms of speed. Samsung also claims that it is 1.5 times more power efficient than the 850 model. Why such a big difference between the two models? This is the first M.2 PCI Express-only model on our list. Replacing SATA with this newer interface allows for a bundle of new tricks, including better performance for certain types of data and greater compatibility with cutting edge protocols designed to increase efficiency. Of course, you should make sure that your computer can handle M.2 PCI Express attachments before jumping on the 950. Support will be dependent on your motherboard. Buy it now from: Amazon B&H Adorama Any Price: Intel 750 Series 1.2TB ($900) While we mentioned PCI Express, we haven’t yet talked about NVMe, or Non-Volatile Memory Express. It’s a very similar connection standard that uses the same physical interface, but also adds additional features specifically for storage purposes. The Intel 750 SSD shows off the advantages of this approach with its flexible installation options and high speeds. This is obviously going to make the drive extra fast — in ideal scenarios, it can exceed transfer speeds of two gigabytes per second — but the high-end SSD has other advantages, too. One of the most interesting is the choice between add-in card and 2.5-inch form factors, which allow you to pick a design that fits your upgrade plans and current drive standards. The lightning speeds and compatibility of the card put it on the top of our list, but you’ll have to pay at least $1,000 for the 1TB model. Just make sure you really want it!

The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) For two decades, a loose-knit group that includes some of the country’s wealthiest people has underwritten the political push for school choice, promoting ballot initiatives and candidates who favor competition for traditional public schools. But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and lead some school choice advocates to join with teachers unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump’s administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. “As much as we are aligned on change, we aren’t always aligned on how much change or how,” said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been split into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school choice movement. School choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus the District of Columbia have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That’s up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. The biggest donors Wal-Mart’s Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft’s Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family’s massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because “the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high,” said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals “a dramatic effort to undermine public education.” Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group would fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures’ opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation’s two largest teachers unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. Heart of the debate For the past decade, school choice supporters have split over the merits of private school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their children. “Most Americans have that already,” Oberndorf said in an interview. “They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It’s really only poor people who don’t have choices.” In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. “There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families,” said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. “School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options — including schools within traditional school systems — offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life.” Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers “a stupid idea.” Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. “No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It’s a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren’t serious about delivering high-quality education,” he said. “They’re simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this.” DeVos deepens divide The schism between wealthy funders over private school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were home schooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her “unprepared and unqualified.” With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, “much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America’s children could be undone,” wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an “A-plus.” Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. “Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be ... is going to be good for education,” Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos’ American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks “who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level.” The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. Trump’s budget calls for eventually increasing annual school choice funding by $20 billion. It’s unclear how much support or opposition such a plan would generate, in part because most people don’t know much about the topic. A poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and released this week found that 58 percent of respondents said they knew little or nothing at all about charter schools and two-thirds reported the same about private school voucher programs. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. “I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?” said DeVos. 3 O'clock Stir e-newsletter 3 O'clock Stir from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Shake off your afternoon slump with the offbeat or overlooked news of the day.

When traveling through highway work zones, use caution and be alert to changes in traffic patterns and slow-moving or stopped traffic.   To help motorists take the guesswork out of travel plans, call VDOT’s 511 or visit http://www.511Virginia.org/ for real-time traffic information.   Underlined entries with asterisks (***) indicate the listing is new or the status of the project has changed since last week’s traffic alert.     INTERSTATE PROJECTS ***Interstate 81 – Exit 14:  Work is underway to reconstruct Interstate 81 exit 14 to better accommodate traffic volumes and to replace the north and southbound interstate 81 bridges at exit 14. During the week of May 8, be alert to flagging and heavy equipment along Old Jonesboro Road and Dennison due to bridge and grading work.  (Completion: fall 2018) ***I-81 bridges over Halls Bottom Road: Replacement of the Interstate 81 bridges over Halls Bottom Road near exit 10 in Washington County is underway. The week of May 8, be aware of grading and drainage work in the median, and to haul truck traffic entering and exiting the median. I-81 travel lanes may be narrowed through the work zone. Due to safety concerns, Route 808 (Halls Bottom Road) is closed underneath the interstate bridges. Only emergency-response vehicles will have access; all other vehicle traffic will be required to detour. (Completion: Fall 2018) ***Interstate 77 Big Walker Mountain Tunnel: Due to tunnel maintenance at I-77 Big Walker Mountain Tunnel, anticipate southbound right lane closures from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. nightly Sunday through Thursday nights.   Interstate 81 Exit 17 bridge repairs: Motorists should anticipate periodic nighttime lane closures on I-81 at exit 17 northbound and southbound due to bridge repairs. Because much of the access for the repairs will be from underneath the bridge, flaggers will be used while working underneath the bridge to ensure pedestrian safety along the Creeper Trail.  (Completion: June 2017)   Interstate 81 bridge repairs at mile marker 45 over Matson Drive: Due to repairs to the Interstate 81 bridges over Matson Drive and their proximity to the southbound exit 45 on-ramp, the southbound on-ramp is closed. Traffic should use the I-81 on ramps at exits 44 and 47. Motorists should also be alert to the possibility of lane closures north and southbound on Interstate 81 near exit 45 in Marion due to repairs to the bridges over Matson Drive.  (Completion: May 2017)   ***Interstate 77 – maintenance activities: Be alert to lane closures on I-77 this week due to the following maintenance activities: Slope repairs and bridge deck sweeping at various locations in Wythe and Bland counties Mowing between the Wythe County line and the I-77/I-81 overlap in Wythe County.   ***Interstate 81 – maintenance activities: Be alert to lane closures due to the following maintenance activities on I-81: Bland County Route 601 bridge replacement: Due to replacement of the Route 601 bridge over Little Walker Creek in Bland County, be alert to workers in the work zone as well as traffic shifts.

If city council approves the proposed transit operations and maintenance facility at 18th Avenue and Foothills, it will be the latest addition to that list. Downtown revitalization has never happened, despite numerous studies and plans drafted over the last 50 years, because the city councils of the day took the easy way out. The university, the arena, the playhouse, Costco, Superstore and Wal-Mart were all projects that could have been forced downtown to rejuvenate the city centre. The university had endowment lands set aside but Prince George continues to pay both the financial and social costs of putting UNBC up on Cranbrook hill. Financially, University Way was a headache to build and is costly to maintain, as are all of city services to that out-of-the-way location. Geographically, the university is a part of the city and apart from the city, meaning that its staff and students are far less connected to local residents and vice versa. The numerous downtown or near downtown universities across Canada are much more integrated into their cities. Same goes for the arena. The Multiplex was built on the Exhibition Grounds to allow for parking. Strangely, other cities, from Kelowna on up to Vancouver and Toronto, build their arenas downtown, making them a central part of city life. Imagine the buzz of energy and activity in downtown if either or both of those facilities had been built downtown or nearby. Imagine if the city had had the nerve to tell major retail and commercial developers that downtown was the only option for them. Downtown would still have its share of problems but the situation would be vastly better than what is there now. But the city lacked the courage and the vision. An art gallery, a courthouse, a police detachment and now a hotel have helped but much more is needed. The $23 million transit facility would help, if it was located along First Avenue or in the light industrial area east of Queensway. It would be a good fit from both a land-use perspective, as well as being centrally located. The local residents who left Thursday night's forum are right to be frustrated by an internal planning process that considered no other location and is offering nothing but a take-it-or-leave-it option. That's a disservice, not just to area residents but also to city council. Mayor Lyn Hall and the eight city councillors are the ones that ultimately have to decide the fate of this proposal. Decision makers, whether in business, politics or doing the family grocery shopping, prefer choices, rather than something or nothing. More importantly, the mayor and the councillors are the ones that have to bear the outcome of their decision with voters. The least senior administration and the planning department could have done is offered alternatives to their political masters. Worst of all, there was no answer give to the public Thursday night, either from B.C. Transit manager Levi Timmermans or Ian Wells, the city's planning and development manager, about what happens if city council, after hearing from the public, votes against the facility. Will the city's buses turn into pumpkins at midnight? Will the city's transit system grind to a halt? Will the current facility in the BCR abruptly fall off the face of the Earth? "We will not be discussing any other sites," Wells told the audience, which it seems included the current location that will somehow, some way, have to remain the current location if city council says so. There were no answers Thursday but there had better be answers in June, when this proposal goes to a public hearing before city council. Without further explanation and justification, residents are right to be angry and the mayor and council would be right to give this proposal the thumbs down. -- Managing editor Neil Godbout © Copyright 2017 Prince George Citizen 'Please support the Prince George Citizen and online news like this by purchasing a digital subscription.'

President Trump looks at Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as he speaks during a February meeting with parents and teachers in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. ASSOCIATED PRESS Eli Broad and his wife, Edythe, stand for a photo amid Jeff Koons sculptures at his new museum called "The Broad" in downtown Los Angeles. Eli Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators calling for them to reject education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos. ASSOCIATED PRESS Venture capitalist Nick Hanauer stands by the window of his office in downtown Seattle. ASSOCIATED PRESS Christian Carter leads a group of fellow Pittsburgh high school students during a protest on the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print For two decades, a loose-knit group that includes some of the country’s wealthiest people has underwritten the political push for school choice, promoting ballot initiatives and candidates who favor competition for traditional public schools. But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers’ unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump’s administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. “As much as we are aligned on change, we aren’t always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight,” said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That’s up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. THE BIGGEST DONORS Wal-Mart’s Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft’s Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family’s massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because “the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high,” said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals “a dramatic effort to undermine public education.” Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures’ opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation’s two largest teachers’ unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. THE HEART OF THE DEBATE For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. “Most Americans have that already,” Oberndorf said in an interview. “They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It’s really only poor people who don’t have choices.” In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. “There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families,” said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. “School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options — including schools within traditional school systems — offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life.” Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers “a stupid idea.” Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. “No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It’s a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren’t serious about delivering high-quality education,” he said. “They’re simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this.” DeVOS DEEPENS DIVIDE The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her “unprepared and unqualified.” With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, “much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America’s children could be undone,” wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an “A-plus.” Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. “Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be ... is going to be good for education,” Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos’s American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks “who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level.” The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. It’s unclear how much support or opposition such a plan will generate, in part because most people don’t know much about the topic. A poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and released this week found that 58 percent of respondents said they knew little or nothing at all about charter schools and two-thirds reported the same about private school voucher programs. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. “I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?” said DeVos.

But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers' unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump's administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. "As much as we are aligned on change, we aren't always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight," said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That's up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. The biggest donors Wal-Mart's Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft's Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family's massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because "the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high," said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals "a dramatic effort to undermine public education." Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures' opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation's two largest teachers' unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. The heart of the debate  For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. "Most Americans have that already," Oberndorf said in an interview. "They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It's really only poor people who don't have choices." Some of the wealthy school-choice funders are not swayed and object to being grouped together with supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers "a stupid idea." Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. "No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It's a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren't serious about delivering high-quality education," he said. "They're simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this." DeVos deepens divide The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her "unprepared and unqualified." With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, "much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America's children could be undone," wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah bond measure to allow charters, said DeVos was an "A-plus." Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouches to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. "Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be ... is going to be good for education," Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos's American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks "who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level." The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. "I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?" said DeVos. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Davenport said she had her infant daughter Skylar in mind.  Read: Cop Buys Shoes for Clerk Who Helped Him In Pouring Rain Wearing Taped-Up Sneakers “We were struggling. This is our first time ever being out on our own, me and my boyfriend. His job wasn’t making enough at the time,” Davenport told InsideEdition.com. “It was dinner time and we had gone to Walmart to see what we could get. It ended up not being enough and we needed dinner for the next two nights.” But, on their way out, the couple was caught with the hot food they'd taken and were both arrested.  “I had never been in trouble before. I had never done anything like that. I was scared,” Davenport said.  Last Monday, Davenport went to plead guilty to theft in the fourth degree, but what she wasn’t expecting was a kind-hearted police officer to change the day around.   Officer Katrina Culbreath, of the Dothan Police Department, was in the court room during the hearing and asked Davenport why she'd resorted to stealing. “I told her it was for my daughter. She told me to meet her outside after court was done,” Davenport said. “She told me to get into my car and follow her patrol car. We ended up at the grocery store. I started crying. I realized she was going to buy food for me and my family.” Davenport said Culbreath paid for $130 worth of groceries for her family.  “I felt so grateful that she was sent to help me. I started crying. I felt someone was looking out for me and my little family. I kept hugging her,” Davenport said.  Read: Kind Cop Buys Food for Famished Homeless Woman, Helps Get Her Motel Room During Storm Since Culbreath's the selfless gesture, Davenport said the two have kept in touch daily.  “There’s still good people out in the world and officers are still here to protect and serve.

Done Editing Tags 33 Comments Share this article 84 84 84 Betsy DeVos Billionaires keep trying to buy seats on the Los Angeles school board to promote privatized charter schools in the city just as Betsy DeVos wants to do nationwide. The outside money is pouring in to the races for two critical seats on the board: Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings has given $5 million, two Walmart heirs have given six figures apiece, Gap co-founder Doris Fisher has given more than $1 million, reliable corporate education policy funder Eli Broad has put in six figures. Interestingly enough, some of these same names popped up as big donors back in 2012 opposing a statewide proposition to fund public education. But sure, they’re giving big money to school board races now out of a sincere concern for the kids. The targets of all this money are Steve Zimmer, the current school board president, and Imelda Padilla, who is running for an open seat. Zimmer and Padilla are not only backed by the teachers union but have been endorsed by Bernie Sanders and Our Revolution. The stakes are high: Los Angeles already has a lot of charter schools but the big-money charter backers are looking for unrestrained expansion, to the detriment of public schools. California already spends big money on charter schools it doesn’t need and that don’t improve the quality of education. The millions of dollars being poured into defeating Steve Zimmer and Imelda Padilla are intended to make that worse.  33 Comments Share this article 84 84 84 33 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

For 16 years, he helped Amazon set the bar in retail for getting packages to customers at warp speed. Now he’s doing the same at Target Corp., helping it play catch-up as it modernizes its systems built around stores to adapt to the faster-paced online shopping world. A year into his role as Target’s chief supply chain and logistics officer, Valdez is overseeing a major overhaul of Target’s network of 40 warehouses, 10,000 trailer trucks and related inventory management systems. The goal is speed, efficiency and accuracy. The effort is a key part of Target’s strategic road map as it looks to reverse sliding sales and pinched profit margins. If he can get it right, it could mean not only reducing costs for Target but also getting online orders into customers’ hands within hours, ensuring customers don’t encounter empty shelves as often and stepping on the gas in opening smaller stores in dense urban centers where backroom space is much more limited. In his first sit-down interview since arriving at the Minneapolis-based retailer, Valdez likened the traditional supply chain for brick-and-mortar retailers to a slow-moving elephant, which transports large amounts of products at one time. His task, he said, is to help transform Target into a gazelle that can more swiftly move smaller shipments, down to individual items, to where they are needed. “Speed matters,” he said. “We’ve got to be faster than the elephant. … Where I spend my time today is helping problem-solve how to become the gazelle.” Arthur Valdez Title: Chief supply chain and logistics officer at Target Age: 47 Previous employers: Amazon, Staples, Blockbuster, Wal-Mart Education: Bachelor’s degree from Colorado State University Quote: “It’s about being there when you need it to be there. Today, we’re not reacting fast enough. We need to do it better.” Some of the fruits of his labor are already beginning to show with a series of tests that Target plans to quickly scale if successful. The retailer is soon launching a pilot program for next-day delivery of household essentials called Target Restock in the Twin Cities. Next month, it will test a same-day delivery service for in-store purchases from its recently opened Manhattan store in Tribeca. And this fall, Target will try out its own curbside pickup service for online orders when it opens its next-generation prototype store outside of Houston. To be sure, Target is chasing some of its competitors in rolling out these innovations. Amazon has pushed the envelope with deliveries within one to two hours through its Prime Now service. And Wal-Mart has been aggressively expanding its curbside grocery pickup service, which will be up and running at more than 1,110 locations later this year. By moving products more quickly through Target’s network, Valdez is also hoping to address one of the other nagging issues for Target and the subject of frequent customer complaints: out-of-stock items. “It’s about being there when you need it to be there,” he said. “Today, we’re not reacting fast enough. We need to do it better.” He added that Target has already seen some measurable improvements in reducing out-of-stocks and better shelf availability in tests where it has been moving to a faster, real-time replenishment model. To aid his efforts, Target will open next month a 718,000-square-foot warehouse in Perth Amboy, N.J., just across the river from New York City where the retailer is opening several urban stores in the coming years. It will serve as a lab for Valdez’s team to try out the latest in automation and robotics as they further test out replenishing stores with single items. “It’s almost like having a little Lego set, and that Lego set is helping us put things together,” Valdez said. “You know what, this piece didn’t fit exactly right, so let’s take that one out and plug this one in.” Target is investing a portion of the $2 billion earmarked for capital expenditures this year — and part of $7 billion over three years — on upgrading its supply chain. Other major initiatives aimed at reviving Target’s business include remodeling stores, improving digital capabilities and launching new private-label brands. “How do we get just the right amount of product to exactly the right place at exactly the right time?” CEO Brian Cornell posed to analysts in New York in late February. “The work underway is game-changing for Target.” The work, other executives added, is fundamentally changing how Target moves products, so when a store sells one bottle of shampoo, Target can put another bottle on a truck within hours to replace it. In doing so, products coming in can then go straight to the sales floor so Target can dedicate more backroom space to shipping online orders. Within the past few years, the supply chain has gone from the sidelines to being a more central part of many retailers’ strategic agendas as they grapple with the shift to online shopping, said Steve Osburn, managing director of consulting firm Kurt Salmon. In this landscape, where you hold your inventory and how fast you can move it has become a competitive advantage — or weakness. Retailers are especially motivated to solve these problems since issues in the supply chain — which used to be taken care of at warehouses and were shielded from public view — are now more visible, he said. “You’ve got so much product going through e-commerce, if there’s a problem in the supply chain, it’s the customer who’s the first to see it,” Osburn said. The growing importance of supply chain also was evident in the buzz surrounding Valdez’s appointment last year. When Target poached him from Amazon, it became big news. Part of the intrigue was that Amazon, which continues to grow while many traditional retailers are struggling, is more often the beneficiary of defectors from Target. Amazon wasn’t happy about it. It sued Valdez for allegedly violating a noncompete clause. The issue was eventually settled. Valdez declined to comment on the matter and shied away from talking much about Amazon. Growing up in Pueblo, Colo., Valdez was introduced to the business at a young age. After school, he would often accompany his grandparents as they made deliveries as part of their pharmaceutical business. And his parents both worked for UPS. “I’d go to my dad’s office and look over the rail and see all of the conveyors and trucks and see how product was moving, and I just got the bug,” he said. After graduating from Colorado State University, he got his first job at Wal-Mart, where he helped it open its first distribution center in Mexico. He mused about how one of the last things he did as Amazon’s vice president of operations also was opening a warehouse in Mexico, located across the street from Wal-Mart’s. He had stints at Blockbuster and Staples in between. As for Target, he said he was drawn to it because of the opportunity to leverage its 1,800 stores — which are in proximity to where most Americans live — to help get products to customers faster. “That’s a huge advantage,” he said. “We can offer second to none the speed from those stores in a tremendous way that others cannot.” Target already fulfills about half of its online orders from its stores, either through in-store pickup or directly shipping items to customers. In doing so, it has cut down on shipping times and costs. Valdez has been bolstering his team, drafting several executives from Apple, Amazon, Wal-Mart and Tesla to bring more thought leadership and technical expertise to Target. In the meantime, the tech industry is exploring ideas such as how self-driving — and even flying — cars might revolutionize transportation and get products to customers. But for now, Valdez said Target is focused on the more immediate future. “We’ll not go that far — not yet,” he said. kavita.kumar@startribune.com kavitakumar View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Reply yod on May 11, 2017 at 11:01 am Usually I like to make fun of people who think they can get away with stealing from Wal-Mart when it’s been proven time and time again that it’s virtually impossible but I’m sad for these kids who had to watch their parents get arrested and embarrassed in front of everyone like that. Reply Anonymous on May 11, 2017 at 7:41 pm No it’s not. I worked there and can tell you how easy it actually is. I’d find over $300 worth of packaging from stolen good each night. FYI, no loss prevention overnight. It’s a joke. Once an off duty cop caught a guy stealing and the manager couldn’t even get into the LP office to review the tape.

Reply Anonymous on May 11, 2017 at 11:04 am Way to instill you piece of garbage values to the next generation. The only way those kids will have any chance in the world is if they are taken from these two turds and given to a responsible family member. At this point foster care would be a better alternative then these two. Both should be charged with neglect and abuse. They are ruining these kids entire lives.

Reply Anonymous on May 12, 2017 at 7:58 pm I’m not sure where anyone is getting their information from: Patricia and Brian have 3 children. They have never had a place to live. They go from relative to relative and friend to friend or motel to motel. They have been doing drugs since I have known them. The children see the drugs and have seen needles, etc. The schools have not done anything. They currently ‘live’ with her mother, a sister, her husband and daughter; brother, wife, and their three kids; and her oldest child. (that’s 15 if you lost count) They lie and steal to get whatever they want. They have even taken their kids on their drug buys. They drive vehicles that are uninsured and you’re right-they do not use seat belts. Look up their names on the Maryland Judicial system website. You will see the amount of tickets they have received. (Nothing happened) Social services should have done something before things got this bad. Reply Anonymous on May 12, 2017 at 8:12 pm I live in the same neighborhood as these people. There are different cars on a daily basis. The kids are always dirty and most of the time, no shoes. They play in the street (they have a yard) There is always trash laying around. They never watch the kids. I saw the youngest boy riding his bike on a DIFFERENT street than where he lives! He is only 4 or 5. We use to call people like these white trash.

Sure hope she does better with the grandkids. Her kids never graduated high school. They have received numerous traffic citations, arrested for stealing and owe almost $100,000 (combined) for not paying electric, cars, etc. They have been told that it is okay to lie and steal. This is not the first time for them to get arrested or just got caught. All of this information is public knowledge. I have no use for people who lie, steal, and use or neglect their kids. Lots of people have money problems, drug/alcohol problems. They still manage to take care of their family. He gets a job to pay the bills. Go to rehab. Do something!

The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) J. Scott Applewhite Share Tweet Share Email Comments For two decades, a loose-knit group that includes some of the country’s wealthiest people has underwritten the political push for school choice, promoting ballot initiatives and candidates who favor competition for traditional public schools. But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers’ unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump’s administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. “As much as we are aligned on change, we aren’t always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight,” said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That’s up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. THE BIGGEST DONORS Wal-Mart’s Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft’s Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family’s massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because “the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high,” said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals “a dramatic effort to undermine public education.” Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures’ opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation’s two largest teachers’ unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. THE HEART OF THE DEBATE For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. “Most Americans have that already,” Oberndorf said in an interview. “They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It’s really only poor people who don’t have choices.” In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. “There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families,” said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. “School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options — including schools within traditional school systems — offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life.” Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers “a stupid idea.” Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. “No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It’s a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren’t serious about delivering high-quality education,” he said. “They’re simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this.” DeVOS DEEPENS DIVIDE The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her “unprepared and unqualified.” With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, “much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America’s children could be undone,” wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an “A-plus.” Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. “Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be ... is going to be good for education,” Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos’s American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks “who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level.” The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. It’s unclear how much support or opposition such a plan will generate, in part because most people don’t know much about the topic. A poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and released this week found that 58 percent of respondents said they knew little or nothing at all about charter schools and two-thirds reported the same about private school voucher programs. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. “I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?” said DeVos.

But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers' unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump's administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. "As much as we are aligned on change, we aren't always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight," said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Timeline, appointments, executive orders + guide to actions in first 100 days The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That's up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. THE BIGGEST DONORS Wal-Mart's Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft's Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family's massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because "the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high," said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals "a dramatic effort to undermine public education." Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures' opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation's two largest teachers' unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. THE HEART OF THE DEBATE For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. "Most Americans have that already," Oberndorf said in an interview. "They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It's really only poor people who don't have choices." In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. "There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families," said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. "School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options — including schools within traditional school systems — offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life." Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers "a stupid idea." Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. "No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It's a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren't serious about delivering high-quality education," he said. "They're simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this." DeVOS DEEPENS DIVIDE The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her "unprepared and unqualified." With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, "much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America's children could be undone," wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an "A-plus." Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. "Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be ... is going to be good for education," Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos's American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks "who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level." The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. It's unclear how much support or opposition such a plan will generate, in part because most people don't know much about the topic. A poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and released this week found that 58 percent of respondents said they knew little or nothing at all about charter schools and two-thirds reported the same about private school voucher programs. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. "I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?" said DeVos.

(KTRK) AP Saturday, May 13, 2017 10:27AM TUCSON, Arizona -- A Tucson woman is accused of substituting flour for infant formula in containers returned to several local stores for refunds, and police have warned the public to check formula containers' seals for tampering. One child got sick from ingesting tampered formula but is in good condition after being treated at a hospital and released May 5, police said late Thursday. Police Chief Chris Magnus held an unusual nighttime news conference to disclose the arrest and to warn the public. "We're concerned about this and wanted to get the information out as quickly as possible to avoid any other children from becoming sick," Magnus said. Police said the suspect was motivated by money and apparently took place over at least several days and possibly for up to two months. The formula was either purchased or stolen, police said. Dr. Francisco Garcia, chief medical officer for Pima County, said tests are being conducted to determine whether other substances were put in formula containers along with flour, such as something to make it more palatable. Police said Jennifer LaPlante, 30, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of fraudulent schemes and artifices and child endangerment. LaPlante remained jailed Friday. It wasn't immediately known whether she has an attorney who could comment on the allegations. Police listed two Fry's grocery stores and two Wal-Mart stores, all on Tucson's eastside, that are linked to the incident. Officials at Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said they don't restock baby formula and are "deeply disturbed" by the Tucson incident. "Our customers deserve safe, quality foods, and we have policies in place to help ensure that returned baby formula is not put back on our shelves," Wal-Mart spokesman Ragan Dickens said in a statement. A police department spokesman, Sgt. Pete Dugan, said Friday he wasn't aware of additional reports of tampered formula. However, detectives remained "smack-dab in the middle of the investigation," Dugan said. "They need to find out if there's others involved. They need to find out if there's other stores involved." Officials advised recent purchasers of infant formula from Tucson businesses to check seals on containers and to see whether the formula smelled normal. Parents shouldn't feed infants with any formula if there's any question of possible tampering, Garcia said. "Those seals should be intact," he said.

I am writing to go back to the time, at the rest stop in Virginia, when you stared, horror-struck, at the taxidermy buck hanging over the soda machine by the rest rooms, your face darkened by its antlers. In the car, you kept shaking your head. I don’t understand why they would do that. Can’t they see it’s a corpse? A corpse should move on, not stay forever like that. I am thinking, only now, about that buck’s head, its black glass eyes. How perhaps it was not the grotesque that shook you but that the taxidermy embodied a death that won’t finish, a death that dies perpetually as we walk past it to relieve ourselves. The war you lived through is long gone, but its ricochets have become taxidermy, enclosed by your own familiar flesh. * Autumn. Somewhere over Michigan, a colony of monarch butterflies, numbering more than fifteen thousand, are beginning their yearly migration south. In the span of two months, from September to November, they will move, one wing beat at a time, from southern Canada and the United Sates to portions of central Mexico, where they will spend the winter. They perch among us, on chain-link fences, clotheslines still blurred from the just-hung weight of clothes, windowsills, the hood of a faded-blue Chevy, their wings folding slowly, as if being put away, before snapping once, into flight. It only takes a single night of frost to kill off an entire generation. To live, then, is a matter of time, of timing. I am writing because they told me to never start a sentence with because. But I wasn’t trying to make a sentence—I was trying to break free. * That time when I was five or six and, playing a prank, leapt out at you from behind the hallway door, shouting Boom! You screamed, face raked and twisted, then burst into sobs, clutching your chest as you leaned against the door, gasping. I stood, confused, my toy Army helmet tilted on my head. I was an American boy parroting what I saw on TV. I didn’t know that the war was still inside you, that there was a war to begin with, that once it enters you it never leaves—but merely echoes, a sound forming the face of your own son. Boom. That time, in third grade, with the help of Mrs. Callahan, my E.S.L. teacher, I read the first book that I loved, a children’s book called “Thunder Cake,” by Patricia Polacco. In the story, a girl and her grandmother spot a storm brewing on the green horizon. But, instead of shuttering the windows or nailing boards on the doors, they set out to bake a cake. I was struck by this curious act, its precarious refusal of convention. As Mrs. Callahan stood behind me, her mouth at my ear, her hand on my hand, the story unfurled, the storm rolled in as she spoke, then once more as I repeated the words. * The first time you hit me, I must have been four. A hand, a flash, a reckoning. My mouth a blaze of touch. The time I tried to teach you to read the way Mrs. Callahan taught me, my lips to your ear, my hand on yours, the words moving underneath the shadows we made. But that act (a son teaching his mother) reversed our hierarchies, and with it our identities, which, in this country, were already tenuous and tethered. After a while, after the stutters, the false starts, the words warped or locked in your throat, after failure, you slammed the book shut. I don’t need to read, you said, pushing away from the table. I can see—it’s gotten me this far, hasn’t it? Then the time you hit me with the remote control. A bruise I would lie about to my teachers. I fell playing tag. That time, at forty-six, when you had a sudden desire to color. Let’s go to Walmart, you said one morning. I need coloring books. For months, you filled the space between your arms with all the shades you couldn’t pronounce. Magenta, vermillion, marigold, pewter, juniper, cinnamon. Each day, for hours, you slumped over landscapes of farms, pastures, Paris, two horses on a windswept plain, the face of a girl with black hair and skin you left blank, left white. You hung them all over the house, which started to look like an elementary-school classroom. When I asked you, Why coloring, why now?, you put down the sapphire pencil and stared, dreamlike, at a half-finished garden. I just go away in it for a while, you said, but I feel everything, like I’m still here, in this room. The time you threw the box of Legos at my head. The hardwood dotted with blood. Have you ever made a scene, you said, filling in a Thomas Kinkade house, and then put yourself inside it? Have you ever watched yourself from behind, going deeper and deeper into that landscape, away from you? How could I tell you that what you were describing was writing? How could I say that we, after all, are so close, the shadows of our hands merging on the page? I’m sorry, you said, bandaging the cut on my forehead. Grab your coat. I’ll get you McDonald’s. Head throbbing, I dipped chicken tenders in ketchup as you watched. You have to get bigger and stronger, O.K.? O.K., Ma. * The first time you came to my poetry reading. After, while the room stood and clapped, I walked back to my seat beside you. You clutched my hand, your eyes red and wet, and said, I never thought I’d live to see so many old white people clapping for my son. I didn’t quite understand until, weeks later, I visited you at the nail salon and watched as you knelt, head bent, washing the feet of one old white woman after another. * Those Saturdays at the end of the month when, if you had money left over after the bills, we’d go to the mall. Some people dressed up to go to church or dinner parties; we dressed to go to a commercial center off an interstate. You would wake up early, spend an hour doing your makeup, put on your best sequinned black dress, your one pair of gold hoop earrings, black lamé shoes. Then you would kneel and smear a handful of pomade through my hair, comb it over. In the egalitarian, sanitized, temperature-controlled space of the mall, isolated from the context of one’s life, one gets to reinvent one’s past, oneself. And that’s what we did. Seeing us there, a stranger couldn’t tell that we bought our groceries at the local corner store on Franklin Avenue, where the doorway was littered with used food-stamps receipts, where staples like milk and eggs cost three times more than they did in the suburbs, where the apples, wrinkled and bruised, lay in a cardboard box soaked on the bottom with pig’s blood leaking from the crate of loose pork chops in a puddle of long-melted ice. The time with your fists, shouting in the parking lot, the bright sun etching your hair red. My arms shielding my head and face as your knuckles thunked around me. Those Saturdays, we’d walk until, one by one, the shops pulled shut their steel gates. Then we’d make our way to the parking lot where we’d wait for the bus, our breaths floating above us, the makeup drying on your face. Our hands empty except for our hands. * Out my window this morning, just before sunrise, a deer stood in a fog so dense and bright that the second one, not too far away, looked like the unfinished shadow of the first. You can color that in. You can call it “The History of Memory.” * Migration can be triggered by the angle of sunlight, indicating a change in season, temperature, plant life, and nourishment. Female monarchs lay eggs along the route. Every history has more than one thread, each thread a story of division. The journey takes four thousand eight hundred and thirty miles, or the length of this country. The monarchs that fly south will not make it back north. Each departure, then, is final. Only their children return; only the future revisits the past. What is a country but a borderless sentence, a life? That time at the Chinese butcher, you pointed to the roasted pig hanging from its hook. Its ribs are just like a person’s after they’re burned. You let out a clipped chuckle, then paused, took out your pocketbook, your brow pinched, and recounted our money. What is a country but a life sentence? * The time with a gallon of milk. A shattering on the side of my head, then the steady white rain on the kitchen tiles. The time at Six Flags, when you rode the Superman roller coaster with me because I was too scared to do it alone. How you threw up for hours afterward. How, in my screeching joy, I forgot to say thank you. The time we went to Goodwill and piled the cart with items that had a yellow tag, because on that day a yellow tag meant an additional fifty per cent off. I pushed the cart and leaped on the back bar, gliding, feeling rich with our bounty of discarded treasures. It was your birthday. We were splurging. Do I look like a real American? you asked, pressing a white dress to your length. I nodded, grinning. The cart was so full by then I no longer saw what was ahead of me. The time with the kitchen knife—the one you picked up, then put down, shaking, saying, Get out. Get out. And I ran out the door, down the black summer streets. I ran until I forgot I was ten, until my heartbeat was all I could remember of my name. * The time, in New York City, a week after uncle Phuong died, I stepped onto the uptown 2 train and saw his face, clear and round as the doors opened, looking right at me, alive. I gasped—but knew better, that it was only a man who resembled him. Still, it upended me to see what I thought I’d never see again—the features so exact, heavy jaw, open brow. His name lunged to the fore of my mouth before I caught it. Aboveground, I sat on a hydrant and called you. Ma, I saw him. Ma, I swear I saw him. I know it’s stupid but I saw Uncle on the train. I was having a panic attack. And you knew it. For a while you said nothing, then started to hum the melody to “Happy Birthday.” It was not my birthday but it was the only song you knew in English, and you kept going. And I listened, the phone pressed so close to my ear that, for the rest of the night, a red rectangle was imprinted on my cheek. * If we are lucky, the end of the sentence is where we might begin. If we are lucky, something is passed on, another alphabet written in the blood, sinew, neuron, and hippocampus; ancestors charging their kin with the silent propulsion to fly south, to turn toward the place in the narrative no one was meant to outlast. * The time, at the nail salon, I overheard you consoling a customer over her recent loss. While you painted her nails, she spoke, between tears. I lost my baby, my little girl, Julie. I can’t believe it, she was my strongest, my oldest. You nodded, your eyes sober behind your mask. It’s O.K., it’s O.K., you said, don’t cry. Your Julie, you went on, how she die? Cancer, the lady said. And in the back yard, too! She died right there in the back yard, dammit. You put down her hand, took off your mask. Cancer. You leaned forward. My mom, too, she die from the cancer. The room went quiet. Your co-workers shifted in their seats. But what happen in back yard, why she die there? The woman wiped her eyes, looked into your face. That’s where she lives. Julie’s my horse. You nodded, put on your mask, and got back to painting her nails. After the woman left, you flung the mask across the room. A fucking horse? Holy shit, I was ready to go to her daughter’s grave with flowers! For the rest of the day, while you worked on one hand or another, you would look up and shout, You guys, it was a fucking horse! * The time, at fourteen, when I finally said stop. Your hand in the air, my face stinging from the first blow. Stop, Ma. Quit it. Please. I looked at you hard, the way I had learned, by then, to look into the eyes of my bullies. You turned away and, without a word, put on your wool coat and walked to the store. I’m getting eggs, you said over your shoulder, as if nothing had happened. But we both knew it was over. You’d never hit me again. Monarchs that survived the migration passed this message down to their children. The memory of family members lost from the initial winter was woven into their genes. When does a war end? When can I say your name and have it mean only your name and not what you left behind? The time I woke into an ink-blue hour, my head—no, the house filled with soft music. My feet on cool hardwood, I walked to your room. Your bed was empty. Ma, I said, my body still as a cut flower over the music. It was Chopin, and it was coming from the closet. The door etched in amber light, like the entrance to a place on fire. I sat outside it, listening to the overture and, underneath that, your steady breathing. I don’t know how long I was there. But at one point I went back to bed, pulled the covers to my chin until it stopped, not the song but my shaking. Ma, I said again, to no one, Come back. Come back out. * The time, while pruning a basket of green beans over the sink, you said, out of nowhere, I’m not a monster. I’m a mother. What do we mean when we say survivor? Maybe a survivor is nothing but the last one to come home, the final monarch that lands on a branch already weighted with ghosts. The morning closed in around us. I put down the book. The heads of the green beans went on snapping. They thunked in the steel sink like fingers. You’re not a monster, I said. But I lied. What I really wanted to say was that a monster is not such a terrible thing to be. From the Latin root monstrum, a divine messenger of catastrophe, then adapted by the Old French to mean an animal of myriad origins: centaur, griffin, satyr. To be a monster is to be a hybrid signal, a lighthouse: both shelter and warning at once. I read that parents suffering from P.T.S.D. are more likely to hit their children. Perhaps there is a monstrous origin to it, after all. Perhaps to lay hands on your child is to prepare him for war, to say that to possess a heartbeat is not as simple as the heart’s task of saying yes yes yes to the body. I don’t know. What I do know is that, back at Goodwill, you handed me the white dress, your eyes glazed and wide. Can you read this, you said, and tell me if it’s fireproof? I searched the hem, looked at the print on the tag and, not yet able to read myself, said, Yes. Said it anyway. Yes, I lied, holding the dress up to your chin. It’s fireproof. Days later, a neighborhood boy, riding by on his bike, would see me wearing that very dress in the front yard while you were at work. At recess, the kids would call me monster, call me freak, fairy. Sometimes, I imagine the monarchs fleeing not winter but the napalm clouds of your youth, in Vietnam. I imagine them flying out from the blazed blasts unscathed, their tiny black-and-red wings flickering like charred debris, so that, looking up, you can no longer fathom the explosion they came from, only a family of butterflies floating in clean, cool air, their wings finally, after so many conflagrations, fireproof. That’s so good to know, you said, staring off, stone-faced, over my shoulder, the dress held to your chest. That’s so good.

But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers' unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump's administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. "As much as we are aligned on change, we aren't always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight," said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That's up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. --- THE BIGGEST DONORS Wal-Mart's Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft's Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family's massive foundation - which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs - is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because "the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high," said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals "a dramatic effort to undermine public education." Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures' opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation's two largest teachers' unions - the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined - contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. --- THE HEART OF THE DEBATE For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. "Most Americans have that already," Oberndorf said in an interview. "They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It's really only poor people who don't have choices." In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. "There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families," said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. "School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options - including schools within traditional school systems - offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life." Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers "a stupid idea." Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. "No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It's a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren't serious about delivering high-quality education," he said. "They're simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this." --- DeVOS DEEPENS DIVIDE The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her "unprepared and unqualified." With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, "much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America's children could be undone," wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an "A-plus." Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. "Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be ... is going to be good for education," Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos's American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks "who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level." The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. It's unclear how much support or opposition such a plan will generate, in part because most people don't know much about the topic. A poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and released this week found that 58 percent of respondents said they knew little or nothing at all about charter schools and two-thirds reported the same about private school voucher programs. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. "I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?" said DeVos. --- Follow Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill . © 2017 The Associated Press.

But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers' unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump's administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. "As much as we are aligned on change, we aren't always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight," said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That's up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. ___ THE BIGGEST DONORS Wal-Mart's Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft's Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family's massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because "the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high," said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals "a dramatic effort to undermine public education." Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures' opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation's two largest teachers' unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. ___ THE HEART OF THE DEBATE For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. "Most Americans have that already," Oberndorf said in an interview. "They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It's really only poor people who don't have choices." In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. "There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families," said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. "School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options — including schools within traditional school systems — offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life." Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers "a stupid idea." Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. "No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It's a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren't serious about delivering high-quality education," he said. "They're simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this." ___ DeVOS DEEPENS DIVIDE The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her "unprepared and unqualified." With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, "much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America's children could be undone," wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an "A-plus." Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. "Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be ... is going to be good for education," Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos's American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks "who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level." The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. It's unclear how much support or opposition such a plan will generate, in part because most people don't know much about the topic. A poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and released this week found that 58 percent of respondents said they knew little or nothing at all about charter schools and two-thirds reported the same about private school voucher programs. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. "I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?" said DeVos. ___ Follow Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill .

But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers' unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump's administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. "As much as we are aligned on change, we aren't always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight," said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That's up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. ___ THE BIGGEST DONORS Wal-Mart's Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft's Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family's massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because "the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high," said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals "a dramatic effort to undermine public education." Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures' opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation's two largest teachers' unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. ___ THE HEART OF THE DEBATE For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. "Most Americans have that already," Oberndorf said in an interview. "They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It's really only poor people who don't have choices." In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. "There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families," said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. "School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options — including schools within traditional school systems — offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life." Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers "a stupid idea." Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. "No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It's a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren't serious about delivering high-quality education," he said. "They're simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this." ___ DeVOS DEEPENS DIVIDE The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her "unprepared and unqualified." With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, "much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America's children could be undone," wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an "A-plus." Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. "Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be ... is going to be good for education," Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos's American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan.

But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks “who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level.” The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. It’s unclear how much support or opposition such a plan will generate, in part because most people don’t know much about the topic. A poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and released this week found that 58 percent of respondents said they knew little or nothing at all about charter schools and two-thirds reported the same about private school voucher programs. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. “I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?” said DeVos. ___ Follow Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill .

But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers' unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump's administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017 file photo, President Donald Trump looks at Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as he speaks during a meeting with parents and teachers in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. A schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible in 2017 during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) "As much as we are aligned on change, we aren't always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight," said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That's up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. ___ THE BIGGEST DONORS Wal-Mart's Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft's Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family's massive foundation - which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs - is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because "the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high," said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals "a dramatic effort to undermine public education." Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures' opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation's two largest teachers' unions - the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined - contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. ___ THE HEART OF THE DEBATE For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. "Most Americans have that already," Oberndorf said in an interview. "They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It's really only poor people who don't have choices." In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. "There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families," said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. "School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options - including schools within traditional school systems - offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life." Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers "a stupid idea." Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. "No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It's a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren't serious about delivering high-quality education," he said. "They're simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this." ___ DeVOS DEEPENS DIVIDE The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her "unprepared and unqualified." With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, "much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America's children could be undone," wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an "A-plus." Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. "Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be ... is going to be good for education," Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos's American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and blacks "who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level." The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. It's unclear how much support or opposition such a plan will generate, in part because most people don't know much about the topic.

In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. "I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?" said DeVos. ___ Follow Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill .

PHOTO: MARC LORE LINKEDIN The Bloomberg Pay Index ranked the top ten highest paid executives in the US – leaders from the technology sector dominated top spots amongst America’s highest paid executives while an employee of Goldman Sachs stood out. Sixty-year-old John S Weinberg’s surname was synonymous with the bank for many years, perhaps decades, till he left as co-vice chairman in 2015 to join Evercore Partners Inc a year later. On December 31, he reaped sign-on awards worth $124 million, placing him third on Bloomberg Pay Index [BPI], which ranks the highest paid executives across the US. The BPI follows the top 200 highest paid executives recorded in filings of companies which submit their compensation details to US regulators. The Index includes salaries, bonuses, perks, options and changes in pension value. Equity values are valued at each company’s annual fiscal end. Axact executive pleads guilty to fraud charges in American court Weinberg is only surpassed by Marc Lore, co-founder of Jet.com Inc. whose in awarded compensation of $236.9 million from the previous year consisted of money from Walmart Store which bought his company. Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, with an in-award compensation of $150 million, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai 44 and Tesla’s Elon Musk, 45 are all those who round up in the top five highest paid executives. However, Weinberg, a corporate adviser who’s father and his father before that had led Goldman Sachs, stands out in the quintet. It was a rare instance for Evercore, founded 1995, to hire a 32-year-old veteran from a top ranking Wall Street firm. Steven Hall, managing director at a compensation consulting firm called Steven Hall & Partners said, “The concept of nine-figure compensation numbers can be startling, But these are executives whose proven talents make them heavily sought after by other firms.” A sum of $22.9 million was awarded to Weinberg in 2013, the last year his pay was disclosed by Goldman Sachs. In its annual proxy filing Evercore said that Weinberg has a “proven track record as a leader of investment-banking businesses.” His pay package for the previous year included $88.9 million in restricted stock and partnership units of which a third is tied to performance leaving him with the opportunity to collect further $35 million paid in cash if targets are met. This puts Weinberg ahead of others such as current CEO of Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein and founders of KKR & CO, Henry Kravis and George Roberts. As a result of Weinberg being ahead, the other three are less likely to be in the top of the index for the next year. ‘Pakistani parents more in favour of start-ups than other countries’ Executives such as 74-year-old, Mario Gabelli, who ranked tenth on the index with $76 million, show up perennially. The payouts are in cash which puts them on an opposite spectrum from Pichai who isn’t paid in cash but in stock that is granted every other year from Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. Ranking sixth on the BPI is Virginia M.Rometty, CEO of International Business Machines Corp, followed by Mitch Garber of Caesars Acquisition Co ranking seventh, Philippe P Duman former CEO of Viacom Inc ranked eighth and Leslie Moonves of CBS Corp ranking ninth. Meanwhile, Lore who is at the top of the BPI makes a special case since most of his compensation is tied to the deal with Walmart and composes of restricted shares which will be vested fully by September 2021. Excluding the shares from the acquisition, Lore receives $1.43 million in the form of salary, perks and bonuses for the fiscal year. However, it comes as a surprise to see 45-year-old Lore at the top of the list, who had previously worked at Amazon.com before starting Jet.com. In an article published my him on Linkedin he wrote “Over my six years in finance, I learned to approach my career as an individual sport, where I was judged by the size of my bonus. Ultimately, I have realized that success is not a measure of your salary, title or degree, but the impact you have on others and the collective happiness of the people you touch.” This article originally appeared on Bloomberg Read more: 2016 , Amazon , Goldman Sachs Recommended Stories Executive Approval: Research, policy forum formed in AJK  The forum will have multidimensional responsibilities to promote the Kashmir issue Axact executive pleads guilty to fraud charges in American court Umair Hamid was arrested last year in the US Capacity Building: UNODC assures NAB of support UNODC Executive Director Aldo Lale Demoz meets NAB Chairman Qamar Zaman Chaudhry on Friday Corrupt practices: Three officials to face the music Accused are sub engineer, executive engineer and sub divisional officer.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Warren Buffett Stocks You Shouldn't Be Buying Right Now IBM, Apple, and individual airlines might not be the most attractive holdings in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio to buy right now. Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) May 13, 2017 at 8:21AM Warren Buffett's stock-picking prowess is envy-inspiring, but his recent comments to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) investors suggest to me that Main Street investors ought to press the pause button before buying shares in IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and individual airline stocks, such as United Continental (NYSE:UAL). Valuation prompts selling, not buying IBM has been pushing hard into next-generation, cloud-based solutions, but despite fast growth in these strategic segments, the company's legacy businesses continue to falter, and that's weighing down sales and profit. IMAGE SOURCE: MOTLEY FOOL Warren Buffett has been one of IBM's biggest supporters, but last weekend, he admitted he's cut his massive stake in IBM shares by one-third. He remains one of IBM's biggest shareholders (Berkshire Hathaway owned about  81 million shares exiting the first quarter), but in the past, when he starts selling, he continues selling until he doesn't own any more shares (exhibit A: Wal-Mart). In explaining his decision to sell a big chunk of his IBM shares, he explained that once shares hit $180, he felt they were valued at levels that made sense to sell, not buy. He also acknowledged on CNBC last week that IBM has "run into some very tough competition." IBMs shares have fallen to about $151, and when Buffett was asked if he's selling more shares at these prices, he replied, "I don't think we will be selling." The word "think" leads me to believe he's not against the idea, and it suggests to me that if shares climb, he could sell more of his position. Since he's still sitting on over 50 million shares, the risk that he'll sell on a rally makes buying IBM less attractive to me. No longer cheap Buffett's made a lot of money buying Apple, but his recent comments about the company's valuation suggest he's sitting on his current position, not buying more shares. He first bought Apple stock after weak iPhone sales caused shares to drop in 2015. At those post-drop prices, Buffett said last week that Apple "didn't have to do a lot better in the future than they were doing at the current time" to justify the price he was paying. Today, that may not be the case anymore. Buffett probably isn't going to be selling his Apple shares anytime soon, but he was noncommittal when he was asked last week if he's still a buyer. Instead, he hinted that buying Apple at today's prices is difficult, because, in his words, "I'm cheap ... and there's always an anchoring problem with buying stocks. We used to buy 'em, at X, and actually it's harder to buy 'em at higher prices." Apple's shares are up 68% since last April, so it's understandable that Buffett might be struggling to justify paying more to buy Apple shares today. After all, he owns a ton of shares already. According to filings, he's got $19 billion riding on the company. Overall, while Apple is a Motley Fool recommendation, his comments suggest to me that if you're long Apple already, the best bet is to stay put. If you haven't bought it yet, perhaps waiting until valuation gets Buffett-worthy is wise. Investing in individual airlines is hard Buffett surprised everyone when he became a big investor in America's biggest airlines, including United Continental, last year. His buying was arguably out of character, given that he's joked in the past that a surefire way to become a millionaire is to start out as a billionaire and then invest in an airline. Perhaps that's why he decided to buy a slate of airline stocks, rather than concentrate his risk in just one of them. After all, he describes his past investment in U.S. Air, an airline that went broke twice, as a "really dumb investment."  His interest in airline stocks nowadays isn't a mystery. Bankruptcies and mergers have removed excess capacity and boosted load factors, improving pricing power, and undeniably, that's helping airlines deliver greater growth. However, airlines still face inherent risks that make picking individual airline stocks hard, and it isn't easy for individual investors to diversify across the industry the way Buffett did. Furthermore, I don't think airlines will be a long-term investment for Berkshire Hathaway. Instead, I think it's more of an opportunistic investment that's similar to how Buffett has invested in oil stocks in the past. Despite its changes, the airline industry remains fiercely competitive, and price transparency removes a lot of an airline operator's ability to price seats at a premium to its competitors. The industry also faces risks associated with payroll costs and volatile jet-fuel prices. Furthermore, innovation is difficult, because the minute one airline does something right, it's bound to be copied quickly. In short, while airlines enjoy tailwinds because of a strong economy, there's no shortage of things that could go wrong and ultimately make these stocks less attractive to Buffett. If I'm right, then Berkshire Hathaway could as easily become a seller of these stocks in the future as it was a buyer, and Buffett will have sold his position long before you get a chance.   Todd Campbell owns shares of Apple. His clients may have positions in the companies mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Berkshire Hathaway (B shares).

(REUTERS/Mike Segar) You probably remember that problem from high school math class: If you saved $5 a day and invested it at a nominal interest rate, you’d make $147,000 after 35 years. The point your math teacher was trying to make was that little amounts add up. But you don’t have to stick a $5 bill in a jar. The virtual universe is full of deals, and shrewd internet habits could lead to big savings over time. You don’t even have to sacrifice simple pleasures like music and video games; you can just obtain them in a smarter and more economical way. By the way, if you’ve avoided budgeting and managing your money because it’s too cumbersome, depressing or difficult, new apps and programs make it manageable and maybe even, dare I say, fun. Click here for the best budgeting and finance software. So how do you cut corners? Here are seven simple ways to save money on the internet. More on this... Why you’ll want a mesh Wi-Fi network at your home or office Criminals using SIM card swaps to steal your money Is Apple CarPlay worth the money? 1. Use Online Coupons Most people hear the word “coupon” and roll their eyes. It’s tedious, snipping out little squares from the Sunday newspaper and then handing them over to a cashier. But online, this process is much easier. Visit sites like RetailMeNot or CouponCodes, and you’ll have access to discounts on everyday products. Codes work for a diverse selection of retailers, including Walmart, Target, Sears, and Macy’s. When you check out, you’ll see the words “promo code.” Just copy and paste your code into the field, and that’s it. You’ll be astounded by the rewards you can reap. Meanwhile, Amazon has an entire section of its website dedicated to coupons. Here, you can find discounts in specific categories, such as groceries, electronics, and office supplies. The coupons get even more enticing for Prime Members. Click here to get coupons on Amazon while you shop. 2. Get Free Music (or Even Rent It) Twenty years ago, it was hard to imagine CDs vanishing from shelves, but today it’s hard to even find a physical music store. Now, we may be entering a new phase. Music fans may not have to buy music at all. Music subscription services like Spotify and Pandora have huge libraries containing millions and millions of songs. They’re basically an all-you-can-eat buffet of artists and albums. For a limited selection and quality, you can sign up for free, and many listeners will be satisfied this robust offering. But for the full experience, a subscription to either service will give you access to all the latest hits. It gets better if you’re already an Amazon Prime member. Many people enjoy their first year of Prime without ever knowing they can download music for free. Yes, you can stream songs, but you can also choose from more than a million MP3s to keep on your phone or computer. 3. Skip the Crazy Gadgets Some of these gadgets can be fun, especially if you give them as tongue-in-cheek gifts, but who actually needs a “smart” Panini maker? Is your roommate really such a jerk that you need an “ice cream lock”? And although it may be colorful, who could sleep with a “light-up pillow”? Worse are the “proof-of-concept” projects that start their lives on crowd-funding sites like Kickstarter. Many never see the light of day, and you may lose your pledge money without ever seeing a finished product. 4. Redeem Those Rebates Yes, rebates used to be a pain. Why would you mail a form in, when you don’t remember the last time you licked a stamp? Some shoppers are young enough not to know the difference between a coupon and a rebate. To refresh: Coupons are used at the time of purchase and are instantaneous. Rebates can only be redeemed after the purchase of an item, usually at full price. But now rebates can be easy. Amazon has a special section for checking if an item you have purchased qualifies for a rebate. Manufacturers, wireless service providers, merchants, and other companies on Amazon.com use mail-in rebates to offer the best possible price on new items. You’ll need your order number and email address handy, and make sure to keep the packing slip when your order is delivered. You’ll use these documents to complete the online rebate form. Rebates may take 12 to 15 weeks to process, but they’re another way to get cash back. I have more information about Amazon rebates on my site. 5. Watch Your Smart Phone’s Data Smartphones are more powerful than ever, enabling you to use GPS, Skype friends in Japan, and stream videos while sitting on a boat in the middle of a bay. These are amazing features, of course, but they also devour your data. If you don’t have an unlimited data plan, you may run out of juice before your next billing cycle. This is the kiss of death for smartphone users. Buying more data is generally expensive, and you’re forced to add a gig or two because your phone is useless otherwise. My suggestion is to either secure an unlimited data plan, especially if you use heavyweight apps on the go, or just carefully watch your data. You can always track how much data you have left, either through your phone’s settings or by downloading your provider’s app. Click here for five ways to drastically reduce your smartphone’s data usage. 6. Wait to Upgrade Your Phone You don’t have to tell me: Phones get better every year. Every incarnation comes with its exciting new features, like improved battery life and camera resolution. So once the next iPhone or Galaxy becomes available, why should you wait to snatch it from the display case? For one, it’s expensive. The people who camp overnight in front of the Apple store don’t mind spending up to $1,000 on the latest model, but most of us don’t have the spare capital. If your phone is working nicely and it’s still in good physical condition, there’s no particular reason to upgrade. Bonus: Buy Your Modem or Router Too many people make the mistake of renting a modem and router from their service provider. Sure, the rental fee for modems and routers is usually nominal, about $6 per month, but after four years of service, that adds up to $288. You can find a very decent router through Best Buy or Amazon for under $100. Better yet, buy your router based on the features you want. Not all routers are created equal. Some are faster; others are better known for security. Click here for my three best router recommendations. There are a few considerations, though: First, your internet service provider may not let you use a store-bought router or modem. Second, you may have to figure out how to install the devices yourself, and not everybody wants to deal with that. Finally, do you expect to use the same service provider for more than a year? The same advice applies to your modem. You’re better off buying that too. Click here for advice on buying the best modem. What are some other ways you can cut tech costs?

Apple said it has joined RE100, a global initiative by influential businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity. To date, RE100 has amassed membership from 77 corporations. Other RE100 members include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, VMware, Rackspace and Wells Fargo. Apple's announcement is mostly symbolic at this point. The company is already powering its operations in the U.S., China and 21 other countries with 100% renewable energy, and, in 2015, powered 93% of its operations around the world with renewable energy. Apple has invested in renewable energy for several years. Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, said Monday that the company completed construction on its latest renewable energy project — a 50-megawatt (MW) solar farm in Arizona, Apple worked with local utility Salt River Project on the solar array, which will provide renewable power to Apple's global command data center in Mesa, Arizona. The solar farm provides power equal to the energy use of more than 12,000 Arizona homes. Apple The Singapore solar project is the first distributed utility-scale installation in the country. Solar energy developer Sunseap Group will provide Apple with 100% renewable electricity from solar energy systems built atop more than 800 buildings in Singapore. Last year, Apple announced it would invest $850 million in a solar power plant through a partnership with First Solar, one of the nation's largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturers and a provider of utility-scale PV plants. Through a 25-year purchasing agreement, Apple will get 130MW (megawatts, or million watts) from the new California Flats Solar Project. The First Solar deal rocketed Apple past Walmart as the largest corporate user of solar power. On the same day Apple joined RE100, Bank of America also announced it was committing to RE100. America's top tech companies have been going green in a big way, so much so that the availability of clean energy resources is a key consideration in where they locate corporate offices and data centers. The move is designed to save them millions of dollars in long-term energy costs. "We believe energy is the future of our business," Josh Henretig, director of environmental sustainability at Microsoft, said in an earlier interview with Computerworld. Last year, Google announced it would purchase 842 megawatts (MW) of clean energy, nearly double the clean energy it had already purchased -- taking the company to 2 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy. Creative Commons Lic. The Googleplex is Google's corporate headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company has committed to tripling its purchases of clean energy by 2025. Put in context, 1 megawatt (MW) can power roughly 200 homes, so Google's purchase could power about 168,000 homes. Google has pledged to triple its renewable energy purchases by 2025. Last year, Apple also joined with 12 of the largest companies in the U.S. to launch the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, a White House initiative to have corporations commit to reduce their emissions, increase low-carbon investments, deploy more clean energy, and take other actions to build more sustainable businesses and tackle climate change. Despite only being a few months old, the RE100 collaborative already boasts corporate signups from companies in India, China, Europe and the U.S. "Research shows that in the U.S. alone, doubling energy productivity by 2030 could save $327 billion annually in energy costs and add 1.3 million jobs to the economy, while carbon dioxide emissions would be cut by approximately 33%," RE100 stated on its website. "We're happy to stand beside other companies that are working toward the same effort," Jackson said during remarks at Climate Week in New York City on Monday. "We're excited to share the industry-leading work we've been doing to drive renewable energy into the manufacturing supply chain and look forward to partnering with RE100 to advocate for clean-energy policies around the world." Apple is also a member of The Advanced Energy Economy (AEE), a trade association representing the renewable energy industry. "We're thrilled that Advanced Energy Economy member Apple has committed to run on 100% renewable energy and also sees the need to improve policy," AEE CEO Graham Richard said in a statement Tuesday. "They are upping the ante as they manage their energy needs, a trend we are seeing among our corporate energy buyer members." Last month, Apple glass supplier Lens Technology in Beijing announced it would run its Apple operations entirely on renewable energy. The clean energy commitment by Lens was combined with a zero waste compliance agreement for all of its final assembly sites. Solvay Specialty Polymers, which supplies Apple with antenna bands for the iPhone, also pledged to use 100% renewable energy for all of its Apple production. The commitment will cover 14 manufacturing facilities across eight countries by the end of 2018. Catcher Technology, one of Apple’s largest aluminum enclosure suppliers, also is targeting 100% renewable power for its production of Apple goods by the end of 2018. Altogether, Apple suppliers' commitments to date will represent more than 1.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy used in the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018, equal to the amount of electricity consumed by more than 1 million Chinese homes.

EVERETT — A Snohomish County judge sentenced a woman to 14 months in prison for hitting an Everett police officer twice with her car earlier this year. Court records show that Vanessa Cuevas lashes out when she’s cornered. At Tuesday’s hearing, she also was sentenced for assaulting a Walmart loss prevention officer who tried to detain her for shoplifting make-up and a nail kit in 2015. The judge agreed to allow the defendant to serve the sentences for the two convictions at the same time. Superior Court Judge Joseph Wilson ordered Cuevas, 28, to undergo an evaluation for drug addiction. In both incidents Cuevas was suspected of using drugs or being in possession of narcotics. Her drug use caught Everett police officer Mark Smith’s attention Feb. 28. Smith was investigating a trespassing complaint on Broadway when he spotted Cuevas in the driver’s seat of a Pontiac. She appeared to be heating a glass pipe with a lighter. Smith also saw a syringe and a piece of foil on the woman’s lap. The officer believed that Cuevas was in the process of using drugs, according to court documents. She hadn’t noticed him so Smith started to record Cuevas with his camera. His position was given away when he radioed another officer to respond. Cuevas started stuffing the drug paraphernalia in her purse. Smith ordered Cuevas to get out of the car. She continued to stash the items in her purse. Smith tried to open the driver’s door but Cuevas had locked the vehicle. She started it up, ignoring the officer’s repeated commands. Smith moved behind the Pontiac to keep Cuevas from leaving but she backed into him and then pulled forward. The officer called for more assistance. Cuevas put the car in reverse again. “Fearing for his safety, Officer Smith pulled out his firearm and ordered Cuevas to stop and exit the car,” Snohomish County deputy prosecutor Jarett Goodkin wrote. The officer moved away from the Pontiac. That’s when Cuevas backed up so the front of her car was pointed at Smith. The officer aimed his gun at Cuevas. As he tried to sidestep to the right, Cuevas punched the accelerator and struck Smith, knocking him to the ground. She fled the scene. Smith was taken to the hospital where he was treated for his injuries. Another officer watched the video Smith had taken and immediately recognized Cuevas. Chelan County sheriff’s deputies arrested her two days later in Wenatchee where she was staying with a relative. Diana Hefley: 425-339-3463; hefley@heraldnet.com.

RUGABER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS This article was published May 13, 2017 at 1:50 a.m. PHOTO BY AP / WILFREDO LEE Shoppers mingle outside a store last month in Miami Beach, Fla. Sales in a retail category that includes department stores slipped 0.5 percent in April even as other categories, including online, gained. Comments aAFont Size WASHINGTON -- Americans in April stepped up their spending at auto dealers, hardware stores and e-commerce outlets as retail sales rebounded from two sluggish months. The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales increased 0.4 percent in April from March. Sales ticked up just 0.1 percent in March and fell in February. The increase suggests that consumers are poised to spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending, which also includes spending on services such as utilities, rose at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter. The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy's and J.C. Penney, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns more than broader economic weakness. Sales in a category that includes department stores, as well as general retailers such as Wal-Mart, fell 0.5 percent in April, the government said. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 percent, the strongest of any group. "The retail sales data provide further reason to expect that overall consumption growth will be much stronger in the second quarter," said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The sales gains were widespread, as Americans spent more at electronics and appliance stores, health care retailers, and sporting goods outlets. Sales fell at grocery stores and clothing merchants. Americans ate out more, allowing spending at restaurants and bars to rise 0.4 percent. Auto sales rose 0.7 percent after falling in March. Consumer confidence has soared since the presidential election, but spending hasn't increased as much as the jump in optimism would suggest. Last month's gain in retail sales was solid but not particularly strong. Hiring has been steady, and the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.4 percent in April. Yet average hourly pay rose just 2.5 percent over the past year. And inflation has ticked up, eroding most of that wage gain. "The backdrop is generally favorable for consumers, with an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, gradually improving wage pressures, low borrowing costs and high household wealth," Michelle Meyer and other Bank of America economists wrote in a note before the data was released. The slowdown in consumer spending over the winter added to the woes of many retailers. On Wednesday, Macy's reported sharply lower sales and profits, causing a collapse in its share price. Traditional retailers are suffering through their worst patch since the recession. More than twice as many stores have closed this year as at the same point last year. Bankruptcies are far outpacing last year's rate. Retailers cut jobs at the sharpest pace in seven years this spring, and they collectively could report the biggest drop in first-quarter profits since 2009.

LaPlante is accused of substituting flour for infant formula in containers returned to several local stores for refunds, and police have warned the public to check formula containers' seals for tampering. Tucson Police Department via AP) Nation & World May 13, 2017 4:03 AM Arizona police: Woman switched flour for formula The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TUCSON, Ariz. A Tucson woman is accused of substituting flour for infant formula in containers returned to several local stores for refunds, and police have warned the public to check formula containers' seals for tampering. One child got sick from ingesting tampered formula but is in good condition after being treated at a hospital and released May 5, police said late Thursday. Police Chief Chris Magnus held an unusual nighttime news conference to disclose the arrest and to warn the public. "We're concerned about this and wanted to get the information out as quickly as possible to avoid any other children from becoming sick," Magnus said. Police said the suspect was motivated by money and apparently took place over at least several days and possibly for up to two months. The formula was either purchased or stolen, police said. Dr. Francisco Garcia, chief medical officer for Pima County, said tests are being conducted to determine whether other substances were put in formula containers along with flour, such as something to make it more palatable. Police said Jennifer LaPlante, 30, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of fraudulent schemes and artifices and child endangerment. LaPlante remained jailed Friday. It wasn't immediately known whether she has an attorney who could comment on the allegations. Police listed two Fry's grocery stores and two Wal-Mart stores, all on Tucson's eastside, that are linked to the incident. Officials at Arkansas-based Wal-Mart said they don't restock baby formula and are "deeply disturbed" by the Tucson incident. "Our customers deserve safe, quality foods, and we have policies in place to help ensure that returned baby formula is not put back on our shelves," Wal-Mart spokesman Ragan Dickens said in a statement. A police department spokesman, Sgt. Pete Dugan, said Friday he wasn't aware of additional reports of tampered formula. However, detectives remained "smack-dab in the middle of the investigation," Dugan said. "They need to find out if there's others involved. They need to find out if there's other stores involved." Officials advised recent purchasers of infant formula from Tucson businesses to check seals on containers and to see whether the formula smelled normal. Parents shouldn't feed infants with any formula if there's any question of possible tampering, Garcia said. "Those seals should be intact," he said.

  You are here: Home > Opinion > Columnists A piece of the economic pie By Earl Bousquet 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China.org.cn, May 13, 2017 Adjust font size: Everyone wants a piece of China today. The British, Canadians and Americans – like many others – are indeed going head over heels to attract more Chinese investment, students and visitors. With China producing an ever-increasing amount of millionaires, businesses and wealthy citizens are increasingly being wooed to leave China and take up residence abroad. On May 7, top U.S. and U.K. newspapers reported that a U.S. businesswoman with ties to the White House was in Beijing unfairly wooing Chinese investors to invest in a private luxury development, with the prospect of receiving U.S. green cards in return. The issue was also used to raise conflict of interest issues with the Trump administration. But offering permanent residency and passports in return for investment is standard practice in most Western capitals. Despite fears about abuse of such schemes by unsavory characters, many countries worldwide – including the U.S. – actually officially offer citizenship for investors. It's the same in smaller nations, too, including the Caribbean countries, where some Citizenship by Investment Programs (CIP) invite potential investors to "Come as a Visitor and Leave as a Citizen." But China does not have to offer or sell passports for investment, as facilities already exist for persons needing to remain there for usually long periods. American and European investors already flock to China, as a result of growing business opportunities and guarantees of attractive rates-of-return: Airbus delivered 153 aircraft to China in 2016, Walmart recently opened-up 40 new outlets in China, Changan Ford opened a fifth China factory last year and Shanghai Disney recorded welcoming nearly 6 million visitors in just seven months in 2016 – and last year McDonald's sold its China business for over $2 billion. U.S. companies also reap great profits from the Chinese market. In 2015, China purchased $165 billion in goods and services from the USA alone, representing 7.3 percent of all U.S. exports; and by 2030, estimates are that U.S. exports to China will rise to over $520 billion. With the World Bank predicting the Chinese economy to grow by 6.5 percent in 2017 and the population to reach an estimated 1.45 billion by 2030, American and European companies are also keeping their eyes on China. Chinese companies have also invested billions in the U.S., creating much-needed jobs. According to a January 2017 report by the U.S.-China Business Council, trade with China supports some 2.6 million jobs in the U.S. Chinese firms have also been landing lucrative transport, construction, engineering and energy contracts in the U.S., with some well poised to land investment possibilities in joint public-private ventures to come out of Donald Trump's recent unveiling of a massive trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. Likewise in the U.K and Europe, sizeable Chinese investments in real estate, joint and/or public-private partnerships are also growing by leaps and bounds. Indeed, records show that China has contributed more towards global growth over the past 15 years than the Eurozone and the U.S. combined – while also accounting for one-third of global GDP growth in 2015. Naturally an investment powerhouse, China has learned from the experiences of others and therefore continues to be accused of being too careful, and even too restrictive about the places in and levels at which foreign direct investment can be applied domestically. Major Western nations continue to accuse China of everything from cyber trade espionage to copyright infringement and currency manipulation. But their major corporations continue to seek and find ways and means of doing more business with China. The fact is: Foreign companies hardly have to be enticed to do business with China today. Nor do Chinese companies have to be surreptitiously enticed to pack-up and leave for other shores. Chinese firms already have their own big plans for overseas investment. Moreover, China has for long been opening-up to foreign investment. The upcoming Belt & Road Forum for International Cooperation in China on May 14-15 will provide another opportunity for states, corporations and other entities that haven't made up their minds to take advantage of the many opportunities offered by China's economic growth. Naturally, some Chinese businesses, nearer to the starting point of the new route, have readily taken the initiative to realize the ancient proverb of "The early bird catches the worm." But others along the way – and from near and far – can also board the early train for the free ride on the new road for equal investment challenges and fruitful rate-of-return opportunities.

Welcome to this week in home video! And by “this week” I mean “last week” as we were offline last week. Click the title to buy a Blu-ray/DVD from Amazon and help support FSR in the process! Pick of the Week The Autopsy of Jane Doe [Scream Factory] What is it? A father/son mortician team see their latest job descend them into a nightmare. Why buy it? One of last year’s best horror films comes home, and genre fans shouldn’t hesitate in picking it up for the first of many watches. Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch are terrific as the pair who see their family business take a hit when the corpse on their slab begins revealing a terrible litany of secrets. Director Andre Ovredal builds immense atmosphere with only a few characters and a single location, and the scares become merciless in their frequency and intensity. It’s a rare horror film where we care about the characters, and that attachment leads to increased tension and fear. Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, and settle in for a modern gem. *Note: This is a Wal-Mart exclusive release until late June when it becomes available everywhere including Amazon.* [Blu-ray/DVD extras: None] The Best 3:10 to Yuma What is it? A father with a bum leg takes heroic action in order to feed his family and impress his son. Why buy it? James Mangold delivered one of the year’s best westerns with his Wolverine film Logan, but his previous entry into the genre is almost as good. 3:10 to Yuma is a remake that finds its own voice in the changes made and the casting of Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in the lead roles. It’s a beautifully shot journey of perceived heroism and hopeful redemption, and it stands tall as a great western. This new release ports over previous extras while bringing the film into the present with a sharp and pristine 4K transfer. It’s worth the upgrade for 4K users but also worth a blind buy for everyone else. [4K UltraHD/Blu-ray extras: Commentary by James Mangold, featurettes, making of, deleted scenes] ———- The Age of Shadows What is it? Korean rebels resist against their Japanese occupiers with intrigue, deception, and lots of violence. Why buy it? This is gorgeous, dense, and thrilling spycraft set in 1920’s Korea and features story turns and meaty characters that share the screen with heavy drama and cracking action sequences. It’s borderline convoluted depending on how closely you manage to pay attention to the character and story details, but even if temporarily lose track of what’s happening you’re never left hanging thanks to its endlessly appealing cinematography. Kim Jee-woon (The Good the Bad the Weird) is still a kinetic mastermind too meaning the action sequences are typically stunners. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Interviews] ———- I Am Not Your Negro What is it? An unfinished book becomes a documentary about an ongoing reality. Why buy it? James Baldwin’s unfinished book, Remember This House, finds new life in this new documentary that’s at times poetic and searing in its exploration and examination of race in modern day America. Baldwin’s text is given a voice – through both his own and Samuel L. Jackson’s – and set against archival footage which collectively tells the story of a country that still can’t get its shit together. This is the kind of doc that should be mandatory viewing for students as it presents a visceral reality that people too often ignore and avoid. Buy it, watch it, share it. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Interview, Q&As, photo gallery] ———- Real Genius What is it? A young genius faces the pressures of older kids, tough professors, military secrets, first love, and a mildly odd roommate. Why buy it? Martha Coolidge’s mid ’80s classic remains one of the decade’s best comedies thanks equally to a ridiculously sharp and funny script and the presence of Val Kilmer at the absolute top of his game. His one-two punch of this and Top Secret! showcase a comedic talent that he wouldn’t truly revisit until the pure brilliance of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang two decades later, but all three represent comedy perfection. Coolidge’s film is filled with memorable moments and lines making it a highly quotable joy. Its Blu-ray debut only has a single feature, but it’s a brand new commentary from the director making this a must-own for fans. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Commentary with Martha Coolidge] ———- Seven Days in May [Warner Archive] What is it? Who ordered the military coup in the United States of America? Why see it? John Frankenheimer’s mid ’60s thriller posits a scenario that’s probably a bit closer to reality than we’d like to believe, and he brings a strong cast along for the ride including Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster. Rod Serling’s script moves between Lancaster’s rogue general and the president’s secretive efforts to discover the truth of the impending coup, and moments of action are peppered into the suspense and drama. A subplot involving Ava Gardner feels slightly out of place and slows things down at times, but the main story builds with a steadily increasing momentum. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Commentary by John Frankenheimer] ———- Tunnel What is it? A man struggles to survive after being trapped in a tunnel cave-in. Why buy it? Disaster movies typically have familiar beats as the protagonists clash in their efforts to survive, but this Korean film avoids that pitfall by stranding a single person amid the disaster. It moves between his situation and the world outside, one where common decency, politics, and reality compete to affect the rescue effort. The result is a thrilling mix of suspense, humor, and drama every bit as compelling as a bigger, grander disaster picture. It’s from the director of A Hard Day too, so you definitely want to give it a watch. [DVD extras: None] The Rest Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyan What is it? You won’t like Paul Bunyan when he’s angry. Why see it? I haven’t actually seen this one yet, but check out this trailer. I’m not saying it looks good necessarily, but I legit love the premise that offers up both a Paul Bunyan origin story and a modern day horror tale. Cheesy, silly, goofy, and overloaded with questionable CG effects, it’s bound to in no way live up to the trailer’s joys, but dammit I’m still going to watch it. [DVD extras: None?] Beyond the Gates [Scream Factory] What is it? A VCR game draws two brothers into a deadly world of supernatural shenanigans. Why see it? The film mixes a nostalgia for those ’80s VCR games – honestly cool at the time for those of you too young to remember – with a gory Jumanji and then throws in a wicked Barbara Crampton for good measure. It’s a low-key film, particularly in its first half, but things get enjoyably nutty as it moves towards a conclusion. The budget definitely keeps things tamped down a bit, but the charm is unmistakable. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Commentaries, featurette, deleted scenes] The Comedian What is it? A bitter, over the hill comedian finds his humanity while doing community service. Why see it? Robert De Niro has been supplementing his filmography with direct-to-DVD movies for a few years now, and while this comedy technically had a short, limited run it’s still a lesser experience for viewers. There’s never been a movie about a stand-up comedian in which the stand-up was actually funny, and this is no different. Worse though the film’s never all that entertaining off-stage either. De Niro’s on auto-pilot, and his arc is a predictable one. The only bright spot here, and the only reason to watch it really, is the presence of Leslie Mann. It’s not a great role necessarily, but she makes the most of it. [DVD extras: Deleted scenes, featurette, Q&A] A Dog’s Purpose What is it? A dog is reincarnated several times before realizing it exists solely to make Dennis Quaid smile. Why skip it? Are dogs and puppies cute? Of course they are, and that may be reason enough for some of you to give this one a watch. For some of us though the themes and end message made implicit in the title are just garbage. It cycles though the dog’s lives with a whimsical tone highlighting how the mutts exist solely to help people, and while I get that in the lazy sense it’s pretty damn insulting at the end of the day. For dogs I mean. But hey, Josh Gad voices the dog so your kids will love it. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Deleted scenes, outtakes, featurettes] Gold What is it? A gold prospector finds gold before discovering that’s the easy part. Why see it? Matthew McConaughey and Edgar Ramirez are always worth watching even if both actors are better than the film they’re currently a part of, and that’s definitely the case here. It has its moments, typically in early scenes with heightened emotions, energy, and geographic flair, but it never quite manages to engage. McConaughey cares and he gives it his all, but we’re left unaffected by both his ambition and his eventual excess. The Wolf of Wall Street this is not. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Deleted scene, commentary by Stephen Gaghan, featurettes] Hunting Grounds What is it? Four hunters are themselves hunted when they find themselves targeted by angry Bigfoots… or is it Bigfeets? Why skip it? The Bigfoot horror sub-genre is a favorite of mine, but for every Abominable or Night of the Demon there are a dozen far lesser films. This one leans towards the lesser unfortunately despite a somewhat intriguing Bigfoot situation because the script and characters are endlessly obnoxious. The creatures themselves are fine, but the atmosphere, scares, and action are all neutered by characters who have us wishing for their demise early on. [DVD extras: None?] Mindgamers What is it? Downloadable skill-sets become more of a curse than a blessing. Why see it? Anyone familiar with The Matrix will get the main plot point here as a group of young scientists develop a method of transferring skills and knowledge from person to database to brand new person. Don’t have time to learn parkour? Download it, and now you’re an expert! The bulk of the film is a traditional thriller with espionage and illicit interests, and it’s forgettable but passable entertainment. Sam Neill is the big draw here in a small role. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Making of] The Resurrection of Gavin Stone What is it? A Hollywood bad boy is redeemed through community service at his hometown church. Why skip it? This is by all accounts a nice, simple movie, but in its effort to tell a positive story it manages only to be wholly predictable, obvious, and dull. Brett Dalton (Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD) is fine, but dull, as a man who follows the exact arc we expect with absolutely zero opportunity for anything fresh or unexpected. The film caters directly to audiences who can’t handle the slightest offense or challenge to their views and beliefs, but if you’re not in that camp then it’s not worth your time. It’s great seeing D.B. Sweeney again I guess, but he’s hardly enough to recommend a watch. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Deleted scenes, featurette, interviews] Rings What is it? A college professor enlists students to help unravel the mystery of the long-haired girl with a phone card. Why skip it? Gore Verbinski’s 2002 remake is a rare reboot that surpasses the original, and it remains one of the best horror films of the millennium. The sequel was a far lesser creation, and now this long-gestating third film sinks the franchise even further. The story presents some new revelations that just fall flat, and the scares are even weaker in their execution. The leads are no help as they lack much in the way of chemistry or charisma, and while Vincent D’Onofrio brings some of his grizzled charm in a supporting role it’s not nearly enough to justify a watch. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Deleted scenes, featurettes] The Salesman What is it? A struggling couple move into a new apartment only to find themselves dealing with the previous tenant’s legacy. Why see it? Asghar Farhadi (About Elly, A Separation) makes films that take events both normal and genre-oriented and turns the focus towards the human participants at the center of it all. His latest leans towards the latter as an attack on his wife leaves a husband set on revenge, but it’s more the shell of a thriller than a thriller itself. That’s by intent as Farhadi’s goal is to highlight both the couple and their community in their collective inability to communicate and deal with the situation. The thriller aspects are ultimately left wanting, but the drama and character work still make for a compelling film. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Interview] Saturday Night Fever — Director’s Cut What is it? Tony Manero is a restless punk by day and a legend on the disco dance floor by night. Why see it? Pulp Fiction is the better film and the one that rejuvenated John Travolta’s film career, but this late ’70s disco drama is the one that first started it. “Disco drama” is a good way to explain it as the film is easily divided into two halves – Manero’s daily life sees him maneuvering the ups and downs of family life and his circle of friends – and the two halves aren’t equally memorable. The dramatic beats are forgettable compared to the dance floor shenanigans which inject the movie with immense vitality. It’s here where we see why the movie catapulted Travolta to stardom. [Blu-ray/DVD extras: Theatrical and director’s cuts, commentary by John Badham, featurettes, deleted scene] The Windmill What is it? Stranded tourists discover just how dangerous sightseeing can be. Why see it? There’s some solid genre fun to be had with this supernatural thriller thanks to a varied mix of strangers and an interesting threat. The individual characters get their own backstories, each with a common thread, and they come together in a familiar but effective way. There are some fun gory bits along the way too.

RUGABER AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) - Americans stepped up their spending at auto dealers, hardware stores and e-commerce outlets as retail sales rebounded from two sluggish months. The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales increased 0.4 percent in April from March. Sales ticked up just 0.1 percent in March and fell in February. The increase suggests that consumers are poised to spur faster growth in the April-June quarter after the economy barely expanded in the first three months of the year. Consumer spending - which also includes spending on services such as utilities - rose at its slowest pace in more than seven years in the first quarter. The rise also indicates that the struggles of large retail chains, such as Macy's and JC Penney's, reflect changes in consumer buying patterns more than broader economic weakness. Sales in a category that includes department stores, as well as general retailers such as Wal-Mart, fell 0.5 percent in April, the government said. Yet a category that includes online retailers reported sales growth of 1.4 percent, the strongest of any group. "The retail sales data provide further reason to expect that overall consumption growth will be much stronger in the second quarter," said Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. The sales gains were widespread, as Americans spent more at electronics and appliance stores, health care retailers, and sporting goods outlets. Sales fell at grocery stores and clothing merchants. Americans ate out more, boosting spending at restaurants and bars 0.4 percent. Auto sales rose 0.7 percent after falling in March. Consumer confidence has soared since the presidential election, but spending hasn't increased as much as the jump in optimism would suggest. Last month's gain in retail sales was solid but not particularly strong. Hiring has been steady and the unemployment rate fell to a ten-year low of 4.4 percent in April. Yet average hourly pay rose just 2.5 percent over the past year. And inflation has ticked up, eroding most of that wage gain. In a separate report, the Labor Department said consumer prices increased 2.2 percent in the past year. The slowdown in consumer spending over the winter added to the woes of many retailers. On Wednesday Macy's reported sharply lower sales and profits, causing a collapse in its share price. Brick-and-mortar retailers are suffering through their worst patch since the Great Recession. More than twice as many stores have closed this year than at the same point last year. Bankruptcies are far outpacing last year's rate. Retailers slashed jobs at the sharpest pace in seven years this spring. And retailers collectively could report the biggest drop in first-quarter profits since 2009. ___ This story has been corrected to show that a category including department stores reported a 0.5 percent drop in sales. Sales at department stores rose 0.2 percent, rather than falling 0.2 percent. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kaufman Lianna Lefler had been missing since April 29. On Saturday, April 29th, 2017 at approximately 1:30 P.M. Lianna Lefler (18 years old) was reported to the Prescott Valley Police Department by co-workers at Walmart in Prescott Valley to be missing. Based on the report, Prescott Valley Police Officers and Police Detectives began to search for Lianna Lefler by various means possible and have been looking for Lefler since April 29th, 2017.  To assist with the search for Lefler, the Prescott Valley Police Department called upon the assistance of the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office and the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue to assist.  Over the course of the last two weeks various law enforcement entities, family members and citizens of the community have searched various areas of the Prescott and Prescott Valley areas with negative findings. On Friday, May 12th, 2017 at approximately 12:00 P.M., Lianna Lefler was located and determined to be deceased by personnel who were surveying the area for the new connector road on top of Glassford Hill.   Based on the finding, law enforcement personnel and Central Arizona Fire and Medical Authority personnel from the Prescott Valley area responded to the location in question and corroborated the finding. The location of Lefler’s finding was off of a maintenance road close to the top of Glassford Hill Mountain. Lianna Lefler's next of kin have been notified. This case is still under investigation and additional information will be provided when available.  Tweet Related items Missing Yarnell Woman's Body Found in Hills Near Yarnell Fain Signature Group Turning Trash into Jobs to Support Veterans, The Homeless and Disabled Adults Body Found on Constellation Trail Join the 10,000+ others and subscribe to the newsletter.

Like other flows, data flows can demonstrate imbalances among exports and imports. Some of these flows represent ‘raw’ data while others represent high-value-added data products. Does any of this make a difference in national economic development trajectories? This paper argues that the answer is yes” [Cambridge University Press]. Politics 2016 Post Mortem “Clinton’s Defeat: Outside Factors Hurt, but Blame Falls on the Candidate” [Charles Cook, The Cook Report]. Two quotes, since Cook is about as close to a dean of political reporting as we have these days, David Broder [genuflects] having passed away: But those [DNC and Podesta email] leaks and Comey’s pro­nounce­ments would not have made a dif­fer­ence had Clin­ton run a bet­ter cam­paign. In­stead of try­ing to win over mal­le­able voters, her team tried to re-cre­ate the Obama co­ali­tion of minor­it­ies, mil­len­ni­als, lib­er­als, and urb­an voters—nev­er mind that the can­did­ate was a 69-year-old white wo­man who had been in the pub­lic eye for 25 years, not a young, cha­ris­mat­ic, fresh face seek­ing to be­come the first Afric­an-Amer­ic­an pres­id­ent. And: But you have to give cred­it to Trump and his cam­paign. He tapped in­to fear, an­ger, and re­sent­ments that polit­ic­al pros had either ig­nored or dis­missed. He settled down and be­came as fo­cused as he is cap­able of be­ing in the fi­nal two weeks, when it really mattered. And his cam­paign blew through cracks in the vaunted blue wall of states that Demo­crats thought was im­pen­et­rable. The 2016 pres­id­en­tial elec­tion had a lot of mov­ing parts, a lot of vari­ables that alone might not have af­fected the out­come but col­lect­ively cer­tainly did. No one or two things ex­plain a race that be­low the radar was closer than na­tion­al polls in­dic­ated—and that on Elec­tion Day el­ev­ated to the pres­id­ency a polit­ic­al novice whose strength among or­din­ary voters was masked by the loath­ing of the elites. Worth a read, if only for the refreshing lack of hysteria.

They surprised insiders by dominating the obscure process — electing a third of the delegates for the state convention, scheduled for May 19-21 in Sacramento. They believe they have turned the once-sleepy race for a new party chair into a serious contest with Bauman, long viewed as the front-runner.” “No One Expected Obama Would Deport More People Than any Other U.S. President” [WNYC]. “Advocate: Trump’s Deportations are Possible Because Obama & Congress Failed to Protect Immigrants” [Democracy Now!] Stats Watch Yesterday and today: Producer Price Index (Final Demand), April 2017: “March was an unusually weak month for inflation and April, after yesterday’s import & export price report followed by today’s producer price report, is shaping up to prove an unusually strong month” [Econoday]. “Because of the size of the monthly swings and questions surrounding Easter, March and April will have to be taken together when assessing inflation data, as it is when assessing retail sales for the two months. Today’s report points to another set of upside surprises in tomorrow’s consumer price report.” And: Mostly the data shows Producer Price data was treading water. In general, Goods inflation surge trend has moderated whilst services inflation is now on the high end of readings seen over the last year. This month’s inflation data is worse than expectations” [Econoday]. Atlanta Fed Business Inflation Expectations, May 2017: “Price expectations, both in this report and on the consumer side, have been muted, a factor that may limit the Federal Reserve’s efforts to reinflate the economy” [Econoday].

Today’s results suggest that March’s 16-year low for the core PCE price index is likely to be quickly reversed and that Thursday’s producer prices and Friday’s consumer prices may both come in higher than expected.” Jobless Claims, week of May 6, 2017: Lower than expected [Econoday]. “Confirming the positive signal from initial claims are continuing claims,” a 29-year low.

Shipping; “The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) today posted a $474 million year-over-year decline in fiscal second-quarter operating revenue, due in large part to the April 2016 expiration of a 4.3-percent emergency surcharge that went into effect in January 2014, and a $69 million increase in so-called controllable expenses stemming from higher labor costs” [DC Velocity]. Political Risk: “Firing Comey and Trump Agenda” [Across the Curve]. I can’t find this on Google, so maybe AtC got it off the Bloomberg terminal. It’s a good round-up, and well worth a read. My favorite comment is that the situation on Capitol Hill is “almost unimaginably fluid.” The thing is, I can’t frame that the deliberate creation of “fluidity” in Machivellian terms, and it’s a safe bet that most of the players on the Hill are Machiavellian. Creating volatility is strategic if… If… You’re properly hedged? Readers? Political Risk: “Supply chain managers are being told that three of the most pressing risks to business performance in the 21st century are cyber attack, natural hazards and supply chain failure” [Logistics Managment]. “For companies concerned by the increasing incidence of cyber attack, oil-rich Saudi Arabia has emerged as a country with above-average inherent cyber risk. Its high internet penetration, combined with a limited cyber security industry, make it a more vulnerable target…. [F]ood-prone Bangladesh, a major manufacturing hub for apparel and textiles, ranks toward the bottom of the index…. For companies with global supply chains, Germany, a major exporter and importer, ranks near the top in resilience, driven in part by its strong ability to demonstrate where parts, components or products are in transit. Russia ranks below average in this respect.” War on Cash: “Mastercard, Visa and UnionPay International have introduced a standardised QR code platform for payments in Thailand that will let consumers make a transaction with their mobile device at any supporting location. The service has been designed to support the Bank of Thailand’s cashless agenda which aims to “drive innovation, interoperability and security in payments” across the country” [NFC World]. Political Risk: “Although some [Silk Road] projects such as a new China-Europe freight rail line have gotten plenty of attention, analysts say investments by China’s development banks have been modest and out of step with the soaring official rhetoric. Expected beneficiaries in the belt-and-road countries are still waiting for the gusher of Chinese infrastructure funds to open up and draw their backwater economies into global supply chains. With China’s economy stretched, however, companies there are largely sticking to safer markets. Some analysts say that’s just as well since bigger investment in belt-and-road projects could prove disastrous in other countries if the money goes to dud projects” [Wall Street Journal]. Then again– Political Risk: “Lessons for China in failed US Silk Road initiative” [South China Morning Post]. “The United States’ New Silk Road initiative [under SoS Clinton] was ‘basically a collection of interesting, somewhat promising but cash-poor ideas about regional connectivity’, said George Gavrilis, author of the 2008 book Dynamics of Interstate Boundaries, a study on border control in Central Asia since the 19th century. Beijing’s plan had ‘a lot more money behind it in the form of loans, grants, soft loans, low-conditionality and no-conditionality loans.'” And Trump has yet to appoint an Ambassador to Afghanistan, which “sits at the center” of the Silk Road. The Bezzle: “Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s international expansion efforts are about to get much more costly. U.S. authorities are asking the company to pay $300 million to settle a five-year investigation into allegations of foreign bribery, the WSJ’s Aruna Viswanatha and Sarah Nassauer report. That possible settlement comes on top of some $840 million the retailer has already spent on an internal investigation and to upgrade its own compliance operations. The penalty would allow the company to clear away a cloud that has been hanging over its business and its global expansion in several countries, where Wal-Mart has been aggressively adding big storefront and logistics operations” [Wall Street Journal].

I think it’s generally out there in the culture, but maybe especially among parents and educators” [The Atlantic].

Donate $25$50$75$100 00200 This entry was posted in Guest Post, Water Cooler on May 11, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

You have got to watch this video, Georgia state police putting people in jail becasue they THINK they smoked weed and were driving under the influence! NBC News Atlanta: ‘The Drug Whisperer’ The conversation recorded from the dash cam of the police car: Officer Carroll: “I’m going to ask you a question, okay? When was the last time you smoked marijuana?” Katelyn Ebner: “Oh, I don’t do that. I can give you a drug test right now.” Officer Carroll: “You don’t smoke marijuana?” Katelyn Ebner: “I do not, no.” Officer Carroll: “Okay. Well, you’re showing me indicators that you have been smoking marijuana, okay?” Officer Carroll: “Watch your wrists for me, I don’t want to pinch you.” Katelyn Ebner: “I’m going to jail for marijuana?” Officer Carroll: “No, ma’am — not possession, unless I find any in your car. I believe you’re impaired by the marijuana you’ve smoked.” Katelyn Ebner: “Okay, so when I do a drug test, I’ll be free to go, correct?” Officer Carroll: “You’re going to jail, ma’am. Okay? I don’t have a magical drug test that I can give you right now.” So, what they are doing is playing the odds. They will likely find weed in the system of the majority of people that they pull over even though the amount they find is no indication of sobriety. I am trying to find the money trail but no idea how the arrests could …oh…maybe if it fills the private prisons with more bodies?

Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob May 11, 2017 at 6:04 pm This isn’t an isolated incident though and lots of cops are just dumb. Back in the early 90s an acquaintance of mine was pulled over for a similar minor traffic violation and had his van ransacked because the cops were sure he had drugs on him. They finally found a small vial filled with liquid which they felt was evidence, despite his protests that it was not drugs. They smelled it and disagreed. I believe he was arrested before they finally realized it was patchouli oil, just like he told them. Now that day may have been one of the few times he didn’t have some weed in the boogie van, but still the cops ought to be able to tell what’s an illegal drug and what isn’t before arresting someone.

I chose MAD Magazine’s Al Jaffee’s snappy answer: “I only sort of like it, can I live on the Canadian border?” I’m interested in how the proponents justify it these days while the cancer is metastasizing and destroying any real “exit” to be had. And, to be honest, I like to watch people squirm while they justify their secular faith against all evidence. I can’t wait for the next would-be expat open thread.

Anyway, London would be sub-optimal as a destination, several million non-drivers notwithstanding. We have fewer cars here and the cops are (slightly) less tooled up, but they (the cops not the cars) make up for their hardware deficit in sheer frothing aggression. Admittedly though, the chances of ‘becoming a victim’ (i.e. of the uniformed gangstas) work sort of in reverse: riding a bus in particular tends to make you more worthy of whimsy’s nightstick than any commuter on a more expensive subway or train or a suitably upscale bicycle, let alone driving a car. Unless the car is too old that is, or you’re too young for it, especially if you’re black and male, or black and female, brown or “of Eastern appearance” and male or female, or not too old at all but incorrigibly “of” any one of those “appearances”.

The one my mother had 30 years ago in NZ (no I don’t know how it got there) was indestructible. Then again it was really a 1970s Fiat, built at Togliattigrad (named for the postwar Italian Communist Party leader who brokered the deal between Brezhnev and the Agnelli family): designed for production in Turin, but the Agnellis’ party was permanently* spoiled there by actual (i.e. non-Party) communists at the Mirafiori factory. (cf. Rabid G. a few days back.) *’Fiat’ (incl.

He did his best to make sure that marijuana was never legal as far as the state was concerned and when that was becoming politically impossible managed to craft and pass a medical marijuana law that makes it nearly impossible to find a doctor, qualify for the prescription, find a dispensary and then afford the highly manufactured legal version. Something tells me that it isn’t just in NYC that marijuana is targeted. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner May 11, 2017 at 7:59 pm What is particularly shocking is Cuomo intends to run for President. After all, it is the party that put up Hillary Clinton. They aren’t exactly bright. I guess he intends to deny it in the future or “evolve” on the issue. He will probably blame Russia. Currently, the establishment Democratic candidate for Virginia governor believes healthcare is a privilege, voted for Shrub twice, and doesn’t want to over turn Virginia’s “right to work” laws.

I happened to do a query to find out if there were actually any cases on file in the late 1980’s. There were probably a dozen or so recent convictions. The south has been a police state for a long time. Reply ↓ RabidGandhi May 11, 2017 at 4:26 pm That video is indeed draw-dropping. Of course at the end of the spot, the reporter takes pains to justify the “brave officers” who “get it right most of the time” (they showed three wrongful arrests who had to go through painstaking processes to clear their names; Ganeesha only knows how many of the 90 other convictions were actually innocent as well but didn’t make it through those hoops/taxes on time). But it turns out the drug detection officers are more accurate than the crime lab that showed their urine was clean. Sounds legit. Lastly, a shout out to MADD who showered the officers with awards and public praise for their “policework” (sic). Donations, credentials, police state, and a legal system calibrated to impoverish the poor (cf the waitress losing her license to work). Sounds like one big happy circle of self-licking ice cream cones.

The hospital bill is $200.00, the insurance negotiates it to $75.00 and pays it. I am suppose to pay 20% but I get a hospital bill for $125.00 . What gives? Reply ↓ jrs May 11, 2017 at 2:30 pm You have probably not reached your deductible yet (assuming you have a deductible, some HMOs and VERY fancy PPOs don’t). So the 20% part won’t kick in until you meet your deductible. And if it’s out-of-network all bets are off. Where the numbers are even coming from down to the dollar though, who knows :). Is $125 worth fighting the insurance company for for you? Just make sure you understand all the deductible in-network/out-of-network info first if you do. There is a social benefit of people fighting the insurance companies on these games (calling up and getting our money back) as otherwise they will just continue them even more so. So it’s a good thing to do. But one can be too tired to bother, especially knowing how much of a pain it can be, if by some miracle they came out of a hospital (really? must not have done much?) only owing $125. Reply ↓ Anon May 11, 2017 at 3:34 pm Balance billing. First, ask if tests and all individuals a patient interacts with are in network.

First it was US auto loans as the new looming subprime crisis, then Australian mortgage and household debt vulnerability to a house price crash, then auto loans and credit debt in the UK (yesterday) and now it’s the same story from Canada – rising house prices, and credit card and car loan debt, combined there with bank downgrades. The survey, carried out by Ipsos for insolvency consultancy MNP, highlights the fallout from the debt binge Canadian consumers have gone on. Household debt reached an all-time high above 167 per cent of disposable income in the fourth quarter of 2016. MNP places some of the blame for that on rising house prices, but data shows Canadians are taking on more credit card and car loan debt as well. US auto is obviously a small part of US household debt, but Canada and Australia are at record private sector debt levels and are exposed to commodity slumps, while UK is Brexit affected.

Reply ↓ John Wright May 12, 2017 at 12:57 am It is not as if the typical American corporation is flush with cash. http://fortune.com/2016/05/20/corporate-america-debt/ “Studying S&P’s universe of more than 2,000 non-financial corporations, S&P’s researchers found that corporate issuers of debt had on hand a record $1.84 trillion in cash. But that statistic doesn’t tell us very much about the health of individual companies, because it appears cash is more concentrated at the top than ever. The top 1% of corporate cash holders, which translates in to 25 large companies—a group dominated by big tech companies like Apple (aapl, -0.05%), Microsoft (msft, -0.17%), and Google-owner Alphabet (googl, -0.21%)—have slightly more than half of the total cash pile of Corporate America. That’s up from 38% just five years ago.” “If you remove the top 25 cash holders, you’ll find that for most of Corporate America, cash on hand is declining even as these companies rack up more and more debt at historic rates. The bottom 99% of corporate borrowers have just $900 billion in cash on hand to back up $6 trillion in debt. “This resulted in a cash-to-debt ratio of 12%—the lowest recorded over the past decade, including the years preceding the Great Recession,” the report reads.” For every debtor there must be a creditor, so pension/bond funds must be holding this debt and the top 25 must have invested their cash in some debt instrument. Maybe some is also on the Fed’s books It will be interesting if many corporations decide to sell more equity to raise cash. The “all time corporate profits” are not translating to a lot of cash on hand for many corporations. .

Also they typically buy the stock when it is a terrible buy. Insiders supposedly buy the stock when they know in advance that there will be really good news so the stock price will rise. By contrast, stock buybacks are to force the stock price up in the presumed absence of near term good news. Reply ↓ John Wright May 12, 2017 at 9:06 am The corporate stock buybacks were viewed as stock manipulation until 1982 when Reagan’s SEC head, John Shad, allowed them for some background https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity “The allocation of corporate profits to stock buybacks deserves much of the blame. Consider the 449 companies in the S&P 500 index that were publicly listed from 2003 through 2012. During that period those companies used 54% of their earnings—a total of $2.4 trillion—to buy back their own stock, almost all through purchases on the open market. Dividends absorbed an additional 37% of their earnings. That left very little for investments in productive capabilities or higher incomes for employees” Corporate stock buybacks should be greeted with derision as they are, in effect, a corporation announcing they have scoured the world attempting to find a good use for corporate cash. The corporation could find no better use of the cash for business expansion, product development, employee training, employee hiring, facility improvement OR an acquisition of intellectual property/another company. Amazingly, with all the opportunities available to them, many US corporations see the best use, of cash and borrowed cash, is to buy their OWN stock. If US corporations, en masse, decide that they need to do “reverse buybacks” (sell stock to raise cash) it might have an interesting effect on the stock market.

I don’t know, do narcissists even have high self-esteem? Even the most prominent suspected example doesn’t exactly seem to. Any level of natural self-esteem or self-compassion probably comes from parents that actually like their kids as people, and don’t abuse them or neglect them, and aren’t too busy with their own issues to parent, and maybe actually help their kids deal with life. But since noone chooses their parents, that’s just the luck of the draw.

So don’t actively train yourself to try to acheive self esteem, train yourself to have compassion for yourself, because it is much more durable. It’s similar to other studies that Yves references that people that try to be happy end up not being happy because life is not perfect. The best chance you have and having the optimal average happiness for your life is to just be compassionate on yourself.

The latter would be the ones who fit the ‘always full of themselves’ picture. The former may superficially come across as full of themselves, but are actually quite fragile and ready to feel slighted and pissed off. Useful distinction, in my experience. Aside from parents, I’d like to give a causal nod to good old economics and employment relations. One of the themes the Frankfurt School would bang on was the idea that, in the face of overwhelming objective power, the subject can be encouraged to max their sense of subjective worth. In a feudal society this wouldn’t go over very well, since such a mindset might quickly translate into revolt. In a capitalist society, with marketized forms of exploitation, the tendency is to believe you’re chock full of human capital and ready to be bought, even though objective conditions are working against. Also, let’s throw in how there are big swathes of employment that involve maxxing personal appeal. Trying to project charisma can get you into trouble if you’re a plumber, but not if you’re in sales. You’ve got it, and you want to make the buyer think that the purchase will lead to some rubbing off. What Baran and Sweezy called the “sales effort” is like mushroom compost for a narcissistic presentation. That said, someone who is clinically narcissistic will end up looking very different from someone who … let’s say “suffers from occupationally driven narcissism.” It makes a big difference if you have a parent telling you that you’re either god or a piece of crap when you’re two years old as compared to getting a blandly affirmative orientation to self in middle school.

The point is not to just stop when you have self-compassioned yourself — got to go on to the other part.

Its narrative about the efficiency of the market, the incompetence of the state, the domesticity of the household and the tragedy of the commons, has helped to push many societies towards social and ecological collapse. It’s time to write a new economic story fit for this century – one that sees the economy’s dependence upon society and the living world. This story must recognize the power of the market—so let’s embed it wisely; the partnership of the state—so let’s hold it to account; the core role of the household—so let’s value its contribution; and the creativity of the commons—so let’s unleash their potential. http://evonomics.com/seven-ways-transform-21st-century-economics-economists/ Reply ↓ Toolate May 12, 2017 at 12:13 am Thanks for this link Reply ↓ MikeW_CA May 11, 2017 at 3:40 pm “But you have to give cred­it to Trump and his cam­paign.

WTF? What part of “take any two similar-sized randomly generated prime p and q and multiply tem together to generate a public key” is hugely complex? Also it’s now known that RSA was in bed with the spooks and actively working to weaken crypto standards via backdooring – Greenwald might have mentioned those types of standards-hacking-based initiatives, which are designed specifically to undermine popular crypto schemes and bring key-cracking within the realm of precisely the kinds of hardware described. You think your 4096-bit RSA is safe, but in fact it’s been backdoored so as to allow NSA et al to break it in reasonable time using their fancy hardware. More stuff that omits crucial additional material: “Spy shops like the NSA can sometimes thwart encryption by going around it, finding flaws in the way programmers build their apps or taking advantage of improperly configured devices.” Or physically interdicting shipments of tech on their way to intelligence-deemed persons of interest and ‘improperly configuring’ said devices via software, firmware and even actual hardware implants, as the spooks are known to do. That allows them to bypass an encryption entirely by way of simply intercepting the user’s keystrokes. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 11, 2017 at 7:40 pm Hugely complex numbers, as shorthand for large numbers which are hugely difficult to find, given only the product. It’s just the usual loss of precision in scientific reporting. Regarding “omits crucial additional material”, what do you expect? It’s long enough already. As for 4096-bit RSA being backdoored or cracked, I don’t believe that to be the case. Please provide a link to a credible claim. It’s certainly vulnerable to side-channel attack, but that’s not cracking, it’s snooping on a decryption process to copy the private decryption key. Mathematically it is impossible to decrypt RSA encryption without knowing the key in a feasible amount of time. For 4096 bit key encryption, the time may exceed the shelf life of the Milky Way Galaxy. But there are side channel attacks that one can perform. This means there are ways to exploit the vulnerabilities that exist in the implementation of the RSA encryption/decryption algorithm in a device. This includes measuring variations in CPU voltage, noise produced by a device during encryption/decryption of a RSA encrypted message (the messages are generally AES keys). Attacks can also be at the software level which exploit unchecked memory read/write or by infecting shared libraries. 1024-bit RSA is of course known to be vulnerable, and you’re right that some standards, particularly anything based on NSA algorithms, are not trustworthy, but this was suspected from the start. Personally, I’d be more worried about trapdoors in Diffie-Helman primes. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 11, 2017 at 8:25 pm Above is (yet again) linked in the wrong place – was replying to ewmayer at 6:52 pm Reply ↓ ewmayer May 11, 2017 at 9:23 pm We do know RSA conspired with the NSA to backdoor so-called elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) – why would you deem it unreasonable to believe that they might have done similarly with their flagship RSA crypto? And note also this chilling 2012 piece from James Bamford: According to another top official also involved with the program, the NSA made an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world but also many average computer users in the US. The upshot, according to this official: “Everybody’s a target; everybody with communication is a target.” “Breakthrough” here might imply something like a so-called L(1/4)-complexity scheme to crack ECC or similar for RSA – that is, development of an attack with asymptotically reduced computational complexity than the thought-to-be-fastest approaches-in-the-academic-community for general-purpose integer factorization (RSA) pr solving the discrete logarithm problem (ECC). That would allow crypto-breaking of selected targets even without any backdooring, It would also involve the kind of “keys to the kingdom” secrecy the government would literally kill to keep, starting with extreme compartmentalization: only a handful of the NSA’s top mathematicians are privy to the details, and all one anyone else outside that tiny circle in the agency or the government sees is “we are building a new improved computer”, not in itself revealing because the kinds of basic mathematical operations involved in all such crypto crackage are public. The secret sauce would lie in the software deployed on same. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 12, 2017 at 12:16 am Yes, RSA’s misbehaviour is well known, but the ECC backdoor relates to deliberately weakened Random Number Generators (RNG) for key generation which are easily avoided. With RSA you get to choose the key, so you don’t need to use a compromised one. Historically, it’s easy to forget that strong crypto used to be export controlled by the USG, so RSA’s actions back in the day are more understandable. Pressure was probably applied. I couldn’t see any link from you to a claim 4096-bit RSA is cracked. And there are in any case plenty of non-RSA alternatives to use. BTW, your first link is dead, all text and no href. Concerning the breakthrough scare story, that I suspect is all about Diffie-Hellman trapdoors, especially going by “employed by … many average computer users in the US”. This involves possible “weak primes” in RFC5114 that allow easy cracking of encrypted web traffic, VPNs, or forging of certificates. Easy in this case means 400 core-years for 1024-bit keys, which is maybe hours using all of WindsorGreen. But 2048-bit weakened keys would still need about 6.4 billion core-years which is hundreds or thousands of years. Finally, speculation about the NSA having the keys to the kingdom via asymptotically reduced complexity algorithms is on a par with them having same due to a large scale functional quantum computing installation: unknown but unlikely. In any case, appropriate choices of crypto are available that make it possible to secure anything you fully control, but don’t ever expect that to be true of someone else’s web server, or your bank site. There’s plenty of 1k-bit RSA and probably SHA-1 certificates around on the web – they’re still on sale. Reply ↓ ewmayer May 12, 2017 at 3:56 am My bad – the first link should read https://www.wired.com/2013/09/nsa-backdoor/all/ “With RSA you get to choose the key” — how so? By approving or rejecting certificates, you mean? And even if in theory that is true, on what basis would you choose (one) 4096-bit key over another? All those will be based on similar-length prime pairs and thus equally impossible-looking to crack. Well-designed back doors are by design invisible to those not-in-the-know. “appropriate choices of crypto are available that make it possible to secure anything you fully control” — if you fully control it, there’s no need for crypto to begin with! The whole point is that out on the web, no one fully controls *anything* – our e-mail passes through multiple servers, and your average PC is now so immensely complex that it offers multiple targets for firmware implants, especially to a state-level actor which can literally interdict hardware shipments at will. I dearly hope you are right about the safety of modern ‘strong crypto’, but I fear your trust is going to prove overly optimistic. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 12, 2017 at 10:44 am Sorry, I meant you get to choose the RSA key generation algorithm, assuming you use software that gives you such a choice, which you should, and you understand what you’re doing or follow a trustworthy recipe.

On full control, I meant that you can choose to encrypt your data by means that render it most unlikely to be cracked with any resources available today or in the near future. It can then safely be stored or transit the insecure internet opaquely. I did not mean that common applications and infrastructure on the net actually make these kind of safe choices, or that individuals can easily protect themselves against all the other modes of attack that a well-resourced actor might employ. Reply ↓ hunkerdown May 12, 2017 at 4:07 am Not weak primes, but pre-shared primes. Even modest 1024-bit isn’t quite as easy as it looks, if you generate a new group with each connection instead of using a pre-shared group. This was not common practice, presumably under the assumption that well-vetted primes were more important than diversity. I excerpt Green et al.’s “Imperfect Forward Secrecy” paper for details: Millions of HTTPS, SSH, and VPN servers all use the same prime numbers for Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Practitioners believed this was safe as long as new key exchange messages were generated for every connection. However, the first step in the number field sieve—the most efficient algorithm for breaking a Diffie-Hellman connection—is dependent only on this prime. After this first step, an attacker can quickly break individual connections. Green and his team built a proof-of-concept system to downgrade connections to export-grade and decrypt them, by computing 512-bit discrete logarithms modulo a specified group prime in a median time of 70 seconds each. The hardware used was surprisingly modest, with 90k core-hours devoted to precomputing a 2.5GB database, ready to use by the last step of the process running on two beefy 18-core Intel servers with 128GB RAM each. To do the same for a limited number of 1024-bit groups is “plausibly within the resources of state-level attackers. The precomputation would likely require special-purpose hardware, but would not require any major algorithmic improvements beyond what is known in the academic literature.” Note that the NSA has their own chip fab and so has all-you-can-eat special-purpose hardware. If you like, just skip to section 4, “State-Level Threats to DH”: (emphasis in original) Finally, we apply this new understanding to a set of recently published documents leaked by Edward Snowden [46] to evaluate the hypothesis that the National Security Agency has already implemented such a capability. We show that this hypothesis is consistent with the published details of the intelligence community’s cryptanalytic capabilities, and, indeed, matches the known capabilities more closely than other proposed explanations, such as novel breaks on RC4 or AES. 4096-bit seems safe to me, but who knows what’s going on under Bluffdale, Utah. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 12, 2017 at 10:24 am I hope Lambert isn’t bothered by our wasting so many electrons here on this geek stuff. Familiar with the Green et al paper and Logjam. The trapdoored primes I was referring to are indeed pre-shared, but also weak. They have been carefully chosen to make them significantly more vulnerable to attack, but that vulnerablity is very difficult to detect if you don’t have the seed. From the abstract of A kilobit hidden SNFS discrete logarithm computation by Fried et al from last year: Our chosen prime p looks random, and p−1 has a 160-bit prime factor, in line with recommended parameters for the Digital Signature Algorithm. However, our p has been trapdoored in such a way that the special number field sieve can be used to compute discrete logarithms in F^∗_p , yet detecting that p has this trapdoor seems out of reach. Twenty-five years ago, there was considerable controversy around the possibility of backdoored parameters for DSA. Our computations show that trapdoored primes are entirely feasible with current computing technology. For these special trapdoored 1024-bit primes, they demonstrate that computing the database needed to routinely attack traffic using the prime is at least 10,000 times easier than it would be for “honest” 1024-bit primes, putting it within the power of pretty much any actor, not just state actors as the Green paper had suggested. From the paper’s conclusion: Dismissing the risk of trapdoored primes in real usage appears to have been a mistake, as the apparent difficulties encountered by the trapdoor designer in 1992 turn out to be easily circumvented. A more conservative design decision for FIPS 186 would have required mandatory seed publication instead of making it optional. As a result, there are opaque, standardized 1024-bit and 2048-bit primes in wide use today that cannot be properly verified. To summarise: – Much of internet security infrastructure using 1024-bit pre-shared keys is vulnerable to state-level cracking, especially if based on widely used groups. – Some such 1024-bit keys are vulnerable to cracking by lower resourced actors as well, and this may include some based on non-widely used groups. – Non-verifiable primes (no published seed) should be avoided. – Use at least 2048-bit and preferably 4096-bit keys.

Kaye Finley has spent much of her past guiding students toward a bright and promising future. Finley will retire from the Beebe School District at the end of the school year after 39 years of dedication to the district. She said the decision to retire was a difficult one. “It’s probably one of the most difficult decisions I have made in my life, or at least it feels that way,” Finley said. Finley has been a library media specialist at Beebe Elementary School for 29 years. “For five years, I was a resource education teacher, and for five years I was a fourth-grade teacher,” Finley explained. “The rest of the time, I’ve been in the library. It hasn’t always been here in this library, though,” she said. “It’s been anywhere from pre-K through seventh grade. Right now, it’s second through fourth grade,” Finley said. “We have two libraries, and they serve a little over 800 students. I see all of those students every other week,” she said. Finley said there’s no such thing as a normal day in the library. “I do have a committee that I work on,” she said. “I’m the Arkansas Comprehensive Improvement Plan process manager, so I’m the one who puts it all together, and I’m responsible for making sure everything gets done.” Finley said she wasn’t a reader growing up but started to become interested in books when she was in junior high school. Finley worked in the library in college at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway. “I read all of the current literature and all of the new fiction at the time,” she said enthusiastically. “When I came here to work as a classroom teacher, my best friend and my mentor was the building librarian. I saw how she worked and how she was a part of the school behind the scenes,” Finley said. “When you’re in the library, you’re on a lot of committees and do a lot of background things. I saw that and realized that was something I’d want to do some day,” Finley said. Finley said she fell into the position, but she has really enjoyed it. “I did miss teaching in a classroom, but I never regretted the change,” she explained. Finley said she likes being involved with the students and staff. “I get to see all of the students. Unfortunately, you don’t get to know them as well as you want to. At least you get to meet them, see them and recognize them in the hallway,” she said. “I also get to be involved with the staff,” Finley said. “You get to build relationships with all of the teachers and see the other side. You kind of see how things work. “In the classroom, I was focused on my grade level and colleagues but didn’t really see how the whole system worked. In my career and on committees over the years, I’ve gotten to see how the school works and how it all works together. It makes you appreciate your job and your school when you see how it takes all of us to make it work.” Finley said the most important part of her job is giving children access to books, information and a place to be themselves. “That’s the main goal and the purpose,” she said. “Sometimes kids just need a place where they’re accepted. There’s no judgment in here, and they’re free to be themselves,” she said. “I’ve had students who didn’t have a niche, didn’t have a place to go, and the library was kind of a sanctuary for them,” Finley said. “Hopefully, you make an impact. Hopefully, you connect them with that book that could be life-changing. “When I first started in the library, I had to hand out candy to get kids to check out a book. Now they come to the library, and they have lists. They know what they want.” Finley said that in her years at the library in Beebe, there have been two fires and a tornado that caused damage to the school. “I’ve helped rebuild three libraries from the ashes up with a lot of support,” she said. “I saw how powerful our staff and community were. Everyone was so supportive and allowed me to rebuild the libraries and the collection,” she said. “We as a district overcame those obstacles, and we thrived,” she said. “No one ever gave up, and we came back better and stronger every time. “It’s like it’s happening to your own home when those things happen, but we were able to make life as normal as possible for our students and staff.” Finley said one never knows the impact one makes on a student. “Several years ago, I had a young student follow me around Walmart and point me out to their parents,” Finley said. “The mother asked who I was, and the student said, ‘I don’t know, but she’s famous. She’s in the library.’ “That was the ultimate compliment to me.” Finley said she would be in the medical field if she hadn’t gone into education. “It’s a service industry like education,” she said. Finley attended Beebe schools from the first grade until graduation. She got her bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the University of Central Arkansas. “Elementary was my major, and special education was my minor. My master’s degree was in library media,” Finley said. Finley was born in Harrison, then moved to Heber Springs, where her dad worked on the Greers Ferry Dam. “We moved to Beebe when I was 6 years old and started school. I came back after college,” she said. “I grew up mainly on a farm out in the country,” Finley said. “Every year we try to take our girls on a vacation. They know we’re going to do historical stuff before fun stuff,” she said, laughing. Finley is married to Joe Finley, a former teacher, and has four grown stepchildren. She said the couple have four grandchildren as well. “We have twin daughters together who are completing college soon,” she said. Finley said she is a part of Delta Kappa Gamma Society International, the Arkansas Education Association, the National Education Association, the Arkansas Association of Instructional Media and the Arkansas Reading Association. Finley said that after her retirement, she hopes to spend more time with her husband and family, volunteer and travel the United States. “I will miss working with students, and I will miss the relationships I have made not only in this school, but with others in our district and beyond,” Finley said. Finley enjoys reading, fishing and traveling to historic parks and landmarks in her free time. Janice Dillard, a second-grade teacher at Beebe Elementary School, said she has worked with Finley for around 22 years. “Kaye is very friendly, talkative, and she has a good listening ear. She is a very good listener,” Dillard said. “She’s very dedicated to the school as a whole. She’s very devoted,” Dillard said. “My first year of teaching here, she and I worked together. She was very gentle, encouraging and patient. I couldn’t have had a better person to start my school year with,” Dillard said. “She’s a stronghold here,” she said. “She is very knowledgeable about everything that goes on in the school system — not just what she does here in the library. “If she had a task to do, you could be sure Kaye would fulfill that task, and it would be done professionally and in a timely manner. She’s always been very mindful of making sure things were done efficiently and professionally.” Rhonda McNeill teaches Gifted and Talented to second-, third- and fourth-graders at Beebe Elementary School. She has worked with Finley for 17 years. “Kaye is very knowledgeable about life,” McNeill said. “She takes pride in where she came from, the school she teaches in, the community and the kids,” she said. “She’s always willing to help you get what you need. She goes above and beyond for the kids and the staff,” McNeill said. “She’s up to date, and she grows with the kids. She stays in touch with them, and they love her,” she said. “She’s truly going to be missed,” McNeill said. Staff writer Kayla Baugh can be reached at (501) 244-4307 or kbaugh@arkansasonline.com.

Site C Dam) past the point of no return? For decades, BC Hydro and various governments have used the scare tactic that Site C is needed to power 450,000 homes. Doesn't it seem strange that, today, those alleged 450,000 homes are hardly ever mentioned? They never existed, still don't, and possibly never will. The justifications for this economic and environmental disaster seem to change constantly: it's for homes, it's not for export, it is for export, it's not for industry, it is for industry, it's for jobs (apparently for Albertans and other non-locals), the list goes on. Just over a year ago, Ms. Clark swooped into Fort St. John, dressed down in her Walmart best (are rural people not good enough to dress up for?), and, after kissing a couple of kids, transformed herself into the proverbial 'wolf in sheep's clothing', patronizing her credulous flock with a nauseating five-minute 'let us help' speech as she promised 100,000 LNG jobs for people in the north to 'fill the government treasuries' with. Since then, I'm wondering how many in that crowd have pulled the wool out of their eyes and will finally see that giant white elephant and realize that all of us, for generations to come, will be paying for it, in many ways. Wake up B.C. Christy's legacy is everyone's expense!

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Chalkin' up a milestone: Hesperia Parks and Rec celebrates 60th anniversary with youth art competition Saturday May 13, 2017 at 6:16 PM May 13, 2017 at 6:29 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes HESPERIA — While kneeling on the ground with a piece of chalk in hand, Allison DeLong focused on the large sketch coming to life as she carefully and swiftly moved around her work of art. “I’ve been drawing since I was 12 years old, and I got inspired to want to draw from watching Disney movies at a young age,” said Delong, 17, of Hesperia. “I would try and recreate the things I had seen in the films and from there I began to branch out and draw my own ideas.” In celebration of its 60th anniversary, the Hesperia Recreation and Park District hosted the Chalk the Walk art competition Saturday morning. Each young artist who participated received a set of chalk and two hours to fill in a 10-foot-by-7-foot space along the walking path of the park for all to see. “If you can imagine your life without a park, wouldn’t that be boring?” asked Staff Assistant Sarah Hauser. “We wanted this event to focus on our youth in the community while also showcasing their abilities to contribute to the park.” Three different age groups  from 7 to 9 years, 10 to 12 years and 13 to 17 years all attempted to draw their best interpretation of the event's theme: Why Parks Make Life Better. While some drew images resembling past events at the park like Movies in the Park, others took a creative spin by creating something out of the ordinary while tying it back to the theme. Covered in chalk, 8-year-old Damien Estrada drew people playing and holding hands at the park in front of his mother Lizeth Barajas, who said the two always make an effort to attend any event the Parks and Rec District offers. “You the see the beautiful sky and them playing and hanging out with friends,” Estrada said as he pointed to his drawing. “That’s my favorite thing to do at the park.” The nonprofit organization Artists of the High Desert partnered with the district to judge the competition. Prizes were awarded to the top 3 finishers in each category. The overall winner received a Walmart gift card. “Although the city wasn’t founded until around the 1980’s, Parks and Rec has been around since 1957 and we thought this would be a great way to commemorate our history and bring everyone out together for a good time,” Hauser said. As the competition came to an end, DeLong stood up from her spot and took a step back to view her completed creation of a young girl blowing bubbles. Inside each bubble was a different activity that people could enjoy at the park. “I wanted each bubble to show why going to the park is a great thing to do and how something simple as walking your dog or hanging out with your friends and family can be something special to make park life better,” DeLong said.

FBI Agent Utley Noble also said 50-year-old Cummins, who was formerly Elizabeth’s high school teacher, said the two began having a sexual relationship March 13, the day they disappeared. A federal judge ruled Friday that Cummins was to be held until his trial on the grounds that he was a flight risk and a danger to the community. U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes cited Cummins’ abuse of his position of authority and his past attempts to evade police in issuing the decision. “Here, the evidence of danger is substantial,” she said.

Police immediately suspected Cummins, a former teacher at Culleoka Unit School in Maury County, who was being investigated by school officials and local police for having an inappropriate relationship with Elizabeth. Surveillance footage caught Cummins filling up his car at a gas station near the restaurant.  Investigators at the time were quick to caution that this could not be a consensual, romantic relationship.

Photo: Reuters “She is 15, a child. He is 50, a grown man,” Tennessee Bureau of Investigation director Mark Gwynn told reporters shortly after the two went missing. “She’s a high school freshman. He’s a former teacher. This is, and was, not a romance. This was manipulation solely to benefit Tad Cummins. This is not a fairy tale. This is a case of kidnapping.” After the pair vanished, they were spotted only once, when TBI officials confirmed a sighting of them on security footage from a Walmart in Oklahoma City. The two were missing for 38 days before finally being located in Siskiyou County, a remote area of Northern California. Cummins was immediately arrested at the scene.  Cummins could face additional charges of statutory rape and prosecutors sought to obtain recordings between him and his soon-to-be ex wife, Jill. She filed for divorce from Cummins shortly after he disappeared. Read: Everything We Know About Elizabeth Thomas And Tad Cummins “I asked, ‘Well, did you sleep with her?’ and he said, ‘Yes I did,’ and I didn’t want any details,” Jill told Inside Edition of a conversation she had with her husband while he was at a federal detention center in California. Jill said she planned to have no relationship with her husband and was conspicuously absent from his first appearance in court. One of his daughters, however, said the past month’s events had not changed her opinion of her father. “He was the definition of what a good father should be and still is,” Ashley Cummins, 26, told Inside Edition. “I believe that. He needs to at least know that everybody’s not against him.” Cummins faces both federal and state charges and could receive life in prison if convicted. A date for his trial hasn't been set.

If you’re looking out for a decent monitor, beefy power supply, or spacious solid-state drive, be sure to jump on these offers before they expire or sell out. Big ticket items such as the GTX 1070 video card from Gigabyte and a 144Hz monitor from Acer can also be snagged at a discount. If you’ve found any other great deals we missed, please let us know in the comments below; sharing is caring! Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1070 – $369.99 From Newegg The GTX 1070 is a terrific mid-high range graphics card capable of handling modern games with maximum quality settings at 1440p. It’s even powerful enough to do 4K in some games while pumping out playable frame rates. This particular model from Gigabyte has a dual fan cooler and an overclocking mode that’ll boost the core clock to 1771 MHz. ADATA Ultimate SU800 512GB SSD (3D NAND SATA III) – $135.30 (promo code: EMCRFBD32) From Newegg Prices for solid-state drives continue to fluctuate, but this 512GB model from ADATA is one of the better deals right now, especially for the amount of storage.

Cooler Master Hyper 212 LED CPU Cooler – $19.99 From Newegg Cooler Master’s Hyper 212 CPU coolers are regarded as some the best air coolers for the price. This particular model is equipped with a red LED fan, but still sports the design and efficiency of other Hyper 212 coolers.

EVGA SuperNOVA 850 Watt Modular Power Supply, 80 Plus Gold – $93.55 From Walmart The SuperNOVA from EVGA provides plenty of juice for most systems with its 850 watts and 80 Plus Gold certification.

Don’t forget to use the promo code to get it for this price. Logitech G602 Wireless Mouse – $39.99 From Best Buy The G602 wireless mouse from Logitech seems to be on sale quite often, but that doesn’t mean it’s still not a great deal for this price.

It also has extensive battery life with several power modes.

Eli Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators calling for them to reject education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos, calling her “unprepared and unqualified.” (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) Posted: Saturday, May 13, 2017 6:04 am Handful of rich school-choice donors spend big in California Associated Press | 0 comments SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Much of the funding for California's pro-school choice groups and candidates comes from a handful of very wealthy donors, including the founders of Netflix and The Gap and children of Wal-Mart creator Sam Walton. An Associated Press analysis of top donors to school-choice ballot measure campaigns around the country found 48 individuals and couples provided most of the reported contributions to those initiatives since 2000. Some of those top donors are major backers of pro-school choice candidates in California. In the past, California teachers unions have spent big to defeat high-profile school choice candidates. Last year, several state legislative candidates backed by school choice advocates beat union-backed candidates. Looking ahead to 2018, some of the most active school choice donors are already contributing to pro-charter candidates for governor and state schools chief. The California Teachers Association and its allies defeated a 2000 ballot measure backed by venture capitalist and former state board of education member Timothy Draper to launch a school voucher program in California. Draper contributed $23 million to the effort — the most one person has ever contributed to a single school choice measure. But teachers unions spent even more in opposition. Draper said he became dissatisfied with the public school his kids attended, where he said school boards, teachers unions and textbook makers were looking out for themselves rather than children. He put his kids in private school instead. "I realized that's not fair," Draper said in an interview. "I get to yank them out, and no one else does." Vouchers could allow other schools to break up the traditional public schools' "monopoly," he said. Since 2000, Draper has not been a major player in school-choice politics — partly because of the high cost of his ballot-box failure. Three years ago, Draper put his own money into an unrelated measure to divide California into six separate states. That one didn't make the ballot. Although his vouchers initiative failed, Draper says his efforts helped pave the way for the charters in California. Charter schools are publicly funded but typically run independently of the traditional public school system. Studies on how effective they are compared with traditional public schools have found mixed results. Since the failed ballot measure campaign, other wealthy California families and individuals have spent millions to support groups that contribute to pro-school choice candidates in state races. Netflix founder Reed Hastings has donated more than $5.8 million to a California Charter Schools Association political committee during the past two election cycles. Donald and Doris Fisher, the founders of clothing retailer The Gap, have donated more than $6 million to groups like California Charter Schools Association Advocates and EdVoice, an advocacy group that supports charter schools. Donald Fisher died in 2009. Eli Broad, founder of SunAmerica and KB Home, also has donated millions to those groups. Hastings, Broad and Doris Fisher all live in California. Jim Carr Walton and Alice Walton, children of the Wal-Mart founder, have contributed millions to California organizations that advocate for school choice. The siblings, who are based in Arkansas and Texas, respectively, each gave $1.4 million to EdVoice last election cycle. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has contributed at least $2 million to pro-school choice groups and candidates in California since 2013. Most of that money has gone to California Charter Schools Association committees. Pro-charter school groups and their allies spent millions on the 2014 campaign to elect Marshall Tuck, a former Los Angeles schools executive who advocated education reform, to head the state's public schools. Tuck lost to California Teachers Association-backed Tom Torlakson. Pro-school choice groups EdVoice and the California Charter Schools Association Advocates spent more than $3.4 million on the Democrat-on-Democrat race in California's 14th Assembly District in the San Francisco Bay Area to support Tim Grayson and oppose Mae Torlakson. The CTA backed Mae Torlakson, Tom Torlakson's wife, spending nearly $1 million in the race. Grayson won. EdVoice also outspent the California Federation of Teachers backing Bill Dodd over Mariko Yamada in California's 3rd Senate District north of San Francisco. Dodd prevailed in the Democrat-on-Democrat race. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, an advocate for charter schools, has already started to see money from prominent school choice donors pour into his 2018 campaign for governor. Hastings has donated $36,400. Broad, who contributed to three of Villaraigosa's past mayoral campaigns, has contributed $112,400 to the 2018 gubernatorial bid along with his wife, Edythe Broad. They've also contributed $29,200 to Tuck's campaign to run again for public schools chief in 2018. ___ Associated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, N.J. , contributed to this report.

Industry’s future looks bleak MERIDEN, CT - MARCH 28: An empty storefront stands in the Westfield Meriden shopping mall on March 28, 2017 in Meriden, Connecticut. As consumers buying habits change and more people prefer to spend money on technology and experiences like vacations over apparel, shopping malls across the country are suffering.In the last decade dozens of malls have closed as retailers like JCPenney, Macy's and Sears, known as 'anchor stores,' close hundreds of locations do to falling sales. Real estate firm CoStar are projecting that nearly 25% of American malls are in danger of losing their anchors stores. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) NEW YORK, NY – America’s long-standing love affair with shopping at malls and department stores may be nearing an end. “The traditional mall as we know it is doomed,” said according to Greg Portell, a retail consultant at A.T. Kearney. “When was the last time a mall closed that people missed, other than people the people who worked there?” And retail workers are taking a huge hit. Between 2001 and 2016, jobs at traditional department stores fell 46%, according to Labor Department data. That’s a much steeper drop than other troubled industries. For example, coal mining jobs dropped 32% during the same 15 years. Factory employment fell 25%. About 60% of department store employees are female, compared to 47% of workers overall. Minorities, the elderly and teenagers are also far more likely to find jobs in department and discount stores than they are elsewhere. Teenagers hold 8% of department store jobs, compared to 3% of jobs overall. “For the young, it’s a rite of passage in learning how to work, how to deal with customers,” said Amanda Nicholson, professor of retail practice at Syracuse University. Some 3,300 store closings have been announced so far this year, according to Fung Global Retail & Technology, a retail think tank. That’s double the number in the same period in 2016. This year will likely see the largest number of store closings since the Great Recession, according to Portell. Further proof of the struggle stores face emerged this week. A raft of retail icons posted disappointing financial results: Macy’s, JCPenney, Kohls, Dillards and Nordstrom. Each of them told the same grim tale about losing sales and market share as Americans shop elsewhere. The trouble isn’t likely to end any time soon. Competition from online rivals like Amazon is continuing to intensify, and chains such as Walmart and Target are investing more money in online shopping, rather than in traditional stores. Americans are spending more money than ever shopping, according to government figures. But every retailer that reported financial results this week said that sales at stores open at least a year had declined from a year earlier. Some chains are struggling just to survive. Abercrombie & Fitch announced this week that it is looking for a buyer for the company. And the CEO of Sears Holdings, which owns the Sears and Kmart brands, told investors that vendors are treating the company “like a pariah” since it warned investors earlier this year it may not be able to stay in business. Sears Holdings warned investors in March that it can no longer promise it will remain in business. It is not in bankruptcy, but it has posted losses of more than $10 billion since 2010, and debt has soared while the value of its stock has tumbled. “There are some chains that are already obsolete and hanging on by a thread,” said Marshall Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD Group.

A federal judge ruled Friday that Cummins was to be held until his trial on the grounds that he was a flight risk and a danger to the community. U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes cited Cummins’ abuse of his position of authority and his past attempts to evade police in issuing the decision. “Here, the evidence of danger is substantial,” she said.

Police immediately suspected Cummins, a former teacher at Culleoka Unit School in Maury County, who was being investigated by school officials and local police for having an inappropriate relationship with Elizabeth. Surveillance footage caught Cummins filling up his car at a gas station near the restaurant.  Investigators at the time were quick to caution that this could not be a consensual, romantic relationship. Tad Cummins, 50, a former Tennessee high school teacher accused of abducting a 15-year-old student in March, seen in this booking photo after his arrest by Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Department’s Special Response Team in the Cecilville area of Siskiyou County, California, Apr. 20, 2017. Photo: Reuters “She is 15, a child. He is 50, a grown man,” Tennessee Bureau of Investigation director Mark Gwynn told reporters shortly after the two went missing. “She’s a high school freshman. He’s a former teacher. This is, and was, not a romance. This was manipulation solely to benefit Tad Cummins. This is not a fairy tale. This is a case of kidnapping.” After the pair vanished, they were spotted only once, when TBI officials confirmed a sighting of them on security footage from a Walmart in Oklahoma City. The two were missing for 38 days before finally being located in Siskiyou County, a remote area of Northern California. Cummins was immediately arrested at the scene.  Cummins could face additional charges of statutory rape and prosecutors sought to obtain recordings between him and his soon-to-be ex wife, Jill. She filed for divorce from Cummins shortly after he disappeared.

Jill said she planned to have no relationship with her husband and was conspicuously absent from his first appearance in court. One of his daughters, however, said the past month’s events had not changed her opinion of her father. “He was the definition of what a good father should be and still is,” Ashley Cummins, 26, told Inside Edition. “I believe that. He needs to at least know that everybody’s not against him.” Cummins faces both federal and state charges and could receive life in prison if convicted. A date for his trial hasn't been set.

We long for Lovullo. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. Great shot welcome Max southern new England sports Saturday and WEEI Scott critic she Jason terra bella knew 4017371287. Is the phone number were talking. Celtics wizards to gain six goes to Washington by a point 9291. There will be a game seven at the TD garden in Boston on Monday night. And we threw the Red Sox on the table as well before we went to break you can also attacked us 37937. And we do have a Texan a 401. I agree on a percentage Farrell has to go but who's the guy they can bring in and I that. That's an interesting question because I have always been a guy. That is said. You don't fire for the sake of firing you know fire if you think you have something better waiting. And I don't know who that would be quite honestly our in house Gary geese are seen as he's the bench coach there and and always and managerial experience in the Red Sox farm system that all on the docket. On I guess he would be the guy and an interim basis I don't know the go outside the organization most teams would just you know. And AM house at this point so that guys like editorial move along a member in the offseason they say about that going anywhere and then a week later. He's off to mood to be digit lead to be a manager fur note made early on in camp Pryor's own I was doing pretty well right now and you know a lot of people credit in the Gould's last year with yeah. How he handled in communicate with the young players on the roster. And you know there was something adjusting this week there was a jar Kravis who works for bar stool covers baseball does a podcasts and had dodge driver Sean yeah and was credit dancing around the question but did a good way of about asking. Was there your interaction with Farrell was very issues that you had. Being a younger player on the team as far as knowing your role in knowing when you're gonna play. And he's basically said yes and then asked follow follow up question if there was this was the only. You know interaction or issued that young players had in the steam in and show us said now there are others you know so inconsistency to I talked to. I now and end. I know to believe me Lou Lou gets so mad with Ferrell but I think this has. Sometimes I go lose a little over the top when it comes to baseball agent so passionate about and they'll get data meaning the guys a former Major League Baseball player but. I agree with a on this I deeply Farrell's inconsistency. With the which he handles his team his pitching staff. It in the way he manages in general is maddening I totally agree with the one that totally agree with. Well how about this with a catcher situation and you announce that you're the catching schedule you know after Cindy alone has two home runs at three home runs over the weekend and you go to Vasquez right. Leave the guy who's hitting well in the lineup David are you having trouble scoring runs to begin with. You're having trouble hitting home runs you having trouble driving driving the ball fraction base hits beat the guy in this hitting well insidious stupid schedule. Which he should stay 88 by the numbers may. Your may now you have to believe order will be restored today because Chris Celtics and yes and also you know you got to figure them on a win today by the way they remove that gave up to 1 o'clock as the Los Sox have as well or trying to avoid the bad weather that's that's bearing down on on New England we're getting a nor'easter coming in the form of a lot of rain starting late this afternoon running through tonight and they tomorrow so. The Red Sox in the loss Sox have moved their games up to 1 o'clock you know the worry about. Anything a sales pitch and I game's gonna be over 130 I mean his last two games got an average two hours and fifteen minutes I'm now watching my dad. In loved an hour and a half into the game you're in the seventh inning and I'm like. Really just gets it and throws it a tent you know every pitcher should work that way there there is something to be said for that in this is the old timers that have multiples ID card in multiple old. All time pitcher old pitchers have said this the pitchers are the ones that control the pace of the absolute and are it's your hater. Are you gonna be more comfortable with the guys continually just thrown darts at even. Even if he's not give he's missing his pitches are you gonna be more opt outs if he's just not give you the time to breathe and think are you gonna be more comfortable. If you that you you're you're sitting there in the pitch distractions companies looking in the knees buckled to his signs. In these gas in the go to the size and he steps off. Where you're gonna be more cock markov to what the guy just continues to not waive off the catcher and throw his pitches no matter who it is and I just have always felt that way that the pitcher's control the pace of the game and it's proven. Yet Chris Hill has fantastic stuff. But that doesn't mean that other pitchers can't try to replicate that and pitch quicker. I think there's too much stinking when it comes to stuff like that as far as a pitcher's mentality out there on the mound and they think that they have to over think. The hitter played this game of chess within the app that what we tight oil. In a couple weeks ago about daddy got an aunt because eyebrow at the pace of play and he he said that pretty much the you know well you know you think about the next pitch in you know I think about what they do is gave them and setting them up for this and that and so he has no problem with the pace appoint you as an addition via clock on its so to speak right but to me. Op I I feel like Chris Hill is a perfect example of ansari pitchers don't need to take all the time that they do to be great or to be effective and he is just exhibiting that. He's so good is so I got he he is. I opt out thought lot of by some estimates on Jackie is the closest thing with I had to Pedro since Pedro. He's he's way better than Jon Lester ever was I'm sorry Jon Lester was rock solid and he was a playoff start for the Red Sox a gag given that I'd give him his due. But don't even compared to two as far as the stuff they have and how dominant they are there there are number one pitchers. In rotations and there are aces he's mace yes OK they are very few races out there he is in ace okay. He's better than Josh Beckett in my opinion all right. I don't I don't even think it's why that's that's up this deck it was awesome in his first and only once did you know he was durable. Further than for a lot of the time he was here the last portion of his career it was not well was that did not go well but it's he was so good in the playoffs. I still think he's the best Red Sox pitcher and a debt that he has the best stocks. Of any pitcher since Pedro in a Red Sox uniform for me I think I'd better than Muster better than Beckett in name near. Alleged ace this guy's an ace those guys are number one pitchers and rotation okay. Maybe Beckett you know at a for a time was an ace but he you know he dropped off obviously to the latter stages of the Red Sox career. This guy is a true ace a true you know what in all the respected dear price. They brought Amanda B Nace not even close up they are not even a number one of the rotation when a disaster he's been but. They they made that wrong right by bringing this guy and you can whine all you want but not having you on Mon cada. That trade was worth every single. Amy. No question I don't really get big guy I like those guys are few and far between. And I'm glad you bring that up Scott because I love sale and what 73 show right out eleven walks that's what you give up for player like that. Among cotta 48 Chris Sale that's what you give up. I wanna I wanna talk just quickly vote about the blame in some of the issues that this team is that. In the bullpen specifically in some the acquisitions and and I do agree with you and I think it's been. Well established how both you and I feel about Farrell vote when you look at some of the issues at this team is having. I don't think enough has been heaped on on the shoulders of Dave Dombrowski. Because. Let's be honest you were me could go out and signed David Price you were knee could take our best prospect from the farm system and trade for Chris Sale. Outside of those deals the deals that he has made acquiring Thornburg has not worked out at all because the guy can't stay out the acquiring Carson Smith. Has not worked out at all the guy can't say helping you don't know when he's going to be back you hope he's gonna do Iraqis going to be throwing. Supposed to be throwing bullpen sessions this weekend and the docket we don't know if he's going to be able to do that you don't know if there's going to be setbacks there. On the Campbell trade I above Kimbrel I do I still think he gave up a lot form. But he's been dominant central Asian I know it's hard to hard to you know I don't know crack on from that an album let me just sassy is isn't it. Closes are curve up and down to begin with unless you have a guy like Chapman in in like maybe cables get into that category. But I just I've always felt that there. You don't give up a lot for closers because you know sometimes they come from out of nowhere like in Drew Miller who had no no. Really didn't have a role until he found himself as an eighth or ninth inning guy in a guy like Wade Davis it was a starting pitcher and then he turns into great clothes. I just feel like I I like Pembroke. I'm not I'm not crap and on that DO I digesting gave up a lot and I think he gave up way too much for Thornburgh in the way too much for Campbell and you look at. A dropout rates that you promise is a prime example. You just don't give up the best pitching prospect camp or a guy that at the end of the day I don't care what his numbers are. Last year in the end the year before in Colorado ends in San Diego when he came to that when he was at all stock you don't I'll be best pitching prospect and I just think that. As much as we don't like Farrell I think it's. A little bit more for. Need to be put on the shoulders of broad Dombrowski. You know he he he did the farm system is. I think it's 42 in baseball now after what he's given away in you know that they had they had a lot there you go to a man Wal-Mart grows going. For San Diego now in. That there's just a lot that makes you scratch your head in wonder does he really evaluate these deals or is he just saying. They which guy do you want it take this guy OK no problem we want this guy take whatever you got picked elf from any of the guys except for Markota. You know. You know is that the armor once did the Palmer and steel makes you forces had a chance to undo it after the injury. Stuff surrender that to me was that you when they decided to. Still stick to that after that they had a chance to get out from under and they didn't. You know you mentioned the farm system in and listen. Always said prospects are just at the prospect is no guarantee you know and how good they are in the minors at the gonna turn out to be Major League stars which is why I would do that Chris Sale deal. Ten times over at a site has to do it again and and I love my god he was my favorite. Minor leaguer in the Red Sox farm system loved the guy could away from you get to Boston in the irregular part of the Red Sox but you know what. I'm okay with the trade because sale is an absolute stud the other thing is to you gotta look their farm system is is good because. And intend he's in the majors now and then some of the other guys that were part of a strong system whether B Bogart's or answer Bradley whatever. They are now part of the majors as well with it the biggest problem this team is okay in the line again. Go back deferral will work its well established we're not big fans of as a legacy changed here with that said. This offense needs to produce more consistently that they need to do a better job at the plate they're just doing consistent I did they really and the question is. Are they capable of it I believe the answer is yes they are capable of producing and a higher level and more consistently than they are. Maybe they're not. May be theme miss David Ortiz his bat and his presence in the middle of that lineup more than we ever knew. And if that is the case and that is in this is the result the trickle down effect of not having big poppies that. In the cleanup spot. And that's where Dave Dombrowski can be criticized he should've foreseeing this comment. We can't afford to lose a big stick like dad and not replace him would something similar. So that's where maybe. He gets to criticism. You know what I mean yeah not replacing a presence like dat in the lineup which made everybody else around him better. Well look at look at the Thornburgh DO and they gave a Travers Shaw and I don't think they needed to give up Travis sharp in that regard and navy. They were relying way too much on policy and welcome back to be reliable they work in not having a back up plan for third base at that. Grew up in their face and nobody you know everybody was hopeful about C involved and everybody there was a lot of people including myself that just had my doubts like okay profit in the regular season. I tell these guys Goodyear I said after last year the criticism you know lose in the way miss and all season. Lot to prove I really thought he'd have a real good solid year this year it could easily be wrong again like he thought he would end in and I was can I was hopefully was but I said let's see what he does in the in the in the regular season this nice that you lost weight. Any given credit for. Try to prove people that hey I was out of shape I need to get back into shape and I need to prove to people that I'm a better player than night. That I have been over the past two years for the Red Sox but it will open their face. He's our we have no idea when he's gonna come back. And you could use a guy like shot. And I just personally I don't think you needed to give up driver shot to get what you got and pilot barber getting need to give up and now and prospects to get a eighth inning guy so. A text to brings up real good point when you talk about how the Red Sox farm system has fallen from grace in you talk about all the moves to browse keys made. Hop more than that as do this text from the for a one points out. You'll also have to factor in that a lot of their top prospects have been exposed as frauds C Henry Owens or a Devin or arrow etc. That's a good point. Like Henry Owens for all is a great stuff he did the dude can't throw strikes consistently. I maddening watching him pitch I don't wanna see him pitch again but yeah I would only counter that with that's it doesn't matter. To me. What. Does like I get Ted Owens always has been exposed for forty years but the general managers throughout baseball still have a thought process than what those guys can possibly be what the upside it is. Yet always has been exposed to some of those other guys. That they got rid of in in some of the other trades at Dombrowski is made. Still hold value higher than may be what we think they have two other general managers because they see more upside and and the navy Dombrowski doesn't they see more value in having a pipeline of prospects than Dave Dombrowski has you look at his history when he was at Florida when he goes to Detroit. And when he has come here. There has been the it is beneath theme of him being you know going through the farm system in trading away for pitchers and not all the guys he traded away. Have bought up in his face and in in fact a lot of them have upload opens face. But it's still it's you know that's where some of the depth that you constant you know I. I you know the Travis show one is really the biggest one that frustrates me because. I don't think he needed to be in that deal and you needed some depth from third base I mean you just again. You just relied way too much as sin of all to be able the in their day in and day out in not have a backup plan not have a suitable backup in form 4017371287. The phone number text line is 379837. Will take a quick time out when we continue with southern new England sports Saturday on WEEI that he's at Torrey who remember in the offseason it's about that on January that weekly.

A judge now ruled that tad Cummins will Tay in jail until the trial. That word coming during a hearing which included information on a note that he allegedly wrote to his wife. ABC's Eva pilgrim is here with the story this morning. Hi, Eva. Reporter: Good morning, tad Cummins knew about the national search for him and Elizabeth Thomas telling investigators he bought an iPad so he could follow the news. This morning we're learning more about what Cummins told authorities happened on the almost 40 days he was on the run. A federal judge has ruled tad Cummins, the former Tennessee teacher accused of taking his 15-year-old former student, will remain behind bars. No, we did not think he was a flight risk. Reporter: The court ruling he's both a flight risk and danger to the community. Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas missing for 38 days crossing the country. An FBI agent taking the stand to testify about alleged details of their journey. Investigators have said that he left you a note. He did. Reporter: This note submitted in court as written by tad Cummins for his wife writing, I'll be back. Don't call police. They'll think I ran because I'm guilty and I'm not. I love you. Authorities say Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas left Columbia, Tennessee, and went south to Decatur, Alabama, stopping there to throw their phones into the Tennessee river. Cummins then disabled the gchs on his SUV. Authorities say the pair continued on to Mississippi then northwest to Oklahoma where they were caught on this Walmart security camera. Staying in super 8 motels like this one before going on to Colorado, Utah, Nevada and eventually southern California. Investigators say Cummins spent $1500 on a two-person kayak in San Diego with the idea that they would use that kayak to get to Mexico. Easy to take a boat from here into Mexico. It would be more like a movie stunt. That's not for real life. Reporter: They abandoned the plan and ending up in this cabin where a good samaritan recognized them and called police. Now, we don't know too much about what Elizabeth says happened while the two were missing. We do know that Cummins made a recording telling Elizabeth to tell the truth. A recording that investigators played for her before they began questioning. Yeah, this story never gets less disturbing at all. There's just more stuff every time. You say at least ten years in prison. At least. At least ten years in prison for the taking her across state lines charges. Alone. Eva, thank you.

Opinion Last Word Last Word on the school budget, May 13 School budget So there are now being created two new assistant superintendents for the school division. Are you for real? That's a great way to close a funding gap, make more top-heavy positions that pay big bucks! What a waste of money! Editor's note: One of the deputy superintendents replaces Dr. Herron; the other was created by moving other openings around. How ironic: front page talks about budget funding gap for schools and page 2 announces two new administrative appointments for the school division. In a very top heavy school division, I can think of one easy savings measure! Also if Superintendent Herron wants to have "more contact between central office and the individual schools," then a list of who works in Central Office, their position and phone numbers should be available. Such a listing disappeared several years ago, so that nobody would know how many people work in Central Office. The WJCC schools need to stop thinking that JCC and Williamsburg residents can continue to fund all their wish list items and continually ask for more money when it comes to budget time each year. They already receive over 50 percent of the current JCC budget. Hold lawmakers accountable and get those state and federal dollars pumped in. If federal government can issue a multimillion dollar grant to expand Longhill Road, surely the schools can get a few million! Black lives matter It's interesting that the slogan, "Save the Whale," does not lead to the response, "All Aquatic Life Matters;" that "Fight Breast Cancer" does not produce "All Cancers Matter;" or even that "Protect the Second Amendment," does not elicit a cry of "All the Amendments Matter." In each case, folks articulating positions are saying that they believe something that they value is under assault and that they wish to rally others to their cause. Black Lives Matter is expressing the view that black lives in the United States are under assault (still) and trying to rally people to their cause. As for "All Lives Matter," imagine how you might feel if you were to lose a family member and, in your moment of grief, you were admonished with the statement, all lives matter. Black Lives Matter is simply a very necessary reminder that all lives needs to encompass black lives, too. I hope this helps. Photos in Williamsburg submitted by readers.

I live in this area, and it's bad enough with the Camp Peary noise. We don't need any more rifle or any other kind of noise along with it. The call for a rifle range in the Williamsburg area is a good one, but the proposed piece of property at the Lightfoot exit on Fenton Mill is not big enough to do anything other than a paintball range. To have a safe rifle range, you need to have at least a down range area of a mile and a quarter with no one living in it to safely be able to shoot anything bigger than a 22-caliber varmint rifle. Recommended I have just had interior painting done by Jeff Branscome. Because of the architecture, this involved 25 foot tall walls. Jeff's work was very professional with a special attention to details. I would strongly recommend his services to anyone else looking to have painting done. He's at 757-332-2388. It's not too early to begin preparations for next year's tax season and QuickBooks can be a lifesaver – especially when you have someone like Patricia Bruinsma of P&L Management Services to guide you. Patricia makes this typically painful process easier to endure by meeting with you and providing instruction at your house or by working with you remotely from her office to your home. Consider QuickBooks, Patricia of P&L Management Services, and remote instruction. It can make a major difference in your life – I know it did for me! For all you koi pond enthusiasts, check out Coleman's Farmers Market on Ironbound Road. The guys are very knowledgeable, and carry pond plants with the best prices I've found in Hampton Roads. Want someone nice to care for your lawn and plants? Call Felix Martina, 804-994-7263. You will be pleased. Christopher Wren To the person talking about classes at Christopher Wren and having them recorded or, you know, being able to watch them on video: I think that's terrific. I would love doing that. There's just so many of the classes that seem so interesting, but for one reason or another, I can't take these classes, just because of conflict with other things. I'm just not doing well myself, being able to get out on that particular day. But I would definitely be willing to pay for the classes and to be able to get the classes on video. Terrific idea! I hope someone goes forth with it. Great! Thanks. Christopher Wren classes on video or on the internet, suggested in Last Word, is an excellent idea. Long overdue. I would sign up immediately and pay well for the privilege. School buses Kudos to Newport News Public School officials in buying 24 new propane buses. They are saving fuel costs as it is cheaper than diesel at 88 cents a gallon, thanks to a 36-cent rebate through a federal program. In maintenance, oil changes are also cheaper--diesel buses take 17 quarts of oil, while propane buses need just seven. The fuel systems emit up to 24 percent fewer greenhouse gases. The buses run quieter and warm up more quickly in cold weather. Estimated annual savings to operate a propane bus is over $1,100. How about it, Williamsburg-James City-York school officials? It is your move now. Traffic woes What is the Highway Department thinking of when they allow people to turn left on a flashing yellow light? A car and I are coming down Monticello Avenue side by side and a young girl coming in the opposite direction zipped right in front of us, turning left and going into the shopping center and both of us darn near t-boned her. It's bad enough, with everybody turning on red without stopping. Now, they're turning left on yellow flashing lights. The highways are crazy! Looking good A shout out to the folks in Walnut Hills—the area is looking great as neighborhood pride is evident in all of the yard clean-ups! Colonial Williamsburg Headed down for a cocktail out on the new terrace at the Williamsburg Inn last evening – what a lovely setting. You won't be disappointed in the beautiful transformation. The staff is energetic and happy to accommodate. A winner! I don't mean to be disrespectful to John Millar, concerning his article in the Gazette about Market Square, but I doubt if Colonial Williamsburg will ever entertain the thought of rebuilding this building or correcting errors that might have been made in Shield's Tavern years ago. They have so many issues right now with the economy and other factors involving fewer visitors. Thank you My sincere gratitude to the person who turned in my cell phone in the Walmart on Rochambeau Drive on Saturday. Your honesty is greatly appreciated. Cats and birds I'm calling about the complaints about the cats that are attacking birds. Why don't they praise the cats for catching moles and field mice? That they are a lot more dangerous than the bird or two that they are missing. Thank you. Comey's firing It's obvious from the White House's firing of FBI Director Comey Tuesday that the FBI has either uncovered or is getting real close to uncovering criminal activity between the current administration, his cronies and the Russians. Just did my homework, and in October of last year, Schumer, Pelosi, Reid and Kaine all said Comey ought to be fired for what he did prior to the election with Clinton's emails. Hillary wanted him fired. Like many Americans I am deeply troubled by the firing of Mr. Comey. The rationale coming from the White House changes by the hour. But all signs indicate that he was fired because his investigations into the connections between Trump and the Russians was intensifying. Several members of congress, including our senators have called for independent investigation into the firing, and the Russian connection. But Taylor and Wittman remain silent. Their silence is a clear sign that they have put party above country. How are Americans sitting idly by while Trump trashes our democracy? He fired Comey because he was getting too close to the truth about his connection with the Russians. He met the Russian delegation behind closed doors; let the Russian press in but kept out the US press. Let a Russian photographer int the oval office. Where is the outrage? Where are our representatives?! Oh, that's right, they are busy destroying access to healthcare, and designing tax cuts for the very rich. Sharing the road For the writer who wrote into the Last Word about bicycling along Greensprings Road: As a bicyclist and a driver, I would ask that the drivers respect the bicyclists' right to share the road with motorists and to slow down when you see oncoming traffic so that the lives of the bicyclists are not put in at risk. Thank you. Looking for ... If you are a beginning mah jongg player who knows the basics and have your 2017 card from the National Mah Jongg League, you are welcome to join us Thursday afternoons in May and June from 1-3 p.m. to practice playing in a room provided to us by the Williamsburg Unitarian Universalists at 3051 Ironbound Road. Please call 757-220-9975 (the Williamsburg Learning Tree line) to register so that we have enough mah jongg sets for everyone. Is there is someone in town who buys gold jewelry, coins, and precious and semi-precious stones from pieces? There used to be a wonderful gentleman who would do so and with such integrity and interest; however, he has recently died. I need to replace a retaining wall in my pool area. Is there anyone out there that can do that kind of work? Please leave your name and number in the Last Word and I will get in touch with you. Thanks. I am the interested person looking for kitchen cabinets. Phone 757-869-9568. Is there an organization or school that still collects Betty Crocker points? If so, I have some I would like to donate. Health insurance When the ACA passed and was signed into law, the Republicans ranted about "death panels," which would decide if Americans would live or die because of the ACA. Now that Trumpcare is on the horizon, death panels are a real possibility. For all those so intent on caring about the 20 million who supposedly will lose their health insurance due to the repeal of Obamacare, may I suggest that you find one these people and offer to help pay for their insurance. It's apparent that the only people not complaining about Obamacare are those not directly affected by it. Finally, some Democrat politicians get it. Congressmen Taylor and Wittman understand what it means to compromise, as if they didn't, there would have only been a repeal and not a replacement for Obamacare. Obamacare was nothing more than just another expensive entitlement program paid for by our taxes and worse by hard working people who ended paying higher insurance premiums. President Trump The 100-day marker is absurd when we truly measure the success of any administration by its accomplishments over the long term. That said, the Trump administration has been extremely successful in following through on a fair amount of President Trump's campaign promises: Illegal immigration has already been reduced by half based upon monthly totals; there has been a significant increase in deportations; many of the Trump executive orders addressed campaign promises such as acceleration of environmental reviews for infrastructure projects, regulatory reform, enforcing statutory prohibitions on federal control of education; and more. I have no issue with our president spending his weekends wherever he chooses; we gave Obama the same courtesy just as we have done with every other previous president.

More Arizona woman charged in baby formula tampering by: Bob D Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Updated: May 13, 2017 - 4:19 AM Tucson Police Department via AP Twtter TUCSON, Ariz. - An Arizona woman suspected of tampering with baby formula and returning it for a refund appeared in court Friday, KVOA reported. >> Read more trending news Jennifer LaPlante, 30, was charged with fraudulent schemes and artifices and child endangerment. Tucson police allege that LaPlante bought and stole the formula, filling it with flour and other substances, and returned the tampered product to four Tucson stores. Bond was set at $50,000, KVOA reported. They also allege that LaPlante tampered with Gerber products including Good Soy Formula, but other products also may be affected. Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus said at least one child became ill from the tainted formula. "The child was treated and released from an area hospital last Friday, but obviously we're concerned about this and wanted to get the information out as quickly as possible to avoid any other children from becoming sick," Magnus told KVOA. The stores affected were Fry’s and Walmart in Tucson, police said. Fry spokeswoman Pam Giannonatti said she could not comment on whether or not the two stores involved in the investigation sold returned formula. She said the company is fully co-operating with the investigation.  "Once we were notified, we removed all of those items from all stores in Tucson,” she told KVOA. “All formula that is returned to our stores is immediately stickered with a 'no return' sticker so it is not resold.”  Walmart released a statement Friday morning, saying the company was “deeply disturbed.” “Our customers deserve safe, quality foods, and we have policies in place to help ensure that returned baby food is not put back on our shelves,” spokesman Kim Aday said.     © 2017 Cox Media Group.

Updated: May 14, 2017 @ 12:54 am Full Forecast top right promo - flex2 Home News Local News Close Zeigler CEDA: The jobs are there, but the housing isn't Brian Todd, btodd@postbulletin.com Brian Todd Regional Reporter May 12, 2017 Updated May 12, 2017 (…) Zeigler DODGE CENTER — While Ron Zeigler was touting the success of another year at Community and Economic Development Associates, he also talked about how the anticipated growth of the region presents some big challenges. "Workforce and housing kind of go hand-in-hand," said Zeigler, president and CEO of CEDA, the economic development corporation that works on behalf of many of the small towns in Southeast Minnesota, While construction might be booming in Rochester, smaller cities have yet to see an increase in housing construction. Finding affordable housing for a growing workforce will be a major focus for cities, counties and groups that assist them, like CEDA. "These smaller communities are trying to draw people," Zeigler said. "You need housing for the people, but you need people ready (to rent or buy) to build the housing. What comes first, the housing or the people." Randal Hemmerlin, executive director of the Red Wing Housing Redevelopment Authority, said the lack of market-rate housing is due to a variety of reasons. The housing downturn in 2008 ground building to a halt and had the added impact of driving many developers and construction companies out of business. "We lost the infrastructure for building," he said. In fact, the city has just started adding affordable housing. "We just built our first market-rate apartment building in 25 years," he said, referring to the 60-unit apartment building going up near the city's Walmart. Still, that is just a drop in the bucket of need for Red Wing. It's an issue that extends across the region, said Gary Gooder, president of manufacturing company Alum-Line in Cresco, Iowa. Gooder, a member of the CEDA board of directors — CEDA also serves communities in western Wisconsin and northern Iowa — said the housing issues being faced in Southeast Minnesota are the same as those in his community. "We only have about 20 percent of our employees living locally," he said. "The biggest missing elements are apartments for young people and transitional housing for older people." The latter, he said, isn't assisted living but a downsized dwelling that allows empty-nesters to move out of their four-bedroom, three-bath house and open that space for a middle-age family that's still stuck in a starter home. Like most communities, Gooder said Cresco has completed several housing studies since 2000, and the results are always the same. "We need about 40 transitional units for older people, and 40 affordable apartment units," he said. "I'd tell the developers out there, you're missing a valuable niche in rural communities." Hemmerlin noted how the housing study in Red Wing showed that based on the job market, workers can afford about $1,100 a month in rents for affordable housing. But, he said, with the variety of businesses that anchor Red Wing's economy, he thinks that number should be higher, and a little more in line with what developers have said they would need to make a profit on new construction. "I think people will be able to afford $1,300 rents," he said. "You get a couple living together, they're used to paying these rents. They want good housing." What's your reaction?

Jennifer Laplante was charged with child endangerment, and fraudulent schemes and artifices after she allegedly returned tampered formula to as many as four stores before it went back on the shelf, police said. She allegedly did this with Gerber “Good Start” Soy formula. The case stretches back to May 5, when Tucson police officers responded to a baby that had “possibly ingested contaminated formula.” Police learned that the baby didn’t have any life-threatening injuries and possibly became sick because of a formula product that was purchased at a Fry’s Food and Drug store.

Six days after police attended the baby, the store provided information about a possible female suspect. Laplante was detained that day. The suspect did this at four stores, according to detectives. They may include two Fry’s and two Walmart locations, and possibly other stores, police added. READ MORE: Vancouver police seize $50,000 of stolen baby formula intended for black market Laplante may be facing further charges; detectives are still looking into any returns she may have made. In the meantime, anyone who recently bought formula from a Tucson business is being warned to “examine the product carefully.” “If there is anything unusual about the seal — or lack of a seal; if the product looks or has an odd smell in any way — DO NOT USE the product and notify our department,” police said. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

The store cards promise deep discounts on clothing, furniture and electronics, and are tough for shoppers to resist. For some retailers, those credit cards are not just a sales tool, but also an essential way to bolster their struggling businesses — a trend that has worrisome implications for the industry and its customers. The store cards, with interest rates that are often twice those of the average credit card, are a rich profit source for retailers at a time when many stores are losing the battle for sales to Amazon and other e-commerce rivals. The profit on plastic helps obscure the true extent of the industry’s pain, a major pressure point for a piece of the economy that employs 1 in 10 Americans. Weak consumer spending, digital competition and changing shopping habits have already roiled retailers. In recent months, the industry has shed tens of thousands of workers. Latest business videos But the businesses may be in worse shape than they appear, since store cards are a shaky foundation. If more consumers fall behind on their payments, the profits could dry up, intensifying retailers’ troubles. The reliance on profits from store cards is stark at some retailers. At Macy’s, the money from branded credit cards accounted for 39 percent of the company’s total profit of $1.9 billion last year, up from 26 percent in 2013, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley. Bloomingdale’s, which is owned by Macy’s, has pushed to increase the number of credit card customers that workers are expected to sign up each month, according to the store workers’ union. At Kohl’s, the profit from plastic totaled 35 percent, up from 23 percent, over that same period. At Target, it made up 13 percent of total earnings, up from 11 percent in 2013. Amazon, by comparison, derives only about 3 percent of its total income from its credit cards. The cracks are starting to show. As signs of customer distress rise, one major lender, Synchrony Financial, which handles the credit cards for Sam’s Club, Gap, Toys R Us and others, is setting aside more money for bad loans. “Investors may not appreciate the magnitude of the retailers’ stress” because of income from store cards, said Kimberly Greenberger, a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley. Shoppers have been using store credit ever since the early 1900s, when department stores issued “charge plates” — small metal cards embossed with the customer’s name and address that were often kept behind the counter. Today, it is virtually impossible to go into a store without getting an offer. J. Crew offers those who sign up 15 percent off their first purchase, while Home Depot offers one year of “hassle-free” returns for card holders. A Macy’s card offers savings of up to $100 for a two-day shopping spree. At first, the cards can seem appealing to customers with limited budgets, allowing them to finance purchases they might not otherwise be able to afford. But the retailers make much of their money on interest charges, so they are counting on many customers going into debt. “These stores are propping up their failing businesses on the backs of lower-middle-class people,” said Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in New York, whose clients often have rung up thousands of dollars in debt on retail cards. Lillian Esposito of Queens accumulated at least 10 different credit cards, including ones from Toys R Us and Walmart. The mother of two young boys, she used them to buy school supplies and Christmas gifts, taking advantage of store discounts on the cards. But any savings quickly evaporate when borrowers cannot pay their bills right away. As Esposito watched her balances grow every month, she calculated paying $25 on interest for every $100 she spent. And she fell behind on some payments. She has since sworn off big retailers. “Never again,” she said. Synchrony Financial, which issued some of Esposito’s cards, declined to comment on her experience. But spokesman Samuel Wang said the company “takes into account a customer’s ability to pay” and encourages customers in distress to contact the lender. Toys R Us said terms of its cards are similar to others. In some cases, customers end up owing more in interest than the original bill. Many store cards carry rates around 30 percent. “It’s like fool’s gold,” said Bryan Hall, who lives in the Bronx. Hall, 48, charged thousands of dollars on cards from P.C. Richard, Best Buy and Kay Jewelers, for an iPad, a 46-inch television and a ring for a friend who was getting married. He then sold off items he bought to pay his rent and keep his car on the road. He stopped making payments on several cards. Kay Jewelers and Best Buy declined to comment on Hall. P.C. Richard did not respond to requests for comment. The credit cards allow retailers to make money from their vast networks of physical stores, even as sales at those locations fall. To make up the gap, some companies are putting more pressure on their workers to sign up accounts. The payoff for employees is low. Workers at some stores earn as little as $1 for each new account they open, and the discounts that their customers get for signing up for a card cut into the employees’ sales commissions. At Bloomingdale’s, the company’s proposal to increase the credit card enrollment was a sticking point in recent contract negotiations, according to the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. A company spokeswoman, Cheryl Heinonen, said credit card enrollments are only one aspect in employee evaluations, but declined to discuss the confidential negotiations. Heinonen added that the company is comfortable with its store cards, noting that card holders are among Macy’s “most loyal and happiest customers.” Citigroup, which issues the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s cards, declined to comment. Credit card profit could prove a fleeting lifeline for retailers. When customers fall behind or default, the banks are likely to clamp down on extending new cards, meaning that source of income for retailers can quickly evaporate. Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse, said credit card profits are a “temporary subsidy” that the industry could not count on over the long term. The problems are already starting to appear. After enjoying several years of low defaults, Synchrony surprised investors in late April by announcing that it had to put aside a larger cushion for loan losses than many analysts expected. The stock sank 16 percent in one day. Among the company’s struggling borrowers was Jose Luis Garcia, a 75-year-old whose only income is from Social Security. In August, Garcia went into a furniture dealer in Brooklyn planning to buy a box spring for $100 in cash. But after the aggressive sales pitch, he came out with a full bed set, totaling $2,041, including delivery. The purchase was charged to a Synchrony card, which he says he never wanted. Unable to keep up with interest payments of 30 percent, Garcia sought legal assistance from New Economy Project, a nonprofit group that helps low-income New Yorkers. After an inquiry from the New York Times, Synchrony said it looked into the matter and forgave his debt. “They took me for an idiot,” Garcia said.

See Offers Nation & World Posted Yesterday at 7:09 PM Updated May 13 increase font size Indonesian official blows up poachers’ boats to save fisheries Susi Pudjiastuti is honored in Washington for protecting her country's marine ecosystem. By MATTHEW PENNINGTONAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article WASHINGTON — A high school dropout turned seafood entrepreneur is leading Indonesia’s crackdown on illegal fishing, winning plaudits from conservationists and awards as far away as Washington despite her explosive methods. A favorite tactic is seizing foreign fishing vessels and then blowing up the empty boats to send a message to her country’s neighbors. One of hundreds of foreign fishing vessels seized by the Indonesian Navy is destroyed last year off Batam Island, Indonesia. The nation's minister for maritime affairs says such efforts are essential for preserving fisheries. AP Photo/M. Urip, File Susi Pudjiastuti, Indonesia's minister for fisheries and maritime affairs, has won plaudits from American conservationists for ordering her country to seize and destroy foreign fishing vessels in the vast Pacific and Indian ocean waters that the nation claims at its own. AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Susi Pudjiastuti, honored last week in Washington for her ecological work, has led the charge in destroying hundreds of fishing vessels in the past two years as the Indonesian government’s minister for maritime affairs and fisheries. Her efforts have boosted fish stocks and curbed smuggling. Catches of anchovies, king prawns and yellowfin tuna are up, Pudjiastuti said. “What we actually earn also is respect,” Pudjiastuti said in the American capital, where she joined other recipients of the annual Peter Benchley Ocean Awards – named for the author of “Jaws.” She was cited for her efforts in protecting Indonesia’s marine ecosystem, and tackling poachers and organized crime. “They cannot just do anything anymore,” Pudjiastuti added. Whereas 10,000 foreign vessels used to fish in Indonesian waters “like in their own country,” she said the new reality was clear: “Not anymore.” Indonesia’s uncompromising approach has irked neighbors whose boats have been caught up in the dragnet for operating in seas plagued by territorial disputes. The campaign may partly reflect Indonesia’s desire to show it is in control of its vast territory of 17,000 islands. Pudjiastuti, 52, has won popularity at home as the campaign’s leader, defying initial skepticism when she was tapped as minister in 2014. She had no political experience and hadn’t even graduated high school. But she spent three decades as a seafood entrepreneur and knew the business. She also had run her own charter airline, Susi Air, to distribute and export produce. On taking office, she declared a fishing moratorium for foreign vessels that had often operated under Indonesian flags. “The state’s sovereignty has to be upheld,” she declared. And to ram the point home, Indonesian authorities have sunk over 300 foreign vessels. In the most recent mass-destruction in early April, Indonesian authorities destroyed 81 empty ships in a single weekend. Most were from Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand. In March 2016, a large Nigerian-flagged vessel was caught poaching toothfish and, after being evacuated, blown up with great fanfare. Pudjiastuti posed on the beach with navy officials, their fists raised in the air with the smoking boat behind them. “The visuals and press that comes from her tough practices on blowing these ships up has really helped educate the world,” said Sally Yozell, director of the environmental security program at Washington’s Stimson Center think tank, speaking of the global scourge of overfishing. She recognized, however, the regional frictions of the campaign, which included incidents last year of Indonesia firing warning shots and seizing Chinese vessels in waters off its Natuna islands. Pudjiastuti also acknowledged some tensions. She said she briefed ambassadors of neighboring countries, including China, before the crackdown and sought support. “Poaching is not a part of good bilateral relations,” she said Friday at the Stimson Center. Indonesian authorities have another 100 seized fishing vessels waiting to be destroying and they are impounding another dozen or so each week, she said. Few are Chinese fishing vessels, which are bigger, faster and often accompanied by the nation’s coast guard, making it harder to police their activities, she added. The United States and Australia are providing support to Indonesia, including satellite technology to help surveillance of waters. Indonesia hopes for Japanese technical help, too. Indonesia isn’t among the half-dozen governments contesting control of reefs and islands in the South China Sea, an emerging Asian flashpoint. But it has reason to be wary of China’s claims. The so-called nine-dash line that Beijing uses to demarcate its expansive territorial claims extends into Indonesia’s internationally-recognized exclusive economic zone (EEZ) that extends 200 nautical miles off its coast. Pudjiastuti said she is less concerned over the subtleties over Indonesia’s stance than her diplomat colleagues. “For me it’s more clear. Once it’s in my EEZ, that’s my fish,” she said. Her moratorium on foreign fishing vessels ended up playing a pivotal role in The Associated Press’ “Seafood from Slaves” investigation, which in 2015 helped to free more than 2,000 foreign fishermen enslaved in Indonesia. The AP found their seafood was bound for consumers in the U.S. and other countries, tainting the supply chains of major companies and pet food brands including Wal-Mart, Sysco and Kroger, Fancy Feast and Iams. The moratorium grounded fishing boats that normally would have been almost constantly at sea, giving AP reporters the opportunity to first speak to enslaved fishermen on the remote Indonesian island of Benjina. Once the story was published, Pudjiastuti quickly dispatched a task force to Benjina, rescuing hundreds of abused workers mostly from Myanmar and Cambodia. In a moderate Muslim-majority country, Pudjiastuti has defied conventional gender roles. She’s divorced, smokes and has a tattoo. She even inspired a character in one of Japan’s most reputed comic books, “Golgo 13.” In one strip, a woman in a beret and sunglasses had an unmistakable resemblance to Pudjiastuti. She was depicted overseeing the destruction of fishing boats, blown asunder with a “BOOM.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Louis B. Ruediger | Tribune-Review A state police car is sits along Learn Road in Bell Township on Wednesday April 26, 2017 in front of the field where a new state police station is to be built. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Updated 6 hours ago Two local government organizations appear divided over Gov. Tom Wolf's proposal to impose a $25-per-person fee on municipalities that rely solely on state police for protection. Elam Herr, assistant executive director of the Pennsylvania State Association of Township Supervisors, said his members are wary of the fee because they fear it will eventually increase. “Although it's been stated that it's $25 and it's ‘reasonable,' ” he said, “you have to look at this at what will happen down the road in the future: Will it stop at $25? Will it increase in the future to $100, $200 per person or anywhere in between?” Ed Troxell, a top lobbyist for the Pennsylvania State Association of Boroughs, said his members recently approved a resolution supporting a per-person user fee for municipalities with a population of more than 4,000. Wolf, a Democrat, proposed a $25-per-person fee that is estimated to generate about $63 million and would help contribute to the state police's budget. The agency has relied increasingly on revenue from a gasoline tax meant to fund road and bridge repairs. When the gas tax was increased in 2013, the state police received about $622 million from the Motor License Fund. The current amount is $802 million, but this year's budget also capped the Motor License Fund transfer at that amount. Troxell said the bipartisan work that went into passing the transportation law, which has generated millions of dollars meant to repair crumbling infrastructure, was “a beautiful thing.” “However, all that's going to go for naught if we don't somehow begin to address an issue like this,” he said. “PSAB is supportive of a solution.” Both Republican and Democratic chairmen of the committee said a fix is necessary. But not all lawmakers were sold on the proposal. Rep. Doyle Heffley, R-Carbon County, said the proposal would “pass the burden on to rural Pennsylvanians.” Wolf administration officials said the proposed $25 fee is a bargain compared to the $234-per-person figure the state police says is the actual cost of providing the services to municipalities that don't have local police. Rep. Mike Sturla, D-Lancaster, said he agrees that state police services should be paid for. He would leave it up to municipalities to decide how to do it but would prohibit it from being assessed on a per-person basis. “You can't say to a family of seven, ‘Oh, well, just because you have five babies you gotta pay seven times the costs,' whereas the Wal-Mart, which doesn't have any per capita and calls the state police 10 times a day for shoplifting calls, they get to get off scot-free,” he said. Lt. Col. Stephen Bucar told the committee that state police are “indifferent” to where the funding is found, so long as there are no cuts. Kevin Zwick is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

News Local news Breaking News Teen held on $2M bail after shooting near Palatine High School Tribune illustration Tribune illustration Grace WongContact ReporterChicago Tribune A 16-year-old has been charged in a Palatine shooting that wounded two people Friday. Diego Garcia-Cordero, a sophomore at Palatine High School, appeared Saturday at the Leighton Criminal Court Building, where he was charged with three counts of attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm in the attack on three teens that wounded two of them. His bail was set at $2 million. According to court documents, two of the three teenagers left school at Palatine High School to smoke a marijuana cigarette. One of the teens then texted his cousin, who joined them after they left a gas station and together they walked to a nearby building in the 1100 block of East Randville Drive, Assistant State's Attorney Christopher Cromydas said. There, two of the teens sat on a green electrical box and one leaned against a wall, he said.  Two other students who were cutting class from Palatine High School were walking with Garcia-Cordero back toward the school when they came upon the three teens. One of the teens is a gang member, part of the Four Corner Hustlers, and he asked if Garcia-Cordero was a "King," meaning Latin King, and he said yes. Garcia-Cordero then pulled a gun out from his waistband and began shooting at the first of the three teens, Cromydas said. That teenager was able to avoid being shot by diving behind the electrical transformer. Another teen was shot in the leg and had a through and through bullet wound, and was released from a hospital Saturday. The other victim was shot multiple times in the leg and later had surgery. Doctors were unable to remove two of the bullets from his body, and he suffered multiple fractures to his leg and was still recovering in the hospital Saturday afternoon. Garcia-Cordero and the witnesses all fled the scene, and the witnesses went back to Palatine High School. After the shooting, Palatine High School went on lockdown. Surveillance video showed both witnesses going back to the school campus. Both witnesses were found and pulled out of class, and they later identified Garcia-Cordero as the shooter. "Officers went to the defendant's address, located him in the apartment complex," Cromydas said. "The defendant was placed into custody. Officers received consent to search from his parents, and a black hoodie and a Chicago Bears hat was recovered." Surveillance video from a nearby Walmart showed Garcia-Cordero going in and out shortly before the shooting, wearing a black hoodie and a black Bears hat. He was charged with three counts of attempted murder because he shot at three people, hitting two. He is scheduled to appear in court again Tuesday.

Her efforts haven't eliminated a problem that has plagued the archipelago nation for decades, she said, but they have boosted fish stocks and curbed smuggling. Catches of anchovies, king prawns and yellow fin tuna are up, helping local fishermen and reducing food prices, Pudjiastuti said. "What we actually earn also is respect," Pudjiastuti said in the American capital, where she joined other recipients of the annual Peter Benchley Ocean Awards — named for the author of "Jaws." She was cited for her efforts in protecting Indonesia's marine ecosystem, and tackling poachers and organized crime. "They cannot just do anything anymore," Pudjiastuti added. Whereas 10,000 foreign vessels used to fish in Indonesian waters "like in their own country," she said the new reality was clear: "Not anymore." For China and others in the region, sensitive politics also are at play. Indonesia's uncompromising approach has irked neighbors whose boats have been caught up in the dragnet for operating in seas plagued by territorial disputes. The campaign may partly reflect Indonesia's desire to show it is in control of its vast territory of 17,000 islands. Pudjiastuti, 52, has won popularity at home as the campaign's leader, defying initial skepticism when she was tapped as minister in 2014. She had no political experience and hadn't even graduated high school. But she spent three decades as a seafood entrepreneur and knew the business. She also had run her own charter airline, Susi Air, to distribute and export produce. On taking office, she quickly declared a fishing moratorium for foreign vessels that had often operated under Indonesian flags. "The state's sovereignty has to be upheld," she declared. And to ram the point home, Indonesian authorities have sunk more than 300 foreign fishing vessels. In the most recent mass-destruction in early April, Indonesian authorities destroyed 81 empty ships in a single weekend. Most were from Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand. In March 2016, a large Nigerian-flagged vessel was caught poaching toothfish and, after being evacuated, blown up with great fanfare. Pudjiastuti posed on the beach afterward with navy officials, their fists raised in the air with the smoking boat behind them. "The visuals and press that comes from her tough practices on blowing these ships up has really helped educate the world," said Sally Yozell, director of the environmental security program at Washington's Stimson Center think tank, speaking of the global scourge of overfishing. She recognized, however, the regional frictions of the campaign, which included several incidents last year of Indonesia firing warning shots and seizing Chinese fishing vessels in waters off its Natuna islands. Pudjiastuti also acknowledged some tensions. She said she briefed ambassadors of neighboring countries, including China, before the crackdown and sought support. "Poaching is not a part of good bilateral relations," she said Friday at the Stimson Center. Indonesian authorities have another 100 seized fishing vessels waiting to be destroying and they are impounding another dozen or so each week, she said. Few are Chinese fishing vessels, which are bigger, faster and often accompanied by the nation's coast guard, making it harder to police their activities, she added. The United States and Australia are providing support to Indonesia, including satellite technology to help surveillance of waters. Indonesia hopes for Japanese technical help, too. Indonesia isn't among the half-dozen governments contesting control of reefs and islands in the South China Sea, an emerging Asian flashpoint. But it has reason to be wary of China's claims. The so-called nine-dash line that Beijing uses to demarcate its expansive territorial claims extends into Indonesia's internationally-recognized exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, that extends 200 nautical miles off its coast. Pudjiastuti said she is less concerned over the subtleties over Indonesia's stance than her diplomat colleagues. "For me it's more clear. Once it's in my EEZ, that's my fish," she said. Her moratorium on foreign fishing vessels ended up playing a pivotal role in The Associated Press' "Seafood from Slaves" investigation, which in 2015 helped to free more than 2,000 foreign fishermen enslaved in Indonesia. The AP found their seafood was bound for consumers in the U.S. and other countries, tainting the supply chains of major companies and pet food brands including Wal-Mart, Sysco and Kroger, Fancy Feast and Iams. The moratorium grounded fishing boats that normally would have been almost constantly at sea, giving AP reporters the opportunity to first speak to enslaved fishermen on the remote Indonesian island of Benjina. Once the story was published, Pudjiastuti quickly dispatched a task force to Benjina, rescuing hundreds of abused workers mostly from Myanmar and Cambodia. In a moderate Muslim-majority country, where religious conservatives have growing political clout, Pudjiastuti has defied conventional gender roles. She's divorced, smokes and has a tattoo. She even inspired a character in one of Japan's most reputed manga comic books, "Golgo 13." In one strip, a woman in a beret and sunglasses had an unmistakable resemblance to Pudjiastuti. She was depicted overseeing the destruction of fishing boats, blown asunder with a "BOOM." ____ Associated Press writer Margie Mason contributed to this report. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Even in faraway US, Indonesian seafood enforcer wins acclaim World by Matthew Pennington, The Associated Press Posted May 13, 2017 11:56 am MDT Last Updated May 13, 2017 at 12:40 pm MDT WASHINGTON – A high school dropout turned seafood entrepreneur is leading Indonesia’s crackdown on illegal fishing, winning plaudits from conservationists and awards as far away as Washington despite her explosive methods.

Samsung Pay will be available in South Korea on August 20 followed by the US on Sepember 28. The system will eventually be rolled out in the UK, Spain and China, Samsung said, although it didn't offer a time frame for this expansion. Samsung's original rollout plans, announced in March at Mobile World Congress, called for Samsung Pay to appear first in the U.S. this summer. Unlike rival contactless payment systems like Apple Pay and Android Wallet, Samsung Pay doesn't exclusively use NFC technology to communicate with credit card terminals. Instead, it relies on a technology called Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) to pass along the information in a card's magnetic strip to terminals already used by retailers. This means a phone using MST can be used to purchase items at nearly any payment terminal. The expense of installing NFC-compatible terminals has prevented many retailers from adopting the technology, hindering the use of mobile wallets. Samsung CEO J.K. Shin noted these concerns during an event in New York where he also announced the company's newest smartphones. Shin said merchants can accept Samsung Pay without added costs while people can use the system at almost every store that takes credit cards. Even though Samsung talked up MST, its payment system will also work with NFC. Samsung acquired MST technology in February after purchasing mobile payment company LoopPay. At that time, LoopPay claimed MST works in approximately 90 percent of the point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. A Samsung spokeswoman added that less than 10 percent of U.S. retailers used NFC. Samsung Pay will come installed on the company's latest smartphones, the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 edge+. Starting in the middle of August, a software upgrade will let Galaxy S6 and S6 edge owners in the US and South Korea install Samsung Pay. Instead of exchanging credit card details with a terminal, Samsung Pay uses tokenization to pass along a temporary code, a system found in other contactless payment systems. Customers use their fingerprint to confirm a purchase. Samsung is working with South Korea's major credit card companies on incorporating Samsung Pay into payment networks. In the U.S, Samsung will work with credit card issuers like American Express, Visa and MasterCard as well as large banks, including Chase and Bank of America. At least one U.S. credit card company has already said it's supporting Samsung Pay: Discover customers will be able to use Samsung Pay at some still undetermined point in 2016. Tech companies aren't the only ones developing contactless payment systems. Merchants including CVS and Walmart are part of a retail group building its own mobile wallet called CurrentC.

Getty Images President Donald Trump and then-FBI Director James Comey before the firing and the firestorm. By WallaceWitkowski Reporter The strongest earnings season in nearly six years has provided a bulwark against controversies that have emerged out of the nation’s capital, but with quarterly results wrapping up, the drama out of Washington may take center stage and further raise the question as to whether President Donald Trump can effectively get any of his pro-business policies passed. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11%  and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.15%  both snapped a three-week streak of gains, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.09%  finished a fourth week in a row higher. In the week, markets contended with Trump’s surprise firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been spearheading an investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. While investors may not be freaking out about the Comey firing and the possible repercussions, they’re mindful that Republicans may distance themselves from the president out of midterm election voter concern, and that could jeopardize Trump’s agenda. Don’t miss: Bridgewater’s Dalio has some bad news for stock-market investors Those concerns will likely push the smattering of economic data this week to secondary importance, Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, said in an interview. “There would have to be some extraordinarily good data next week to change the conversation,” Pavlik said. Reports due next week include the May Empire State index and May homebuilders index on Monday; April housing starts, building permits, industrial production, and capacity utilization on Tuesday; with weekly jobless claims, the May Philly Fed index, and April leading indicators on Thursday. “People are worried that the Washington drama may start to spiral into something that detracts from the Trump agenda,” Pavlik said. “The market’s not reacting now, but if Trump starts losing political and voter support, that agenda might go away.” Stocks have been curiously even-keeled in the past few weeks, with the S&P 500 moving within a daily range of 0.5% or less for 13 straight sessions, according to Dow Jones data, the longest such streak since September 1995, when the index moved within that range for 14 straight sessions. Not even the Comey firing disrupted that. “I’m amazed, with the news that came out, how calmly the market digested that,” Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, said in an interview. “There’s a wait-and-see mentality: Is the shoe going to drop, or is there a shoe to drop? What can snap us out of this Sea of Tranquility?” Read also: Here’s what’s still unknown about James Comey’s firing Part of the flatness can be attributed to strong earnings, which are directly supporting stock prices, balancing out the indirect pressures of how uncertainties and continued controversies in Washington will affect promised reforms that propelled gains for much of the year, Detrick said. With more than 90% of the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results, the index is on track for earnings growth of 13.6% for the first quarter, the strongest increase since the third quarter of 2011, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. That growth number could get scaled back a bit, especially after earnings disappointments from traditional retailers like Macy’s Inc. M, -3.04%  in the past week. Many big-box retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.55% Target Corp. TGT, -0.46% and Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.46%  have earnings reports in the coming week. Those retailers may be less of a concern and interesting to watch out for, Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, said in an interview. “One thing we’ve seen are that department stores are having difficulties because of online sales, so it’ll be interesting to watch Home Depot,” Stone said, reasoning that consumers are more likely to go to a physical store for their home improvement products than purchasing online. Plus, with home prices rising, people are more willing to put money into their homes, he said.
