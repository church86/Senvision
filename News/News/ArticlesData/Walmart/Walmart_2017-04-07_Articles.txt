The movie itself is less than two months away, and while fans wait to see the first lady of DC comics in her own solo movie, they are being treated to some sneak peeks at the tie-in merchandise for the film. So far, a Wonder Woman LEGO set has been revealed, which included a large LEGO Ares, sparking further speculation that the God of War is going to play a part in the film. In addition, Mattel showed off a sneak peek at some of their figures that will be arriving exclusively at Walmart this month. As with any major blockbuster, especially a superhero one, toys, collectibles and merchandise are big business, and there are sure to be plenty more on offer once the movie hits theaters. For many collectible fans, however, it’s Funko that is the big name in affordable figures – and the toy giant has now revealed their full line of Wonder Woman exclusive figures. Funko posted images of seven of their upcoming Wonder Woman exclusives on their blog today, including some available now and others that will be available next month. The exclusives include a Dorbz of Wonder Woman in her classic costume (Walmart exclusive), a Rock Candy figure of her in her classic costume with sword and shield (Hot Topic exclusive), a PopVinyl showing her on one knee with her shield in front of her (Walmart exclusive), a PopVinyl  of her in her Themyscira costume with her shield (Hot Topic exclusive), a PopVinyl of her in a blue evening gown with her sword (GameStop exclusive), a PopVinyl of her as Diana Prince with her shield (Entertainment Earth exclusive) and finally, a PopVinyl set of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor (FYE exclusive). These exclusives are in addition to the previously announced Funko figures for the film (which include Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor and Hippolyta PopVinyls, another Rock Candy figure, and a Pocket Pop keychain). The Diana Prince PopVinyl has also been seen already, when Funko revealed it last month. These new Funko figures are bound to sell well, as the film is one of the most anticipated of the year, and fans love the Funko brand. PopVinyls have become one of the most popular collector items, with figures available from a massive number of franchises. It’s likely that there will even be more Wonder Woman PopVinyl figures announced in the future if the movie does well, as especially popular films often have multiple PopVinyl collections released. Of course, not every fan of DC is going to be a fan of these figures, but for Funko collectors, these will make an adorable addition to the display cabinet.

In a note to clients sent out on April 7, Telsey Advisory Group Analyst Joseph Feldman says that Walmart is reemerging as the dominant brick-and-mortar retailer because of the company's investment and execution in grocery and private brand sales.  "Walmart appears to be regaining its dominance in physical retail... The focus on food and e-commerce, price investments, and the customer experience point to a winning formula to gain market share," Feldman wrote. He upgraded Walmart to "Outperform" and raised his price target to $82.00 from $73.00. Over the last decade Walmart has invested millions in their grocery department, and it has paid off. Walmart is now the second largest grocery store in the country behind Kroger. Additionally, grocery accounts for roughly 56% of sales at Walmart and 59% at Sam's Club, making grocery the company's largest business.  Feldman highlights some key grocery initiatives: Freshness: Walmart is adding more and more local farmer produce to their stores to highlight freshness. They are also rearranging food in their stores to show off the new selection. Natural and Organic: It is clear that there is heavy demand for natural and organic products. More than ever, Walmart shoppers are conscious of what they eat, and Walmart is meeting the demand with a plethora of new natural products, which have better margins. Private Brands: Walmart is vastly expanding its private brand product offerings and recently opened an innovation center to come up with new ideas and new recipes. Since these products are produced by Walmart, they also have better margins.  Feldman also notes that deflation, which has been an issue for grocers, has lessened. Going forward Feldman sees modest food inflation that should help grocers.  This is key to competing with stores like Trader Joes and Kroger. Walmart is also investing in e-commerce to compete with Amazon.  Click here for a real-time Walmart quote.  markets Insider    SHARE THIS POST News for Kroger Walmart's groceries make it the king of brick-and-mortar retail (WMT, KR) Business Insider 5h Walmart's relentless price war is crushing America’s biggest grocer (WMT, KR) Business Insider 2d Grocery Stores Stocks on Investors' Radar -- Kroger, Whole Foods Market, SUPERVALU, and Sprouts Farmers Market PR Newswire 8d BRIEF-Kroger launches new Kroger stories website (KR) Reuters 11d Kroger Launches New Kroger Stories Website PR Newswire 11d Target names Kroger veteran Jeff Burt new grocery chief Reuters 19d UPDATE 1-Target names Kroger veteran Jeff Burt new grocery chief (TGT, KR, WMT) Reuters 19d BRIEF-Kroger says names Joe Grieshaber president of Fred Meyer Stores (KR) Reuters 19d Click here for more news your MARKET VIEW Your Personalized Market Center Related Stocks Kroger 29.86 0.36 (1.22%) 4/7/2017 Disclaimer Get real-time Kroger charts here >> Walmart 72.90 1.48 (2.07%) 4/7/2017 Disclaimer Get real-time Walmart charts here >> Walmart 72.90 1.48 (2.07%) 4/7/2017 Disclaimer Get real-time Walmart charts here >> MORE Find News GO Home / Stocks / Kroger-Quote / News for Kroger Kroger / Walmart's groceries make it the king of brick-and-mortar retail (WMT, KR) Follow us Need help?

Combined, Wal-Mart and Boeing's share gains were adding about 16 points to the blue-chip index , which was aiming for a close in positive territory for the day and week. However, Goldman Sach Group's 0.7% decline was helping to drag the gauge lower, cutting about 10 points from the price-weighted benchmark. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index was up less than a point at 2,357, and the Nasdaq Composite Index was trading flat at 5,881. Cautious trading Friday comes as disappointing March employment data and President Donald Trump's late Thursday airstrike against Syria weigh heavily on investor sentiment. Trump also is holding diplomatic talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Mar-a-lago, Fla., which is being closely followed for signs of geopolitical tensions. The U.S. strike against Syria and jobs report initially knocked stocks around but the market has shown an uncanny degree of resilience, hovering in the green, however slight.

Apple's stock rose $27.93, or 24%, during the quarter, to add about 191 points to the Dow, while and Boeing shares climbed $21.50, or 14%, to boost the Dow by 147 points. Rounding out the top 5, 3M Co. added 89 points to the Dow, Home Depot Inc. tacked on 87 points and Visa Inc. added 76 points.

 Walmart to cut 300 tech jobs BI Intelligence Apr. 7, 2017, 10:45 AM 1,001 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Walmart refocuses on omnichannel Walmart ramps up e-commerce with two new initiatives Amazon launches Amazon Cash This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walmart is cutting 300 jobs in its Information Systems Division, according to Retail Dive. The layoffs are part of a larger ongoing overhaul of Walmart’s tech operations that began with its acquisition of Jet.com last year. Walmart has been restructuring many of its e-commerce-focused divisions. The supply chain group lost 1,000 positions in January, while its Silicon Valley office lost 200 e-commerce positions in the same month. The latest layoffs come just a week after Walmart promoted three senior IT officers tasked with building out technology that would bridge in-store and online customer experiences. The job cuts are aimed at making the company more agile and efficient, which will be crucial as it grows its e-commerce segment. At the time of the cuts, CEO Doug McMillian said that the technology division needed to be leaner, with lower costs and less bureaucracy. As Walmart continues to invest in e-commerce it will need to continue to address costs and ensure efficiencies. A lean inventory and supply chain management process will be critical to keeping costs low as the company grows its e-commerce segment, which could cause shipping and inventory costs to skyrocket.

News Dow Stocks Wal-Mart, Disney See Upbeat Analyst Moves; Arista Downgraded Telsey Advisory Group upgraded Wal-Mart to outperform from hold and raised its price target to 82 from 73, despite intensified competition with Amazon. (Wal-Mart) REINHARDT KRAUSE 4/07/2017 Reprints Dow Jones industrial average component Wal-Mart (WMT) was upgraded amid fierce competition with Amazon (AMZN), and fellow Dow stock Walt Disney (DIS) got its price target bumped up, while oil and gas firm Williams Companies (WMB) was upgraded, and Arista Networks (ANET) was downgraded. Wal-Mart Telsey Advisory Group upgraded the retailer to outperform from hold and raised its price target to 82 from 73, despite intensified competition with Amazon. "Wal-Mart appears to be regaining its dominance in physical retail and exerting new prowess in digital commerce," said Joseph Feldman, a Telsey analyst in a report. "The increased focus on food and e-commerce, price investments and the customer experience point to a winning formula to gain market share." Wal-Mart stock closed up 2.1% at 72.90 in the stock market today, while the Dow index ended virtually unchanged. Amazon stock dipped 0.4% after hitting an all-time high on Wednesday. RELATED: Amazon Announces Part-Time Hires As Retailers Shutter Stores Walt Disney FBR & Co. maintained a market-perform rating but hiked its price target on the media and entertainment company to 116 from 113.

"We believe investors should own Williams ahead of the expected sale of its Geismar ethane cracker as we believe this sale coupled with the January 2017 restructuring places Williams on a path toward investment grade metrics before year-end 2017," said the Citi report. WMB stock edged up 0.3% to 30.35. Williams Companies is one of the dominant independent U.S. natural gas pipeline operators. It is the managing partner of Williams Partners, focused on gas field gathering systems. RELATED: Williams, Kinder Morgan: Are NatGas MLPs Set To Consolidate LNG?

Elizabeth Thomas, 15, has been missing since March 13, when she disappeared with her 50-year-old teacher Tad Cummins. The two - believed to be an illicit relationship - were spotted two days later at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, and haven't been seen since then. In the three weeks his daughter has been missing, Anthony Thomas says that two of her classmates have stopped talking to the family and he believes that they may be holding information that could help authorities bring Elizabeth home safe, the court filing says. Anthony Thomas (left) filed a petition in court on Thursday, asking for the power to depose two witnesses who may have information that could bring his missing daughter Elizabeth, 15 (right), home  Elizabeth and her 50-year-old teacher Tad Cummins have been missing since March 13. The two are pictured above at an Oklahoma City Walmart two days later. This was the last time either was seen   ‘With each passing week that Cummins and the child are gone, the memories of these witnesses potentially become less clear,’ the petition filed in Chancery Court said. ‘At least two of the witnesses have information that could lead to the finding of this child. One of those witnesses has stopped speaking to counsel altogether, and the other one is believed to have more information than what has been shared to this point.’ Cummins was suspended from teaching on February 6, nearly two weeks after another student caught him kissing Elizabeth  Thomas also revealed in the court documents what he knows so far about his daughter’s relationship with her teacher, including some details which have not been released before. He said that Cummins allegedly went to his home on several occasions, without his knowledge, and pressured his daughter to go out for a meal with him, threatening ‘repercussions at school’ if she declined. Elizabeth reportedly told friends and siblings that she felt in ‘over her head’ in the relationship and that she was scared of Cummins. When Cummins would show up at her work unannounced, Elizabeth would reportedly hide and tell Chik-fil-A co-workers to lie and tell Cummins she wasn’t working. Classmates are also said to have noticed a strange intimacy between Elizabeth and her teacher. One fellow student allegedly found Elizabeth sleeping on a hospital bed in Cummins’ classroom before classes began one morning. Elizabeth reportedly had a special desk close to Cummins and other classmates saw the teacher give her money and gifts. Others found it weird when Cummins allegedly rubbed Elizabeth’s back and shoulders at school. On January 23, a student reported seeing Cummins and Elizabeth kiss to the school. Both denied the claim, but Cummins was eventually suspended on February 6. In the nearly two weeks that he was allowed to continue working at the school, Thomas says that Cummins was a chaperone on a field trip that his daughter attended. Elizabeth reportedly told friends and some of her siblings (the family pictured above) that she felt in 'over her head' in her relationship with Cummins   Cummins was fired on March 14 - the day after he and Elizabeth went missing. Elizabeth’s father says that he believes Cummins may have guilted her into leaving with him, saying that ‘her future collegiate and work career was ruined’ because of the scandal. She reportedly told a friend who dropped her off at a restaurant to meet Cummins the morning of her disappearance that she did not want to go and was having second thoughts about spending the day with him. Speaking to ABC News, Thomas’ attorney, Jason Whatley, said that the unnamed witnesses may be withholding information because they are intimated. ‘Perhaps the most concerning element has been the hesitancy of some persons to fully cooperate in sharing information that they know,’ Whatley said. ‘The purpose of our petition as filed today will hopefully put an end to that hesitancy displayed by some and will help us, as the family, to methodically confirm facts that have been at times unclear,’ he added. ‘We have brought this petition for no purpose except to provide a vehicle for gathering information.’ The court filing came a day after Thomas pleaded with his daughter to come home in a television interview.   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Human remains found in a Missouri field identified as those...

Don't listen to that.  'Everything he said to all the kids, not just you, has been a lie. He's nothing but a liar. We all want you home,' he said.  He said teacher Tad Cummins is 'filtering' the news the girl sees, as he urged Cummins to turn himself in. 'I know you're keeping up with all this and you're filtering. You're not letting her see how much people out here love her,' Thomas said to Cummins. Students said that Elizabeth had a special seat next to Cummins' desk and that he would rub her shoulders and back at school (the two pictured above at school)  'You're depriving her of that. It would make better sense for you to turn yourself in to law enforcement. You turn yourself in, there are laws that will guarantee your general safety,' he added.  Thomas said the words at a tree-planting ceremony on Wednesday, as part of national crime victim's rights week.   Police have issued an Amber alert for Elizabeth and say they have warrants charging Cummins with sexual contact with a minor and aggravated kidnapping. Authorities have warned against using the word 'romance' to refer to the two.  Elizabeth's dad says she told a friend that she was hesitant about meeting with Cummins on Marhc 13 - the day she went missing. Above, Elizabeth leaving her home the morning of her disappearance   At a press conference last week, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn said Cummins manipulated Elizabeth and kidnapped her. Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper said he used the word 'romantic' to describe the nature of draft emails exchanged between the two, but should have used the word 'grooming.'  He said a 50-year-old educated man trying to convince a vulnerable teenage girl that being in a relationship with him was the right thing to do is not a romance, but a serious crime.  Last week, Cummins' wife filed for divorce after 31 years of marriage. Court records show that Jill Cummins sued her missing husband on the grounds of irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct. The wife, who works for the Maury County school system, says she has not seen her husband since March 13. The couple has two children together. Jill Cummins has previously publicly pleaded with her husband to turn himself and bring the girl home safely. Elizabeth is described as 5 feet tall and 120 pounds with blond hair and hazel eyes. Cummins is described as about 6 feet tall and 200 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes.    Read more: Father has strong message for both Elizabeth Thomas, Tad Cummins | WKRN News 2 Missing Tennessee teen's father seeks to depose witnesses in hopes of finding daughter - ABC News Share or comment on this article e-mail 21 shares Most watched News videos Terrified people flee scene of Stockholm truck attack Police tackle man to the ground moments after terror attack Footage appears to show hangars damaged by US air strike in Syria Fury as female traveller rests her SMELLY feet on coach seat Man missing for months is found in giant hole in woods People run in fear as truck drives into people in Stockholm Emergency services respond to people lying on the ground Girl in India found living with monkeys dubbed Mowgli 2.0 USS Porter launches Tomahawk missiles at the Al-Shayrat Air Base Question Time audience member demands apology from Diane Abbott Trump orders launch of 50 Tomahawk missiles on Syrian airbase Moment USS Ross launches Tomahawk missiles into Syria The moment Stockholm police catch the third beer truck...

Store No 8, named after an early store remembered by Sam Walton as an "experiment," sets out to uncover, invent, and invest in ideas that will transform the future of commerce. The Silicon Valley stand-alone entity hopes to develop ideas that are the retailer's "big bets that have the potential to change the world." The announcement was revealed at ShopTalk, by Marc Lore, president and CEO of e-commerce U.S., whose Jet.com online store was purchased by Walmart last year for $3 billion. "Store No 8 will incubate, invest in, and partner with entrepreneurs, early stage start-ups, VCs and academics to innovate across a wide variety of areas including robotics, virtual & augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence," a spokesman for Walmart told RIS News. "These startups will be ring-fenced from the broader organization, so they have the room to grow and develop." The endeavor will be led by G. Seth Beal and Katie Finnegan. "Store No 8 is building a team with the expertise to bring radical innovations to the physical, digital and virtual retail experience, acting as a force driving commerce forward at a time when emerging technologies influence all aspects of consumers’ lives," the spokesman said. Beal is SVP, Incubation & Strategic Partnerships for Walmart US e-commerce, which includes his role as Principal for Store No 8. Since joining Walmart in 2013, Seth has served in a number of roles with a deep focus on the digital shopping experience including SVP, Global Marketplace and Digital Store Operations (DSO) and Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer for Global e-commerce. Prior to Walmart, Seth was President and CEO of Thrift Books LLC, the nation’s leading online seller of used books.  Finnegan co-founded an innovative retail tech startup and was Head of Corp Dev, IR and Strategy for Jet, reporting directly to CEO Marc Lore.           SHARE YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Omnichannel Walmart Expands Capabilities as Online Shopping and Traffic Grows Business Intelligence (BI) The Jet and Pilot Have Landed Enterprise Resource Management Jet Setting with E-Commerce Start-Up Jet.com Fulfillment Is Walmart Poised to Triumph in E-Commerce?

(GuruFocus) Speaking on Bloomberg Markets, Tim Biggam of Delta Derivatives shared with the viewers his bearish trading idea in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). He said the stock closed higher for eight days in a row, before it lost 1.21 percent on Thursday. He added that its market cap is twice the market cap of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT), but it has only 30 percent of Wal-Mart's sales. Biggam thinks Amazon is overbought and he wants to use options to initiate a bearish position. He wants to buy the April 21, 900 strike put and sell the April 13, 890 strike put. The trading structure would cost him $7.50 and it breaks even at $892.50 or 0.64 percent lower. If the stock trades above $890 at the April 13 expiration, the April 13, 890 strike put is going to expire worthless and Biggam is going to have a chance to earn more than $2.50, which is the maximal amount he can make on the put spread.

This article really caught my attention and I think the gist of it applies to customers in retail as well. At my Target recently, I asked a young man where I could find something and it was obvious that he was mentally impaired and could not help me, but he tried so hard and I was so appreciative to him and thanked him with gusto for his help. I was so delighted that Target was hiring such persons who need jobs and can function well as stockers, etc. And, at my neighborhood Wal-Mart, my checker was an elderly man in a wheelchair. He was slow but so pleasant and trying so hard to maneuver my items. I thanked him profusely. Again, I was delighted that Wal-Mart hires persons in specific jobs to fit their capabilities. But I think it is up to the public, the consumers, to recognize these individuals and appreciate them for the jobs they do and be patient and kind. Barbara Wiskow, Dallas Blind to immigrants' plight Re: "Mayors try to pin down Trump policy -- Homeland Security chief hears frustrations over defining 'sanctuary city,'" Thursday news story. For more than 20 years our country has let immigrants come across our borders and work our hard-labor jobs and build a life for themselves and their children. Now we are telling them if they do not abandon their lives that they have worked so hard to build, we are going to throw them out. Since their children were born here, we are going to throw out the parents and foster their children in foster care. Millions of foster children will be ours to raise. We all know foster children often end up being troubled. Labeling the people we have allowed to build lives in this country as illegal immigrants is wrong in every way. People who can't see this are blind, cruel and un-Christian. Susan Simmons, Waxahachie Moving on to wealth care So, now that repealing the Affordable Care Act failed in the House, it's time to move to ... tax reform? It seems they have decided that it is appropriate for a shift from health care to wealth care. Funny, wouldn't you have some kind of actual budget in place before you go monkeying with your cash flow? I know it works that way in our household. George Dailey, Dallas A tea party remnant? Re: "Trump slaps at the right -- Freedom Caucus draws his wrath; some push back, say he needs them," Friday news story. In the famous words spoken by Butch Cassidy to the Sundance Kid when they were being pursued and threatened by a group of lawmen, "Who are those guys?" The Freedom Caucus guys seem to be a remnant of the tea party movement of 2009-10. It won the admiration of many conservatives but failed to sustain itself in the years that followed. It seemed they were too radical and overly opposed to the leadership. This caucus group missed a great chance to boost the conservative cause by giving the party a victory in the health care vote. It would have helped the future plans of the party's tax reform, infrastructure updating and the budget approval. One congressman said: "It is easy to say 'no' but very hard to govern." There will always be opposition to change. Folks don't like their perks taken away. Could a compromise have been worked out? Ronald Reagan compromised and got a lot of good legislation passed. His approach: Take what you can now and try for more, or the rest, later. They could have gotten rid of the unpopular mandate and other similar parts of the Affordable Care Act. How severe a blow this was to the Republicans will be determined later this year. Robert Watkins, Plano Why demonize entitlements? Re: "See behind the ritual of presidential budget -- Jonah Goldberg: It is greeted as a document of significance, but its unveiling is almost always symbolic," Wednesday Viewpoints. Goldberg's use of the budgetary process to argue for his economic ideology is unpardonable. Here, he is the crazy street corner preacher screaming the end of world is at hand, repent. What's needed is not recognition of the ritual, but what every economist knows, that: 1. A nation like ours, with its debt entirely in its own currency, cannot go broke. 2. Most of our debt is owed to ourselves, and you aren't broke because you have more of your money in one of your pockets than another. Why demonize entitlements and debt, when these actually put money into the private sector, whereas government surpluses and balanced budgets don't? Follow the money. When governments hoard, the public must buy from private parties who profit. When governments spend directly into the public, private parties have less to offer -- and thus make less. So the real problem with entitlements for people like Goldberg is that there's no profit in them for private-sector businesses, and the real problem with debt is that it's funding public initiatives that the private sector doesn't profit from. Brian Baldwin, Dallas/Oak Lawn Don't hamstring civil servants It's a challenging time to be a federal employee, but as president of Chapter 254 of the National Treasury Employees Union I can attest to the dedication of our nation's civil servants, even in the face of threats to cut their pay, their benefits and their jobs. Federal workers in small towns and large cities all across America are committed to serving the American public. Whether they protect the border, process tax filings, catch financial scammers, keep the air and water clean and safe, or inspect new food and medical products, these employees deserve a fair wage and the necessary resources to carry out their missions. Indiscriminate budget cuts and across-the-board hiring freezes only hamper their ability to deliver vital public services. We urge our fellow Americans to stand with us to protect the integrity of the civil service and make sure government functions efficiently and effectively for everyone. David Arvelo, Dallas Border wall an insane project Re: "Will wall go on Mexico's side of the Rio Grande?" Thursday news story. The estimated cost by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for building the wall along the Mexican border is $21.6 billion over three years. I used to own 200 acres on the Rio Grande south of Eagle Pass, where there are more rattlesnakes than people. Believe me, the river moves, there are mountains and all sorts of physical and legal obstacles with this project that makes it insane, and maybe, just maybe, that should describe those who propose it.

Jenna Greenwood, a Shipt Shopper, shops at the Ballantyne Harris Teeter earlier this year. Diedra Laird dlaird@charlotteobserver.com i By Katherine Peralta kperalta@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story It seems like almost everywhere you look in the booming parts of Charlotte, a grocery store is either under construction or undergoing a renovation. The city’s long-running grocery wars are heating up, with Florida-based Publix muscling in on hometown grocer Harris Teeter’s turf and low-cost chains like Aldi pressing ahead with expansion. The intense competition shows no sign of letting up – and that could be good news for shoppers. Matthews-based Harris Teeter is once again the No. 1 supermarket chain in the Charlotte region by market share, according to a tally of 2016 revenue from sales-tracking firm Chain Store Guide. Wal-Mart Supercenters are the area’s No. 2 grocery destination, and Salisbury-based Food Lion is No. 3. Despite their high rankings, Wal-Mart and Food Lion both saw their market shares slip over the last year. Harris Teeter, on the other hand, grew its market share. So did Publix, which entered the market in 2014 and competes closely with Harris Teeter. Publix, based in Lakeland, Fla., is Charlotte’s No. 4 grocery chain. Phil Lempert, a supermarket analyst, says the competition in Charlotte’s grocery market is going to get even hotter, as discount European chains like Aldi and Lidl open new stores in the area. It could be especially true as Publix wraps up construction on several more stores around Charlotte, he said. “You’re going to see a price war,” Lempert said of the phenomenon of retailers beating out their competitors with low prices. “That’s great news for consumers, not such great news for retailers themselves,” who are already pressured by tight margins. The population of the Charlotte metro area has increased by 2.35 percent over the last year, according to Chain Store Guide’s report, but total area grocery sales surged by 4.75 percent over the same period. Shoppers could be spending more as the area’s economy improves, as they’re faced with more options and sparkly new amenities, and as grocery delivery services like Shipt launch in Charlotte. Still, as the Observer reported last month, lower-income areas are left behind as grocery wars heat up elsewhere in the city. Supermarkets have not been expanding into certain areas, such as the West Boulevard corridor, where the only full-service grocer for miles is a Wal-Mart Supercenter. On the other end of the price spectrum, Whole Foods and Fresh Market command a much smaller – 1 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively – share of Charlotte’s grocery market, ranking them at No. 16 and No. 17. That could start to change for Whole Foods, which is building its third area location uptown. &nbsp; facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:56 Hilton lawsuit Pause 0:58 New McClatchy Podcast: 'Majority Minority' 2:37 Add this to S-Town buzz: Carolinians may know the professor 0:58 Dowd YMCA breaks ground for big makeover 1:56 HB2 deal announced in late-night press conference 1:24 Indian grocery store a hate crime target 2:00 PRP and stem cell therapy gains popularity in Charlotte 1:41 Fly Ty and Jacinda Jacobs on togetherness 0:46 Leonard Fournette on what he had to prove at LSU pro day 2:45 Commutation recipient James Patterson Jr. had sentence reduced because of Obama Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email How to spot GMOs on your grocery store shelf Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, an organization pushing for GMO labels on food packaging, shares some tips for finding items on grocery store shelves that contain genetically modified organisms (GMO). As Vice President of Government Affair Harris Teeter and Publix A local businessman named W.T. Harris opened the first Harris Food Store on Central Avenue in 1936. The chain, now called Harris Teeter and based in Matthews, remains the hometown favorite. Over the last year, Harris Teeter grew its market share in the area to 20.1 percent from 19.4 percent, according to the report. Grocery giant Kroger bought Harris Teeter in early 2014 for $2.5 billion. Since then, it’s been adding fresh amenities to its stores like wine bars, growlers, gas stations and more food-service offerings, an effort to make the chain an even more attractive destination. Harris Teeter spokeswoman Danna Robinson pointed to Charlotte’s “thriving economic climate and growing population” to explain why it and other retailers are expanding in the city. “Harris Teeter is always reviewing new real estate opportunities to drive growth and strengthen our brand in existing and new markets. We are thrilled with the opportunity to re-invest in our home market to bring our shoppers new, attractive and convenient Harris Teeter locations,” Robinson said. In multiple spots throughout Charlotte, including South End, Cotswold and Prosperity Village, Publix is building stores close to Harris Teeter, and vice versa. That’s because their prices are similar, and they compete for the same customers, experts say. Last year, Publix grew its market share to 7.2 percent from 6 percent the year prior, Chain Store Guide’s report shows. “The overwhelming response from our customers shows that they appreciate quality products and service,” spokeswoman Kimberly Reynolds said. Wal-Mart Wal-Mart is technically Charlotte’s biggest grocer, when the market shares for its Supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and Sam’s Club stores are added together. Supercenters are the area’s second-biggest grocery destination, with 18.6 percent of the market, down from 19.8 percent a year prior. Neighborhood Markets are Wal-Mart’s version of a traditional grocery store. While they grew their market share in Charlotte last year, Wal-Mart has since announced it is closing several Neighborhood Market locations, including the one on Independence Boulevard. “Over the next year, we will further our investment in the Queen City with plans to save our customers time and money, invest in e-commerce and continue to improve our existing stores by remodeling several Charlotte area locations,” said Phillip Keene, Walmart’s director of communications for the Southeast. Wal-Mart-owned Sam’s Club, alongside competitor Costco Wholesale, has been gradually losing market share in Charlotte over the years. They are the No. 6 and No. 7 grocers in the city, respectively. Meanwhile, BJ’s Wholesale Club, a competitor ranked No. 8, has been growing its local market share. BJ’s opened in the Metropolitan in late 2015. Food Lion Food Lion was the area’s No. 3 grocer last year, down from No. 2 the year prior. Food Lion saw its market share decrease to 18.1 percent last year from 19.1 percent, according to the report. Late last year, Food Lion wrapped up a $215 million renovation project of its 142 supermarkets in the Charlotte area. The store redesigns include new features like easy-to-navigate formats, new decor, lower prices on staples like chicken and produce and expanded product assortments. Spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown said the grocer is pleased with its performance in the Charlotte market, as well as with its recent investment. “We have been very pleased with our customer feedback about our new stores, which makes shopping easier, and ensures we are providing products that are fresh and affordable,” Phillips-Brown said. Food Lion could face competition from the growth of German grocers Aldi and Lidl in Charlotte in coming months and years. The two supermarket chains have stores that are about half the size of a typical 40,000 square-foot store like Food Lion, but they also offer low prices and quality, Lempert said. Lidl could be opening its first Charlotte stores as early as this summer. Aldi has said it’s spending $3 billion through 2020 to open 650 new stores across the U.S. “(Aldi and Lidl) are game changers,” Lempert said.

Walmex, a unit of Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said Thursday that sales in the January-March period totaled 131.7 billion Mexican pesos ($7 billion), up 7.3% from the first quarter of 2016. It was the slowest growth since the fourth quarter of 2014, and below the 12% growth for all of 2016. Same-store sales in the first quarter, which exclude stores opened in the past year, rose 4.1% in Mexico and 2.1% in Central America. In January, widespread protests in Mexico over higher gasoline prices led to violence and looting that temporarily shut down several dozen Walmex stores and shaved 1.5 to 2 percentage points off sales growth that month. February had an extra leap-year day in 2016, and the Easter holiday, which tends to lift sales, is in April this year instead of March. Mexico's employment and wage growth in the past two years, coupled with low inflation, has contributed to robust retail sales, although consumption shows signs of slowing in 2017 and annual inflation has picked up to 5.3% in mid-March. "We believe same-store sales growth is being increasingly driven by ticket rather than traffic, which we read as lower-quality growth," Credit Suisse said in a recent report in which it added that macroeconomic tailwinds such as wage and credit growth are losing strength. Walmex said that 1.4% fewer customers spent on average 6.1% more per visit in March at its stores in Mexico. Still, the company last month reiterated its target of doubling sales in the period from 2014 to 2024. Walmex said it would invest 17 billion pesos this year, 19% more than in 2016, in new stores, remodeling, logistics and development of e-commerce. Walmex plans to report its first-quarter financial results on April 27.

ALERT welcomes new officer in charge ALERT CEO Chad Coles ALERT - Inspector Chad Coles of the RCMP has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of ALERT. Coles will be the officer in charge of the provincially funded, integrated unit that addresses organized and serious crime across Alberta. ALERT was established and is funded by the Alberta Government and is a compilation of the province’s most sophisticated law enforcement resources, including officers with Calgary Police Service, Edmonton Police Service, Lethbridge Police Service, Medicine Hat Police Service, and RCMP. ALERT’s integrated teams investigate everything from drug trafficking to child exploitation to gang violence. “I’d like to congratulate Insp. Chad Coles on his appointment of Chief Executive Officer of ALERT. His career leading organized crime teams throughout the province, as well as more than two decades with the RCMP, will enable him to lead this vital team of specialized units. The valuable work ALERT does is an integral part of ensuring the safety of all Albertans,” said Kathleen Ganley, Minister of Justice and Solicitor General. Coles has been with ALERT since 2015 and oversaw the regional organized crime teams based in Fort McMurray, Grande Prairie, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, and Red Deer. His appointment was made official at the ALERT Board of Directors meeting in March. “On behalf of the ALERT Board of Directors, I wish to congratulate Insp. Coles. I know he will continue to grow ALERT, expand on the strong relationships with our policing partners, and build upon the legacy left behind by Supt. Charmaine Bulger,” said Board chair Don Johnson. Coles is a 21-year member of the RCMP with a third of his career spent as a member of integrated units.

Edmonton drug dealers charged with Child Endangerment ALERT - Three Edmonton women are facing charges under Alberta’s Drug-Endangered Children Act after allegedly exposing an infant to drug deals and cocaine production. ALERT Edmonton’s organized crime and gang team charged the three women on April 5, 2017. The women’s ages are 27, 26, and 26, but their names are not being released in order to protect the identity of the 11-month-old victim. The infant is the biological daughter of one of the accused. Police allege that the women brought the infant along on a number of drug transactions. ALERT expedited the investigation after growing concerns for the health and well-being of the child. A search warrant was executed at home in northeast Edmonton on March 23, where investigators found evidence consistent with cocaine trafficking. Cocaine processing equipment and residue was found throughout the home and the infant’s nursery doubled as a cocaine conversion lab, where the drug was being converted to crack cocaine. Edmonton Police Service’s Child at Risk Response Team (CARRT) provided assistance and the child was removed from the home. Charges against the women include: Causing a child to be drug-endangered; Causing a child to be in need of intervention; Production of cocaine; Possession for the purpose of trafficking; and Possession of a controlled substance. The Drug-Endangered Children Act makes it clear that children exposed to an adult's involvement in serious drug activity, such as trafficking, are victims of abuse and need protection.

Videos - Latest World Headline News, Breaking News In 6988, Steve Jobs was trying to entice John Sculley to leave a wildly successful career at PepsiCo to become Apple’s new CEO. Jobs reportedly asked him, “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?” In making his pitch, Jobs leveraged a potent psychological force: the deep-seated human desire to do meaningful work. Nation | News One Placement year fees for 7575/76 are still to be confirmed. As an indication, for 7567/68 the current placement fees are set at 75% of the yearly full-time fee for UK/EU students and £8,555 for international students. With cloud computing becoming the next big thing worldwide cloud expenditure is expected to increase by % CAGR by 7575. The company is expected to increase its revenues and consumer base through this opportunity with the help of its Creative Cloud services. Even with the big figures being recorded as their net profits yearly, they still have a net liability amounting to about almost three billion dollars in unpaid pensions. Inspiration strengthens commitment, of course, but when it’s rooted in a respected brand purpose, all employees will be motivated by the same mission. This enhances collaboration and, as more and more employees come into contact with customers, also helps ensure consistent customer experiences. The payoff is that everyone in the company becomes a de facto member of the marketing team. In January 7559, Moody’s Investment Services placed the long-term ratings of GE and GE Capital on review for possible downgrade. The review of company’s rating for downgrade was primarily due to uncertainty regarding GE Capital’s asset quality and earnings performance in future periods. Further, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the company’s ratings outlook from stable to negative. Lower credit ratings represent higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets for GE. Under debt instrument guarantees and covenants, GE would have to post additional collateral if the ratings were cut below AA-/Aa8 or A-6 and P-6, or four levels, the company said in its annual filings with the .

If I’ve learned anything from watching 10 billion episodes of HGTV’s “House Hunters” program, it’s that in real estate, compromise is inevitable. That, and the value of investing in granite countertops before you sell. So it was not at all surprising to have learned this week that Lidl, which has been hunting for homes in saturated markets along the East Coast for the last few years, has, in the opinion of some experts, made a few compromises of its own on the spaces they intend to move into. According to sources, at least some of the 233 locations the German discounter has secured — including what they believe to be many of the earliest acquired and presumed first ones to open — have less-than-ideal site characteristics. They’re located on mid-blocks or on secondary street corners near but not quite at those locations easiest for shoppers to get to and from. Like everyone else, I’ve been following the progress of Lidl closely and can attest to that point in a few of the places it reportedly intends to occupy that I happen to know well. Reports last fall indicate for example, they’re building at the site of a batting cage facility my softball team used to tune up for the season in Newark, Del. That’s a bunt single from some nearby residential neighborhoods but a home run from the highly trafficked corners from which they’d drive. And in Cecil County, Md., where I worked my first newspaper job — and where one of Lidl’s planned distribution centers has been celebrated for its economic impact — a planned store site in Elkton faces a ton of traffic on Route 40 but I can attest it would be convenient to visit only if you happened to be traveling west to east. For everyone else, there’s easier access to a gigantic Walmart and an Acme facing off at a major intersection a mile away. Again, this general lack of “Main & Main” locations has been the case along the developed East Coast for 20 years, so compromises were inevitable. More surprising was the belief among some of the real estate experts I spoke with this week that Lidl took these sites without the customary regard for the competitive characteristics of the trade areas — a compromise that they say could result in wild swings among the volumes of one store to the next, depending on the makeup of their neighbors. Lidl, I should note, respectfully declined questions on its site selection process and has not yet made announcements as to specific sites it will open, though I expect the latter will be revealed shortly. But if the predictions of the real estate watchers hold through it would seem to put still more focus on Lidl’s ability to differentiate not on the basis of its neighborhood, but on the quality of its kitchen counters. They not only need to shine, but to last: Lidl’s strength will need to be a compelling concept backed with a willingness to stand behind it for the long haul — and a gradual improvement is just what some retail experts expect from Lidl. That’s also where Lidl will need to differ from Fresh & Easy, the Tesco-based concept that encountered similar issues finding good locations, but was ultimately done in by a concept that wasn’t worth visiting anyway, and a management that lost faith in fixing it. ‘Less Flat Footed’ Karen Short, the Barclays’ analyst whose insightful research this week tipped us off to the Lidl real estate angle, also checked in with a report from the retail front lines in Nashville, Tenn., where Kroger appears to have finally responded to Walmart’s aggressive pricing initiatives. A Barclays’ basket study there indicated Kroger was 3.9% more expensive than Walmart on a 78-item basket, but held a 3.3% advantage on fresh items. This reflects more aggressive price investment in the recent quarter on the part of Kroger, which according to Barclays was caught “flat footed” when Walmart’s multi-billion price slashing effort first reached Music City last year. Another hyper-competitive market appears to be Houston, where according to a recent Wolfe Research study, Kroger, Sprouts, Whole Foods and H-E-B had all taken on a fairly aggressive promotional strategy in the fresh categories since November, while Albertsons’ Randalls chain has also been more price competitive. Although Wolfe’s most recent check there indicates slightly higher pricing overall (+0.3%) than in January, the market has been deflationary by 1.5% since last April, and the pace of new stores and promotional intensity continue to keep retailers on their toes. “Looking at the promotional stance and the level of store building taking place in Houston, the inconvenient truth, in our opinion, is that Houston’s competitive landscape continues to deteriorate and staples retailers are taking extraordinary steps to drive customer traffic to their stores,” Wolfe’s Scott Mushkin said. “This means, in some instances, that frequently purchased items like milk and chicken breasts are being priced near or below cost.” TAGS: Kroger Walmart 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

The hard discounters are coming Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (NYSE:WMT) UK chain Asda has had its backside kicked by hard discounters, but the US mothership is much better prepared. That’s the claim of David Cheesewright, president and chief executive of Walmart International. Broker Jefferies hosted meetings in Toronto with Cheesewright in which he maintained management would be better prepared to deal with hard discounters in the US than it was in the UK, where all of the major players have struggled to deal with the arrival of Aldi and Lidl. The chain is preparing for an onslaught by improving quality, prices and own-label products. “In the process of muting the growth of hard discounters, it believes its work should allow it to take share from other larger competitors and this could prove to be the bigger prize,” Jefferies reported in a research note, in which it reiterated its ‘buy’ recommendation. The company is also acutely aware of the threat posed by Amazon.com, but Cheesewright believes having both an online presence and bricks and mortar outlets will lead to a “multiplier effect” on sales. Like Amazon, Wal-Mart enjoys global scale, which should enable it to compete on price. Jefferies has a price target of US$86, versus a current share price of Wal-Mart of just under US$73.

Chris Hill (TMFWizard) Apr 7, 2017 at 2:04PM On this episode of Market Foolery, Chris Hill is joined by Motley Fool analyst David Kretzmann as they look at two major deals that were announced this week First, Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) confirmed it would be joining the large portfolio of privately held JAB Holding -- owner of Krispy Kreme and Keurig Green Mountain, among other brands. Meanwhile, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) picked up the rights to stream Thursday Night Football games in a deal with the NFL that cuts out last season's streaming partner, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). To close things out, we'll hear some business takeaways from Kretzmann's three-week trip to Australia and New Zealand. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 5, 2017. Chris Hill: It's Wednesday, April 5th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio: David Kretzmann from Supernova. He's back from his trip. Welcome back, sir! David Kretzmann: I made it back in one piece. It's good to be back. Hill: I had no doubt you would make it back in one piece. Kretzmann: I appreciate that. Hill: I want to get to your trip in a moment, because you spent some quality time down under, exploring Australia and New Zealand. But we have to talk about the story of the day. Kretzmann: The news fairy. Hill: The news fairy has been good, I'll be honest, coming into this week, I was like, I really hope the news fairy shows up, because there's not a lot of earnings news this week. The deal that we discussed yesterday has now been ... well, it hasn't been set in stone. I guess all the documents will be signed in the next couple of months. Panera Bread is being bought, and we now know it's going to be bought by JAB Holdings. It's a $7.5 billion deal. If you're a Panera Bread shareholder, you're having one hell of a good week. A week ago, the stock was trading around $250, and the buyout price is going to be $315 a share. What did you think when you saw this news? JAB Holdings, you look at their portfolio, the companies that they own, they are very deep into the food space. They have Krispy Kreme donuts, Green Mountain Coffee, Peet's Coffee, Caribou. Kretzmann: They love their coffee. Hill: They do. Kretzmann: It definitely makes a lot more sense than Domino's acquiring Panera. Panera seems like a much better fit. And, based on what Ron Shaich, the founder and CEO of Panera, has been saying, it sounds like JAB will be giving Panera a lot of autonomy. To me, that would be the only way a deal like this would make sense. You get the impression that Shaich and company really love what they do, and the Panera 2.0 concept is really clicking. So, I would expect JAB to be a little bit more hands off with Panera compared to Krispy Kreme or Keurig, which were brands or companies that were struggling a little bit more. Keurig had Keurig Kold, that was the big deal that totally fell flat on its face around the time when JAB bought them out. Panera seems like it's a good fit, based on where JAB has been going. Like I said, probably a little bit more hands off. I think it makes sense, and for Ron Shaich and company, they can be fully in control, from the sound of it. So, it sounds like a good deal for both. Hill: It does. The one thing -- and you and and Aaron Bush and I were talking about this earlier this morning -- that's a little puzzling to me is, if you think about Krispy Kreme, Keurig Green Mountain, Peet's, Caribou, when they were all public companies on their own, by the time JAB got around to buying them, they had struggled, as you said. And it was one of those situations where I remember thinking, particularly in the case of Keurig Green Mountain, "Well, that's good. That's good, that they're going the private-equity route, because then they can be out of the spotlight." Panera Bread is crushing it. So, that's the only thing that's a little bit puzzling to me. But, as Aaron Bush said, maybe JAB just wanted something a little easier that they didn't have to go in and fix. Kretzmann: Yeah, they don't have to fiddle with it quite as much. And it sounds like that's what JAB wants, that's what Panera wants. So, it makes sense there. A few years ago, there was a much different conversation around Panera. Even here at the Fool, we had a good amount of people here who were skeptical about where Panera was going. It was struggling on a lot of different fronts. And it wasn't immediately clear whether Panera 2.0 would click. But it turns out Panera was one of the first restaurant chains to embrace digital, mobile, online ordering. And as a result, at a time when a lot of restaurants are struggling, Panera today is putting out astounding numbers, it's well at the top of the pack, alongside companies like Domino's and others. A few years ago, it wasn't as obvious that Panera would turn into what it has today. The company, even over the past five years, still, after this pop, the stock has still underperformed the S&P 500. I know we have some people at the Fool who follow the company and recommended it a lot longer. If you've held the stock for 8 to 10 years, you've come out well ahead. It's up 300% to 400%. But over the past few years, the company has still struggled. And it's only really within the last 12 to 18 months that it became clear that 2.0 was going somewhere. I think, in the grand scheme of things, it still could be somewhat early. But like we were talking about, JAB, at this point, you just let Panera and Shaich do what they're doing, because it's clearly working. And in the restaurant space, not a lot of restaurants can say that. Hill: Right. I watched an interview that Shaich gave this morning, and one of the things he was talking about was, you go back three years when he made the famous mosh pit comment, and he was absolutely right about that. But one of the things he talked about in this interview was how long it takes. It's not just a matter of "you need an app" and make it easy for people to order. No. You have to make sure that there are people in the kitchen who are going to be able to deliver on what is being ordered. The stat that surprised me a little bit when he said it, but I suppose it makes perfect sense, when it comes to mobile ordering at Panera Bread, 70% of those orders are customized. So, it's not just someone saying, "I want a bowl of chicken soup," or "I want this sandwich." It's "I want this sandwich, I want it on this type of bread, I don't want the mayonnaise, I do want spicy mustard." All that sort of thing. They really put so much ... it's all the more impressive what they have done. It's also, if you are, for example, a Starbucks shareholder, where one of the recent stories about their business is, they're struggling a little bit with the mobile ordering front, you realize, "Oh, yeah, there's a lot more that goes into it. It's not something that can be turned around in one or two quarters."  Kretzmann: No, certainly not. I think another company that really needs to take notes from Panera and Starbucks is Chipotle. Chipotle actually took the Chief Information Officer, Curt Garner, from Starbucks about a year-and-a-half ago. Even at Chipotle, it's like going through molasses there, it's just so slow to improve the app. I love Chipotle, I'm one of their regular users, but their mobile and online ordering experience, compared to Panera and Starbucks, is just way behind. This stuff does take time. I think it just reiterates or reinforces the importance that as investors, you have to be patient. No company is going to go up in a straight line. Companies like Panera or Starbucks will go through these stumbles, but if you believe in the leadership, the long-term advantage of a company, it pays to stick it out. Even though Panera had a few years where it struggled, by and large patient investors are coming out ahead. So, I think it's critical to be patient, which is easier said than done when you are investing in a company that's going through some shorter-term stumbles. Hill: Best performing restaurant stock of the last 20 years, better than Chipotle, Starbucks, any of them. It has returned over 10,000% over a 20 year period. So, definitely a testament to long term buy and hold.  Twitter has lost Thursday night NFL games to Amazon, and it's understandable why, because Amazon ponied up five times the amount of money for the Thursday night games that Twitter did a year ago. Amazon is paying $50 million for 10 Thursday night NFL games. Kretzmann: Which is essentially the same deal that Twitter had last year. Hill: Right, although they were only paying $10 million for it. Kretzmann: Yeah, besides that. Hill: And it's not exclusive, they'll still be on the broadcast networks. This comes at a time when Amazon shares broke through the $900 barrier and hit another all time high this week. It seems like, while Amazon is the headline here, in sports, there are games where it's like, did one team win it, or did the other team just lose it? I look at this story and I know the headline is, "Amazon has won the right to stream these games." I look at it as, "No, Twitter is the loser." That, to me, is the headline. Kretzmann: Especially with Jack Dorsey coming on as CEO over the past year and a half. The company is focusing on being the live events platform, and this NFL deal seemed to be a pretty big piece of it. And it's not like Twitter is struggling for cash. I've been critical of the company, I'm a disappointed shareholder, like a lot of people, but they have over $2 billion in net cash. And this seems like the type of thing where you don't want to focus so much on immediate ROI here. So, I'd be curious to see, what was the max price that Twitter went up to and they said, "At this point it's not worth it." It reminds me of the Costco and American Express deal, where Charlie Munger at Berkshire Hathaway ... I guess he's vice chairman under Buffett, he basically said comments along the line of, "If you're American Express, you pay a little bit more and you keep that deal. Clearly, that's valuable to your brand and your competitive position." I think, if you're Twitter, you needed the NFL deal far more than Amazon needs it. But, I think it makes sense for Amazon. It beefs up their video platform. I'll be curious to see, because, they will have some time for ads during the game, so I'll be curious to see what that mix of ads looks like. Will they just be promoting Amazon NFL gear? Will they be promoting other Amazon products and services? Or will they open it up to outside advertisers? If I'm Amazon, I think this is a great opportunity to test promoting your own products and services. I would be surprised if that isn't a pretty big focus of theirs. Hill: Yeah, that was one of my thoughts when I saw the price tag. I thought, "Can they sell $50 million worth of stuff on 10 consecutive Thursday night this fall?" I think they probably can. Kretzmann: We'll find out. And, they'll bring in more Prime memberships. It makes that Prime offering, especially the video aspect. I think more people are waking up to the fact that Amazon has some quality original shows. I just found this out today, they have a partnership with the NFL already with one of their shows where they follow an NFL team through the season. Apparently, that's one of their most popular shows. I think they feel pretty good that this will be a hit. They have that data. I think this is a golden opportunity for them to venture into that live TV market and figure out how they can integrate the Amazon experience with live TV. Hill: Let's talk about your trip. We'll start with any business takeaways. You were gone for three weeks. One or two business opportunities that you saw, whether it's investing opportunities or a U.S. brand that's doing well in Australia. Did you meet up with the Fool Australia people? Kretzmann: I was able to meet up with most of them. They actually had a member event on the Friday before I left, so I was able to meet up with a lot of them. I stayed with Claude Walker, who's one of our advisors over there for Hidden Gems in Australia. Big thanks to Claude and the team for meeting up. I was able to see Joe, Uncle Joe. Hill: Nice. How is Uncle Joe? Kretzmann: Seems like he's doing well. He's heading up a fund now. What's interesting about Australia compared to the U.S. is, The Motley Fool in Australia is a big fish in a small pond. In the U.S., when it comes to retail investors, we have more clout than probably any organization in the U.S., but we're still in a big pond. Our analysts aren't jumping on conference calls talking to management. But in Australia, it's not uncommon to go on a conference call and hear a Motley Fool advisor asking questions to management. It's a different ballgame there, to some extent. But, yeah, the team over there has done some great work. Hill: Fantastic. In terms of what you saw, in terms of business and investing, share one or two things. Kretzmann: One thing to me -- this is an area that I definitely want to pay more attention to now -- is the whole payments space. I didn't actually convert any cash while I was over there. There were only two instances where I needed cash. It was either, when I needed to ride the bus, in New Zealand, and they only accept cash, they wouldn't accept a credit card. Similarly, in Australia, I needed to pay cash for a shuttle to the airport. Other than those two instances, I was able to just bring my credit card. If you have a travel card, there's no foreign transaction fees. To me, it reinforced the position especially of Visa (NYSE: V) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA). They are really bringing us toward a cash-less society. I think they have an incredible position. Also, thinking more broadly about the payment space, in New Zealand in particular, I noticed a few different retail spots that had Alipay and WeChat Pay. That's Alibaba and Tencent, two of the heavyweights in China that are rolling out their mobile pay services. So, it makes me wonder what company in that whole space has the best position? Because Alipay, WeChat Pay, that's venturing closer into PayPal's territory. Then, you have online payment processors like Stripe.  It's a whole category that, as a whole, seems to be pretty crowded, but I keep coming back to Visa and MasterCard. I think those are the toughest companies to disrupt or overtake. They have very powerful network effects at play and it shows in the financial statements. PayPal is a profitable company. They have a net profit margin of about 13% to 14%. Visa has about a 40% profit margin. Visa and MasterCard essentially have no cost of sales, so their gross margin is 96%. In the case of MasterCard, their gross profit margin is 100%. They have no cost of sales. It's just incredibly powerful and profitable companies. Their competitive position is reflected in the financial statements. That means they do have a pretty big target on their back, because if you are a company nipping at their heels, that's a pretty attractive position to be in. But I see those companies as least likely to be immediately disrupted. I want to take a closer look at those companies, for sure. A month or two ago I was watching an interview with Visa's relatively new CEO on Jim Cramer, and he was talking about the opportunity. And Cramer said, "You're a $200 billion company, but it sounds like you're just at the beginning of your opportunity." The majority of payments around the world are still in cash, so there's a huge opportunity to transition from cash to credit cards. Obviously, I would say New Zealand and Australia are probably toward the forefront as far as credit card adoption, compared to some other countries you might visit. But, that was definitely something that stuck out to me. Hill: Nice. And I'm assuming you had a little bit of fun? Kretzmann: Yeah, I had a lot of fun. Pretty much the whole trip, I was in the North Island in New Zealand, so I had some time to explore around there. I went to Hobbiton. You and Bill were talking about The Lord of the Rings yesterday. I'm not a huge The Lord of the Rings fan, I watched the three original movies and I watched maybe one and a half of the Hobbit movies. But people had told me, even if you're not a huge The Lord of the Rings fan, Hobbiton is a cool thing to check out. And I think it's probably the closest thing that New Zealand has to a Disneyland type of experience. Hill: Is it a theme park? Is it a town? What is it? Kretzmann: What it is, it's the original farm that they filmed the whole Hobbit set, this is the whole Hobbit village, so, where Bilbo and Frodo are from. Initially, when they filmed the The Lord of the Rings last decade, they essentially tore down the set. But when they returned to do The Hobbit movie, the farmer who owned that land very smartly suggested to Peter Jackson, the director, "Let's leave the set up and invite people to come here." So, it is not a cheap experience, by any means. You're paying $70 to $80 a person to get in. And they're just filling busloads by every 10 to 15 minutes. That farmer made a very smart business decision. But, it's a fun experience. You're there for a couple hours, you walk through the whole Hobbit set. It's similar to Disneyland, you're just transported to another world. And if you're a diehard The Lord of the Rings fan, it's definitely a place to go. Hill: Thanks for being here, man! Kretzmann: Great to be here! Hill: I really appreciate you coming by.

With this in mind, every Friday TriplePundit will give you a fun, easy read on a topic you care about. So, take a break from those endless email threads, and spend five minutes catching up on the latest trends in sustainability and business. In response to growing consumer pressure, food and retail companies around the world are shedding the animal husbandry practices of decades past and embracing welfare guidelines that respect the animals in their supply chains. While plenty of laggards remain, the worlds largest animal welfare NGOs call out these eight companies as leading the way in their sectors when it comes to animal welfare. Let’s hope their peers soon follow suit. 1. Marks and Spencer U.K. retail giant Marks and Spencer is no slouch when it comes to sustainability. In 2014, the company claimed that over 60 percent of the products on its shelves were sustainable, a number it seeks to increase. The company is also a leader in human rights, so its position as head of the pack on animal welfare should come as no surprise. Under its Plan A sustainability agenda, the company emphasizes food products that are fair trade, organic, free-range and cruelty-free. And its internal animal welfare standard insists animals be respected all stages of their lives – on the farm, during transportation and at the place of slaughter. Beyond food, the company stopped selling products tested on animals back in 2006, and it has never sold fur. Marks and Spencer held the highest ‘leadership’ tier in the 2016 Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare, produced by World Animal Protection, and continues to lead the retail industry in this area. 2. McDonald’s Some may be surprised to see McDonald’s on this list. In the 1990s, the fast-food chain was often targeted by groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) for alleged mistreatment of animals in its supply chain. But the company is turning things around. World Animal Protection says animal welfare is now “integral” to its business strategy. McDonald’s switched to 100 percent sustainable fish in 2013. A year later, the company said it would start sourcing sustainable beef in 2016 — a move it’s making, albeit slowly. In 2015 the company pledged to transition its egg supply chain to cage-free. The process will take 10 years, but the Humane Society of the U.S. called the decision a “watershed moment for animal welfare.” It’s also looking to clean up its infamous McNuggets and ditch deforestation in its supply chain. With restaurants in more than 100 countries and millions of animals in its supply chain, most movements by McDonald’s will take time. But the company is well-positioned to make a serious impact, even through incremental changes, as it seeks to lead its industry. 3. Unilever Unilever leads the way in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry when it comes to animal welfare. World Animal Protection also says animal welfare is now “integral” to its business strategy. Under its Sustainable Living Plan, Unilever aims to purchase all of its animal-derived ingredients from sustainable sources by 2020. And it’s already making significant progress. It sourced nearly 60 percent of its dairy from sustainable sources in 2015, and 45 percent of its eggs were cage-free. In January another Unilever brand, Hellmann’s, also pledge to phase out battery cages for egg-laying hens. (Like several Unilever brands, Hellmann’s is already cage-free in Europe.) 4. Tesco Another U.K. retailer, grocery chain Tesco also tops the animal welfare charts. It earned high marks on the World Animal Protection list and uses the Farm Animal Welfare Council’s Five Freedoms to craft its animal welfare policy. Tesco’s policy protects animals from breeding and rearing through to transport and slaughter. It also does not sell personal care or cleaning products tested on animals, and only sells items like feathers or leather if they are a byproduct of food production. The company’s focus on making the most of waste and byproducts is clear across its supply chain, and it is the only U.K. retailer to publish annual data about its food waste. 5. Walmart Walmart is best known as an ‘everything’ big-box store, but few know it’s also the largest food retailer in the U.S. After years of pressure from consumers and NGOs, in 2015 Walmart adopted a welfare policy animal protection groups called “groundbreaking.” The policy was especially noteworthy, the groups said, because it engages the company’s entire supply chain and covers a wide range of issues — from antibiotic use to housing systems. “The policy applies to all of the company’s U.S. operations, including its subsidiary, Sam’s Club,” 3p’s Gina-Marie Cheeseman reported. “Walmart is committed to selling products that sustain people and the environment,” Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and senior vice president of Walmart sustainability, said in a statement announcing the new policy. “We have listened to our customers, and are asking our suppliers to engage in improved reporting standards and transparency measures regarding the treatment of farm animals.” The company now receives respectable marks on the World Animal Protection scorecard, and earned recognition from the likes of Mercy for Animals and the Humane Society of the U.S. 6. Wendy’s Wendy’s rolled out its first animal welfare guidelines in the mid-1990s and began routinely auditing its suppliers. It established an Animal Welfare Council in 2001. Made up of executives from across the company, the council is tasked with regularly reviewing and strengthening Wendy’s animal welfare standards. Its standards now include housing, transportation and slaughter requirements for cows, pigs and chickens across its supply chain. America’s third-largest hamburger chain also pledged to switch to cage-free eggs by 2020, and it’s making progress on phasing out antibiotics. NGOs are mounting pressure on food companies to phase out the unnecessary use of antibiotics, arguing overuse of antibiotics in farm animals can expedite antibiotic resistance in humans. Only two years ago, Wendy’s was considered a laggard in this space — earning a failing grade in a 2015 scorecard from the Natural Resources Defense Council and other NGOs. After testing antibiotic-free chicken in some markets and taking steps to improve its antibiotic policy, the company bumped that up to a C grade on the 2016 scorecard. 7. Nestle Nestle has come under increasing fire in North America for its water-sourcing practices. But the global food and beverage giant is making significant strides toward greater animal welfare. Nestle became the first major food company to form an international partnership with an animal welfare organization when it linked up with World Animal Protection International in 2014. The resulting welfare policy aimed to phase out veal crates for calves, gestation crates for pigs and battery cages for egg-laying hens. The company extended its policy across its supplier base. It pledged to work with suppliers found in violation of its code, and cut ties with suppliers who failed to comply. World Animal Protection recognized Nestle for its established welfare policy, while noting it still has work to do. 8. Chipotle Chipotle was a fast favorite among the sustainability set. In 2013, it became the first fast-food company to disclose all the ingredients in its menu items, including genetically-modified (GMO) foods. Two years later, it drew cheers from the animal welfare community when it cut ties with a major pork supplier for violating the company’s standards — even if it meant a shortage of pork at hundreds of restaurants. After a highly public outbreak of E. coli, salmonella and norovirus in 2016, the company’s position faltered a bit. The company continued to be outspoken about its vision for healthy, natural and humane food. And earlier this year, it rolled out a new animal welfare policy in partnership with Compassion in World Farming USA and the Humane Society of the U.S. World Animal Protection notes that Chipotle is still working to implement its policies, but as a fairly new company compared to its competitors in the space, it’s making good progress so far.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 7, 2017 at 2:00PM Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and "initiate coverage" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope... Up less than 5% in 12 months, shares of retail giant Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) have lagged the rest of the S&P 500 by more than 10 percentage points over the past year. But could happy days be here again? Two analysts think so. This morning, first tiny Telsey Advisory Group announced it is upgrading shares of Wal-Mart to outperform and raising its price target more than 12% to $82 a share. Shortly after, Jefferies & Co. chimed in with an endorsement of its own, reiterating its buy rating on Wal-Mart stock and doubling down on an $86 price target. Here are three things you need to know about that. Image source: Getty Images. 1. The tale Telsey told Physical retail is a mess. Left and right, we see retail companies filing for bankruptcy (RadioShack, hhgreggg, Payless, and maybe soon Sears as well), or seeking to sell out to avoid it, as Staples is said to be doing. Amazon.com's low prices and ever-quicker delivery options are simply wreaking havoc among the brick-and-mortar crowd. But perversely, that could be good news for companies that manage to survive to pick up the pieces (and the market share) of their fallen rivals. According to Telsey Advisory Group, as the biggest physical retailer in the world, Wal-Mart Stores is one such likely survivor. StreetInsider.com notes that Telsey believes Wal-Mart is "regaining dominance in the physical retail game" both at its eponymous retail stores and at Sam's Club warehouse stores as well.  This, says the analyst, should help Wal-Mart to grow its profits slightly this year (from $4.38 to $4.40 per share), and lead to even stronger profits growth in fiscal 2018, when Telsey sees Wal-Mart growing earnings 6.6% to $4.69 per share. 2. Jefferies remains optimistic At the same time, Jefferies argues that investors should not overlook Wal-Mart's substantial online operations. It notes that Wal-Mart's CEO claims the company enjoys "a multiplier effect" from selling goods online to folks who can pick up their purchases immediately at physical stores, while those same stores give otherwise online shoppers a chance to try on and try out goods, and buy them in person. Jefferies also believes that Wal-Mart's purchase of Jet.com will improve its online business with "Smart Cart proprietary technology that adjusts prices in real time based on proximity of product to the shopper and shipping costs." Both observations tend to support Telsey's finding that Wal-Mart is enjoying "stronger sales ... in the digital market." 3. The proof is in the pudding But can any support for all this be found in Wal-Mart's financials? Perhaps -- and perhaps not. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, even as its rivals are flailing, Wal-Mart's U.S. retail stores have enjoyed a combined 16.5% worth of revenue growth over the past five years, while Sam's Club sales are up 6.7%. Profits, however, are lower at both of these two big Wal-Mart businesses over the same period, with the company earning less money from its retail stores -- and its wholesale stores as well -- last year than it did in 2012. Last year alone, total operating profits at Wal-Mart dipped more than 5%, even as sales continued to grow. What it means for investors This may be the cost of doing business in the U.S. (or even remaining in business) for Wal-Mart. Everywhere you look, one competitor (Amazon.com) continues to gain market share even as it becomes more and more profitable, while others (Staples, for example) struggle and look for a buyout, and still others (Payless most recently, and soon, perhaps, Sears) simply throw in the towel go out of business. Yes, Wal-Mart survives -- but is simply surviving a good enough reason to own Wal-Mart stock? I'm not so sure it is. Valued on P/E, Wal-Mart stock currently costs 16.6 times trailing earnings. Even were it earning today what Telsey says it might earn two years from now, the stock's P/E ratio would still be 15.5, which seems a mite expensive for a company growing profits not at all today, maybe a modicum next year, and only 6.6% the year after that. When you get right down to it, even if Telsey is right about Wal-Mart being a survivor, and even if Jefferies is right, too, the stock still doesn't look cheap enough to buy.

If you work part time, rent a spare bedroom, or provide car rides or other goods and services, you may still owe Uncle Sam if payments are in cash or if there is an information return like a Form 1099 or Form W-2. 2. Some business expenses may qualify for deductions. For example, a taxpayer who uses his or her car for business often qualifies to claim the standard mileage rate, which was 54 cents a mile for 2016. 3. If you rent out your home, apartment or other dwelling but also live in it during the year, special rules may apply. For more about these rules, see IRS Publication 527, Residential Rental Property (Including Rental of Vacation Home). 4. The U.S. tax system is pay-as-you-go. Those in the gig economy often need to make estimated tax payments during the year to cover their obligations. Payments are due April 15, June 15, Sept. 15 and Jan. 15. Use Form 1040-ES to figure these out. 5. If you work a gig but are also employed at another job, you can often avoid making estimated tax payments by having more tax withheld from your paycheck. File Form W-4 with your employer to request additional witholding. You’ve retired, but you want some extra cash in your pocket? Join the “gig” economy and pick up what’s known as a “side hustle.” Side hustles can be as simple as reselling, says John Tarnoff, author of Boomer Reinvention: How to Create Your Dream Career Over 50: “I learned of an insurance agent who shops at Walmart on Black Friday and then sells the items he bought at a deep discount for four times their original price on eBay.” Some seniors are doing driving gigs for Lyft or Uber, or renting out spare rooms on Silvernest.com or AirBnB.com, or pet-sitting for DogVacay. Some are  delivering groceries for Instacart or running errands for TaskRabbit, or selling their expertise on freelancer sites such as Fiverr.com. Some are coaching youth sports. Money and flexibility are key reasons for retirees to step back onto the workplace stage, as is supplementing their savings. Roughly 65 percent of baby boomers say they plan to work past age 65 or do not plan to retire at all. Sixty-eight percent of Americans age 50 to 64 say they are worried about not having enough money for retirement. And 40 percent of those nearing retirement age have zero savings. For those who do have money in the bank, the median balance — half have more, half have less — is just $100,000, according to figures from the 2014 Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies survey and Federal Reserve data. The gig economy is all about short-term, less formal employment arrangements — and offers the opportunity for experimentation and reinvention. For Cecelia Hodge and Kiwi Nicholson, it's about coaching tennis. Hodge, 65, of Philadelphia, a retired brokerage assistant for Wachovia, played tennis competitively and travels for tournaments around the country. Once she retired three years ago, she began volunteering to coach kids at Philadelphia's Althea Gibson Center. Ultimately, she joined Down the Line and Beyond, a nonprofit that hosts tennis programs in basements, classrooms, gyms, even on concrete parking lots. She and Nicholson, 65, of Elkins Park, love their coaching gigs — and it doesn’t hurt that coaches are paid $20 an hour. (Information at DowntheLineandBeyond.org.) “Our entire coaching staff are retirees,” Hodge said. “We need people who can come at any time, and are consistent.” Said Nicholson, a retired telecommunications engineer: “Tennis keeps me young. You can never stop going, never stop playing.” When pursuing your second or third career, Tarnoff advises, embrace your age and be grateful for your experiences, but avoid arrogance. "A resumé is a good reference tool, but it is not a good marketing tool," he writes,  noting that 85 percent of jobs are filled through referrals. Use social media to build relationships and an active professional network. Turn the interview process to your advantage: Ask what problems need solving and position yourself as a valuable solution-finder. Ignore any age bias you encounter, he adds. "Show by your attitude that you have absolutely no problems dealing with younger people. Remember that you’re not there to teach them a lesson or tell them war stories. Instead, you’re there to be of service and to provide value to their business." Of course, you might try starting your own business. The Women's Opportunities Resource Center is offering a seminar in conjunction with AARP and the Hartford called "Work for Yourself@50+" from 6 to 8 p.m. June 13 at the center's second-floor training room, 2010 Chestnut St. (Information at http://www.worc-pa.com/ or by calling the AARP Foundation at 1-888-339-5617.) The program is specifically designed to help people 50 and older learn what it takes to be successfully self-employed in today's economy. "We had one most recently in March at the Philadelphia Free Library, and the response was very strong," said WORC direct Lynne Cutler.  Home sharing is among the ways a rising number of retirees and empty-nesters are setting themselves up in gig-economy businesses, according to Wendi Burkhardt, founder of Silvernest.com, a roommate-pairing service and rental website for seniors. Among seniors over age 65 who make less than $25,000 a year, 43 percent would share their homes, she said. Seven in 10 women end up alone as seniors, and Pew/AARP statistics show an increased rate of death by 26 percent if you live alone over age 45, Burkhardt noted. So you can make money and stay healthier by renting out your house? “There's a lot of studies about health and well-being, the impact of connectivity, and having someone in your space every day is really powerful. It's phenomenal,” she said. Silvernest is different from AirBnb in that it finds long-term renters, typically for six to 12 months. It has more than 15,000 users and has matched 11,000 roomies in the last 16 months, she said. Cost is $29.99 in a one-time use fee for three months. The average age of a homeowner is 60, and 70 percent of homeowners renting out space are female. The average age of renters is 40. For retirees who work for Instacart or another delivery gig, you’ll generally need a smartphone and transportation. “We have two models: full-time contractor jobs who shop and deliver all in the same trip; the second is people who shop with partners like Reading Terminal, DiBruno Bros., BJ's, Petco, SnapKitchen, and Weavers Way, Acme, or Whole Foods. They do nothing but shop. They get the list, talk to the customer, put it in a staging area for Instacart. Another contractor comes and picks it up; scans it in, and then delivers it,” said David Schloss, general manager for Instacart, who oversees Philadelphia as part of his region. The gig economy often gets a bad rap about low pay. “We make a concerted effort to pay above minimum wage and we benchmark against existing gigs,” Schloss said. Locally, Instacart pays an average of $11 to $15 an hour.

MUNCIE, Ind.– A man who pleaded guilty to leaving a backpack meth lab inside a Walmart bathroom in Muncie learned his sentence Thursday. Tyler Armstrong, 25, was sentenced to complete a county drug program. If he fails to do that, he will serve five years for aiding, inducing or causing dealing in meth. He would receive 488 days credit for serving time in jail. The discovery was originally made in a front bathroom by the cash registers. A Walmart official said an alert worker saw a man with a backpack who was seen in the store several times before making purchases related to the meth-making process. The employee informed police, who were already in the store and trailing the suspicious man. The man went into the bathroom with the backpack, but came out moments later without it. When police looked inside the backpack, they found tools consistent with a type of meth cooking known as “shake and bake” or “one pot.” Armstrong was arrested later at a Taco Bell in Muncie. Police said Armstrong tried to resist the officers, but was subdued and taken into custody.

Consumer discretionary companies have low ratios, FANG companies have high ratios. Mark Fahey | @marktfahey 14 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters These companies should be worried about wage growth    11 Hours Ago | 01:33 The unemployment rate continues to fall and wages continue to rise. That's good news for workers, but not for the companies that are most reliant on labor. Retail companies like Wal-Mart, Staples or Gap are worth $50,000 to $100,000 in market capitalization for each person they employ. That's much lower than average, indicating that those companies would be hit harder by a dollar increase in wages. On the flip side, tech titans Netflix and Facebook are worth more than $10 million for each employee, a figure that suggests to analysts that wage increases will be less of a burden on the companies' bottom lines. Hourly wages rose by 2.7 percent year over year in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report released Friday. That's slightly less of a gain than last month, but continues the general upward climb over the last few years. Those additional costs have hit wage-sensitive stocks more than others, especially consumer discretionary companies. In the Dow 30, companies like Wal-Mart, McDonald's, IBM, Home Depot, United Technologies and Caterpillar have a lower ratio indicating a higher exposure to wages. Companies like Apple, Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, Chevron, Johnson & Johnson and Chevron are worth almost five times more per employee. Public companies in real estate, energy, utilities, information technology and health care tend to have much higher ratios, while companies in consumer discretionary, consumer staples, industrials and materials are more labor-dependent, according to that metric. In a February research note, Thomas Lee of Fundstrat noted that without Amazon and Netflix, consumer discretionary stocks would be level with the market. Despite that classification, the two companies are far less exposed to wages than the average stock in that sector. If we look at just the top 50 most labor-exposed and 50 least exposed, it's clear that as a group the companies with lower ratios have underperformed, while the opposite group has pushed ahead of the overall index. The FANG companies — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet — as a group score remarkably well by this metric. They're worth five times more per employee than the S&P overall, and exceed even real estate investment trusts and the technology sector as a whole, according to Lee's research. As wage inflation heats up, Lee recommends looking for stocks with similar profiles, which he calls "alternative FANGs" — stocks with long-term positive returns and revenue growth and a market capitalization per employee ratio at the top of the stack. While wage inflation does tend to hit some sectors much harder than others, alternative FANGs can be found across every sector. Some of Lee's recommendations include T-Mobile, Stamps.com and Vail Resorts.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Trump trade threats force export-dependent Vietnam to pivot Friday Apr 7, 2017 at 12:00 PM Apr 7, 2017 at 12:00 PM Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen and John Boudreau Bloomberg President Donald Trump's withdrawal from a Pacific Rim trade deal was viewed as a glancing blow by Vietnam's Phu Tai Corp., which makes furniture for Wal-Mart outlets. The knockout punch may come if he follows through on threats of protectionism. From a possible border tax to higher tariffs, America's push to reset trade relations is putting Vietnam's small economy at risk. Phu Tai, based in a central province, relies on the U.S. for 40 percent of sales, and some business may evaporate if its dining-room sets and outdoor chairs become too expensive. "If protectionism rises in the U.S., it will hurt countries like Vietnam that rely on exports," said Nguyen Sy Hoe, the company's deputy general director. "The government needs to help companies." Vietnam sells a fifth of its exports to the U.S., making it one of the few Asian nations counting America as a bigger market for their goods than China. Yet Vietnam's $32 billion trade surplus with the U.S. puts it in the crosshairs of the White House after Trump ordered a study to identify any "trade abuse" fueling American deficits. Trump also professed support for a border adjustment tariff to encourage production of goods in the U.S. and reduce incentives for companies to move overseas. Higher taxes on U.S. importers would reduce Vietnam's gross domestic product by almost 0.9 percent, the most negative effect on any Asian country, Credit Suisse Group economists Santitarn Sathirathai and Michael Wan said in a January report. "If the U.S. creates a new wave of protectionism, Vietnam will be very vulnerable," said Alexander Vuving, a Vietnam political analyst at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. The U.S. will investigate countries running the biggest bilateral trade deficits to assess the extent they're caused by "cheating or inappropriate behavior," U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said. That tone is triggering alarm in Hanoi. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told his cabinet that U.S. protectionist policies could hurt the economy and lead to a slowdown in exports and foreign investment. The rhetoric comes at an inopportune time for a nation where foreign technology titans Samsung Electronics, Intel Corp. and LG Display have set up shop. Companies relocated factories to Vietnam from China in recent years because of the latter's rising costs and shrinking labor force. Since introducing market-oriented "doi moi" changes in the 1980s, Vietnam has increasingly tethered itself to global trade, helping transform an agrarian economy into a manufacturing hub of everything from shoes to smartphones. Exports surged to a record $177 billion last year, with U.S. customers accounting for about $42 billion of that -- more than double compared to five years ago. Mobile phones and parts make up the biggest segment at about 27 percent. The most-recent GDP figures show how trade-dependent Vietnam has become. Samsung's decision to scrap production of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone last year spurred an 11 percent decline in shipments of phones and parts during the first quarter, the national statistics office said. That played a role in curbing growth of gross domestic product to just 5.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with the 6.25 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Phuc called the slower rate "very worrisome" and asked ministries to find "suitable solutions," according to an April 3 posting on the government's website. The government is targeting 6.7 percent growth this year. Just the threat of American trade barriers is denting exports for some homegrown manufacturers. Thanh Hoa-based Delta Sport Joint-Stock Co. saw a 20 percent drop in U.S. orders for its sportswear during the first quarter, Chief Executive Officer Nguyen Trong Thau said. Last year, shipments to the U.S. represented about 40 percent of its exports, or the equivalent of $30 million in revenue. Customers include Wal-Mart Stores and Mizuno Corp., according to its website. "Some of our American retailer clients are concerned about some uncertainty in the policies of the new administration," Thau said. "We're a bit worried about the outlook of our exports to the U.S." The Trans-Pacific Partnership would have benefited Vietnam by reducing or, in some cases, eliminating U.S. import tariffs. Without U.S. participation, Vietnam is pivoting toward Plan B. Government officials vowed to push through structural changes to the economy required under the deal, including reforming state-owned enterprises and strengthening enforcement of intellectual-property protections. They're also pushing sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing to improve efficiency and product quality. The science and technology ministry recently organized a business trip to the U.S. for Vietnamese companies to meet prospective clients, and the government is helping market their goods. "In the current environment, it's crucial for us to improve our competitiveness," said Tran Viet Thanh, the deputy minister of science and technologies. Hanoi may explore ways to keep TPP alive even without U.S. participation, said Michael Michalak, regional managing director of the U.S.-Asean Business Council and former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. One alternative would be bilateral or small-group deals with neighbors or Latin American countries on the basis of the earlier negotiations, he said. "I don't think they want to see those six years go to waste," he said. "There are opportunities there to build on." That's what furniture supplier Phu Tai is trying to do. It's spending about 140 billion dong ($6.2 million) to build a factory in coastal Binh Dinh province to boost capacity and cut out the middlemen it uses for Wal-Mart, Hoe said. Shares rose the most in a week Friday. "That will help us save a lot more in costs," he said. "We must be more competitive to cope with what protectionism may bring about." ---  Bloomberg's David Roman contributed.

Attrino | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Anthony G. Attrino | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com NJ.com Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 07, 2017 at 11:18 AM, updated April 07, 2017 at 11:28 AM comments TETERBORO - The mother of an 8-year-old boy has filed suit against Wal-mart alleging that improperly stacked soup cans fell from a display and struck her son on the head, causing serious injuries. Shakiba Kirby claims in court documents she was in the vegetable aisle with her son on May 5, 2016 when the falling cans hit the boy, opening a cut on the bridge of his nose and nearly knocking him out. "The cans of soup fell on him from a height of 6 feet, hitting the boy on the head," said attorney David Silverstein, who filed suit on March 23 in Bergen County Superior Court. "According to the mother, they were walking by the display when the cans fell." The boy was taken to Hackensack University Medical Center bleeding and complaining of headaches, the attorney said. He was released from the hospital with stitches, Silverstein said. The incident occurred at the store at 1 Teterboro Landing Drive, according to court papers. The suit accuses Wal-mart employees of being negligent in failing by "allowing soup cans to be improperly stacked," creating a danger to customers. The suit claims the boy suffered severe and permanent injuries and that the family incurred "large sums of money for medical and hospital care." The suit seeks a jury trial and unspecified monetary damages along with costs of the suit. A Wal-mart spokesman said the big-box store takes safety seriously. "The safety of our associates and customers is among our top priorities," spokesman Ragan Dickens said in an email. "While we have not been served yet, we take these claims seriously and will defend ourselves in court." Anthony G. Attrino may be reached at tattrino@njadvancemedia.com.

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Apr 7, 2017 at 9:41AM Rapid top- and bottom-line growth, bullet proof balance sheets, and innovation-first management teams make Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Celgene Corp.(NASDAQ:CELG) incredibly intriguing stocks to buy in portfolios. A forest of opportunity Amazon.com is dominating online retail, yet its sales would need to nearly triple to match bricks-and-mortar giant Wal-Mart Stores, and investments in innovation could help this company become much, much bigger in the coming decade. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In the past year, Amazon's sales surged 27% higher to $136 billion, and this year, industry watchers think that Amazon's revenue could jump again to $165 billion. Driving the company's growth is CEO Jeff Bezos unwavering focus on new products and services that can make Amazon more meaningful to consumers. Thanks to Bezos vision, Amazon Prime has become a leading source for consumer entertainment, and Amazon's devices, including tablets and, more recently, virtual assistants, are providing increasingly more ways for Amazon to cozy up with consumers. As Amazon introduces increasingly more relevent products and solutions to consumers, and it discovers new ways to deliver those solutions more quickly, I believe its bottom-line will soar. Already, we're seeing evidence of this. Net income grew far more quickly than revenue last year, and as higher revenue is leveraged against fixed costs, that trend should continue. I'm not alone in that thinking. Industry watchers believe Amazon's sales will grow more than 20% in both 2017 and 2018, and they forecast EPS growth will double and triple their sales growth projections, respectively. AUTHOR'S CHART. Cashing in on connections Facebook can't have any more room for growth, can it? After all, you have to try pretty hard to find someone that's unfamiliar with the social media Goliath. Yet, CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks his company's monthly active users can more than double from about 2 billion today to 5 billion by 2030. Resting on Facebook's laurels won't help him hit that target, so Zuckerberg's committing big money to expanding Facebook's services into adjacent markets, such as messaging, video, search, and gaming. Zuckerberg's acquisition of Oculus VR, and rumors of forthcoming consumer electronics devices suggest that Facebook plans on riding tailwinds associated with next-generation technology too, including the Internet of Things. While those investments ingrain Facebook more deeply into current user's lives, big picture projects, such as delivering Wi-Fi to far flung regions of the world, introduce Facebook to new, heavily populated markets, like Africa. Funding all of these projects isn't cheap, but Facebook's massive size means it's got the financial firepower necessary. The company's sales surged 57% to $26.9 billion in 2016, and momentum has folks pegging revenue of $37.9 billion in 2017. Net income jumped an eye-popping 177% to $10.2 billion in 2016, and if the company hits sales targets this year, EPS could climb to $5.42 from $3.49 in 2016. Only time will tell if Facebook's user base grows the way Zuckerberg hopes it will, but given his track-record, a massive installed base already, and an increasingly attractive income statement, I'm betting on him, not against him. Game-changing drug development The biotech industry is notoriously hit and miss, but Celgene's track record has undeniably been dominated by the former. Celgene established itself as a biotech leader when it launched the multiple myeloma drug Revlimid in 2005, and today, Revlimid is one of the world's top selling drugs. It's the market-share leading first- and second-line therapy used in the indication, and research that's expanded its use to more patients translated into $7 billion in sales in 2016. Over the years, Celgene's successfully added not one, but three additional blockbusters to its product portfolio. In 2012, it launched the lung cancer and pancreatic cancer drug Abraxane, in 2013, it launched the third-line multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst, and in 2014, it launched the psoriasis drug Otezla. Last year, sales of those drugs totaled $973 million, $1.3 billion, and $1 billion, respectively. Soon, Celgene may be able to count two more drugs as top-sellers. Earlier this year, management reported results from a clinical trial of ozanimod in multiple sclerosis that were impressive, and the FDA is already reviewing a new leukemia drug -- enasidenib -- that Celgene co-developed with Agios. If ozanimod wins FDA approval next year, its arguably best-in-class safety could propel it to one billion dollars in sales quickly. Meanwhile, a decision on enasineb is expected on Aug. 30, and that means Celgene could add a new source of sales as soon as the third quarter of 2016. Given the company's R&D prowess (and its high-profile collaborations), it's not surprising that management's got high hopes for revenue and profit growth. This year, it's forecasting sales will climb 18% to at least $13 billion in 2016. It also thinks EPS will jump 21% to $7.10. That's impressive growth, but even more impressive is management's outlook for 2020. While regulatory rejections or trial failures could derail its forecast, it's targeting sales of over $21 billion and EPS of over $13 that year. With an outlook like that, it seems smart to be shareholder.    Todd Campbell owns shares of Amazon, Celgene, and Facebook.

Shoppers reported spotting a large lizard in the Miami store Thursday evening and a Walmart employee summoned the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Venom One Unit to remove the potentially dangerous animal. "When Venom 1 unit arrived they spotted a spiny lizard standing near some shopping carts," Erika Benitez of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue told Patch. "Several store patrons had spotted the lizard walking around and they became concerned." The foot-long lizard was captured by Lt. Lisa Wood. Rescuers theorized the iguana might have been pregnant and looking for a place to nest. "It might have been a situation where she was looking for a place to lay eggs," Lt. Felipe Lay of Miami-Dade County Fire Rescue said. "It was probably nesting." The rhino iguana was turned over to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, which Lay said would provide medical care to the lizard before it is released into a more suitable environment than Walmart. Experts said rhino iguanas are popular pets because of their impressive appearance and can be tamed, but some members of the species have been known to act aggressively and bite humans.

Barrick Gold, Randgold, Gold Fields — These and other gold mining stocks are rallying Friday morning, as the Syrian air strikes prompted safe-haven buying in gold. Twitter — The company refused a government order to reveal the name of a user with an anti-Trump account. Twitter has filed a lawsuit blocking that order, aimed at finding out who is behind the account that focuses on opposition to the president's immigration policies. Alphabet — The company's YouTube unit unveiled a new policy that places ads on channels only after they reach 10,000 views. The move is aimed at preventing those who post unauthorized content from making money by doing so. Yum Brands — The parent of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell will cut the use of antibiotics in chickens bought for its KFC restaurants. The restaurant operator is giving poultry suppliers until the end of 2018 to stop using the antibiotics, joining McDonald's and Chick-fil-A and doing so among the biggest restaurant chicken sellers. Southwest Airlines — The airline reported a March increase in revenue passenger miles of 3.9 percent compared to a year ago. Twilio — The stock was upgraded to "overweight" from "neutral" at J.P. Morgan Securities, which said the cloud communications company has a number of unappreciated aspects. They include better valuation after the stock tumbled from its September highs, and the fact that Amazon's Web Services unit is increasingly using Twilio to power a number of its new products. Amazon.com — Amazon will create 30,000 new part-time jobs over the next year, which would nearly double its U.S. part-time workforce. 25,000 of those will be in warehouses, while the rest will be home-based. The Buckle — The stock was upgraded to "hold" from "sell" at Deutsche Bank, which said there is support for the apparel and accessories retailer's shares at current levels. Deutsche Bank did say it was still cautious about the company's long-term prospects. Ruby Tuesday — The restaurant chain posted an adjusted loss of 6 cents per share as well as a same-restaurant sales drop of four percent. The company also named former Burger King and Cosi executive Jim Hyatt as its next chief executive officer. Fiat Chrysler — The automaker's Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne will remain in that position until 2019, according to a report in an Italian daily financial newspaper. WD-40 — WD-40 posted quarterly profit of 87 cents per share, three cents short of estimates, while revenue also fell short of forecasts. It also cut its sales guidance for the full year. The company said currency issues are masking the strength of its business. PriceSmart — PriceSmart fell 2 cents short of estimates with quarterly profit of 90 cents per share, and the discount retailer's revenue also was less than analysts had expected.

The employee, who says she became a U.S. citizen 20 years ago after emigrating from El Salvador, said she began recording the video Thursday after the man said he wanted a white employee to assist him. "It has hurt me a lot because we are working people. We pay our taxes. We have children who study in college," said Adela, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used because she is concerned for her well-being. Adela did not identify the man in the video, which was sent to The Dallas Morning News by a friend on Facebook who said Adela works at the Wal-Mart's optical center. The man had complained he couldn't see well with the glasses he was picking up at the store on North MacArthur Boulevard near Interstate 635. After Adela referred him to a doctor to check his prescription, the man demanded to be helped by a white employee.  "You're being racist," Adela said she told him. She went to get her supervisor, who is white, but she was busy on a conference call. Adela said she began recording the video on her cellphone after the man complained about a black woman in an electric wheelchair. “Look at that, who do you think pays her hospital bills?" the man says on the video.  "I don't know, you can ask her," Adela says. "I do," he says pointing at himself. "I pay her hospital bills. She’s a foreigner. She came over here. She got sick and fat and obese, and she can’t do anything. She can’t work," he says. "But I have to pay her bills. See what I mean? Am I fat and obese? I go to work every day. I pay taxes.” Adela responds: “OK, me, too. I pay my own taxes, too.”   “All of these foreigners are living off of us good working white people. Yes, I’m just telling you the truth," he says, laughing. "It’s all right. I know you ain’t leaving. I know you’re here to stay. Y’all should go to your own countries and fix up your own countries.” “OK, sir, I don’t want to hear that anymore. That’s it,” the employee says as her supervisor comes to assist the man. After the man left, Adela said she showed the video to her supervisor. "I told her I was in shock," she said. "I didn't know what to do, whether to cry. I felt very bad."   Her supervisor asked two Wal-Mart employees to watch for the man, but Adela said he later called to cancel a follow-up appointment.  Adela said she'd never faced discrimination the way she did last week. Before she became a citizen, she was a legal permanent resident of the United States. A manager working Sunday at the Wal-Mart said he was unaware of the incident. He said such situations are investigated internally and directed questions to the corporate media office, which could not be reached for comment.

Courtesy photoEditor’s note: This story by Caleigh Cross was first published in the Stowe Reporter on April 6. The Vermont Country Store team got a sense of “which way the wind blows,” as owner Eliot Orton put it. The team may not have left with a firm “yes” from the Stowe Development Review Board on its development plans for Mountain Road, but wasn’t looking for one quite yet. The company had a conversation with Stowe residents and the board about whether the Vermont Country Store operation would be welcome. The business, owned by brothers Eliot, Cabot and Gardner Orton and their father, Lyman Orton, hasn’t opened a store in 50 years, Eliot Orton said. The original store was in Weston; the “new one” is in Rockingham, just south of Bellows Falls. For the last decade, the brothers have been looking for a good spot in northern Vermont for a third store. “Community is a big part of our decision. … We wanted to be in a place we wanted to stay in and be,” Eliot Orton said. “Our stores represent a bit of what Vermont represents — going back in time.” He described the Vermont Country Store as “purveyors of the practical and hard to find.” The company was asking the development review board for a partial, conditional review. It has an agreement to buy the property where Stowe Motel and Snowdrift are located on the Mountain Road. The store needs a traffic study and a storm water study before it can get full town approval — and then it will buy the property. Vermont Country Store is proposing one large building, nearly 17,000 square feet, that will house three retail spaces. The three-store proposal is an effort to comply with town policies limiting retail stores to a maximum of 5,000 square feet. That requirement was adopted to prevent big-box stores such as Wal-Mart or Home Depot from opening in Stowe. “Portioning out our business is not standard practice for us,” acknowledged Geof Brown, executive vice president and chief storekeeper at Vermont Country Store. Brown asked the board to look at this departure from the ordinary as a sign of the Ortons’ willingness to work within town parameters. One store will have an entrance from Mountain Road and a second store entrance will face Luce Hill Road. The third store will be constructed later. That ruffled some feathers among the 60 or so people at the meeting, who thought the three-store plan was just a way to sidestep the zoning regulations. Would this set a precedent to allow a Wal-Mart to come to Stowe, they wondered? Graham Mink, who owns the building at 109 Main St. where his wife, Cristina, runs Country Store on Main, said the plan is “directly opposed” to zoning regulations. “They’re trying to circumvent the regulations and alter the scale and type of development allowed” in town. Mink also thinks the Vermont Country Store would “severely hurt the recently revitalized Stowe village” by making it hard for smaller local businesses to compete. Orton countered Mink’s concerns. “Would a Wal-Mart come in and split up into 20 different stores?” he asked. “Probably not. … When we first encountered (the 5,000-square-foot retail rule), we thought, ‘How are we going to deal with that?’ We want to stick with the letter of the law. We’re not trying to hide anything. We put together a design splitting this up” to adhere to the zoning laws. Stowe businesses need not worry too much about retail competition, Orton said. “We’re not going to put up a sign that says, ‘Cheapest Maple in Town.’” “My biggest concern is that our village has been empty and sad,” said Trudy Trombley, who owns Stowe Mercantile, the Boutique and Stowe Public House with her husband, Marc Sherman. “The biggest problem is getting people off Mountain Road. … Our businesses all have a story. All of us have worked very hard.” Trombley thinks the Ortons’ large, bustling store on Mountain Road will make people less likely to want to navigate Mountain Road traffic to the village. “I just hate to see that big of a store” come to town, Trombley said. “I don’t want to lose what our village has worked hard for.” Other Stowe residents were enthusiastic about the proposed stores, such as Jed Lipsky, who says he knew the founding proprietor, Orton brothers’ grandfather Vrest Orton. “When I hear them talk about what Vermont Country Store does in Rockingham,” like supporting community events and organizations, “that attracts me,” Lipsky said. “Our town plan cannot be based on protectionism. That’s not really the American way. No one’s looking to bring big-box stores to Stowe.” Beth Gadbois backed Lipsky up. “I own three businesses in Stowe,” she said, “and I believe that a rising tide lifts all ships. I couldn’t be more thrilled you’ve chosen our town. We have a tendency in Stowe that drives me bananas toward elitism. Competition is the American way.” Talk then turned to traffic. “We have no opinions on the store,” said the Rev. Rick Swanson, pastor of St. John’s in the Mountains Episcopal Church, which sits directly at the intersection of Mountain Road and Luce Hill Road. “You can barely get onto Mountain Road from Luce Hill Road for all the traffic,” Swanson said. “I just hope you’ll take traffic into serious consideration.” The development review board tabled the discussion after four hours. The board will discuss the plan again on June 20, when the Vermont Country Store team will be back for round two.

Removing the impact of weather should add about 100,000 payrolls back to the total, in LaVorgna’s view, in-line with recent trends. Indeed, the household employment survey (which wasn’t weather affected) posted its best result since February 2016. Looking ahead, the economic calendar is relatively light with just updates on job openings and producer price inflation. Friday will be busier, with consumer price inflation and retail sales on the docket.

The Pennsylvania Department of Property and Supplies had begun reviewing the final plans for the project in January of that year. 25 years ago On April 14, 1992, Wal-Mart Inc. announced that it would build a regional distribution center in Clearfield County. The project was expected to cost $30 million and create 300 new jobs when it opened in the fall of 1993. 10 years ago In April 2007, members of the Borough Council mulled the possibility of making State College the fifth Pennsylvania municipality to outlaw smoking in enclosed public places.

Allen David Adams, 26, was booked at the Flagler County jail this afternoon on a manslaughter-drunk driving charge and a DUI-property damage charge in the death of his girlfriend, Brittany Lee Pitt, 26, in a motorcycle wreck on Old Dixie Highway last May. Adams, a Walmart forklift operator whose Harley Davidson sported a “Support Your Local Outlaws” decal, almost immediately posted bail on $102,500 bond. The wreck took place where the southbound exit off I-95 merges with Old Dixie Highway, on May 14, 2016, at 12:40 a.m. Adams was operating his 2014 Harley, going south on I-95 with Pitt sitting behind him. He took the exit and passed another vehicle on the ramp as he was approaching the yield sign at the intersection, according to his arrest report. Kenneth Tonak III, a 32-year-old resident of Hastings, was at the wheel of a black Chrysler Journey, an SUV, driving west on Old Dixie Highway, toward U.S. 1. Adams was supposed to yield to Tonak. He did not do so, violating Tonak’s right of way, according to the arrest report. Brittany Lee Pitt in an image from her Facebook page.When Adams realized that the Chrysler was immediately behind him, he gunned his motorcycle, accelerating across both lanes of the two-lane Old Dixie, toward the grassy shoulder on the south side of the road. The sudden acceleration caused Pitt to fall on the pavement around the yellow double-lines. Tonak tried to avoid hitting Adams’s motorcycle by swerving left into the opposite lane, but in doing so, he ran over Pitt, and the vehicle dragged the victim a distance. She was pronounced dead at Florida Hospital Flagler. She was the mother of a young boy. She was from Spring Hills, as is Adams, a resident of 5521 Ashland Drive. Adams’s recorded blood-alcohol level was 0.089 and 0.091, just over the legal limit. Tonak, to, was over the limit: his tests both showed 0.082 blood-alcohol level. Tonak, who had three passengers in his car– was charged with drunk driving, a first-degree misdemeanor. The DUI-manslaughter charge Adams faces is a second-degree felony that carries a minimum prison sentence, if he is convicted. He also faces a first-degree misdemeanor charge for DUI-property damage. Adams and Pitt were staying at Tomoka State Park. They were returning from a concert in Jacksonville, where, as Adams told an investigator, they’d had a few drinks. Adams, not familiar with the area, had gone in the wrong direction–west, instead of east, when he made the turn off I-95. Recommend or share: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr Questions?

Police said Patton had a blood-alcohol level of .105 and threatened an officer, later taking back the statement by saying “Never mind. I don’t want to get in trouble.” Police said Patton was upset, saying his son died from “fake heroin” and said police didn’t do anything.

The man didn’t want to press charges. 8:18 p.m. – 300 block of Boardman Poland Rd., Angela Powers, 28, and Shane Ploured charged with theft after an investigation of shoplifting at Kohl’s. Monday, April 3 8:23 a.m. – 100 block of Shadyside Dr., a man reported that his vehicle was stolen while he was watching “Wrestlemania.” He had inadvertently left his keys, wallet, and cell phone inside the unlocked vehicle.

The Oklahoma Association of Optometric Physicians filed a legal challenge on Friday to the petition filed by Oklahomans for Consumer Freedom. The retail group wants to launch a signature drive to get a question on the ballot that would nullify state laws prohibiting optometrists from operating inside a retail establishment. But in their legal challenge, the optometrists are challenging the petition alleging "logrolling," or combining several topics into one petition, in violation of the state's single-subject rule for legislation and constitutional amendments. A spokeswoman for the retail group says their legal team is reviewing the filing. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

 Slack's AI boss explains its secret weapons in the coming chat wars with Microsoft, Facebook, and Google Matt Weinberger Apr. 7, 2017, 6:26 PM 1,932 facebook linkedin twitter email print Slack head of Search, Learning, and Intelligence Noah Weiss Slack Three years ago, a startup named Slack came out of nowhere to become what's believed to be the fastest-growing business software company ever, hitting a $1 billion valuation within the first 8 months of its existence. Today, Slack is a $3.8 billion business with over 800 employees, and a growing roster of paying customers that include IBM, Walmart's Jet.com, and, yes, Business Insider. For many companies, chat is the way people are getting things done. Slack wasn't the first company to do chat at work, but it's certainly the most visible.  And so, tech titans like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook have all launched their own work chat apps, trying to crush Slack before it's too late. Under that pressure, Slack is doubling down on its biggest advantage: Generally speaking, people actually enjoy using it, which isn't often the case with software meant for use in the office. Enter Noah Weiss, former Googler and Senior VP of Product Management at Foursquare, who now leads Slack's Search, Learning and Intelligence team out of the company's spiffy new New York City offices. It's his team that's going to be making much of the "magic" that keeps users glued to Slack, even as the alternatives proliferate.  "Slack is a very bizarre enterprise software company," says Weiss. "And I mean 'bizarre' in the best possible way." 'Connective tissue' Because people are using Slack all workday, every workday, there's an astonishing amount of information that's already flowing through the app. Not just text, but the photos and links and documents that your coworkers are sharing with each other. "All of that data exhaust is something that we think we can tap into to make Slack itself smarter," says Weiss. Slack already integrates some of that, with smarter search suggestions. And users can opt-in to receive regular suggestions for chat rooms within their company — whether that room is for a special sales project populated by the people they talk to every day, or for "Game of Thrones" fans. The data that's feeding the beast is largely coming from outside apps, says Weiss. For example, he says, teams at Slack itself use Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Dropbox Paper, and Quip, just for the creation and sharing of documents. Regardless which app employees use to create the file, they use Slack to share it with coworkers.  Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield Craig Barritt/Getty Images "Slack ends up being pretty good connective tissue for this increasingly diverse set of tools," says Weiss.  Over time, Weiss says, Slack can really start to "learn" things about users based on the things they send around. If you share a lot of spreadsheets with "expenses" in the title, you probably work in accounting. If you post a lot of links about Elon Musk, you're probably into space. And so on. All of which comes back to helping people love Slack more, explains Weiss. All of this data will help its users sift through the noise that comes with everyday conversation, and find the answers they're looking for, more quickly. Once Slack "understands" the relationships between people and files, it can subtly point you towards the right answers, without requiring you to change the way you work. "There is tremendous collective knowledge building up in Slack," says Weiss. Versus Microsoft and Google Microsoft, in particular, is hard at work on similar principles. In 2016, the company introduced the Microsoft Graph, which, as you may guess from the name, traces the relationships between documents and coworkers the same way that Facebook's famed social graph does for your friends.  Still, Weiss believes that Slack has a few advantages. First and foremost, it's been doing it longer, and claims a leading 5 million daily active users. That means lots more data flowing in, which means it can release new, smarter, time-saving features faster. Slack's channel recommendations are an early version of how the company wants to use existing data to make it much smarter. Slack "We kind of created this category; we have the most usage in this category," says Weiss. Furthermore, Weiss says, Slack is way more focused than Facebook, Google or Microsoft, all of whom support a plethora of messaging apps beyond whatever it is they offer to office workers. For Slack, messaging is literally all they do. Weiss' team has one mission, and it's not powering a search engine or whatnot — it's building a chat app that helps people be more productive. "When you think about how Slack itself is wired, we are here on this Earth to do this one thing," Weiss says. Get the latest Google stock price here.

Telecom and consumer staples were the top performing sectors while the utilities and energy sectors lagged. WTI crude oil for May delivery settled at $52.24 a barrel, up 1% on the day and at its highest level since March 7. June gold added 0.3% on the day to settle at $1,257.30. Equities were headed for a mixed close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.01% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down 0.04%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.03%. Stocks traded very near the break-even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could finish with either a small gain or a small loss for any or all of the indexes. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Friday was Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) which traded up 2.10% at $72.93. The stock’s 52-week range is $62.72 to $75.19. Volume was about 10% below the daily average of around 9.2 million shares. The company’s stock was upgraded to Outperform this morning at Telsey. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) traded up 0.76% at $48.80. The stock’s 52-week range is $46.01 to $56.95. Volume was about 10% below the daily average of around 15.4 million shares. The company had no specific news, but a reported change coming to FCC rules on net neutrality would likely be good news for the big wireless carriers. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) traded up 0.65% at $178.53. The stock’s 52-week range is $122.35 to $185.71. Volume was about 30% below the daily average of around 3.4 million. The company had no specific news, but Thursday night’s missile attack on Syria boosted most defense stocks Friday. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) traded up 0.51% at $166.18. The stock’s 52-week range is $125.26 to $172.14. Volume was 40% below the daily average of around 3.7 million shares. The health insurer had no specific news Friday. Of the Dow 30 stocks, 14 are on track to close higher Friday and 16 are set to close lower.

Schwegmann" (2017, Neutral Ground Press, $20), will sign his new biography of the businessman and politician at the Crescent City Farmers Markets next week. Cappello, whose book is subtitled is "New Orleans, and the Making of the Modern Retail World," will be available to chat about the book during regular market hours Tuesday (April 11) at Uptown Square, 200 Broadway St.; Thursday at the American Can Company, 3700 Orleans Ave.; and April 15 at 750 Carondolet St. downtown.  "The more I got into it I thought this is like a gold mine," said Cappello, who was signing books St. Roch Market on April 9. "I was really surprised at how important he was in the city and the country." Author David Cappello signs his book, 'The People's Grocer: John G. Schwegmann' at St. Roch Market on April 9, 2017. Cappello will sign again at Crescent City Farmers Markets, April 11, 13, 15. (Photo by Ann M. Maloney, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune) "He actually invented the whole discount store concept before (Sam) Walton (founder of Wal-Mart) -- almost a generation before -- and he had the biggest store in the world," Cappello said. "And thank God for that because the whole food culture in New Orleans could have been different, if it has been dominated by national chains." The biography, which will soon hit area bookstore shelves, chronicles Schwegmann's life and the rise and dissolution of the supermarket giant, which began in 1869 with Schwegmann family members opening a small Bywater store. The first Schwegmann Brothers Giant Supermarket opened at St. Claude and Elysian Fields avenues in 1946, introducing the idea of lower-priced, self-service grocery shopping. That store grew in to a supermarket chain, selling everything from baked goods to shoes beside aisles and aisles of produce and canned goods. It houseed such as businesses as pharmacies, banks and notary offices for shoppers' convenience.  The supermarket chain dominated the city's retail grocery scene until it was sold in the mid-'90s after an unsuccessful expansion attempt. Schwegmann himself was a state legislator and later a member of the state Public Service Commission. He died in 1995 at the age of 83.

You don 8767 t need a second car, because you live 7 miles from work. That is a close enough distance that it can be done by bike in about 7 minutes in nice weather, and on foot if you live somewhere with deep snow or other non-bike conditions in the off-season. Hell, you could even swim  that distance.   There 8767 s your first $775 per month in savings! EasyBib: Free Bibliography Generator - MLA, APA, Chicago You really are stupid. You 8767 re so stupid you actually believe you made a valid point. You 8767 re so unbelievably retarded you think that college is no different than prison. Furthermore, you 8767 re so dumb you think you can make up statistics. Leftists lament how wages have stagnated since the seventies and how the gap between the rich and poor has never been wider, but they can 8767 t admit that  feminism   is a big reason why Americans are getting poorer by the day. The mass entry of girls into the workforce that began in the seventies conveniently coincides with the stagnation and decline of American wages , as well as the decline of unions. Whereas a man could comfortably support his family on his own back in the fifties and sixties, it takes both parents working to raise a family today, assuming the couple can even afford to buy a house and have children to begin with. It astounds me how so many feminists have absolutely no knowledge of economics. Here 8767 s a hard lesson for you girls:  labor is a commodity. And like all other commodities, labor is subject to the laws of supply and demand. When the supply of a commodity outpaces demand, its price (in this case, wages) goes down when demand outpaces supply, the price goes up. This basic law is why a Walmart in Canton, Ohio is holding canned food drives  for its own employees   while the Walmart in Williston, North Dakota has to pay its workers $76 an hour and give them free hotel rooms labor is plentiful in Ohio and scarce in North Dakota. Many of Richard Dawkins detractors are conservative Christians which is not surprising. As alluded to earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported: "A comprehensive new study released by Baylor University yesterday, shows that traditional Christian religion greatly decreases belief in everything from the efficacy of palm readers to the usefulness of astrology. It also shows that the irreligious and the members of more liberal Protestant denominations, far from being resistant to superstition , tend to be much more likely to believe in the paranormal and in pseudoscience than evangelical Christians." [6] In the United States , CBS News reported in October 7555 that the Americans most likely to believe only in the theory of evolution are liberals. [95] Richard Dawkins has established a reputation for avoiding debates with his strongest opponents. On May 69, 7566, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph published a news story entitled Richard Dawkins accused of cowardice for refusing to debate existence of God. [667] In The Daily Telegraph article Dr. Daniel Came , a member of the Faculty of Philosophy at Oxford University, was quoted as writing to fellow atheist Richard Dawkins concerning his refusal to debate Dr. William Lane Craig : "The absence of a debate with the foremost apologist for Christian theism is a glaring omission on your CV and is of course apt to be interpreted as cowardice on your part." [668] An article by Sarah posted at Skepchick about a conversation between Richard Dawkins and David Silverman , the president of the American Atheists organization, which took place during the planning phase of the Reason Rally : Women find that kind of attention until they are young and you know what, every one of them gets old after a while. After hitting their thirties, they still have to support themselves. In particular, if their precious husband happens to find a new, younger and prettier woman. You want to encourage women to make a living of marrying up, and then you whine that women are gold-diggers. MORONS. «Bringing up baby thesis sa» in pictures.

When the Dairy Queen opens in late February, we know spring is coming, and while we may not be putting the snow shovels away until June, over at Walmart the Easter decorations and candy are coming into the back room along with bikinis and sunhats. We can read a calendar and even when the temperature hits 30 below and blizzards blanket the plains, we know spring is coming. But sometimes we can also look ahead to things that are not so grand - for we also see signs of sorrows and pending darkness as clearly as we see the first crocus or robin heralding spring. Jesus spoke to those willing to listen of the signs that would herald a time of terrible devastation, suffering and sorrow. He had spoken of His coming rejection by the religious and civil authorities with the result of His being arrested, tried and crucified. But this was not the great disaster of which He was speaking here - or, as He also had told His disciples, this was a necessary part of God's plan of redemption. And on the third day He would rise again as proof and sign that He was and is the Messiah, the Son of God. But in Goliath's text today, the tragedy Jesus told His followers to prepare for was the destruction of Jerusalem, the Holy Temple, and the Jewish people as a nation. And the same forces that would bring about His horrible death would be the cause of this tragedy as well: human conceit, pride and rejection of God. Someone has noted that, historically, it is often the most "religious" people who bring about the greatest cruelties and sufferings. And always it is because in their supposed zeal for God they actually begin to worship themselves. Humanity has always had the habit of dividing the human race into two categories: "us" and "them." In every culture and in every religion, many begin to see "us" as superior and "them" as inferior. Thus "they" must be controlled and exploited for the benefit of the superior beings - "us." Nietzsche and his offspring, the Nazis, were neither the first nor the worst of those who embraced this view. We know the Nazis killed 6 million in concentration camps. But it was the British who invented the concentration camp during the Boer war in South Africa. The Soviets under Stalin murdered some 12 million Ukrainians and Poles in World War 2 - and of course it was us great old Americans under such "heroes" of the Civil War like U.S. Grant, William Sherman and Phil Sheridan who came up with that dandy policy of "the only good Indian is a dead Indian." Of course, this attitude is not limited to Europeans, as any anthropologist will tell you. This same strain of "us" against "them" is part of human nature - a trait we all carry. Hence, we all have a tendency, to one degree or another, to be racist, sexist, biased and given to discrimination. In this, the Jews were no different than any other human beings - and when the idea of the God of Israel also being the God of Europe, of Africa, of Asia etc., they rejected it as blasphemy. Jesus was a threat because the God He preached was the God of the universe and not the private property of the priests and scribes. Though the Temple was built to the glory of God, it did not glorify Him, for, as is so often the case, absolute power given to mere human beings corrupts absolutely. In the "Name of God," the religious authorities began to "play God," deciding who was worthy and who was not. Jesus spoke to Jews who were less than faithful in attending the synagogue or the Temple - and even shared meals with people who were unwelcome in such places. Women who had to sell their bodies to support their children when their husband abandoned them. Men who had fallen for the illusion of power and wealth, sacrificing their honor and integrity in their quest for it. Jesus welcomes prostitutes and tax collectors working as collaborators with the Romans. He also had time for children, even when it was obvious to everyone else that there were far more important people impatiently wanting to speak with Him. It was this proud attitude and dismissal of most other people that Jesus saw in Jerusalem and in the Temple itself that He identified as signs of the coming destruction. Israel had been created for the purpose of becoming a model for humanity. Back in Genesis 12, when God chose Abraham and Sarah to be the first ancestors of this people, He told them the reason. He made a covenant with them - that through them He would do three things. First, He would create a unique people who would pass on this covenant to their children in generation after generation. Second, He would make a nation of them and grant them a homeland at the crossroads of the ancient world; and third, from all this would come God's blessing of all the families of the earth. The Chosen people had been chosen and created to fulfill God's purpose for all creation. But people got comfortable with the idea they had been chosen because they were superior to everyone else - and that they were indeed the "Master Race" Nietzsche would nearly 2,000 years later describe - suggests they were destined to rule the world. Only for Nietzsche, man and science were now masters of the universe instead of God. Well, we have seen the results of that point of view in Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Castro, to name a few. It isn't pretty, but human beings can be a pretty stubborn and pig-headed lot. Sometimes God has to wake us up. The wakeup call Jesus spoke about was the coming destruction of Jerusalem, the Temple and the nation. Within less than 50 years, the Temple, the city, and, geographically, the nation would cease to exist. To be a Jew became a statement of one's religion and ancestry, but not of nationality, for they would become a people without a nation. Yet the Jew would not cease to exist - for they remained God's chosen and, from them, in Christ and His followers, has come the New Israel - a people created not by nationality, ancestry, race or place of origin, but by the love of God. When Jesus rode down the streets of Jerusalem and the people shouted, "Hosanna" -  "Save us!" - that is exactly what Jesus was doing. The Temple, the city and the country did not survive, but God's people did and God's plan to redeem all of creation continues to this day. The story begun in Genesis is not over fo the plan is still being fulfilled - and we are all part of it! -- Goliath and John Bruington seek to serve the Lord and share what little knowledge He can manage to get through. After all, horses have a brain the size of an orange - and Goliath is considered the smart one of the two.

Ask your doctor about getting tested to find out your kidney health. Your kidneys aren’t very large – each is just the size of a computer mouse – but they’re hard-working. They filter all the blood in your body every 30 minutes, removing wastes, toxins, and excess fluid. They also help control blood pressure, stimulate production of red blood cells, keep your bones healthy and regulate blood chemicals that are essential to life. Kidney-friendly tips • Keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (or the target your doctor establishes for you). • If you have diabetes, stay in your target blood sugar range as much as possible. • Get active – physical activity helps control blood pressure and blood sugar levels. • Lose weight if you’re overweight. • Get tested for CKD regularly if you’re at risk. • Take medications as instructed, and ask your doctor about blood pressure medicines called ACE inhibitors and ARBs which may protect your kidneys in addition to lowering blood pressure. • If you smoke, quit. Smoking can worsen kidney disease and interfere with medication that lowers blood pressure. • Include a kidney doctor (nephrologist) on your health care team.

Twelve people — nine of them from Waterloo Region — were arrested on Thursday in a joint investigation between the RCMP and Waterloo Regional Police. The takedown began at about 1 p.m. in Cambridge in a Walmart parking lot at the corner of Hespeler Road and Eagle Street when RCMP and local police officers intercepted what they believed to be "criminals in the midst of importation," RCMP Supt. Jamie Jagoe said on Friday. Police seized 34.5 kilograms of cocaine after the arrests. In total, they seized 38.5 kilograms with a street value of $1.75 million, said Jagoe. One kilogram of cocaine can garner up to $45,000, he said. Mixing it with cutting agents such as fentanyl can increase profits significantly, Jagoe said. The same day, police executed 14 search warrants, most of them in homes in Kitchener and Waterloo, as well as in Toronto, Windsor, Leamington and Wheatley. Police also seized five high-end vehicles and $15,000 in cash. On Friday, RCMP, local police, along with Canada Border Service Agency and the U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, held a news conference where they showed the bricks of powdered cocaine at the local RCMP detachment. Jagoe said the cocaine was coming from California concealed in compartments and hidden under floor boards of transport trucks carrying legitimate cargo. "They created false bottoms," Jagoe said. "They were well-versed in how to move contraband. "This organization was exploiting the land crossings," said Jagoe, referring to border crossings between Canada and the United States. Jagoe said the organization of individuals was a sophisticated network that identified a U.S. supplier of the drug. "Traffickers often ship cocaine from the United States distribution centres, including Houston and Los Angeles, along major highways to Canadian land ports in Ontario, including Windsor, Sarnia and Sault Ste. Marie," he said. Waterloo Regional Police Supt. Pat Dietrich said police intelligence showed many of the individuals involved in the crime ring were local and the region was a "distribution hub." Dietrich said the investigation began last September and three officers were assigned to the case, known as Project O-wing. On Thursday, about 200 officers were involved in the arrests and search warrants, 90 of them from the local police service. Police said several of those arrested were known to police. Ronald Marcell of the Homeland Security Investigations said arrests in the U.S. in connection with the busts in Waterloo Region are expected. The nine local people arrested face a variety of charges, including trafficking, conspiring with others and importation of a scheduled substance into Canada from the U.S. They are Mile Vignjevic, 59, of Cambridge, and eight Kitchener residents: Dimitrios Papadakis, 34, Thomas Kapouranis, 46, Jadranko Neskovic, 53, Marko Tufedgzic, 34, Mihajlo Vignjevic, 31, Julie Panyadeth, 36, David Thiessen, 31, and Nghia Nguyen, 42. lmonteiro@therecord.com Twitter: @MonteiroRecord Liz Monteiro can be reached via Twitter @MonteiroRecord | Latest News Local Twenty local men fell at Vimy: 'They need to be remembered' Snapshot Local Local baseball fans recall Jays’ first home game Snapshot Local Life in prison for crossbow murder Snapshot Local Province pours $1.8M into Conestoga College Conestoga College’s Waterloo Campus, in the midst of a $43.5-million makeover, will naturally be...

After earning a degree in audio engineering at the Art Institute of Seattle, Prince moved back to Hawaii where she now calls Kona home. A full-time performing musician, she is currently working on her first studio album. Yet while her life appears something out of a storybook, Prince’s life wasn’t always fairy tales and princess parties. “I spent my childhood below poverty,” said Prince. “We lived in a homeless shelter in Kawaihae and a trailer park in southern Oregon. I was teased in school for where I lived, for wearing clothes from Walmart, for being seen at the food bank. My mom was a single mom of two children trying to support us on her own. She did her best to encourage us to follow our dreams no matter how hard the struggle became.” Follow her dreams she did. When Prince was living in the trailer park she asked her mom for a guitar for Christmas. Prince’s mother traded some of her jewelry at the local pawnshop to buy her little girl her first guitar. “Knowing that she had gone to such great lengths to get me that guitar made me determined to teach myself,” she said. “About a year later, I entered a talent show, took first place, and the next day played my first gig in a little biker bar during Labor Day weekend in 2005.” In 2012, with the help of financial aid, Prince graduated from the Art Institute of Seattle. Then, in June 2013, she came to Hawaii to visit family and decided to stay. “The move here was very challenging,” she said. “I quit my job over the phone, borrowed an old beater car from an uncle, and slept on my aunty’s couch. I served tacos at Ocean’s for about two years until I finally decided to go for it and take the plunge. I got a sound system together and began jamming for little to nothing or for free any and everywhere I could. I realized a lot of my time was being spent partying, so, I quit drinking and my success just bloomed and blossomed from there.” It’s been four years since Prince moved back to Hawaii. She is now proudly 2.5 years sober and a full-time performer and swimwear model. She collaborates on projects with other women entrepreneurs and artists, and enjoys empowering and encouraging young women and girls to follow their passions. “I never gave up on my dreams no matter what, and now I am living the dream,” said Prince. “I get paid to play music for beautiful people from all over the world almost every single day. After 11 years of performing, I am finally releasing my first album that was written solely by me. There is nothing more that I could ask for at this point in my life and career. Ten years from now, I can’t even imagine where I’ll be. Wherever I am, I hope I’m still playing my guitar. Whether it be to a big crowd or around a campfire, it makes no difference to me.” Prince’s debut album will be released later this year. Her words, both musically and spoken, are an inspiration to those around her. “I hope to inspire people through my music by expressing that no matter what types of obstacles you face in your life, anything is possible,” she said. “Our only limitations are the ones we put on ourselves. I spent so many nights singing to an empty bar, so many hours waiting to play one song at open mic nights, that sometimes when I’m on stage jamming to a venue packed full of people, I just want to cry. I can’t believe how far I’ve come, and I hope to continue to share my music for many years to come.” Prince performs today from 9 to 11 a.m. at Daylight Mind Coffee Co. in Queens’ MarketPlace and from 2:15 to 4:15 p.m. at Lava Lava Beach Club. On Saturday, she performs from 3 to 5 p.m. at Huggo’s on the Rocks. On Tuesday, she heads back to Daylight Mind at Queens’ MarketPlace for a performance from 9 to 11 a.m. Info: www.victoriaprincemusic.com Rules for posting comments Comments posted below are from readers.

According to Wolcott Police, on April 3rd at approximately 10:30 p.m. two males were at Walmart on Dixwell Avenue in Hamden where one used a debit to card to make a purchase. The second suspect attempted to do the same thing, but the card was rejected. He then tried to use several other cards with the same results. Wolcott Police say since the resident still had his debit card they believe his debit card information must have been obtained through a skimming device. Police ask anyone with any information on the two suspects to call them at 203-879-8120 or the tip line at 203-879-7626.

Again Posted: Friday, April 7, 2017 12:47 PM EDT Updated: Friday, April 7, 2017 12:48 PM EDT By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The dramatic reshaping of the American retail industry has, unfortunately, led to massive job losses in the sector. The federal government said Friday that retailers shed nearly 30,000 jobs in March. That follows a more than 30,000 decline in the number of retail jobs in the previous month. So-called general merchandise stores are hurting the most. That part of the sector, which includes struggling companies like Macy's, Sears and J.C. Penney, lost 35,000 jobs last month. Nearly 90,000 jobs have been eliminated since last October. These stores, along with others like Target and Kohl's, are struggling to adapt to the shift from brick-and-mortar shopping to digital and mobile commerce -- the so-called Amazon effect. More consumers are buying goods on their phones, tablets and PCs, to the detriment of nearly all the traditional big box stores and many mall-based retailers. Payless ShoeSource announced this week that it will be closing hundreds of stores. Ralph Lauren is shutting down its big Fifth Avenue store in New York City. American Apparel, Wet Seal and The Sports Authority have all filed for bankruptcy within the past year. Will the job losses continue? Some argue that the weakness in retail is not something that will last. This could be just a shakeout in the industry. Weak retailers have to shut stores, but the overall sector could start adding jobs again if stronger retailers hire. "There is no question that the Amazon effect is overwhelming," said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist of private banking for BBH. "There has been a shift in the way we buy things as opposed to a shift in the amount of money spent." To that end, Amazon just announced plans to hire 30,000 part-time workers. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst with Bankrate.com, referred to what's going on in the sector as a "retail reshuffle." "Many store chains have announced closings. .... They're struggling with overcapacity in the industry and the consumer's shift to online purchases," he wrote in a report, adding that "more pain for retail workers looms in the months ahead." Still, all is not lost for brick-and-mortar. Walmart is one "old-school" retailer still doing well. Walmart has ramped up its own digital commerce businesses with a series of acquisitions, led by last year's big deal for the hot e-commerce unicorn company Jet.com for $3 billion. Other retailers have been able to avoid getting Amazon-ed too. Companies like Home Depot, Lowe's, Costco and Children's Place have all done well this year. But how long will this last? Brett Ewing, chief market strategist with First Franklin, pointed out in a report that a slight slowdown in wage growth could cause consumers to pull back on spending. "The most negative thing about the report was a deceleration in average hourly earnings. While they are still growing at a solid pace, we never want to see that growth start to decelerate and it is something we are focusing on for upcoming months," he said. And Adam Strauss, co-manager of the Appleseed Fund, said that too much is being made about Amazon's growing clout in retail. "I am convinced that the weakness in retail is way more than Amazon," he said. "It's having an effect. But Amazon is just talking market share. The overall U.S retail sector isn't growing," he added. As a result, his fund is avoiding all retail stocks due to consumer spending concerns. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Amazon pulls Diapers.com and other Quidsi apps from the app store Posted 15 hours ago by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Payments are all that’s needed for chatbots to deliver on their promise, says Kik CEO At the end of March, Amazon announced it was planning to shut down Diapers.com and all the other e-commerce sites operated by Quidsi – the company Amazon acquired for $545 million back in 2010. However, it didn’t offer any details as to when those sites would eventually shutter their doors. But it now appears the first steps towards closure have been taken – all the Quidsi apps have been pulled out of the app store. According to data from App Annie, Quidsi at one point had half a dozen published mobile shopping apps across both platforms, including an iOS and Android app for its flagship property Diapers.com, as well as cross-platform versions of the next leading sites, Wag.com and Soap.com. In addition, it also had iOS apps for its less popular sites, AfterSchool.com, BeautyBar.com, Bookworm.com, Casa.com, VineMarket.com, and YoYo.com. App Annie shows that Diapers.com was ranking on the App Store on Wednesday, which indicates the app was pulled either at a later point in the day on Wednesday or on Thursday. Amazon did not make any announcement about the apps’ shutdown, though it was to be expected at some point. If you happen to still have any of the Quidsi apps installed, they appear to remain functional – you can browse products, search, add items to the cart, and checkout, as usual. There is no in-app notification that the app is no longer supported. That may come at a later point, though – after all, the websites themselves are still operational, too. However, by pulling the apps from the app stores, they’re no longer available for download by new users, and Amazon can stop focusing developer resources on keeping them updated or patching them with bug fixes. Amazon had said it decided to close down Quidsi because it failed to make the division profitable following the acquisition. But some wondered if Amazon’s feud with Quidsi’s founder, Marc Lore, came into play in this decision. After leaving Amazon, Lore founded Jet.com which he sold to Walmart for $3 billion, and he now runs Walmart’s e-commerce operations. A report from Recode indicated that only months ahead of Amazon’s announcement regarding Quidsi’s closure, execs told staff that Quidsi was expected to reach profitability this year – putting Amazon’s statement about Quidsi’s failures into question. That being said, none of Quidsi’s mobile applications were doing that well in terms of their app store rankings. For instance, at the time of Amazon’s announcement, Diapers.com was #257 in the Shopping category on the App Store, per App Annie. The other brands were ranked even lower: AfterSchool.com, Bookworm.com, and YoYo.com were unranked (on App Annie, ranks lower than #1750 aren’t tracked); BeautyBar.com was #1276; Casa.com was #947; Soap.com was #886; Wag.com was #802. Meanwhile, VineMarket.com was no longer tracked as of March 24, 2017, which indicates it may have been pulled even earlier. And the Android apps hadn’t been tracked by App Annie at all this year. Data from Sensor Tower indicates that Diapers.com for iOS saw 23,000 downloads last quarter, while all the Quidsi apps were downloaded 32,000 times across both stores during that same time frame. Comparatively, Amazon’s flagship application is the #4 Shopping app and #46 Overall in the App Store. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Amazon Founded 1994 Overview Amazon is an e-commerce retailer formed originally to provide consumers with products in two segments.

Talking at the Princeton Club of New York, New York Fed President William Dudley said the U.S. should consider small adjustments to the Dodd-Frank law, which toughened oversight for financial institutions. "No one wants to be on the wrong side of this deregulation trade," said Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. The prospects of deregulation have been a boon for equities since the U.S. election. Dudley also said there might only be a slight pause in the Fed's plan to normalize rates if the central bank starts unwinding its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The benchmark 10-year yield traded near 2.37 percent in the afternoon. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 6 points lower, with Goldman Sachs and DuPont contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent, with consumer staples leading advancers and utilities lagging. The Nasdaq composite fell marginally. Brendan McDermid | Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. "It's certainly interesting that the market didn't have a more significant drop-off," said Adrian Day, CEO of Adrian Day Asset Management. "When people are positive and stocks are going up, it takes a lot to knock the market off. On the data front, the U.S. economy added 98,000 jobs last month, well below the expected gain of 180,000. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent from 4.7 percent. Wage growth was not as strong either, with average hourly earnings up by 2.7 percent on an annualized basis. "It is certainly the most unusual jobs report I've seen in a while," said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "There was something for everybody." Futures and Treasury yields slipped after the jobs report was released, with the 10-year note yield briefly dipping below 2.3 percent to hit its lowest level since late November. "Investors are taking this as a sign they should be a little more cautious in their portfolios," said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. "While the headline payroll was considerably weaker, it was more of a mixed report when you look at the other components." Investors were also contending with a U.S. airstrike in Syria, which sent 59 Tomahawk missiles Thursday night. US 10-year yield intraday Source: FactSet The missiles targeted the Shayrat air base near Homs, and were in response to a Tuesday chemical weapons attack. Officially announcing the strike, President Donald Trump said the targeted airfield had launched the chemical attack on a rebel-held area, and he called on other nations to oppose Syria's embattled leader. Overnight, Dow futures tumbled around 100 points, but managed to retrace most losses. "The military response last night was in keeping with what the U.S. has done in the past," said Brown Brothers' Clemons. "I think that's giving the market some comfort for now. But if the situation escalates, ... that could bee a negative for sentiment in the market." Trump ordered the airstrike as he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. The U.S. dollar rose 0.48 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.059 and the yen around 111.21. "Every time there is an international event, there is a flight to safety and the dollar is seen as a safe haven," said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. "That's why, even after a pretty lousy jobs number, you're seeing the dollar hold its ground." Other data released Friday included wholesale inventories, which rose 0.4 percent. The Atlanta Fed also slashed its first-quarter GDP forecast to 0.6 percent from 1.2 percent, citing weak car sales, among other factors.

The Nasdaq composite fell 1.14 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 5,877.81. Decliners were a step ahead of advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 752.50 million and a composite volume of 3.037 billion at the close.

(NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune archive) Print Email Robert Rhoden, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Robert Rhoden, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 07, 2017 at 9:12 AM, updated April 07, 2017 at 9:19 AM comments In what police called "a tragic accident," a 67-year-old Ponchatoula man died after being run over by a pickup truck he had just gotten out of in front of Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market in Covington, authorities said Friday (April 7). Donald Wilburn Leavelle died at a hospital around 10:30 p.m. Thursday, nearly seven hours after the freak mishap, Covington Police said in a news release. Leavelle, who was recently discharged from a hospital and still weak, rode with a friend to the grocery story on U.S. 190 around 4 p.m. Thursday, police said. The 60-year-old friend, who was not named by police, drove to the front of the store to drop off Leavelle so he wouldn't have to walk far. Leavelle got out and took a couple of steps toward the store entrance but, unbeknownst to the driver, he turned around and walked back to the truck as if he were reaching for something in the bed, police said. As the driver began to move forward, one of the truck's wheels struck Leavelle, knocking him to the ground where he fell under the dual-wheeled vehicle, according to police. While driving off, the friend saw in his rear-view mirror that Leavelle was on the ground, police said. Leavelle was taken to a hospital where he later died. Impairment is not suspected to be a factor in the accident, authorities said.

Lonnie Leonard was arrested on charges of manslaughter, aggravated battery, and carrying a concealed weapon Wednesday night. Jeffrey Edwards, the brother of Arthur Adams, the man Leonard killed, said the manslaughter charges filed against Leonard is not enough. “I think he should be charged with murder not, manslaughter, for one. And to have a bond? I don’t think he should have a bond,” Edwards said. Investigators said Adams and another man were stealing two carts of diapers when a store employee confronted them in the parking lot. Leonard noticed what was happening and got involved. Leonard told authorities that Adams reached for something, which made the him feel threatened. Leonard then pulled out a gun and fired several shots, according to authorities. Witnesses contradicted Leonard’s story and said they did not see the teen reach for anything. Adams was shot, and so was a teenage girl who was with the suspected thieves. Adams made it to the gas station across the street where he collapsed. He was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead. The girl who was shot survived her injuries.

This week's question is Did you ever find money? When? Where? What did you do with it? Once, I found a $5 bill at the Flemington Home Depot sometime last year. I spent it on a couple food items. Ian Hoats Grade 5 East Amwell School Yes I have found money before. I found money last month. I found the money while I was walking through New York City. I didn't find a lot of money so I couldn't buy a lot of stuff so I just bought a pack of gum because I love gum. Kaitlin Reid Grade 5 East Amwell School One time I found $20 in my pocket. My friend James and I were singing, "I found twenty dollars in my pocket!" It was funny. It was in the hallway. I spent it in Hawaii. It was funny. I hope I find money again. Avery Schaefer Grade 4 Milford Public School When I was at Polar Cub, it got my ice cream and spotted a dime on the ground. I tried to decide what to do with it. Take it? Give it to someone? I put it in the tip jar. Wasn't very much, but it could help. Andrew Menyhert Grade 7 Readington Middle School When I went to hockey practice on a windy day I saw a hundred dollar bill on the ground then four more. Andrew Bennett Grade 7 Readington Middle School One time I found money was last year and I was with my friends at a Rutgers game. I found a $50 bill on the ground and obviously picked it up. I spent maybe $20 on snacks and just held onto the rest. It was pretty nice, even though they lost. Gregory Lavish Grade 7 Readington Middle School I have never found much money just laying around before, but if I did I would try to spend about ten minutes looking for the owner, but probably after two I would keep it and walk away. Thomas Micco Grade 7 Readington Middle School A Few years ago, I was casually putting my jacket on to go outside. Since it was slightly chilly, I put my hands in my pockets. At first I had thought that there was a gum wrapper, but it was actually an $100 bill! I was so happy that I ran inside and put it with my other money in a high top secret place. And in that secret place, no money goes out, all the money only goes in. Can you tell I like saving money? Bianca Centamore Grade 7 Readington Middle School Last week I walked into gym class to my spot. There on the floor was a shiny penny. I picked it up and put it in my right sock because I had no pockets. Becca Bowser Grade 7 Readington Middle School One time I was walking on the street with my family and a 20 dollar bill flew out of my dad's pocket and I said hey look money and i kept it he never did find out it was his all along Lucas Shoewalker Grade 7 Readington Middle School I was in the hallway and I saw a ten dollar bill fall to the ground. I could not spot who dropped it because I was in a crowd of people. I asked about four people if it was theirs and none of them claimed it, Ever since this moment I still have this ten dollar bill and I have never spent it. Ben Schlosser Grade 7 Readington Middle School We were just coming out of the restaurant. I found a credit on the ground. I was thinking about using it to buy myself some stuff, but then I realized that I needed to be a better person. I went to my house and shredded the credit card. I made sure not to give give it to anyone even the police, because they would all most likely use it. Corey Paulson Grade 7 Readington Middle School If I ever did find money it would depend on how much I found whether I would turn it in or not. If it is a lot of money I would turn it in. But if it was a small amount I would just keep it. Jordan Altom Grade 7 Readington Middle School One night, my mother and I were going grocery shopping by Kings Plaza.  We found exactly 100 dollars when  we walked inside. We turned in the money that we found.My mom told them that if they dont find it i will turn it into the police station.But they never called,so maybe the money was returned. Bianca Colaluca Grade 7 Readington Middle School There it was sitting right there on my counter $126 how could that of possibly got here. I was shocked so I was about to tell my mom until I realized it was fake money. It was used for my hair piece in a dance called "money". However I completely forgot about it oh well! Natalie Gerstein Grade 7 Readington Middle School I never found any dollar bills, but I'll be happy to tell you when I found a quarter in Wildwood, an island near New Jersey. First, I was walking to a restaurant to get breakfast with my mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, aunt, cousin, and my sister. While we were walking, I happened to find a quarter on the sidewalk. Additionally, I showed my family. Lastly, my dad said that he had put it in my piggy bank when we got back to New Jersey. So, that is where it's being stored right now! I felt lucky because finding a quarter off the ground isn't something someone finds every day! Lillian Woodward Grade 4 Copper Hill Elementary School I find money all over the place, at a lot of different times, and do a lot of different things with it.  First, sometimes I find money on the floor of my mom's car, but my sister forces me to give what I found to her.  She can be greedy about money sometimes.  Next, sometimes I find money in my advent calendar as a gift from my elf.  I put it in my piggy bank and save it for later.  Also, I sometimes find quarters on the floor.  I try to get the money in my piggy bank before my sister can steal it.  Last but not least, my grandparents slip money into my pocket while I'm not looking, and act like they are surprised when I realize I have some money in my pocket.  However, I always find out it was them.  I also save that money.  My piggy bank is becoming like a pot of gold since I find so much money. Mason Irani Grade 4 Copper Hill Elementary School There was one very lucky day when my friend and I found a twenty-dollar bill. We went to the Mall that day to see a movie. When we arrived, we first made a stop at the pretzel stand. On the way back to the theater we both spotted something on the floor. We quickly identified it as money and ran for it. The funny thing is that my dad saw it as well, and he got there first. My dad and I decided it would be kind to let my friend keep it since he was our guest that day. What is even funnier is that his dad took it from him when he got home. Next time I'm keeping it!!    Max Kenny Grade 4 Copper Hill Elementary School I have found money many times. One time I found it under Poppops chair. It was a real surprise considering it was Easter and he hadn't sat in it for quite a while. I found it when I went to Nama and Poppops house. After I found it I put it in my purse. It was only 2 dollars and some change. But, it could buy me some candy. Money is a great thing to find! Julia Gabriel Grade 4 Copper Hill Elementary School Money can be a cool thing, but sometimes people take it seriously. Especially those who don't have it... Once I found some money, and everyone wanted it! Here's my story: Over spring break last year I went to Las Vegas. When I arrived the city looked beautiful! I couldn't wait to go on a tour! I walked around Las Vegas, stopping in some shops. It was amazing! All except for one thing... there were beggars lining up the streets! It was hard to walk around, but I didn't complain. Later that night there were more people than before! I ignored them.  On my way to the restaurant, I saw a flower pot with over ten flowers! It was gorgeous! Stopped and looked for a while. Then I saw a green slip. I tugged on it and out came a five dollar bill! A couple beggars saw and started shoving their signs in my face! They shouted, "HELP THE POOR!" over and over. Once again I ignored them unt il I got to the restaurant. The next day, I used that money to buy some lip gloss. Those beggars never asked me again!    Madison Silvestri Grade 4 High Bridge Elementary School Have you ever found money floating around somewhere? Well I have! Here is one story that I will share with you. I was on a trip in Canada over the summer, my family and I were in a mall looking for a good place to eat. We were going upstairs on an escalator when I looked under the escalator and I found a $20 bill! Tyler Kusznier    Grade 4 High Bridge Elementary School Have you ever found money? Well I have found quite a lot of money.  Once I was walking in New York with my parents on our way to Broadway and I found $50! I spent it on drinks and popcorn and 4 refills. Another time I was walking in Walmart and in between the toilet papers I found $10.  I saved that money. I was walking in Madison Square Garden on my way to a basketball game to watch Cleveland Cavaliers vs New York Knicks and someone dropped tickets and $60.  We gave the tickets to the owner but the money was not his so I kept it, but I  wasted it on drinks and autographs. Marcus Labib Grade 4 High Bridge Elementary School I have found money. Just a couple days ago, I found a penny in my family's candy box. My brother and I were going to have candy, so we went into the candy box, and there it was! A penny! I was the first one to go into the candy box, and it was pretty low, so I found the penny. It was really dirty, but that does not matter to me, so I took it. I did not really do anything with it yet, but I am going to put it in the coin counter that we all share. That is the money I have found. Camryn Valenta    Grade 4 High Bridge Elementary School When I was seven years old I was at the beach. We went to the board walk to have fun.  I saw something green on the beach so I went and got it. It was a 20 dollar bill. Then I saw some ice cream and bought everyone an ice cream. Kara Voorhees Grade 4 Valley View School I found a five dollar bill at the memorial park, at the day in the park, a few months ago and I used on the bouncy house. and I got only 5 minuets because I got in late, and I had to leave. Charlie Wellbrock Grade 4 Valley View School One day I found money on the floor. In my house! I woke up at 6:45 and it was dark. I took a flash light and went out to the living room. I saw my dog sniffing something green. She has a small crocodile plush and I thought that was what she was sniffing. But later, She brought it near the couch. I immediately picked it up and put it in my piggy-bank. Later that week, I think I spent it on snack at my school.   Giada Rhinesmith Grade 4 Valley View School I once found 200$ in my present for Chrismas. I was excited!  With my money I bought a Traxis RC car. I rode my rc car in my back yard. I am happy that I got this gift! Tyler Duryea Grade 4 Valley View School I found money once when I was five of six. I was walking in a parking lot to my car coming back from a diner in Princeton. When I was walking, holding hands with my mom, I suddenly say a shinny penny. It reminded me of a necklace I had that had a glinting, fake diamond on it. I suddenly started tugging my Mom's hand in the other direction. She asked, "Katie why are you pulling me?" " I saw a penny!" I exclaimed. She replied, " Okay, I will wait here and you can go get it." So I did. I picked it up. The cold, metal coin felt wet and cool in my hands. I ran back to my mom. When I got home, I put it in my piggy bank. That was a time when I got money. Katie Goad Grade 4 Valley View School Yes I have found money when I was cleaning my bedroom and in a wallet that I found, there was twenty dollars in the wallet. When I wanted to spend it, I went to a toy store and got some toys with the money that I found. Christina Sullivan Grade 4 Valley View School I once found a penny on the ground. It was in Princeton. It was during the afternoon. I gave the money to my mom to hold on to but I never got it back! Abby Sell Grade 4 Valley View School The times when I find money is on St. Patrick's day.  I wake up and go outside to see what the leprechauns did to my trap.  They leave money.  What I usually do with the money is put it in my piggy bank and save up for things. Brooke Tiemeyer Grade 4 Valley View School Yes, I found it when I was walking to ShopRite. All the sudden I saw something green at the corner of my eye. I look back. It was a 2 dollar bill! I took the dollar bill and kept it for a while. Then I went to Walmart and saw a cute turtle picture for $1.59! i asked my mom if I could buy it she said, "Yes, If you have your own money." I thought again I do have enough money for it. I went to the cashier and she scanned it. When she saw the 2 dollar bill she was surprised that I had one because she had never seen one before. She tries to find a slot in her register for the 2 dollar bill, she could not find a place. She just puts it in the 1 dollar bill slot. Natalia Cywa Grade 4 Valley View School I have found money before it was only five dollars though.  Since it was only five dollars I put it in my wallet.  Though if I had found a 20 dollar bill I would have spent it like a regular person.  You see I am a spender.  I spend all the money I can get or that I find.  And if you were me you would understand. Geneva DiRe   Grade 4 Valley View School Once I found money outside a restaurant. I was headed inside when something shiny caught my eye. I bent down to examine the coin. Even though it was just a penny I picked it up and put it in my pocket. When I got home I put it in this little safe I have. Even though it was only worth 1 cent it is worth saving for college. I'm sure that when I arrive at college and need money to buy things, I'll be happy I saved some money.   Hope Dunleavy Grade 4 Valley View School Yes, I have found money in the pants that go in the washing machine. I found the pennies about last year in November. My grandma said that her father paid for his car with all pennies. Then she said that I should save up money for a car. So I decided to put the pennies in my piggy bank.  That is one of the times that I found money. Joshua Carey Grade 4 Valley View School The only time that I find money is when my parents give it to me for allowance. That kind of means I'm bad at finding things especially money. I usually get the money on Sunday. With the money I get I save it so if I need to buy something I should have the money for it.    Hunter Doyle Grade 4 Valley View School One day I was walking on the street and I saw a five dollar bill. So when I got back home I put the money in my piggy bank. Kyle A. Ciculya Grade 4 Valley View School Yes. I once found a twenty dollar bill with a five dollar bill. I found it on a sidewalk in New York. I found it a few months ago with my parents in January. When I found the money my parents were up ahead of me. I ran to them so I could show my parents the money, where it was and ask what I should do with it. When we walked back the money was gone. That is one of the times when I found money. Sabrina Mickley Grade 4 Valley View School I never found money, but if I did I would think it would be like this. I would be walking down Broad Street in Seaside Heights and would find a five dollar bill. It would be a five dollar bill because the street is right by the board walk and the beach. I would not take it because I think that is stealing, so I would give it to my mom. Then she could ask if anyone lost money. I would do this because I think it's the honest thing to do. Brielle Jones Grade 4 Valley View School I have found lots of coins. I have found them almost any wear. If they are on heads I take them, but if they are on tails I will ether flip them so the next person gets it, or I flip it and if it lands on heads the first time I take. I have found them lots of times. Gavin Rich Grade 4 Valley View School Once, when I was 8 years old, I was walking through the mall when something caught my eye. It was an $100 bill, just lying there, on the ground. I didn't want to steal that much money from someone, so I gave it to the nearest mall security guard and explained what happened. She walked into and office and did who knows what with it. Anyway, on that day, someone lost a 100 bucks and I don't think they got it back. Florie O'Brien Grade 4 Valley View School I have never really found money, but I have gotten money from my birthday and for Christmas.  These were gifts from family.  When I get money, I put it in my bank account and get free gifts from the bank.  My favorite gift was lots of magnets that have words on them so you can make sentences with them.  Even though I haven't found any money, I still think it would be cool to find money! Carleigh Staten Grade 4 Valley View School I have found money before. I found it at home when our family came to our house. I pretended to be a fortune teller and got some money. When the people were over I ran upstairs and took some money from dad. The next day my mom and I put it in the bank. Jaime Myers Grade 4 Valley View School Once I was walking through the streets of NYC with my family and I saw something bronze glimmer between two cracks of the sidewalk. I reached down and picked it up. It was a penny. I wanted to buy stuff with it but I didn't know that you couldn't buy much with it because I was five. Dory Goad Grade 4 Valley View School Once I found coins in my older brother's room, when he left our house. Then, I added up all my coins with the coins that I found. My mom was going shopping, so we went to a Coin Star machine to get my coins counted. Then, I went shopping too!  At Walmart I bought a couple of toys and new markers. I never told my older brother since the day that I took his coins. Sophia Casola Grade 4 Valley View School Once I found a twenty dollar bill. I found it in the driveway at my house. It was a few years ago. I went with my mom to the store and bought a gift card as a gift for my cousin. Alex Atchley Grade 4 Valley View School One time I found money in the ocean and the amount was $20.  It was around July 21st, and it was a perfect day to go to the beach. Someone dropped money in the ocean and I picked it up. I found the owner eventually of the money and gave it to him. He gave the money back to me to keep and he said" You found it, you keep it". I thankfully accepted it, for I planned to put the money in my bank account. After a few weeks, I went to Walmart with my $20, and found the perfect Nerf Gun set for Daddy and me to play with. I had fun for a whole week just because of the generosity of a kind, kind man. I really liked the kindness of him. My daddy said that I did good a few days ago, and I deserved it. He thinks why it happened was something pathetic like quantum physics. Tristan Tiffany Grade 4 Valley View School I have found money in places a lot of times. The only money I have found are pennies, but because of this I have a penny jar and I have about 100 pennies. I have found pennies all over the place: at shops, restaurants, my school, and doctor offices. I have found pennies at many different times. Whenever I find one, I make sure it isn't anyone's, and if it isn't I take it home and wash it and put it in my penny jar. Amanda Gokey Grade 5 East Amwell School Yes. I found penny in a mall that had its head facing up. I found it about four years ago. I think I lost the penny before I left the mall. That is when I found money. Logan Smith Grade 5 East Amwell School I once found a 10 dollar bill when I was on my way to Game Stop. I had already had 40$ on me, enough to buy the normal COD Black Ops 2. After finding the 10$, I had enough money to buy the deluxe edition of COD Black Ops 2. I was very happy that I got to get the deluxe edition. Jack Heide Grade 5 East Amwell School I have found money on the street.  Once when I was in New York City, I saw a 100-dollar on the ground.  I have also found money under couch cushions.

Sleczka Grade 5 East Amwell School Last year I was in my sister Katerina's room, trying to find my shoes and there,  in her owl vase I found five dollars. I knew my sister would be in her room soon so I had to think fast. I did want to keep the money, but that would not be fair to Katerina. I decided to leave the money where it is. Sasha Terebetsky Grade 5 East Amwell School One time I when my mom was pulling clothes out of the dryer, someone left money in one of their pockets in their pants.

Finley Bruton Grade 4 Califon School So here's what happened. I was walking down the street and I found this circle thingy. It was small. I picked it up and flipped it over. It was a PENNY!!!! So when I got home I put it in my piggy bank!! That's what happened!!!! Kate Firko Grade 4 Califon School I once found money under the couch at my friend's' house during a sleepover. If I recall it was a Friday night and it was now Saturday morning. I had found two dollars, one for me and one for my friend, but when she was getting ready for a basketball game I set it down to do her hair and never picked it back up. So I never did anything with it. Ava Keiser Grade 4 Califon School Yea, once I found a few cents on the floor, but that's all.  I put the money in my piggy bank.

Bond's family is asking volunteers to meet at the Walmart off Joe B. Jackson Parkway at 8 a.m. Friday to join a search party. The Riverdale High School freshman was reported missing last Friday after his younger brother noticed he had placed towels and pillows under a blanket to make it look like he was still in bed. There were reports that Bond may have been in nearby Barfield Crescent Park Saturday, which stretches more than 400 acres. A group of volunteers, including Bond's family and friends, searched for several hours on Thursday. The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office and the Tennessee Highway Patrol have also been looking for Bond. Detective Randy Groce, who is leading the investigation, said that he is following all leads, while school resource officers are monitoring social media and talking to students. "We will continue to search diligently," said Groce in a news release. "The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office joins the family in finding Devin. We are asking for prayers in locating Devin." A candlelight vigil is planned for Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Barfield Crescent Park. Anyone with information about Bond's whereabouts is asked to call RCSO at 615-898-7770 or Groce at 615-904-3049.

Subscribe here.  Are big corporations among the firewalls protecting the Republic from Donald Trump? It would be comforting to think so. Silicon Valley has risen up against Trump’s anti-Muslim attacks. More than 100 of the most prominent tech giants, from Microsoft to Tesla, signed an amicus brief challenging Trump’s immigration orders. Starbucks made a point of announcing that the company would hire 10,000 refugees. The Super Bowl ads were a veritable festival of anti-Trump sentiment, some subtle, others surprisingly direct. Budweiser celebrated the dreams of its immigrant founder. An Airbnb ad declared, “We believe no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong.” 84 Lumber’s astonishing commercial followed a young Mexican girl and her mother trying to make it to America, on foot, in a boxcar, and on a flatbed truck, finally finding a door through a wall. Fox refused to air the full, six-minute version, but did run a cut-down one-minute spot whose message was unmistakable. Google’s ad depicted a rainbow of families of different ethnicities, religions, and sexual orientations, ending with a party and a “Welcome Home” cake. Take that, Steve Bannon. Several of America’s largest corporations, including Apple and Google, have defended transgender people. In a statement, Apple publicly attacked Trump’s repeal of guidelines on transgender bathroom use in schools: “We support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe that transgender students should be treated as equals.” Target endorsed the proposed federal Equality Act, which adds protections to LGBT people. Corporate America continued voting with its feet against states that display bigotry. North Carolina, epicenter of both anti-transgender policy and suppression of voting rights, keeps losing convention business, sports events, and concerts. Some 41 large companies have poked Trump in the eye by donating directly to Planned Parenthood, including not-especially-progressive outfits like American Express, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Nike, Ford, and Verizon. And Nordstrom, Macy’s, and several others have stopped carrying Trump family brands. Professional sports teams with large numbers of black athletes took pains to distance themselves from Trump. Several players from the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, a team with long-standing ties to Trump, boycotted the team’s White House visit. A handful of franchise owners and officials have expressed their personal displeasure at Trump. John Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles said that Trump was not welcome to throw out the first ball unless he apologized for all the offensive things he’s said. What gives? Is corporate America giving the commander in chief a big middle-finger salute?   BEFORE WE EMBRACE our improbable saviors too ardently, consider several caveats. Where are the corporations on the economic issues? Where they usually are, of course. They now have a plutocrat champion in the White House who makes William McKinley look like a socialist. If you unpack the issues where big corporations are crossing Trump, they are the cultural ones—immigrant rights, transgender rights, reproductive rights, support for a multicultural America. This is progress, of a sort. It does serve as a counterweight to Trump’s cultivation of the most vicious forces of the far right. However, on the core issues that have defined America’s slide into reactionary economic policies, corporate elites are lined up at Trump’s trough—to double down on the same policies they have been aggressively pushing since Ronald Reagan. While America’s biggest companies, especially those with reputational concerns, are singing kumbaya with a multicultural rainbow, these same companies are happily taking the tax cuts, the deregulation, and the anti-labor laws. Even our liberal-ish friends in Silicon Valley want nothing to do with regulatory constraints, much less labor protections. On some key policy issues, corporate America has proved to be surprisingly impotent. Three of the largest players in America’s health-industrial complex—the hospital industry, the insurance industry, and the American Medical Association—took strong stands against the Republican health bill, and lobbied against it. None of that cut any ice. How come? Maybe they didn’t lobby all that hard. The bill includes some nice perks for insurance executives. It repeals the ACA’s limits on tax-deductible executive pay, intended to limit the ability of companies to pass along windfall profits from their expanded customer base to corporate brass. The drug companies, meanwhile, are salivating at the prospect of even less regulation under Trump’s FDA. Likewise the bankers, and the energy industry, and the telecom giants. So companies with direct consumer exposure, such as AmEx or Verizon, can throw a few bucks at Planned Parenthood, while they chuckle all the way to the bank, buoyed by the prospect of lower taxes, less regulation, weaker unions, and right-wing judges who will overturn what remains of health, safety, consumer, labor, and environmental regulation. On a handful of issues, there is convergence between corporate self-interest and common decency. Corporate America is liberal on immigration, but for all the wrong reasons. Back when Republicans and Democrats were working on a compromise path to citizenship for undocumented workers, corporations were among the biggest backers. Imagine—all those low-wage workers under strict legal constraints to stay out of trouble. Yum. Trump has appointed climate-change deniers to key energy and environment posts. Where is corporate America on that? A small segment of American industry is making money off the green economy, but the big fossil fuel companies are back in the saddle, thanks to Trump. And Walmart, the number one predator when it comes to mistreating workers, tries to change the subject by being the greenest robber baron in town. Where is the corporate pushback against the Republican war on science? Several of the same corporations that took progressive stands on cultural issues, such as AmEx and Verizon, are also supporters of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which promotes right-wing policies at the state level. Among the core items in ALEC’s playbook are strategies to suppress voting participation. Did somebody say black lives matter? This corporate support of the Tea Party base has served both to strengthen the infrastructure of the far right and to undermine the living standards and economic security of ordinary people. The somewhat bizarre alliance between the culturally liberal Wall Street right and the culturally reactive Tea Party right paved the way for Trump. Corporations undercut pay and job security for workers, while they embraced multiculturalism. The Tea Party nourished the resentment against both. There is a perverse and paradoxical symbiosis here. Corporate America and its Republican allies execute economic policies that make daily life more arduous for ordinary people. But they burnish their image by supporting liberal social causes like immigrant rights and protections for transgender people. And then the conservative social base gets mobilized against both trends. Somehow, the corporations escape the wrath of working-class America. That gets deflected onto liberals, immigrants, blacks, and gays. Meanwhile, Democrats have been losing winnable elections because progressive cultural policies are easier for them to embrace than aggressively anti-corporate pocketbook policies. Going left on multicultural issues while largely failing to articulate a politics of class uplift cost Democrats the 2016 election. Trump’s economic populism is, of course, fake. Four decades of an increasingly virulent business elite paved the way for it. On no significant issue are Trump’s pocketbook politics at odds with those promoted by big business.   IS THIS TOO HARSH? If you take a close look at the good-guy corporations on issues other than identity politics, here’s what you find: There are a small number of idiosyncratic corporations led by genuine progressives, such as the original Ben and Jerry’s, and God bless them. We also have corporations that are various shades of green, ranging from completely bogus green-washing, to entrepreneurs who have found ways to profit from marketing clean technology and a variety of renewable forms of energy. Then we have the larger movement for corporate social responsibility, and its international counterpart, the voluntary movement to improve working conditions and environmental standards, by promoting labels for a broad range of products and processes. These range from fair-trade coffee to sustainable forestry to decent labor conditions for garment workers in Bangladesh, and dozens of others. Take a close look, and these certified goods represent a small fraction of total production, and they are losing more ground than they are gaining. Indeed, if you go back half a century, the truth is that progress was made on the entire front of environmental, labor, public health, and safety issues when citizens mobilized and legislatures passed mandatory laws—not via corporate voluntarism. For two decades after World War II, business got along with unions, not because elites had had a change of heart but because of a power shift. The same was true of the spate of environmental laws enacted in the 1970s. In the famous formulation of Lyndon Johnson, who was very skeptical when his Vietnam advisers told him that America needed to win hearts and minds, if you get them by the [private parts], their hearts and minds will follow. This is surely true, in spades, when it comes to reining in corporate excess. Yes, it’s great to have some class traitors among your allies, but it’s no substitute for a real movement.   BUT WHAT ABOUT democracy itself? There is a whole school of democratic theory that associates liberal democracy with the spread of economic laissez-faire. Cheerleaders for freer markets like both Friedmans (Milton and Tom) have insisted that democracy and capitalism logically go together. Going back to the days of Adam Smith, we’ve heard that free markets and free peoples reinforce one another. Supposedly, capitalism promotes democracy, because of common norms of transparency, rule of law, and free competition—for markets, for ideas, for votes. Democracy and capitalism are intimate allies. So when an existential threat to democracy like Trump arises, the captains of industry will surely come together to defend core democratic institutions. Oh, did I miss that? The nexus between free-market capitalism and democracy sounds plausible, until one examines the actual relationship throughout history. Slavery was a quintessentially commercial enterprise. Abolitionists in liberal Massachusetts, center of the 19th-century textile industry that depended on cheap Southern cotton, spoke scathingly of the alliance between the loom and the lash. In the 20th century, capitalists coexisted nicely with dictatorships, which conveniently created friendly business climates, cut taxes, and repressed independent worker organizations. Western capitalists have enriched and propped up third-world despots who crush local democracy. Western extractive industries have worked with dictators to plunder natural resources, pay kickbacks, exploit corruption, and give almost none of the benefits to local people. Communist China works hand in glove with capitalist business partners to destroy free labor unions and to preserve the political monopoly of the party. Vladimir Putin presides over a rigged brand of capitalism and governs in harmony with approved kleptocrats. Western businesses helped work to overthrow insurgent democratic regimes that threatened their financial interests, from Chile to Iraq, and cut deals with dictators from Kazakhstan to the Congo. International companies and bankers promoted capitalism in post-Soviet Russia. They didn’t exactly promote democracy. During the shabbier periods of American history, our government has protected purely commercial interests by sending in the Marines or fomenting coups. Today’s global backlash, in both its populist and religious-fundamentalist forms, is partly the result of the less-savory face of American corporate power overseas. General Augusto Pinochet took his economic advice from los chicos de Chicago. His ultra free-market economic advisers got a lot of publicity for counseling the dictator on how to deregulate the Chilean economy. They were notably silent on Pinochet’s brutal repression of any political opposition. In the 1930s, big business found it congenial to work with Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco. Adam Hochschild’s new history, Spain in Our Hearts, recounts how Texaco, in violation of the Neutrality Acts, literally helped turn the tide for Franco’s fascists against the Spanish Republic—not only by refusing to sell the Republic oil while generously supplying Franco’s forces, but also providing Franco’s Nazi ally with intelligence on the Republic’s oil sources so the Luftwaffe could sink the tankers. Large German corporations, from Deutsche Bank to Thyssen, Krupp, and I.G. Farben, assumed Hitler could be worked with to serve common interests and would moderate once in office. When the Fuehrer only became more vicious, the German corporate elite went along for the ride, and got quite rich on rearmament until the unfortunate miscalculation of World War II. Several American corporations briefly got into trouble for helping Hitler. Even after war was declared, Ford and GM subsidiaries in Germany continued to operate. ITT and RCA, via intermediaries in Switzerland, continued to collaborate with their German partners, Siemens and Telefunken. History shows that when circumstances demand awful choices, the logical conclusion of the corporate state is fascism.   TRUMP IS NOT HITLER. But if we think corporate America will serve as a bulwark against his excesses, we are as delusional as Trump is. When right-wing Republicans went after the fundamentals of democracy, by suppressing the right to vote, or shutting down the government over budget disputes, or refusing to even hold hearings on dozens of judicial nominations, we didn’t see any warm and fuzzy ads from Google, Apple, or Starbucks. Donald Trump calls out particular corporate executives when that is expedient, but his is a quintessentially corporate regime. With few exceptions, corporations conclude that Trump, weirdness and all, serves their interests. They are bankers and billionaires first, citizens a distant second. Not only do corporations fail to promote democracy; the converse is also true. Both at home and abroad, democracy has expanded by limiting the power of business. Constraints on corporate abuses have been necessary to give ordinary people more liberty and security to pursue a decent livelihood. When that project fails, dark forces are often unleashed. The political scientist Yascha Mounk makes a useful distinction. The problem threatening democratic practice today is not just illiberal democracy—governments with the form but not the substance of real democracy, from Turkey to Hungary to Russia and the dictatorial urges of Trump Tower. The problem is also undemocratic liberalism. By this Mounk means liberalism in its European sense, as ultra-marketization that narrows the space for democratic deliberation. All the major trade deals of the past two decades and the austerity rules of the European Union add up to what the economist Dani Rodrik calls hyperglobalization. The goal is to diminish the capacity of the democratic nation-state to housebreak capitalism, and it succeeds all too well. Mounk’s point is that undemocratic liberalism and illiberal democracy feed on each other, by leaving people who are not part of the Davos set far behind. So the challenge for progressives is not to make better alliances with corporations, but to restore democratic constraints on corporate power. In the late 1990s, a British NGO called Publish What You Pay (PWYP) devised an ingenious strategy for going after the bribery paid by Western extractive industries to third-world dictators. It pressured these Western corporations to disclose the bribe payments. A few, beginning with BP, agreed. Due to persistence and luck, PWYP even managed to get a mandatory disclosure provision included in the Dodd-Frank Act. Companies now had to disclose such payments in their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulations carrying out this provision were among the very first to be scrapped in Trump’s war against regulation. You can just imagine how many corporations tried to block the repeal, in their splendid civic defense of the transparency that is allegedly common to efficient markets and democracy. That would be none. Thus far, Donald Trump has assaulted American democracy in several respects. He has stirred up hatred by associating his presidency with far-right haters. He has done everything in his power to undermine the free press. He has sought to use decrees to undermine the rule of law. Substantively, his policies have escalated the war against a balanced, socially decent form of capitalism. Some of corporate America has resisted the pure hate part, and for this we can offer one cheer. But let’s not kid ourselves. Despite the touchy-feely corporate commercials about America being a big, happy, diverse family, there is far more that unites business with Trump than divides them. At the end of the day, we need the same movement to keep Trump from destroying basic democracy and to keep business elites from destroying a decent brand of capitalism. We will defend and redeem American democracy the old-fashioned way, by mobilizing ordinary citizens.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Julie Scagell By Julie Scagell April 7 at 6:00 AM (iStock) “Can I whisper something in your ear?” my son asked, sidling up to me on the couch one morning the week before his fifth birthday. He smelled sweet of sweat and pancake syrup. “Of course you can. Talk to me,” I said. “I’m wondering if I can ask for Shopkins for my birthday. I want them but they are for girls,” he said with a hush. I sat stunned. Gender is not something we often consider when making decisions in our household. Both of my sons have enjoyed getting their nails done with me, and I happily oblige. My daughter had little interest in dolls or dresses, preferring her younger brother’s hockey jersey as acceptable school-picture attire until middle school, when hormones took hold and makeup became the norm. But somewhere at school, my youngest came to believe Shopkins were meant for girls. [Her young daughter thought Gap’s clothes were too girlie. Here’s how the company’s CEO responded.] We’ve seen the outrageous ways marketers pitch pink anything to women (pens, hammers), while candy comes in “adventurous” flavors for boys and “enchanted” flavors for girls. There are pink clothes hangers for girls and blue for boys, and even cowgirl toy guns in, of course, pink. While toy manufacturers continue to brand toys specifically based on gender, big names such as Target, Walmart and Toys R Us have stopped labeling aisles specifically “boy” or “girl.” “So what’s the harm?” you might ask. National Geographic’s January issue, titled “Gender Revolution,” explored the science and research behind gender and its history, expression, evolution and impact on society. [‘I’m not a boy, I’m a girl,’ she told her parents. Here’s how they handled it.] According to Natasha Daly, author of the National Geographic article “How Today’s Toys May Be Harming Your Daughter,” the various researchers she interviewed believe that “anytime play is restricted or one gender is not exposed to certain toys, there are bound to be consequences. Research already shows girls’ play is negatively impacted in the areas of spatial reasoning and problem-solving because they are not encouraged to build or construct. We know, for instance, that girls’ puzzles are made with fewer pieces.” She also learned through her discussions that, “toys can impact comfort level. For instance, Legos are equated with construction, dolls with nurturing. When kids aren’t given a chance to develop these skills through play, it can have an impact later in life.” Play is central to the development of critical thinking early in life. How we play, and the toys we play with, can affect a child’s future profession. Some researchers even say this is why we do not see as many women pursue science, technology, engineering and math careers. “If parents understand the importance of exposing boys and girls to different types of toys, they can make informed decisions based on that information rather than what is being marketed to them based on their child’s gender,” Daly said. The gender bias extends far beyond the toy aisle. I took my oldest to a babysitting class last summer to become an official, CPR-certified child-watching tween. Of the 16 people in her class, one was male. Another friend told me his 16-year-old son’s Advanced Placement computer-science class is 16 boys to one girl. Is this a result of parents not offering options or a genuine lack of interest? [Are you holding your own daughter back? A Harvard psychologist gives 5 ways to raise girls to be leaders.] What impact might this have on stay-at-home fathers, a role typically filled by women in past generations? According to the Pew Research Center, the ranks of stay-at-home and single fathers have grown significantly in recent decades. As of 2012, 16 percent of U.S. fathers with children in their household were not working outside the home — that’s roughly 2 million dads. Of those, 21 percent reported that they were home to provide care for their family, up from 5 percent in 1989. With women today getting the majority of college degrees in the United States, that trend is likely to continue upward. It is also remarkable to note that we don’t really have a word, a positive one anyway, for boys who play and act in a feminine manner, unless we tie it to sexuality. For girls, we use the term “tomboy.” But for boys who enjoy playing dress-up or with dolls or baking, the word is often “sissy” — or worse. There is a negative connotation associated with anything less than complete masculinity, even in adulthood. Remember the amount of grief Ben Stiller’s character got in “Meet the Fockers” for being a male nurse? And that is a laugh track in a movie. It speaks nothing to the fact that almost half of trans-identified people have attempted or died by suicide. Or that kids who are bullied for being different (often tied to sexual identity or gender) are two to nine times as likely to consider suicide than non-victims, according to studies by Yale University. In 2016, more transgender people were the victim of hate crimes in the United States than in any other year on record, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Those who say these kids should just live with the gender they were assigned at birth have never had to question theirs. While we are making strides to bridge the gap where gender is concerned — the first male CoverGirl, legislation centered on transgender people’s use of bathrooms, stores such as Target removing gender signage, publications such as National Geographic devoting entire issues to keeping these important conversations going — we still have a long way to go. Identity is important. Feeling as though you belong somewhere, and are not judged for it, means something. We proudly wear our favorite sports teams’ gear; we join the alumni groups of our alma maters. But belonging means something different for all of us. When we remove gender labels, we become a more inclusive society. Not just for transgender children. Or people who are bisexual or gay or gender non-binary. But for all of us. For girls such as my cousin, a neuroimmunologist finding a cure for multiple sclerosis. And also for my son, who will be getting Shopkins for his fifth birthday.

The Harvard Crimson An Articulate Art: Spoken Rhetoric in the Contemporary University The lines in the photograph are from Ryan F. Boyland ’17’s poetry, which he writes and performs. Grace Z. Li An Articulate Art: Spoken Rhetoric in the Contemporary University The place of spoken rhetoric in the liberal arts curriculum at Harvard remains uncertain, even as professors and students today use rhetoric as both a creative art and a practical skill. By Lucy Wang, CRIMSON STAFF WRITER April 7, 2017 In 1995, Jay Heinrichs published a piece in Harvard Magazine titled “How Harvard Destroyed Rhetoric.” The article criticized Harvard’s undergraduate curriculum, which “doesn’t offer a single course in which oratorical theory and practice are taught together.” Today, such a course exists—Expository Writing 40: “Public Speaking Practicum,” though it’s the only spoken rhetoric class in the undergraduate curriculum. Marcus K. Granderson ’18, who designed his own concentration, Rhetoric, had to commute to MIT last year to take his introductory rhetoric class because Harvard didn’t offer one. Even at a liberal arts college with a broad range of course offerings, the place of studying rhetoric in the undergraduate education remains uncertain. Some students and professors view speaking as a skill crucial to any sort of career, while others see it as a creative outlet and type of performance. Still others value rhetoric as a way of enhancing and enriching human communication. Although some argue that advanced technologies and social media are beginning to replace face-to-face conversation, many students at Harvard still see the ancient art form of spoken rhetoric as worth pursuing, both inside and outside the classroom. Defining Rhetoric Expos 40 may be an anomaly in the undergraduate course catalogue, but at the Kennedy School, the Business School, and the Graduate School of Education, rhetoric courses are much more available. One such course, on offer at all three schools, is “The Arts of Communication.” Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, an Adjunct Lecturer on public policy at the Kennedy School, teaches six sections of the course this semester. “It’s a course that seeks to introduce students to the arts of communication and public speaking, and some writing, and a little media training as well, but it’s mostly based on public oratory,” he said. The title of the course itself implies that spoken rhetoric has an artistic side to it. “Public speaking is by nature performative. You move, you use your voice, you use your body, you try to connect with people in different ways, you make eye contact, you master a script, you use language,” he said. So what is spoken rhetoric anyway? An art? A practical skill? Steven D. Cohen, who holds a faculty appointment at the Harvard Extension School, where he teaches “Oral Communication In the Workplace,” splits spoken rhetoric into two components. “On a basic level, there’s what you say and how you say it. But what I write about is the music beneath the words,” Cohen said. Vocal performances have a clear connection to spoken rhetoric, but Cohen said that even music without lyrics can provide models for speaking. “There are elements that both speakers and musicians use: tempo, dynamics, pitch, for instance. And a couple of my research articles look at the technique that composers use to create beautiful pieces of classical music, and the techniques that leaders use to create memorable moments,” he said. “So my central argument is that we ought not just consider the words that speakers use, but the music they use to coat those words.” In some contexts, such as spoken word poetry, rhetoric is essential to the art form itself. Ryan F. Boyland ’17 is a member of Speak Out Loud, a spoken word poetry group on campus, and also performs on his own. Just as Cohen makes a distinction between the words and the way that they’re spoken, Boyland also articulates the difference between the written and performed versions of his poems. “I perform for others, but I write for myself,” he said. “I perform because I want people to feel something, that’s the goal. I write because I like to write. I feel like it helps me figure out the way that I’m thinking, my emotions.” Boyland said that he uses his techniques of speaking as a way to respond in real time to the reactions of his audiences. He echoes Cohen in his sense of the musicality inherent in spoken word. “I’m not that great of a writer. People like the way that I say things,” Boyland said. “I feel like with my stuff, not necessarily with everyone, a lot of the message is found in the way that things are said. Just with the emotions, the pauses, or the lack thereof, all of that together.” Boyland emphasizes that music and rhetoric not only sound similar, but also share a broader communicative purpose. “I feel like music and poetry and spoken word are all just different types of storytelling, different ways to convey your ideas,” Boyland said. At the heart of it, these students and professors see rhetoric as a means of creative expression. “As human beings, we’re hardwired to be social creatures,” McCarthy said, “We seek to be understood.” Amanda N. Dias-Jayasinghe ’17, who took Expos 40 last fall, sees the connection between public speaking and the deeper messages that music conveys. “Music is all about the words, but there’s something about the rhythm, the instruments, that conveys the sense that it’s happiness, or it’s hope. And that’s the same with public speaking. You can tell a story, just as you can with a novel, with a painting. It’s not just you that’s experiencing it, it’s your whole audience. It’s an art form in the sense that you are trying to reach a human being, because those human beings are right in front of you.” Advertisement Instructors in rhetoric echo the idea that the interpersonal aspect, the idea of connecting to the audience, is crucial to spoken rhetoric. David S. Carter, currently one of the three preceptors for Expos 40, said that speaking is as much a craft as other forms of art. Expos 40 focuses on improving public speaking skills through practice and cultivating an understanding of communication itself. In addition to delivering three speeches throughout the semester, students practice impromptu speaking, analyze famous speeches, and write their own. “I think because our class is a practicum, we practice the craft. If you want to call it an art, it certainly can get in the poetic,” he said. “We practice the craft of gauging an audience, which is artistic.” A Practical Art Though the music of the words may very well define spoken rhetoric as an art, students and faculty also note rhetoric’s practicality and pre-professional purposes. Cole S. Scanlon ’18, a previous student of Expos 40, sees spoken rhetoric as almost universally useful. “Public speaking is such an everyday skill,” he said. Paul Lisker ’17, another former student of Expos 40, said that students in almost any field need public speaking skills to prepare themselves for life after college. “I think that being an effective speaker is sort of essential for most careers that people take, certainly many of the careers that people in Harvard are interested in in particular. If you’re going into finance, or science, or government, any of these professions will require public speaking,” he said. Other students say that they’ve seen the gap in their education when they leave Harvard to pursue jobs and internships. Dias-Jayasinghe recalls a public speaking opportunity at her internship last summer at Wal-Mart as the “most embarrassing moment of my life.” “I was asked to M.C. a Wal-Mart quarterly meeting,” she said. “So I was in front of all these executives, thousands of people, and I completely froze on speech.” Dias-Jayasinghe knew that public speaking was a skill that she wanted to work on. In fact, she’d been trying to lottery into Expos 40 since the second semester of her freshman year. Since Expos 40 is the only rhetoric class at the college, however, and she was not chosen for the lottery until after this internship, Dias-Jayasinghe had had little opportunity to practice her spoken rhetoric in a classroom setting before she had to give her presentation. A Rhetoric Requirement? Dias-Jayasinghe is not alone in her experience with Expos 40’s lottery process. In fact, over 200 students get turned away from the class each semester. “Expos 40 is a lottery class,” Carter said. “We have between 250 and 300 students each semester who want to apply, who do apply. But we can only choose five sections, no more than 70 or 80 people.” Juan P. Castaño ’17 presents a speech on happiness as part of Expos 40, a public speaking class. Grace Z. Li Students who have taken the class see its value as part of the undergraduate education, but are split on the issue of whether such a rhetoric class should be required. Currently, all undergraduates are required to take Expos 20, an expository writing course. But Expos 40 is purely elective and does not currently fulfill a General Education requirement. “I think that Expos 20 should definitely be required. And I think that Expos 40 should be as well, or some kind of public speaking class,” Lisker said. Granderson, who designed his own concentration in rhetoric, thinks that it should be an integral part to every undergraduate’s education. “Every college student should be required to take at least one rhetoric class, I can’t stress how important that is,” he said. Dias-Jayasinghe agrees. “I wish there were more options for courses,” she said. Scanlon said that he felt similarly. “I think Harvard should do a better job at encouraging public speaking, be it offering more classes [or] expanding the Expos 40 sections,” he said. However, Scanlon does not think that Expos 40 should be a required course. “I’m very con requirements, generally,” he said. “I think the fact that so many people are lotterying for it speaks to its value, and that that’s enough to cause a lot of people to enroll in it, which already happens, but I don’t think it needs to be a requirement. Because I think there are cases in which people might not want to do it or whatever else.” Professor Jeffrey L. Seglin, who is the director of the Communications Program at the Kennedy School, does not believe that requiring Expos 40 would be a positive change in the curriculum. “Anytime you make something a requirement it results in resentment,” he said. “But I think the skills that we teach are those that anyone graduating from college should have.” Instead, he said that the college could offer a set of courses from which students could choose and make it a requirement that the students take at least one of those courses. Constructing a Concentration For Granderson, however, just one class wasn’t enough. He started out thinking about a government concentration, but then realized that didn’t fit his interests completely. In high school, his first introduction to the academic side of rhetoric was in his AP Language class. He also participated in debate in high school, which he said wasn’t as artistically fulfilling as what he was looking for. Marcus K. Granderson ’18 crafted his own special concentration in rhetoric. Grace Z. Li “The power of rhetoric in American history, thinking about Martin Luther King, and Frederick Douglass, Shirley Chisholm, Sojourner Truth, all these different powerful orators who have moved the needle of history by their words, it was just really attractive to me,” he said. Since Granderson had to create his own curriculum and set of courses to take, he did some research online and looked to other schools for inspiration. “Berkeley actually has this program, an extensive rhetoric program. I looked at how they constructed it, their concentration, and I drew upon it. They were looking at film, looking at literature, looking at poetry, looking at rhetoric in all of these mediums, to give a multidisciplinary approach to rhetoric,” he said. “So I tried to do the same in my concentration, tweaking it more to my interests.” He added that he sees rhetoric as inherently linked to many different areas of a liberal arts curriculum. “Rhetoric is a multi-disciplinary idea to me,” he said. Among the classes that he included in his own curriculum are rhetoric classes at MIT, because there were no specific “rhetoric” classes offered for undergraduates when Granderson made the concentration. Instead, he’s taken classes ranging from psychology to the sciences. “Science is one [subject] that people don’t necessarily associate with rhetoric, but I took a class on climate and talking about how we frame climate change can change how people perceive it,” Granderson said. To Granderson, rhetoric is as valuable as any other liberal arts program offered for undergraduates at Harvard. “Harvard is always talking about how it’s training future world leaders, but what if those future world leaders don’t understand how to talk about well-reasoned, well-thought out ethical arguments, and also [don’t understand] the rhetoric that is coming at them?” he said. Extension School Professor Cohen believes that teaching rhetoric aligns with the values of Harvard. “Harvard is all about creating leadership. And the way to create leadership, the way to get undergraduates out there, is to not just learn about the art of communication, but also the science of communication,” he said. While some liberal arts schools, such as Seglin’s alma mater Emerson College, require an oral communication class, many American universities today do not include rhetoric among their core offerings. Cohen said that Harvard has the chance to be one of the first to do so. “It’s about doing something that the Ivy League hasn’t yet tackled. It’s about making communications part of the core curriculum. It will differentiate Harvard, it will make us stand out,” he said. “It will send a signal to the world that we’re not only a place where we breed leaders, but we’re a place where we give leaders the skills we need to achieve their goals.” Advertisement Michael D. Smith, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Robin Kelsey, Dean of Arts and Humanities, did not respond to emailed requests for comment. A Political Art From a political perspective, McCarthy also emphasizes the importance of rhetoric skills for students interested in becoming successful leaders. “Many people are increasingly coming to understand that one has to be an effective communicator in order to be an effective leader and to have any kind of success in public life requires you have to have fairly advanced and even sophisticated skills,” he said. “You have to be able to write well, speak well, you have to be able to communicate through the media, you need to be able to code-switch in different settings with different audiences.” In the current political climate, students are recognizing rhetoric not only as a classical art, but as one that renders political discourse dynamic and subjective. Lisker, for instance, compared President Donald Trump’s ways of speaking to pointillism, an artistic style that was controversial and idely criticized when it first appeared. “Donald Trump’s rhetoric, I don’t think it’s a very typical type of art, but it’s subjective and could also be characterized as a distinct school of art,” he said. Some even see rhetoric as deceptive, as putting content in a more attractive package. Seglin, Director of the Kennedy School’s Communications Program, emphasizes the necessity of quality content as well as persuasive rhetoric. “I’d much rather deal with someone who has content and has rough edges, than deal with someone who has nothing to say,” he said. “It’s easy for me to help someone become a better writer if they have something to say. What’s really challenging is if someone’s gifted or charismatic but has no meat, and there’s nothing really there.” Contemporary Communication As media of communication evolve, so does rhetoric. McCarthy recognizes that changes in the way we communicate pose challenges to some of the classical techniques of rhetoric that Aristotle posed. “Aristotle never would’ve imagined a tweeting Trump,” McCarthy said. “But in fact, Aristotle is deeply relevant in the twenty-first century because he laid out a practice of rhetoric and a structure of rhetoric that is very much still alive and well today.” Expos 40 preceptor Carter said that he believes that perfecting spoken rhetoric requires students to be less dependent on electronic forms of communication. While he recognizes that students juggle often not one, but multiple smart devices, he says that he asks students to step away from them in the classroom. “It’s the elephant in the room, in one respect,” Carter said. “I do say that you don’t need your laptops, we ask you not to use your laptops in class, because it’s a very practical, interactive, experiential course. The experience is to interact with each other on a verbal level to get that practice. To take people away from the texting and typing.” Granderson said he thinks that technology has the potential to erode the very basis of traditional rhetoric. “I think that social media, that whole 140-character, short prose, is killing rhetoric,” he said. “Rhetoric to me is about long, sustained, well-crafted, multi-point arguments that bring together poetry and different philosophical ideas and different novels in literature and all these ideas to make well-reasoned and well-thought out, artistic arguments” Yet for some, new technologies herald new forms of rhetoric rather than its disappearance from social life. “I think rhetoric has evolved, as many art forms do. Some people think that the art of writing is lost, because people don’t write letters anymore. I don’t think it’s being lost, it’s just different from what it used to be,” Lisker said. “There’s a certain beauty to the evolution of art. You can’t let art stagnate. I don’t think rhetoric is stagnating, it’s evolving, and I think it’s really exciting.” —Staff writer Lucy Wang can be reached at lucy.wang@thecrimson.com.

Adkins Special to the AFRO / (Courtesy Photo) / April 6, 2017 0 354 tweet Anyone who has ever been on Capitol Hill knows it isn’t exactly a beacon for diversity. Now, as first-ever director of the Black Talent Initiative at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Don Bell, 27, says his top priority is lobbying Hill lawmakers to hire more Black people in key staffing roles. Don Bell is the first-ever director of the Black Talent Initiative at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. (Courtesy Photo) “Those are the positions the really influence a member of Congress,” said Bell, who worked on the Hill for three years and joined the center March 20. “My mission every day will be to try to help some other person achieve the dream that I once had, which was to work in the policy space on Capitol Hill.” To that end, the initiative is launching a multi-pronged strategy to beef up diversity on the Hill.  Those plans include: Pushing for paid internships and fellowships for people who don’t have the means to work on the Hill for free. Deploying a talent bank that pairs resumes of promising Black candidates with jobs on Hill. Supporting those candidates with mock interviews and professional development sessions. Conducting research for a follow-up study on diversity among key Senate staff and for a new report on diversity among Senate legislative assistants. Bell pushed diversity as president of the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus, a position he left after he joined the center. At the end of November, the caucus released a report that showed just five percent of the Senate’s nearly 3,600 staffers are Black. “We have a long way to go, and Don is someone who has proven that he won’t rest until we achieve true diversity in our federal workforce,” Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said in a statement. The caucus study builds on a 2015 report the center compiled on diversity among Senate staff. It found that while people of color comprise 36 percent of the U.S. population just 7.1 percent of them hold top positions in the Senate. Bell is working on a report that analyzes diversity among top staffers working in the House. The diversity disparity persists for several reasons. Financial barriers, for example, make it even more difficult to get to the Hill and stay long enough in a low-paying job there to move into a mid or senior-level position, he said. Bell found a way around those financial issues by working at Wal-Mart and relying on his friends’ generosity. He was born and raised in Connecticut to parents who worked as custodians. His parents, Donald and Julie Bell, didn’t have much money, but they taught him the importance of education, being resourceful and paying it forward. Bell was the first in his family to graduate from college, and he did it in three years to save money. He also holds a law degree from the University of Connecticut School of Law. “All that has taught me to work hard for other people,” Bell said. He arrived in the District in 2012 as an unpaid legal fellow/intern for Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Bell realized his work was helping his home state and shaping judiciary and housing policy. During the first week of his four-month stint, he decided he wanted more. “I just really enjoyed being heavily involved in the policy space and just thinking of ways to improve the lives of people,” Bell said. He returned to the District the following year after graduating from law school. This time, he worked eight months as an unpaid legal fellow for Christopher Murphy, Connecticut’s junior senator. By day, Bell worked with Murphy’s counsel on juvenile justice and other important issues. But at night, Bell worked as a Wal-Mart cashier to make ends meet.  He was putting in 14-to-16 hour days during this period. But thanks to friends who supported him and later, a stipend and paid positions on the Hill — most recently as counsel to the most recent ranking members on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs — Bell only spent two months working at Wal-Mart. Yet he hasn’t forgotten what he learned there. “As someone who wanted to be part of the policy-making space and have a seat at the table, it wasn’t just about me getting to that position,” Bell said. “It was about me getting to the policy-making position and affecting the people that got up every day, worked very hard, struggled deeply and felt they didn’t have a voice in D.C. or in our country.” SHARE Facebook Twitter Previous articleAdditional School Funding Won’t Cover Baltimore Budget Shortfall Next articleCounty Leaders Voice Opposing Viewpoints on Bail Bond Issue Special to the AFRO RELATED ARTICLES Commentary WE’RE WITH THEM!

Image: 55Ohms/Shutterstock There are 25 women on this industry-spanning list of CIOs. That’s 10 more than the percentage found in all Fortune 500 companies. Last year, a Korn Ferry Institute study of the largest companies in the US found that only 24pc of those in C-suite roles were women. When it came to the role of chief information officer (CIO), that number dropped to 19pc. “Having gender equality in the CIO role is already top of mind for CEOs and boards. We expect this focus to continue for years to come as the CIO creates greater strategic impact across organisations,” said Craig Stephenson from Korn Ferry when this data was released. Image: Korn Ferry Institute Singling out Fortune 500 companies, Boardoom Insiders found an even smaller female CIO headcount of 15pc as of November 2016. However, the top 100 of these companies manage to hit 20pc, which aligns with other research indicating that companies with gender-diverse leadership prove to be more profitable. These studies and more like them have ensured more focus is being paid to closing the gender gap in business leadership, putting diversity on the boardroom agenda. And so, because representation matters in the battle for gender diversity in tech, we have drawn up this long list of women CIOs (plus a handful of exceptions in CIO-adjacent roles who continue to influence in this space). We found CIOs with interesting stories, spanning a broad spectrum of industry in this technical role. Many are directing IT strategy at world-famous brands and Fortune 500 companies and, with decades upon decades of experience between them, have served as pioneers for women in tech. Pam Parisian As CIO of AT&T Services, Tennessee native Pam Parisian is one of a select few female CIOs at Fortune 500 companies. Parisian’s standing in the tech industry is such that she was inducted into the Women in Technology hall of fame in 2015. In recent years, she has been entrusted to lead AT&T’s integration of DirecTV, which was acquired in 2015. The initial effort involved more than 3,300 IT people and 2m hours of code. Linda Clement-Holmes Linda Clement-Holmes. Image: Linda Clement-Holmes/LinkedIn Linda Clement-Holmes is CIO of P&G, having assumed the role in October 2015. Originally joining the company in 1983, her previous roles at P&G have included chief diversity officer, SVP of global business services, and global information and decision solutions officer. A well-regarded leader, Clement-Holmes has been touted as a future CEO of the $65bn company. Sheila Jordan Sheila Jordan is CIO and SVP at cybersecurity company Symantec. With more than three years in the role to date, she currently oversees more than 600 IT employees. Jordan’s role has seen her work on the company’s two major acquisitions in the past few months – spending $4.6bn on Blue Coat and $2.3bn on LifeLock. A winner at the San Francisco CIO of the Year Awards in 2015, Jordan recently explained her role as that of integrating these two businesses into Symantec’s operation. Marcy Klevorn Marcy Klevorn, CIO, Ford. Image: Ford Named CIO of Ford in 2015, Marcy Klevorn originally started out in marketing with AT&T after earning a business degree from University of Michigan. She retrained in computer science and shifted towards Ford and, often thanking her lack of a technologist path, excelled. Klevorn recently spoke of her interest in the people side of work, claiming that interpersonal skills are as important as technical ability. She is also an advocate of encouraging more women into the tech industry. Aarti Shah Aarti Shah, senior VP and CIO, Eli Lilly. Still from ‘Employers Discuss The Demand For Statisticians’.

Photographs show discolored bananas that have likely fallen prey to a fungus, not to being injected with HIV-infected human blood. 57K CLAIM Photographs show a banana that has been injected with human blood in order to spread HIV. false RATING false ORIGIN Photographs purportedly showing bananas that had been “injected with blood” have been passed around online with varying degrees of paranoia for several years: I bought a bundle of bananas from the Walmart in Aberdeen tonight and opened it to give to my 2 yr old daughter. This is what I found on the inside! I opened the rest of the bundle and they appeared to be normal bananas. I’m not saying it’s blood but what else would it be?! One banana out of the whole bundle was like this … a little weird! Check your produce before eating it.  You never know what someone put in there. < The claims associated with the photographs have evolved from speculation about the discoloration of the banana (as seen above) to assertions that human blood was purposefully injected into the banana in order to spread HIV: As we noted in another article about a rumor concerning supposed blood-tainted oranges, it is nearly impossible for the HIV virus to be transmitted via foodstuffs: Except for rare cases in which children consumed food that was pre-chewed by an HIV-infected caregiver, HIV has not been spread through food. The virus does not live long outside the body. You cannot get it from consuming food handled by an HIV-infected person; even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. Dr. Bob Frascino came to a similar conclusion, although in a much sassier manner, when the question was posed on The Body forum in 2011: So you’re worried that folks who test HIV positive “lose moral control” and inject blood into bananas? Dude, tell me you’re kidding. Please tell me you’re kidding. Because if you’re not kidding, I’ll have to assume you’re a looney tunes fluffernutter. Yep, totally bat-sh*t crazy. Your blood-banana paranoia is too bizarre to even qualify for urban legend status. If above-displayed photographs do not show bananas that have been injected with blood (HIV-infected or otherwise), then what caused the discoloration they display? It’s likely that these bananas are experiencing some form of fungal rot, such as a type referenced in a 2011 New Yorker article about a disease destroying millions of bananas via a fungus described as producing a visual appearance featuring a “putrefying mixture of brown, black, and blood-red.” Snopes Delivered to Your Inbox: Feedback Fact Checker: Dan Evon David Mikkelson Published: Nov 11th, 2015 Updated: Apr 6th, 2017 Ask.

It’s called competition. Look at the fast food places we have. All the restaurants, too. One does not cannibalize the other. They compete against each other. We have numerous car repair places, dealerships, grocery stores. Some people have a favorite and others go where they feel the price is right. We have Target, Wal-Mart, Walgreens. They all sell miscellaneous items — food, makeup, clothes and more. Again competition. Whoever came up with the word cannibalize where a new casino in another town might be built is afraid of competition. Think it might have been the owner of Riverside Casino? You really think he’d build a water park here? Fat chance. Wendy Shramek Cedar Rapids Like what you're reading?

(Submitted photo) Progress MN: Runnings By: Todd Nelson April 7, 2017 1:42 am 0 Business: Family-owned retailer offers sporting goods, clothing, footwear, pet supplies, housewares, tools, farm supplies, lawn and garden supplies, toys and outdoor equipment along with hunting, fishing and archery equipment and accessories. Based: 901 North Highway 59, Marshall Founded: 1947 CEO: Dennis Reed Employee count: 2,000 Website: www.runnings.com Runnings, a 70-year-old retailer with deep roots in fleet and farm supplies, is enjoying continued growth as it opens larger stores with expanded selections including sporting goods, clothing and tools and pet supplies. In recent years, Runnings has relocated its New Ulm store into a 100,000-square-foot space, adding 20 jobs, and opened 90,000-square-foot stores in Austin and Monticello, generating more than 60 jobs in each of those new markets. In all three cases, Runnings took over buildings that once housed national discount stores. The transition to larger stores began in 2005, when the Marshall location moved into a former Wal-Mart, said Dennis Jensen, Runnings marketing and advertising director. That roughly coincided with a brand evolution to make Runnings “a destination to find anything and everything you want for your home, your farm, your ranch, your shop and your outdoor lifestyle,” Jensen said, noting that the Marshall store location underwent a 2015 renovation. To support its growth, Runnings last year completed a $10 million, 100,000-square-foot addition to its 65,000-square-foot Marshall distribution center. It also has distribution centers in South Dakota and New York. By year’s end, Runnings will have 41 stores, with 16 in Minnesota, including one opening this fall in Moorhead, and locations in the Dakotas, Montana, New York and New Hampshire. Norman “Red” Runnings opened the first store in 1947 in downtown Marshall. A group including CEO Dennis Reed acquired Runnings in 1988 and the Dennis and Adele Reed family took over sole ownership in 2004.

Live Watch Missing Tennessee teen's father seeks to depose witnesses in hopes of finding daughter By Catherine Thorbecke Close Follow on Twitter More from Catherine EMILY SHAPIRO Close Follow on Twitter More from Emily Apr 6, 2017, 11:45 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation WATCH 'Still in disbelief': Family holds candlelight vigil for missing Tennessee teen 0 Shares Email The father of a Tennessee teenager who was allegedly kidnapped by her former teacher filed a petition in court today, asking to depose witnesses who may know more about their purported relationship. Authorities believe 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas may have been abducted by Tad Cummins, 50, who is wanted on allegations of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. The court filing is asking for witnesses who may have any information that could aid authorities in their search for Elizabeth to be deposed. "The family cannot simply wait for information to trickle in," Jason Whatley, the attorney representing Anthony Thomas, Elizabeth's father, told ABC News today. "This petition will hopefully bring a fresh light into the disappearance of Elizabeth." The legal move comes more than three weeks after Elizabeth was reported missing on March 13. The only confirmed sighting of the pair was at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, two days after the pair disappeared. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said that Cummins, who was fired one day after the alleged kidnapping, "may have been abusing his role as a teacher to groom [the teen] ... in an effort to lure and potentially sexually exploit her." One of Elizabeth's schoolmates reported seeing her and Cummins kiss in his classroom on Jan. 23, according to a school district investigative report, but both denied the claim. A school report from January reads that neither one "admitted to behaving inappropriately towards the other." Whatley told ABC News that the family believes there are classmates, friends and teachers who may know more information that could help in the search for Elizabeth, but added that he feels some people may be intimidated or scared to talk to authorities. Dad of missing Tennessee teen who was allegedly abducted by teacher: 'Please come home to us' Walmart footage is best lead in Tennessee abduction case, expert says Whatley added in a statement that the "process of this investigation has been frustrating" for the Thomas family. "Perhaps the most concerning element has been the hesitancy of some persons to fully cooperate in sharing information that they know," Whatley said. "The purpose of our petition as filed today will hopefully put an end to that hesitancy displayed by some and will help us, as the family, to methodically confirm facts that have been at times unclear," he continued. "We have brought this petition for no purpose except to provide a vehicle for gathering information." Authorities are asking that anyone with information call 1-800-TBI-FIND and that anyone who sees a car with Tennessee license plate number 976-ZPT call 911. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Missing teen's father seeks to depose witnesses in hopes of finding daughter " ANALYSIS: 5 political takeaways after the Syria strike " Mandated police reform could make Baltimore 'less safe,' AG says " Manhunt is underway for gun-store robbery suspect who sent manifesto to Trump " NCIS: 27 suspected of 'criminal activity' in nude photos of female Marines " Rubio says President Trump 'has an obligation to act' in Syria " Trump's pick to lead border security wins support from Bush- and Obama-era officials " Myanmar ferry capsizes; 20 dead, over a dozen missing " Fast train hits Polish truck; 19 hospitalized, 7 seriously " Sheriff: 5 dead after house fire in Tennessee " Double amputee leaves her wheelchair behind " Firefighters, police save birthday of boy hailed as hero in family's house fire " Newborn girl shares birthday with dad and great-grandfather " Girl fighting cancer given American Girl doll with matching prosthetic leg " North Carolina bridesmaids trade bouquets for rescue puppies in wedding photos " Couple throws an epic state-fair-themed wedding complete with Ferris wheel, corn dogs " Hip, hip, hooray!

Angelica Roman, 43, of Ravenna, told police a stolen generator was a gift from her father. City police had seized the generator during a traffic stop on state Route 46 at 3:30 a.m. March 17. Jonathan English, 36, of Ravenna, told police he was traveling to the Salem Walmart to purchase a part for his generator, but the officer detected inconsistencies in his story. His uncle Robert English, 55, also of Ravenna, was in the car as well. Roman came to the station to ask police to return the generator. Detectives later determined that the generator had come from the Walmart at 6001 Mahoning Ave in Austintown. Surveillance footage showed two men affixing a UPC label to the generator so that the $488 item would only cost $9.87. The men also stole an iPhone 6S, police said. The Austintown Police Department issued warrants on March 27 for Robert and Jonathan English on charges of felony theft. Robert English was arrested on Monday. Jonathan English has not been processed. Canfield police arrested Roman on charges of falsification on Wednesday.

To me, this is an attainable goal. But, as President Hifikepunye Pohamba recently rightly cautioned, still we have only 25 years left. Now people want to see how this vision is going to reduce their poverty and bring a better life for their children. Tangible Results If we could start the Vision 2030 engine in 2006, then after five years (by 2010), an ordinary Namibian should be able to fulfil his basic family needs and his employable children would bee employed. People’s buying power is increased. This means that our vision has begun to deliver tangible results. Now the mission becomes a messiah for the grass-root level people. This is one way to measure the success of the vision. The next yardstick is the steady growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In 2006, the GDP is around N$12.5 and the growth is 3.8%. Let us imagine that by 2010, the GDP has risen to N$16 billion and the growth has increased to 7 percent. This growth will generate more jobs, improve insfrasture and increase investments, then people passionately will love and defend the vision. They don’t think of the vision as a rhetoric slogan. By increasing the GDP growth to 9.5%, continuously over 20 years, China could rescue 40% of the population from dire poverty and be reborn as a global economic powerhouse. It is valid for Namibia, too. Guiding Principles I believe that the V-2030 Project can be guided by the following five principles. (1) Government-Led Growth – Namibia’s growth is to be initiated by the State, mobilizing the resources of the Government and private sector. By utilizing the annual budgets, monetary and fiscal policies, during the NDP3-period (2006-10) (NDP-3), Namibia can easily leap ahead to industrialization (2) Identifying Core Economic Sectors – China is the ‘Global Factory.’ Its manufacturing industries are based on the massive capital, technological expertise, raw materials and energy. India is the ‘Global Service Hub” that focuses on software products, telecom, and business process outsourcing. They are 52% of the GDP. Japan’s focus is knowledge-intensive industries: microelectronics, automobiles and robotics. The USA thrives on advanced technologic industries, IT, pharmaceuticals, energy, and an efficient service sector. Among the world’s 10 biggest companies, four of them are owned by the USA (Walmart, Exxcon Mobil, Ford Motors, General Electric). They annually inject around US$1,000 billion to the American economy. In 2006, we should promote viable Competitive Economic Sectors (CES) for the V2030-Plan of Action. (3) Skill Development – The NDP-3 (2006-2010) will demand a more knowledgeable workforce. Our education system doesn’t produce them. Now, let us design short-term trade courses through the vocational training centers. Moreover, select 100 B. Degree holders (including Art/ Social Science graduates) and provide 12 months’ management training. They will be our future knowledge workers. In the 1980’s India recruited thousands of Art Degree holders for the three-year science degrees such as Bachelor of Information Technology and Bio Technology. (4) Attracting Foreign Direct Investment – When government starts the engine of growth, youth will become knowledgeable though fast track courses and apprenticeships. Identified economic sectors will produce highly marketable quality products and services. This success story will fly across all continents. In the mean time, government should remove the investment barriers such as profit exporting, registrations and lethargic immigration rules. Also, it is vital to establish a ‘Single-Window for Speedy Clearance’ for our investors. Then, more local and foreign investors, even multilateral donors, will open their moneybags. Economic success encourages investors’ confidence! (5) Managing HIV/Aids – Nearly 20% of our population is HIV positive. The impact of AIDS on the V-2030 is still not property studied. We have tabled the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan 2004-2009 to minimize the spread of HIV and mitigate the impact of AIDS. The time scale of the plan is 60 months and only 37 months are left. If NACOP can provide bi-annual progress reports of the MTP-111 to the NPC, they can restructure activities of the V-2030 Plan of Action to manage the impact of AIDS. Service Industries for Namibia Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) or Back Office Service is a growing economic sector in the world that provides services to clients across the world. These services are Writing Software Applications, Utility Bill Processing. Airline Booking, Medical-Record Handling, Data Processing, Data Warehousing, Call Centers and Research. Indian big BPOs like Wipro, Office Tiger, Infosis, provide back office service to the world’s big companies such as HSBC, American Express, British Airways, IBM. This sector employs thousands of graduates and covers 51% of the GDP. Furthermore, the Identification Products (bio-metric), Security Printing, Financial Services, Retail Industry, Private Medical Care and Leisure-Services are related to the service sector. Africa’s Back Office Let us leapfrog. Namibia should plan to become the Service-Hub of Africa. We can use our excellent infrastructure, state-of-the-art telecommunications network, efficient financial sector, easily trainable Namibian youth and political stability to establish a high-tech service sector. This sector will bring unimaginable wealth to our economy. Except South Africa and Egypt, we are ahead of other African countries. We have an easily manageable population and an abundance of unused natural resources. Namibia upholds and defends parliamentary democracy. Therefore, if we use our business acumen and best ethical management practices, this nation has enormous potential to become a success story for the third world. And, as President Pohamba said, “We have to do something now.” Hence, without wasting our time in never-ending discussions and debates, let us do something that our people can see.

Tax Alert: Fake rent receipts won't help you anymore BENGALURU: Wonderchef, a kitchen appliance and cookware brand promoted by celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor, has raised Rs 40 crore from French group Labruyere Eberle to fund a new manufacturing unit and expand into new categories. Confirming the investment, Wonderchef managing director Ravi Saxena said, "We are looking at opening our own factory by the end of the year, which will cater to 40% of our manufacturing, and expand our new category of large appliance and penetrate into new markets." He said the French group is looking at doubling its stake in the company to 8-10% with further investments. Founded in 2009 by Saxena and Kapoor, the company sells premium kitchen appliances, cookware and bakeware products. Vincent Labruyere, CEO of Labruyere Eberle, said, "We want to focus our investments towards growing companies in consumer goods industry in India and Wonderchef perfectly fits with this strategy." Over the last two years, the French group has invested in India in related businesses. It has picked up stake in the two wine companies Sula and Grover Zampa, and is a large franchisee of Pizza Hut and KFC restaurant outlets in India. The group is also a partner of Walmart rival, Carrefour, globally. In 2015, Wonderchef had received Rs 30 crore funding from Zurich-headquartered investment firm Capvent. According to industry experts, the branded kitchen appliance and cookware market is Rs 15,000 crore in India now and growing 12% year on year with players like Prestige and Hawkins having a large market share. Experts said it will take another 5-7 years for premium cookware sector to make a dent as the consumers are spending on modular kitchens but are still price conscious when it comes to buying expensive cookware.

TidewaterBiz Farm Fresh cuts Virginia Beach headquarters staff Tara BozickContact Reportertbozick@dailypress.com Privacy Policy Farm Fresh is reducing its Virginia Beach-based headquarters staff by 21 positions as part of its parent company's decision to shift merchandising to a Maryland office, a company spokesman confirmed. Farm Fresh owner SuperValu is basing its merchandising team for Farm Fresh, Shoppers and Shop 'n Save East at Shoppers in Bowie, Md., and plans to add merchandising staff there, Supervalu spokesman Jeff Swanson said. Twenty-three operations positions will remain in the Virginia Beach office on Seahawk Circle, Swanson said. The company is reducing its Farm Fresh operations and store support roles from 60 positions to 40 remaining jobs, he said. The change doesn't affect Farm Fresh stores, hourly store employees or day-to-day store management, Swanson said. Employees who are affected can apply for new or open positions or will qualify for severance, he said. Farm Fresh President Micky Nye will become regional vice president of operations for Farm Fresh, Shoppers and Shop 'n Save East, Swanson said. "Communicating news of this nature, in particular the reduction in some positions at Farm Fresh, is always difficult because of the impact to our employees," Swanson said in an email.

Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn't add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn't last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn't last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. The dollar dipped to 111.15 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0588 from $1.0646.

Despite sharp gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index amid optimism about business-favorable policies and infrastructure spending under the Trump administration, supermarket and wholesaler stocks veered in the opposite direction. “There has been some basic rotation into industries that are perceived to be beneficiaries of any potential stimulus spending or infrastructure investment by the new administration,” said Chuck Cerankosky, an analyst with Northcoast Research, Cleveland. “Secondly, I think we had a meaningful pickup in new store development and store expansions, and maybe it snuck up on the industry in a way that while there was some deflation out there, chains were fighting to get sales and customers to their new space, and it put pressure on margins and in turn on earnings.” Phoenix-based Sprouts Farmers Market was a notable exception to the downward trend in food retailing stocks, as the natural-and-organic specialist saw its share price spike 22.1% in the first three months of 2017, to $23.12, after a report that the company had held preliminary merger talks with Albertsons Cos. Neither company confirmed the report. Cerankosky said Sprouts may be able to maintain a higher valuation with a strong first-quarter earnings report next month. “If not, and the takeover speculation goes away, then the stock price pulls back,” he said. News also resuscitated the share price of Canadian retailer Empire Cos., parent of the Sobeys chain, whose share price had plummeted last year in wake of its struggles to improve the performance of the Safeway stores it acquired in Western Canada. In January, Sobeys tapped Canadian Tire veteran Michael Medline as president and CEO to spearhead a turnaround effort. Despite posting a weak fiscal third quarter in March, Empire’s stock maintained an upward trajectory through the first quarter and closed nearly 30% higher for the calendar year-to-date, at $20.32. Walmart, which in February posted its best comparable-store sales performance in four years and continued to make inroads in e-commerce, also saw gains in the first quarter, with its stock up 4.3%, closing at $72.08. The company posted fiscal fourth-quarter comps of 1.8%, versus expectations of 1.3%. Costco’s stock also saw gains in the first quarter, up 4.7% to $167.69, and the company continued to drive both dollar and tonnage gains with sharp pricing on deflated grocery items. “Sales decelerated middle two quarters of calendar 2016, then things began to pick up in the latter part of the calendar year, which I think gave investors a fair amount of relief that the warehouse club retail model continues to attract new customers and excitement and discretionary spending,” said Cerankosky.

Marvin Lacy, 71, who listed an address in the 400 block of East Church Street, Champaign, apparently made the claim in an attempt to drum up sympathetic customers for his failing business, police reports indicate. Lacy pleaded guilty Thursday before Judge Roger Webber to a single count of disorderly conduct, a felony, admitting that on May 13, 2016, he lied to an Urbana police officer about receiving a piece of U.S. mail that he said contained a cardboard sign with magazine letters glued to it with a racially motivated threat. Police learned through investigation that Lacy had actually persuaded an employee of his business, Lacy's Kansas City Style BBQ, 119 W. Main St., to mail the package for him. The employee told police he did not know what was in the package but, upon learning what it was, surmised that Lacy did it to drum up business. In exchange for Lacy's plea to the disorderly conduct, the state dismissed a separate case charging him with theft for switching clearance price tags with regular tags on meat at Wal-Mart on North Prospect Avenue on four occasions in February and March last year. As part of his sentence, he was ordered to repay the store $241.17. Court records show Lacy had prior convictions dating to 1992 for possession of a controlled substance, possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, obstructing justice, theft and making a false bomb report.

Innovative features in gift cards are also responsible in driving their sales, especially among young demographics. Moreover, rise in number of e-commerce platforms are also expected to boost global sales of gift cards. E-tailing giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and BestBuyCo. Inc. are observed among the world's leading providers of closed-loop gift cards. Considering that many people will explore such options, leading retail and banking organizations are offering their customers or members prepaid stored-value money cards, which are commonly called as gift cards.

Salone Monitor.com Online Reviews By Salone Monitor Search Main menu Skip to primary content Home Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Post navigation ← Previous Next → Amazon Prime Air: Drone Delivery Coming to a City Near You Posted on April 7, 2017 by admin When Amazon was launched, it began as a online bookstore. Outside the span of economic opportunity was the chance of enhancing the buyer experience by widening the customers’ choice. Creating the world’s first online bookstore was recognizing that, in 1995, you couldn’t walk into any bookstore in the world and be able to review or purchase the millions of books in circulation. Even from the beginning, Amazon was focused on creating the best customer experience with a deliberate focus on convenience and the vision of pioneering other technological advancements as the end of the 21st century approached. I believe it’s fair to say that Jeff Bezos and many others, including myself, believed the 21st century would include the convenience of flying cars, the convenience of getting your annual checkup without having to visit the doctor’s office, or being able to order a ride to anywhere in your city all at the press of a button. In 1995, all of these technological advances were just storylines of The Jetsons and other science fiction. Innovation has now made all but one of those storylines a reality – but I’m sure Elon Musk is working on getting us those flying cars. Amazon has pioneered a number of technological innovations through their now-extensive product lines. From its conception, the company was focused on making every book available for purchase online, but their focus has now evolved into “selling everything to everyone.” Over the last 16 years they have come closer and closer to that goal. Their product lines include: Amazon Fresh (currently in beta), where they sell fresh produce. Amazon Prime, which provides video and music content instantly to customers via their smart devices. Amazon Fashion, which launched last fall. Amazon Fulfillment. Amazon Marketplace, which provides customers with the opportunity to become entrepreneurs while utilizing the company’s logistics and distribution infrastructure. Amazon Kindle, which I believe was the predecessor of all other tablet devices. Amazon Web Services, which was a business born out of Amazon’s necessity to create a sustainable infrastructure for their online operations. They did it so efficiently that they had extra capacity to support the infrastructure of other companies, some of which could be considered their competitors. Their latest and possibly most ambitious endeavor, Amazon Prime Air, will revolutionize ecommerce as well as logistics and distribution. Amazon Prime Air extends the products that the company can sell. With a vision of leading innovation in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) delivery, Amazon Prime Air will enhance all of their other product lines by allowing their customers to get the goods they order much faster, effectively enhancing the Amazon customer experience. Skeptics (including myself) have wondered how big is the customer base that would use such a service and why would anyone ask for a drone to come anywhere near their house. Drones definitely get a bad rap, and rightfully so, but most of those concerns are out of place within the APA discussion as these UAVs will not have missiles or cameras attached to them. So the real question is, does this product line and technology have a customer base or serve any real need outside of its “coolness” factor? Well, let’s take a look at what the data says: Amazon has been working on UAV technology for some time but it wasn’t until November of last year that the Federal Aviation Association (FAA) announced a plan to create a standard for the commercial use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). It is obvious that Amazon has to go on a public relations blitz to inject the acronym “U.A.V.” into the public discourse in the place of “drone” in regards to APA as it will enhance the public’s perception once they launch the platform. And according to the FAA’s UAS commercial integration plan, they have plenty of time. Here is the FAA UAS integration timeline. It is broken into 3 phases: The first phase, Accommodation, extends into 2015. During this time, I believe Amazon will work to attain the Certificate of Airworthiness (COA). The second phase, Integration, extends into 2020, and in this phase I believe Amazon will mostly focus on beta testing in select markets. The third and final phase, Evolution, extends past 2021; Amazon would have not only developed a UAV ready to interact with the public but also a UAS that incorporates the various aspects of storage, fulfillment and distribution. At this point, they can expect that there will be many competitors who would also utilize UAVs as a form of logistics such as Fedex, UPS, other online retailers, and big box stores such as Walmart and Target. So Amazon’s main focus at this point should be creating a UAV/UAS that will be the safest and most reliable, and not only meet FAA standards but exceed them with the goal of Amazon Prime Air becoming synonymous with UAV delivery. The FAA has made it clear that it is not a matter of if but when, and if Amazon follows through with its plan, it could pioneer a completely new form of delivery. Google Trends The day after Amazon Prime Air was announced on the show 60 Minutes happened to be the largest consumer holiday of the year, “Cyber Monday.” It was also the first time that Cyber Monday surpassed Black Friday in sales. Utilizing the Google Trends tool I was able to gauge consumer interest. Google Trends is a research tool that allows users to gain insight on Google search data by comparing search phrases. In this graph “Cyber Monday” was at 100pts with “Amazon Prime Air” and “Amazon drone” representing 75 and 74 points respectively. So for every 4 people that searched for Cyber Monday deals, 3 searched for Amazon Prime Air. I believe it is fair to say that for every 4 people who made a purchase on Cyber Monday, 3 would have been a customer of Amazon Prime Air! The data shows that there is some consumer interest, but whether this is a true reflection of real opportunity is to be confirmed. Regardless, a showing of 3 out of 4 consumers definitely leans towards further investigation. The opportunity and economics of this new business line must be examined. Amazon Prime Air’s current prototype has a max payload of 5 lbs or less, which qualifies 86% of their shipments as eligible for Amazon Prime Air. According to resources, their free shipping policy on select orders cost the company about $6 billion just last year and with FedEx and UPS (their shipping partners) increasing the rate by 4.5% they can anticipate that this cost will go up and continue to increase over time. The data available on the Amazon Prime Air R&D budget is not publicly available so I had to get creative and also make a few assumptions. I deduced the opportunity cost by multiplying 86% of their daily shipping count which at its peak represents 13.5MM by the lowest ‘one-day shipping’ rate which is the closest service to Amazon Prime Air and then the highest ‘one day shipping rate’ and captured an amount totaling $52-103 billion. I then took this a step further, considering Amazon’s customer-centric philosophy and their current business model of low margins. Even at a 2% margin they would still net $1-2 billion dollars. The opportunity is large enough that Amazon will either be a huge customer of UAV delivery or a huge provider of UAV delivery. So far I’ve covered the vision, strategy, and the why (albeit briefly), and now for the execution of the most innovative product of the 21st century – so innovative that the government is still trying to determine the regulations. Amazon Prime Air is the name of Amazon’s unmanned aircraft system. The system will be developed by framing every possible user story with the consideration of their customers, the public, their employees at the fulfillment centers, the deployment, the UAV hub and most importantly, the unmanned aircraft vehicle. At their current capacity of 96 fulfillment centers around the world, they do not meet the 10-mile distance requirement for the UAV prototypes, so as part of their strategy they would need to continue the development of fulfillment centers as part of the unmanned aircraft system. UAV MVP Amazon’s primary focus should be creating a safe UAV, so discussing and developing user stories with the engineering team will be prioritized by safety, security, and reliability. They should also focus on defining and exploring specs utilizing current FAA requirements such as sense and avoid, control and communications and the others as detailed. The current roadmap details the definition and exploration to meet FAA requirements within the next two months, exploring SAA technologies such as electro-optic, infrared, and radar, with the second phase focusing on building and testing of the UAV through the rest of the year. The last phase, focusing on developing the rest of the Amazon Prime Air system, will extend into 2015 calendar year. Launching Amazon Prime Air will not be an easy task, as can be expected for such an ambitious endeavor, but I believe even with this brief analysis of the project, Amazon could lead in the innovation of UAV delivery.

ASSOCIATED PRESS THE BLADE Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print THE BLADE Enlarge | Buy This Image NEW YORK — U.S. stocks never got going today after a slightly disappointing jobs report and word of U.S. missile strikes against Syria. Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn’t add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn’t last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. RELATED: Searchable stock index Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market did not have an overwhelming reaction to the jobs report or missile strikes because neither really altered investors’ views of the U.S. economy. “It was not a bad (jobs) report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports,” he said. Wren said the economy probably won’t grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. The Standard & Poor’s 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. While stocks didn’t move much overall, there were a few clear trends. Investors mostly avoided industries whose performance is closely linked to the state of the economy. The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, which was weaker than the last few months and about half as many as analysts had predicted. One-time factors including snowstorms may have temporarily slowed hiring. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 2007, as more people found work. Over the last three months hiring has remained around the same monthly pace as in 2016. Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The VIX, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” started rising late Thursday as the U.S. government shifted its policy on Syria. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn’t last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. Twenty-First Century Fox declined for the fifth day in a row as advertisers continued to pull their ads from “The O’Reilly Factor.” Less than a week ago, the New York Times reported that Fox News and Bill O’Reilly, the network’s most popular prime-time host, have paid $13 million to five women to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. Kantar Media says the show brought in more than $100 million in advertising revenue in 2016. The stock lost 5 cents to $31.07 and fell 4.1 percent this week. Wells Fargo dipped after an influential firm that advises big shareholders says most of its board of directors should be removed. Institutional Shareholder Services said the board isn’t doing enough to oversee the bank’s sales practices. A second firm also recommended that a large portion of the board be replaced at the Wells Fargo shareholder meeting later this month. Wells Fargo recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after its employees opened more than 2 million accounts without customers’ permission. CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired after the scandal came to light and thousands of employees were fired. Today Wells Fargo stock fell 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.84. Gold finished up $4 at $1,257.30. Silver lost 10 cents to $18.15 an ounce. Copper declined 1 cent to $2.65 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 2 cents to $1.75 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Natural gas slid 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar dipped to 111.15 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0588 from $1.0646. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany’s DAX hardly budged. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was little changed.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Payless ShoeSource closures paint ominous picture for traditional retail Friday Apr 7, 2017 at 4:07 PM Apr 7, 2017 at 4:07 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz VICTORVILLE — The e-commerce slasher strikes again, this time closing the doors of hundreds of Payless ShoeSource stores across the nation. With some 4,000 locations in 30 countries, the struggling shoe chain reported the company will shutter 378 stores as a result of filing for bankruptcy. Three Payless stores in the Victor Valley dodged the closure bullet, but nearly 50 stores in California will close including, four stores in San Bernardino County — one each in Upland and San Bernardino, and two in Palmdale. Local Payless shoe stores are located at The Mall of Victor Valley, in the Victor Valley Town Center, both in Victorville, and in the Jess Ranch Marketplace in Apple Valley. News of Payless’ bankruptcy comes during a tumultuous time in the retail industry as big and middle box stores attempt to adapt to more online sales as they shift away from brick and mortar shops, financial experts say. Successful e-commerce platforms reduce the need for physical store space and store numbers, which forces retailers to reassess their store versus online strategies. Shopper expectations have also changed as they want a seamless, blended experience across both online and physical stores. This drives stores to operate as e-commerce fulfillment or distribution centers, a central pillar for e-commerce, The Business Journals reported. The City of Hesperia recently announced the expected opening of Famous Footwear, which will be located in a newly constructed building near the Super Target off Main Street. Caleres, who operates the Famous Footwear brand, pointed to ongoing pressures in the retail environment, with Caleres Chairman, President and CEO Diane Sullivan saying the firm is cautious about the year ahead. “Despite a promotional and challenging retail environment in the fourth quarter, we maintained our consistent approach of managing the areas under our control while continuing to rapidly respond to changing consumer shopping behaviors,” Sullivan said in a release. Wal-mart announced last year it would close over 15 stores in the U.S and nearly 120 stores overseas. The retailer will also end its Wal-Mart Express small-store format. Other stores hit hard by the e-commerce wave include Sears, Macy’s and J. C. Penney, Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

(Amanda Cowan/The Columbian) By Adam Littman, Columbian Staff Writer Published: April 7, 2017, 3:37 PM A   A If You Go • When: 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday. • Where: Klineline Pond at Salmon Creek Park, 1112 N.E. 117th St., Vancouver. • What: The annual Klineline Kids Fishing Derby, which is open to kids ages 5-14, costs $5, which gets kids a fishing rod and T-shirt. The preregistration spots are sold out, but there will be about 50 walk-up spots every hour. For more information, visit www.klineline-kf.org. Heavy winds whipped around a rainy Clark County on Friday morning, but at least the fish were biting. Friday was the first day of the annual Klineline Kids Fishing Derby, held at Klineline Pond in Salmon Creek Park. The weather didn’t deter the crowd. More than 500 fishers signed up for the first day, and Allen Jaffe, retiring president of the Klineline Kids Fishing Nonprofit, said he expected more than 700 on Friday, including walk-ups. “We come every year,” said Alexander Nihipali, 5, of Vancouver. “I wanted to catch a big fish. This is the biggest one I ever caught.” Alexander and his mom couldn’t walk more than a few feet without someone coming over to admire the 23-inch, 6-pound trout he caught earlier on Friday. It took about five minutes for Alexander to reel in the trout that was almost as long as one of his legs. His mother, Leilani Nihipali, said he lost a few fish before reeling in the large trout. She was excited for her son, and excited to take the fish home. “We usually give them back, but I think we’re going to keep this one,” she said. At the derby, which has been around for 30-plus years, fishers get their fish measured, weighed and cleaned by volunteers. Then they can take them home or donate them. Jaffe said all the donated fish go to Share, and the event usually donates around 500 pounds of cleaned fish to the nonprofit. The event costs about $200,000 to put on, Jaffe said, adding that the money comes from donations and grants. Clark Public Utilities donated the 14,000 fish put into Klineline Pond for the event. The Klineline Kids Fishing Nonprofit buys all the rods and reels for the event. Earlier this week, volunteers put together 3,600 rods and reels for the event. With the $5 registration fee, kids get a fishing rod and T-shirt. There are also prizes every hour for each group of fishers. The fisher who hauls in the biggest catch gets a trophy and a $40 gift certificate to Wal-Mart. Second place gets a trophy and a scooter and third place earns a trophy and tackle box. The fisher who brings in the smallest fish each hour gets a tackle box and coupon for an extra large pizza. “We give them the extra large pizza because their fish is too small to feed a family,” Jaffe said. Alexander won the first-place finish during the 9 a.m. fishing round on Friday, and second place went to Jayden Lynn Wolford, 3, of Vancouver, who caught a 3-pound rainbow trout with some help from her father. The two regularly go fishing. Jayden had a fun Friday, and her two favorite parts were “building a boat and fishing with daddy,” she said with the remnants of an ice cream sandwich smeared around her mouth. Along with fishing, local businesses and organizations have booths during the derby. Home Depot was in attendance on Friday, and at that booth, kids could assemble wooden sailboats. Due to the heavy wind, some vendors left a little early, or took down their tents. Jaffe said the event wouldn’t stop due to weather unless there was lightning. He is hoping for calmer weather Saturday, when he expects more than 3,000 kids to attend the derby. It runs from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. with new fishing rounds starting every hour. Each hour has 300 slots to fish, and every session is fully booked. There is also room for 50 walk-ups each hour. “We’re growing,” he said. “This is the first year we’ve sold out the 2 and 3 p.m. sessions.” One thing that helped the event grow was allowing online sign-ups, which started three years ago, Jaffe said. He’d like to see the first day of the event, which is reserved for special needs participants, grow even more in the future. Last year, the special needs day brought in about 600 fishers. Jaffe said the event doesn’t turn any kid away. “The kids who can’t afford it, we do offer scholarships,” he said. “We don’t want to turn any kid down. Every kid is important.” The event is run by volunteers, who do everything from sign kids up to help them catch and clean the fish. Friday had about 250 volunteers and Jaffe expects 350 to 400 volunteers Saturday. Endeavour Elementary School second-grader Walter Ferrante, 7, had some help from one of the volunteers while fishing on Friday. He caught two fish. “It was hard to reel them in. They were heavy,” Walter said, adding he’s been to the event a few times. “This is the first time I’ve caught fish here.”     Adam Littman Columbian Staff Writer  360-735-4518  @@a_littman  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

An autoimmune disorder that affects the hair follicles, it can cause once flowing locks to fall out in small round patches about the size of a quarter. In some cases, patients lose much larger swaths of hair. And that’s exactly what happened to 7-year-old Gianessa Wride from Utah. “On January 1st, Gianessa had taken a shower,” her mother, Daniella Wride, explains. “After her shower, I was helping her brush her hair. Her hair was down to the middle of her back. I noticed that a lot of hair was coming out in the hairbrush and so I began looking around her head. I found a bald patch on the back of her head the size of a quarter. I also noticed that around her temples it was beginning to thin. We let her go to bed without telling her what was going on. I didn’t want to scare her. My husband and I called her pediatrician the next day and made her an appointment.” Left column: January 10 Middle column: January 13 Right column: the cutest 7 year old, fashionista, artist, shopkins loving girl. This is hard, but she is the strong one. #alopecia #alopeciaareata #baldisbeautiful #brave #nohairdontcare #youthinkyourehavingabadhairday A post shared by Daniella Wride (@daniellawride) on Jan 15, 2017 at 3:16am PST The pediatrician was able to give Gianessa a tentative diagnosis, but recommended that she see a dermatologist to be 100 percent sure. It took nearly a month for the Wrides to get an apointment with one. In the meantime, all of Gianessa’s hair fell out. “It took a total of 20 days,” Wride tells CBS News. “I tried to explain it to her on a 7-year-old level, but tell her the exact truth. You can’t beat around the bush with kids. And instilling false hope, I think, it’s kind of cruel in its own way. So we just let her know that her hair was falling out and it probably wasn’t going to grow back. And we also tried to let her know that she’s still herself. She just doesn’t have any hair. She can still emphasize her personality through fashion choices. She can still do art and dance and do karate.” Gianessa and her two younger brothers at the beach. Courtesy Daniella Wride A few months later, the Wrides encountered an unexpected hurdle: Gianessa’s school was having a “crazy hair day.” How could the little girl possibly participate now that she had lost all her hair? “I was really nervous when I found out that it was coming up,” recalls Wride. “But I didn’t want her to feel like an outcast or that she wasn’t like the other kids, so I wanted to come up with something fun for her. I went to the Walmart craft section trying to see what I could find and put together for her. I came across these scrapbook sticker jewels. They just fit her personality. She’s so vibrant and full of life and she loves everything sparkly.” It's crazy "head" day today! I must say she looks absolutely stunning! #alopecia #alopeciaareata #crazyhairday #baldisbeautiful #gorgeous #brave #firstgrade #youthinkyourehavingabadhairday A post shared by Daniella Wride (@daniellawride) on Mar 28, 2017 at 8:00am PDT Needless to say, the internet went wild for Gianessa’s new look — Instagram users seemingly coming out of the woodwork to comment on the little girl’s strength, beauty and resilience. “You look FANTASTIC SWEETHEART!!! May the sun always be shining in your corner of the world,” wrote one user. “Such an inspiration to so many,” chimed in another. “Continue to shine bright as the stars... you are beautiful and continue to inspire.”  “I never in my wildest dreams expected for such a little girl to have such a positive influence on the world today,” Wride tells CBS News of the unexpected worldwide reaction. “Truly I cannot even begin to tell you how many times tears have come to my eyes just knowing that so many people are finding strength and courage in Gianessa’s story. I hope it continues and can provide light and love to all those that see it.” © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

I am on the fence between the Husky and the Milwauke 85 8798 that you reviewed and the Husky 57 8798 . Credit Center - Home Depot Credit The holiday season is officially here, with Home Depot having put up many of their holiday season tool deals on display. Some are clearly absent, such as a deal involving the new Dewalt Tough System wheeled tool box  and value-priced small tool box. Benny's Home Center - Quality & Savings From Construction It 8767 s hard to judge HDX based on one purchase. Their quality ranges from excellent (and not just 8766 for the price 8767 excellent) to unusable junk. It 8767 s always a crapshoot. It changes, too. A specific tool which was good at one purchase may have changed manufacturer and become junk at a second purchase, and vice versa. But that 8767 s why they are cheap. Home Depot Careers I 8767 m not sure what grade MDF is being used but the lower grade stuff swells and fails if not protected when subject to lots of moisture. I suspect that an apartment balcony qualifies as a spot that may at times have lots of moisture. Here are the specific differences. Both kits are entirely 68V brushless tools and both include these two tools: R8658 7-6/9 8798 Circular Saw R86587 8-Speed IMPACT Driver I don 8767 t have much room for dedicated shop space. This looks like it could really be useful in that department. Hopefully some user reviews will start to show up. I don 8767 t mind loaning those out and don 8767 t mind all that much (but yes it does irk me) if I lose one or leave it at a buddy 8767 s place. I have a Sidekick and a Wingman from several years ago. I also bought the Rev and several Skeletools last year. All of them at markdown prices after Christmas. I 8767 ve heard there is aa new SOG Micro Tool at Walmart. Supposedly . $75. I will pick up another Sidekick or two if they all make it through Christmas to the inevitable markdowns. As Stuart notes, there are specialized fasteners that work pretty well with it but regular screws into the face may not hold and screwing into the edge will cause it to fail. When we used it fastening was with glue and dowels (more recently dominos) not screws. Deals with deep discounts on mid/high end tools. The are harder for us out here to find. The HD/Lowes stuff we can usually find on our own. «The home depot center directions» in pictures. More images «The home depot center directions». Contact | RSS feed | sitemap.xml | News

The video vignettes are the work of the the veterans empowerment organization Got Your 6. Abalos, who lives in Fresno, now works as a dentist serving low-income patients in Visalia through the nonprofit Family Healthcare Network. Many of her patients are migrant farmworkers. Matthew Sarim, left, with school resource officer Katrina Lloyd and friend Robert Gonzalez. Matthew earned a new bike, but he gave it to Robert, who did not have one. Fresno Unified School District i A refugee from Vietnam, she was featured in The Bee last year, where she told about her decision to join the Army after 9/11, despite being a student at the University of California, Berkeley. She served in Germany for four years and was deployed to Afghanistan for a year, where she worked as a counter-intelligence agent. When she left the Army, she enrolled in dental school at UCLA, where she co-founded Operation Bruin Smiles, the first university dental subsidy program in the U.S. that provides free dental care to college veterans and former foster youth.   Thumbs up to Woodlake native Amanda Rentería, 42, for being named chief of operations for state Attorney General Xavier Becerra. She is in charge of about 1,000 state Department of Justice employees who provide support to 3,500 attorneys. The position not only puts Rentería on Becerra’s executive team, but gives the San Joaquín Valley a bigger profile in Sacramento. Rentería told Juan Esparza Loera of Vida en el Valle that she sees her task today as helping to battle President Donald J. Trump’s executive orders and actions that could hurt California residents. Thumbs down to walkers and drivers who carelessly use their phones while on the road. U.S. pedestrian deaths are projected to increase by 11 percent in 2016, the Governors Highway Safety Association warned last week. It’s the second consecutive year of the largest annual jump in the death toll since records have been kept. The safety association says that more cars are on the road due to lower gas prices and that more people are walking. But it also says another factor may be that too many drivers and pedestrians are distracted by their smart phones. Thumbs up to Sequoia Middle School student Matthew Sarim for his big-hearted gift to classmate Robert Gonzalez. Matthew won a mountain bike through a school contest because of his good grades, attendance and behavior. He has happy to win it but Matthew had no intention of keeping the bike. Instead, he gave it to Robert. Matthew already had a bike, he explained to the staff, but Robert did not. Although Matthew’s request would seem to violate the terms of the contest, which sought to recognize meritorious students, the staff allowed it. Good, sensible move by the adults for keeping their priorities straight. Another 26-inch mountain bike was given out during the contest. Walmart donated both bikes. Thumbs up to the Fresno catering company The Painted Table for winning an award for a mystery dinner at the Forestiere Underground Gardens. The catering business based in the Tower District won the Catie Award for the 2017 signature caterer for best event during the 25th Annual Catersource Convention in New Orleans. The dinner was part of The Painted Table’s supper club that takes diners to a mystery location that’s not revealed until the last minute. This dinner was literally underground, an authentic Sicilian menu with family-style seating, and mandolin music. For more information on how to participate in the dinner series, keep tabs on Fresno’s Underground Supper Series Facebook page or email info@fresnoundergroundsuppers.com. Thumbs up to Malee Srisaard, Ba Xiong and their six children, ages 18 months to 19 years, for getting the keys to their new home April 1 from Habitat for Humanity Fresno County. After living four years cramped up in a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment, they finally are able to leave a high-crime area and move into 1,300 square feet, four bedrooms, two baths and a yard. The family was selected based on need and the ability to purchase the home through a zero-interest loan. The down payment is met by contributing 500 hours of sweat equity. This is the 139th Habitat for Humanity Fresno County home built since 1985. The homes are made possible through donors and volunteers.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Dow closes down 7 points Friday Apr 7, 2017 at 1:48 PM Apr 7, 2017 at 4:44 PM The Associated Press NEW YORK — U.S. stocks never got going Friday after a slightly disappointing jobs report and word of U.S. missile strikes against Syria. Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn't add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn't last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market did not have an overwhelming reaction to the jobs report or missile strikes because neither really altered investors' views of the U.S. economy. "It was not a bad (jobs) report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports," he said. Wren said the economy probably won't grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. While stocks didn't move much overall, there were a few clear trends. Investors mostly avoided industries whose performance is closely linked to the state of the economy. The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, which was weaker than the last few months and about half as many as analysts had predicted. One-time factors including snowstorms may have temporarily slowed hiring. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 2007, as more people found work. Over the last three months hiring has remained around the same monthly pace as in 2016. Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The VIX, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," started rising late Thursday as the U.S. government shifted its policy on Syria. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn't last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. Twenty-First Century Fox declined for the fifth day in a row as advertisers continued to pull their ads from "The O'Reilly Factor." Less than a week ago, the New York Times reported that Fox News and Bill O'Reilly, the network's most popular prime-time host, have paid $13 million to five women to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. Kantar Media says the show brought in more than $100 million in advertising revenue in 2016. The stock lost 5 cents to $31.07 and fell 4.1 percent this week. Wells Fargo dipped after an influential firm that advises big shareholders says most of its board of directors should be removed. Institutional Shareholder Services said the board isn't doing enough to oversee the bank's sales practices. A second firm also recommended that a large portion of the board be replaced at the Wells Fargo shareholder meeting later this month. Wells Fargo recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after its employees opened more than 2 million accounts without customers' permission. CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired after the scandal came to light and thousands of employees were fired. On Friday Wells Fargo stock fell 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.84. Gold finished up $4 at $1,257.30. Silver lost 10 cents to $18.15 an ounce. Copper declined 1 cent to $2.65 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 2 cents to $1.75 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Natural gas slid 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar dipped to 111.15 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0588 from $1.0646. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany's DAX hardly budged. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed.

Chatham-Kent police said the man was located inside the detached garage by the homeowner around 7:40 a.m. on Thursday. Police said the homeowner noticed the door of the garage was damaged and when she entered she found the man asleep on a couch. The man awoke as the homeowner took a picture of him on her cellphone. She then ordered him to leave, police said. Afterwards, the homeowner discovered the man had consumed approximately $25 worth of food and drank six beers. Police were called and were provided the picture the homeowner took. The man was located a short distance away around 8 a.m. and a police check revealed he had outstanding warrants from the Niagara Region. The accused was charged with break and enter and theft under $5,000. He was taken to police headquarters where he was held for a bail hearing, police said.   Petty theft leads to charges Committing a petty crime led Chatham-Kent police to a 33-year-old Chatham man wanted on an outstanding warrant for not attending court. Police said the accused was arrested last June and charged with having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding the legal limit. A warrant was issued for his arrested when he didn't show up for court last September, police added. On Thursday around 3 p.m., the man was in the Sears store in Chatham when he was spotted by store security opening the package of an item, valued at $16.999, and placing it into a personal bag he was carrying, police said. The accused walked out of the store without playing for the item and security watched him get into a cab, then called the police. Through investigation, an officer learned where the accused lived and went to the address and arrested him on the warrant for failing to attend court. Police the man is also charged with theft under $5,000 and possession of property obtained by crime under $5,000. The accused was released with an April 26 court date. Caught on video A 27-year-old Wallaceburg man was arrested after he was recorded on a video surveillance camera breaking into vehicles in a driveway. Chatham-Kent police said the accused was sentenced to two years of probation in 2016 that requires him to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. Last month, the man went to a property in a Wallaceburg subdivision where he doesn't live and began rummaging through a vehicle parked in a driveway, taking a $50 Walmart gift card. The accused also stole some money from a second vehicle in the same drive way, police said. Due to the number of thefts that had been occurring in that subdivision, a video surveillance camera had been installed, which captured the entire incident. Police were called and the responding officer was able to identify the accused, who is well known to police. A warrant was issued for his arrest, because he couldn't be located at the time, police said. The man was arrested after he was spotted in Chatham on Thursday around 3:30 p.m. The accused was charged with two counts of theft under $5,000 and failing to comply and later released with an April 12 court date, police said. Break and enter Chatham-Kent police are investigating a break and enter at a Tilbury residence on Thursday. Police said some time between 3-9:30 p.m. the bay door of a large garage-type structure on Glenwood Drive was entered. Numerous items were stolen valued at approximately $8,000, police said. Anyone with information about this crime is asked to contact Const. Larry Johnson at larryj@chatham-kent.ca or at 519-436-6600 ext. 87130. Anonymous calls can also be made to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8744)     Pair killed in house fire identified   Lambton OPP have released the names of two people that died in a January house fire in Dawn-Euphemia Township.

Huffstutter | April 7, 2017 Email This Print Newsletters Tweet Article Comments ABC Broadcasting has lost a last-ditch bid before South Dakota’s highest court to avoid a trial in a beef producer’s $5.7 billion defamation case over reports about a product that critics call “pink slime.” The order signed on April 3 by state Supreme Court Chief Justice David Gilbertson denied ABC’s petition to appeal a recent ruling letting plaintiff Beef Products Inc (BPI) take its case to a jury. In February, Judge Cheryle Gering of the Union County Circuit Court in Elk Point, South Dakota, said ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co, and its reporter Jim Avila must defend against claims that they damaged BPI by referring in a series of reports to BPI’s “lean finely textured beef” product as “pink slime.” Gering did not rule on the case’s merits, nor did the Supreme Court. ABC declined to comment while BPI said in a statement it looked forward to holding the defendants accountable. The case is scheduled to go to trial on June 5 and could last eight weeks. Lean, finely textured beef is made from beef chunks, including trimmings and exposed to tiny bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill bacteria. At the time of the ABC News broadcasts, few Americans realized the product was a mainstay of fast-food burgers, school lunch tacos and homemade meatloaf. BPI said ABC’s reports in March and April 2012 implied that the South Dakota-based company’s product was not safe, not nutritious and not even meat. The network has called BPI’s lawsuit an attempt to chill media coverage of the industry and inhibit free speech. BPI has claimed up to $1.9 billion of damages, which could be tripled to $5.7 billion under South Dakota’s Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has called BPI’s product safe. But some retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, stopped selling ground beef containing it after the ABC reports. Several other defendants were previously dismissed from the case, including a former Agriculture Department microbiologist said to have coined the term “pink slime” in a 2002 email. The case is Beef Products Inc et al v. American Broadcasting Cos et al, First Judicial Circuit Court of South Dakota, Union County, No. 12-292. Reporting by P.J.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) FILE - In this Oct. 2, 2014 file photo, people pass a Wall Street subway stop, in New York's Financial District. Most world stock indexes fell Friday, April 7, 2017, while oil prices rose after the U.S. fired missiles at Syria during President Donald Trump's first meeting with China's president, leaving investors on edge. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • After wavering up and down all day, U.S. stock indexes wound up pretty much where they started. U.S. missile strikes in Syria and news Friday of a slowdown in hiring last month left investors with little interest in making big moves in the market, with a handful of exceptions. Defense contractors traded higher after the strikes. Raytheon climbed 1.5 percent and Lockheed Martin gained 1.2 percent. Investors also bid up some high-dividend stocks like phone companies as they sought out relatively safe venues to park money. Energy companies and banks fell. At 2 p.m. Mountain time, the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 6 points to 20,656. The Nasdaq composite slipped 1 point to 5,877. HIRING: The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, about half as many as analysts had predicted. Hiring dropped off somewhat after a few months of strong job growth that was linked to warm weather that boosted hiring in construction. The monthly job gains in January and February were revised a bit lower, which meant that hiring over the last three months continued at about the same pace as 2016. The unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5 percent. AIRSTRIKES: Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The U.S. government started shifting its policy on Syria before the close of trading Wednesday, which pushed the VIX, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," higher. The increased geopolitical uncertainty gave something of a boost to defense contractor stocks. Raytheon added $2.10, or 1.4 percent, to $152.85 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.31, or 1.2 percent, to $270.42. L3 Technologies climbed $2.86, or 1.8 percent, to $165.76. THE QUOTE: Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market isn't having a strong reaction to the events of the last 24 hours because they won't really alter investors' views of the U.S. economy. "It was not a bad report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports," he said of the jobs report. He said the economy probably won't grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive and keeps inflation at bay. SEEKING SAFETY: The price of gold jumped 1.2 percent to $1,268.10 an ounce, its highest price since right after the presidential election in November. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent from 2.34 percent. Lower bond yields mean lower interest rates and small profits on lending, and that hurt bank stocks. Capital One fell 71 cents to $83.52 and Citigroup lost 44 cents to $59.45. Phone companies, utilities, real estate investment trusts and household goods makers all traded higher. Wal-Mart gained $1.18, or 1.7 percent, to $72.61 and Sempra Energy rose $1.01 to $110.76. ENERGY: The military strikes in the Middle East, which produces a large chunk of the world's oil, sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 50 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.20 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 38 cents to $55.26 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.77 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0614 from $1.0646. OVERSEAS: In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany's DAX hardly budged. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES College football: Virginia admits 32 recruiting violations under Bronco Mendenhall Many may be called, but few women are chosen to speak at Mormon General Conference Utah Jazz: Gordon Hayward scores career-high 39 points as Jazz beat Minnesota Timberwolves 120-113 | Leave it to beaver?

Even the people who make decisions about which stocks to buy and sell are being replaced by computer programs, by bots. To understand what goes on inside a stock-picking bot, we at Planet Money built our own. Bots are cheaper than stock-picking humans. They're less emotional and more disciplined. They can process more information at once. They are doing things like scanning social media for consumer trends and counting the number of cars parked in Wal-Mart parking lots, then using that to trade. Our bot is doing something seemingly simple: It looks at President Trump's Twitter feed, and when he tweets about a company, it trades stocks, with real money. Because the official Twitter handle of the president of the United States is @POTUS, we named our bot @BOTUS, bot of the United States. There's $1,000 on the line invested by the staff members of the Planet Money podcast from their personal funds. Follow along, and track whether we're making money or losing it. Music: "Rapture" and "Now Son." Find us: Twitter/ Facebook. Subscribe to our show on iTunes or PocketCast. See what BOTUS has been up to lately: Tweets by BOTUS The Fine Print: This is for real. All decisions on buying and selling stocks are made automatically by BOTUS, a computer program. BOTUS makes trades by analyzing tweets from @realDonaldTrump to recognize when he mentions a publicly traded company. BOTUS also measures the sentiment using VADER Sentiment Analysis. If BOTUS decides a tweet is positive, it will buy the stock mentioned in the tweet; if BOTUS decides the tweet is negative, it will sell the stock short. BOTUS will hold the position for 30 minutes, then get out. BOTUS was built with Tradeworx and trades through the Interactive Brokers platform.

Getty Images/moodboard RF. i By Bill Estep bestep@herald-leader.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Two people have been charged with stealing debit cards from vehicles while owners were away in the Daniel Boone National Forest. Dustin Cantrell and Josie P. Moore face up to 30 years in prison on the most serious charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. The two also are charged with aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to steal property on federal land, and aiding and abetting each other in the thefts. The two allegedly broke into two vehicles at parking areas in the forest in Menifee County and three in Rowan County in June 2016.

By Cedar Pasori From SHOT: 101 Survivors of Gun Violence in America.   Image by Kathy Shorr In 2015 alone, the national homicide rate in the United States increased by 11 percent, with gun use contributing to 80 percent of deaths. At a moment when the country is becoming more murderous than any time since the early ‘70s, people like photographer Kathy Shorr are voicing an urgent need for gun law reform, using the power of photojournalism to chronicle survivors of gun violence. Shorr, who is based in New York City, embarked on a two-year, self-funded mission to photograph 100 of these people and compile the images in book form. With a determined focus, she documented a diverse range of subjects across the U.S. — aged 8 to 80 years old, all with various occupations and positions on gun rights (a third grader, a community activist, a small business owner, and a police officer, are among them). Candid statements from survivors lend context and depth to each image, most of which were taken where the shooting occurred. Here, in her own words, Shorr explains her true-to-life photo series, SHOT: 101 Survivors of Gun Violence in America, out now via Powerhouse Books. What drew you to photography? I went to the School of Visual Arts in New York City. I always liked street photography and taking portraits. One time I drove a limousine and photographed the people in the car over a period of nine months. About 10 years ago, I did a project where I went to a homeless shelter in Brooklyn every Saturday and photographed the families there, with their permission of course. The next week, I would come back and give everyone an 8x10 picture of their family. Later we invited the greater community to a big exhibition in the shelter’s recreation room with donated frames. Doing that project made me start thinking about photography as something that could change lives. You’ve said that the impetus for this project was a violent situation at your house, involving a gun. What happened? A number of years ago I was robbed; today they call it a home invasion. Armed intruders came into my house and pointed a gun at me and my daughter, who had just started to walk. That feeling of helplessness — someone else controlling your destiny — is something you never want to experience again. You feel very lucky if you can walk away from it physically unharmed. It's probably the most awful feeling a human being can have, when someone else is in charge of your fate. It's become part of my psyche now. At the time, I was also teaching photography and art classes at an inner city school in New York. There were kids who would come in with memorial cards around their necks, almost making folk heroes of people who had been killed in their neighborhoods, or their family, or friends. I would see this and think about the people who get shot and survive. Does anybody ever think about them?   Image by Kathy Shorr   Image by Kathy Shorr Were there any specific events or things that happened nationally or globally that inspired the timing of this project? I felt that the country had become very polarized. Gun issues are clearly not black-and-white; there are many shades of grey. I thought that if I could do a project where the abstraction of gun violence was taken away — so it could become something human with faces — that people would be able to confront this issue more easily. I wanted it to be extremely geographically and ethnically diverse, because gun violence affects everyone of all ages. Getting a Native American involved was one of the hardest parts of the project. It took me two years, but I was persistent. I made sure to include gun owners, as well. ADVERTISEMENT How were you able to find gun victims across the U.S. ages 8 to 80? There were many different ways of getting in touch with people. I spent many days on the computer doing research. There was a lot of old-fashioned letter-writing — seeing a story about an incident that happened in a certain area, calling a reporter, looking in the white pages for someone's name, and getting help from lawyers, doctors, and non-profits who work with domestic violence survivors. Since I funded this project with my own money, I had to be conscious of being efficient with my travel. If I was going to L.A., I would try to focus on that area and find at least two other people. The first person I photographed was a man in Brooklyn. I was watching a local TV show, and it showed someone who had been shot six weeks prior. He had a memorable Indonesian last name, so I Googled him and sent an email. He said he would be part of the project. I told him I was also interested in photographing him in the location, which he agreed to. When I met him, he told me he had taken a Xanax to be calm, because it had been less than two months since it happened. I also asked to photograph his scar, to show the real damage from those who want to share it. A few people later on did not want to, but most people did want to, actually. He felt that it was very cathartic, that he had taken back the space. He felt very empowered by it. After that, I felt like I could continue the project. Were any of these survivors hesitant to be photographed where they were originally shot? There are 101 different people total, so there were a range of circumstances. If someone was shot in their home, a lot of times they still live in their home. Or they were shot in their car, which they still drive. Though their lives were interrupted, they go back to them, often because they have to. For the most part, people who went back to a place they had avoided felt really good about going back, because it was theirs now, and they moved past it. It's the idea of confronting the beast, and saying, “No, I need to do this for me." In one case, I was going to Miami to photograph a few people there. One woman emailed me the night before and said, "I can't do it. I went back today, and I freaked out." Her boyfriend shot her in the parking lot of their apartment house, and she hadn't gone back yet. Going back triggered a response. I told her I didn't want to encourage her to do something she wasn't comfortable with, so the next year I went back to Miami again, so I sent her an email and said, "Do you think you might want to try to go there this time?" She said that she wanted to, and she did. She was fine, and she felt really good about doing it. She just needed that first time to make peace with it. The idea is that if someone looks at the project and can’t identify with one of the people, they would definitely be able to identify with the locations where they were shot. The locations were never scary or like a haunted house situation. Most of the places are very normal locations that people go to everyday. There's a policewoman in the book who was shot by her husband. You might be able to identify with the fact that she was shot in a Wal-Mart parking lot. I didn’t do this as a project to put people on different sides. I did it to get people to identify that this could happen to them or someone they know.   Image by Kathy Shorr “It’s probably the most awful feeling a human being can have, when someone else is in charge of your fate.” —Kathy Shorr What were some of the other decisions you made visually and compositionally as you were doing the series? I met and talked with everyone first, anywhere from half an hour to three hours. We would meet to have coffee, sit down, and talk. I wanted to get to know them and make sure they were comfortable. It was very intense. I had to keep calm and cool. Everything can't be controlled like in studio photography. I wanted to show these people looking real. That's the important thing. How did the number become 101 people? I knew that I wanted to finish in December 2015. The middle of the country is the last place I went. I had 97 people at that point. I found a story in the newspaper about a young Native American woman in South Dakota who was in a domestic violence situation. Her boyfriend killed her three friends, shot her in the back, and killed himself. She was the only survivor. Her grandmother and I had phone conversations for a few months. Nothing ever happened. Right around Thanksgiving, a year after her incident, I said to her grandmother, "I would love to have her in the project, but I'm finishing next month, and I have to book flights.” I had two people to photograph in Milwaukee, but I couldn't wait any longer because I had to end the project in December. ADVERTISEMENT I thought it wouldn't work out. The day after Thanksgiving, I got a call; her grandmother said that her granddaughter, Karissa, had a very bad weekend. Both her therapist and grandmother said she should be in the project, so she agreed to do it. That made it 101, which I actually like better than 100. 101 sounds good. It was so powerful and moving that she could do this. It really showed the courage and determination of all the survivors in this project. Many people said, “If my story can help one person avoid this from happening to them, then it's worth my time and energy.” They have a complete selflessness about wanting to help other people.   Image by Kathy Shorr   Image by Kathy Shorr There are people in the book who carry guns or are pro-gun rights. Did you find that the subjects always vocalized support for more restrictive gun rights? I never asked anybody if they had a gun, because I felt like it wasn’t really my business. Some people would say to me, "I have guns, of course I have guns," sometimes from a culture of hunting or for defending themselves if they live in the middle of nowhere. Then there are people who would never go near a gun after what happened to them. There are people I photographed who didn't connect what happened to them with their hunting, and didn't get rid of their guns. The NRA member I photographed would be dead if he didn't have a gun on him. There are all different kinds of stories. People who own guns and want responsible gun laws (which I think is most people who own guns), those are the people who hold the key to this question about responsibility and guns. We all have to start talking. 70 percent of NRA members are not allowed to vote or make political decisions about how that organization behaves. I don't think that the people who are OK with mentally ill people having guns represent the majority of people in this country, but for some reason, it's a political group that has a lot of money and power. We need to hear more from gun owners who want gun safety. April 07, 2017 Photography Read full story MAKING YOUR LIFE EASIER.

Most world stock indexes fell Friday, April 7, 2017, while oil prices rose after the U.S. fired missiles at Syria during President Donald Trump's first meeting with China's president, leaving investors on edge. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks never got going Friday after a slightly disappointing jobs report and word of U.S. missile strikes against Syria. Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn't add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn't last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market did not have an overwhelming reaction to the jobs report or missile strikes because neither really altered investors' views of the U.S. economy. "It was not a bad (jobs) report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports," he said. Wren said the economy probably won't grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. While stocks didn't move much overall, there were a few clear trends. Investors mostly avoided industries whose performance is closely linked to the state of the economy. The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, which was weaker than the last few months and about half as many as analysts had predicted. One-time factors including snowstorms may have temporarily slowed hiring. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 2007, as more people found work. Over the last three months, employers had added an average of 178,000 jobs a month. That's just a bit slower than the monthly average from 2016. Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The VIX, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," started rising late Thursday as the U.S. government shifted its policy on Syria. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn't last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. Twenty-First Century Fox declined for the fifth day in a row as advertisers continued to pull their ads from "The O'Reilly Factor." Less than a week ago, the New York Times reported that Fox News and Bill O'Reilly, the network's most popular prime-time host, have paid $13 million to five women to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. Kantar Media says the show brought in more than $100 million in advertising revenue in 2016. The stock lost 5 cents to $31.07 and fell 4.1 percent this week.

Stocks wavered earlier following a somewhat disappointing jobs report and U.S. missile strikes against Syria, but defense contractors stocks are climbing and the price of oil is also up. KEEPING SCORE: Stocks have been flipping between small and gains and losses all day. The Standard & Poor's 500 gained 1 point to 2,358 as of 3:05 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,681. The Nasdaq composite added 4 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,882. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks fell 1 point, or 0.1 percent, to 1,363. HIRING: The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, which weaker than the last few months and about half as many as analysts had predicted. But Wall Street wasn't much bothered by the report, as one-time factors including snowstorms may have temporarily slowed hiring. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 2007, as more people found work.

Most world stock indexes fell Friday, April 7, 2017, while oil prices rose after the U.S. fired missiles at Syria during President Donald Trump's first meeting with China's president, leaving investors on edge. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) AIRSTRIKES: Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The VIX, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," started rising late Thursday as the U.S. government shifted its policy on Syria. The increased geopolitical uncertainty gave something of a boost to defense contractor stocks. Raytheon added $2.27, or 1.5 percent, to $153.02 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.80, or 1.4 percent, to $270.91. THE QUOTE: Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market isn't having a strong reaction to the events of the last 24 hours because they won't really alter investors' views of the U.S. economy. "It was not a bad report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports," he said of the jobs report. Wren said the economy probably won't grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive and keeps inflation at bay. SEEKING SAFETY: Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn't last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day, sending yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent. It finished at 2.34 percent Thursday. Phone companies, real estate investment trusts and household goods makers all traded higher. Wal-Mart gained $1.37, or 1.9 percent, to $72.80 and Prologis rose 72 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $53.78. ENERGY: The military strikes in the Middle East, which produces a large chunk of the world's oil, sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. FOX ROCKED: Twenty-First Century Fox declined for the fifth day in a row as advertisers continued to pull their ads from "The O'Reilly Factor." Less than a week ago, the New York Times reported that Fox News and Bill O'Reilly, the network's most popular prime-time host, have paid $13 million to five women to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. Kantar Media says the show brought in more than $100 million in advertising revenue in 2016. The stock lost 10 cents to $31.02 and it's down 4.1 percent this week. WELLS FELLED: Wells Fargo dipped after an influential firm that advises big shareholders says the majority of its board of directors should be removed. Institutional Shareholder Services said the board isn't doing enough to oversee the bank's sales practices. A second firm also recommended that a large portion of the board be replaced at the Wells Fargo shareholder meeting later this month. Wells Fargo recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after its employees opened more than 2 million accounts without customers' permission. CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired after the scandal came to light and thousands of employees were fired. On Friday Wells Fargo stock fell 41 cents to $54.96. METALS: The price of gold jumped more than 1 percent Friday morning and reached a five-month high, but the gain didn't last. Gold finished up $4 at $1,257.30. Silver lost 10 cents to $18.15 an ounce. Copper declined 1 cent to $2.65 a pound. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline gained 2 cents to $1.75 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Natural gas slid 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet. CURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 111.26 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0591 from $1.0646. OVERSEAS: In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany's DAX hardly budged. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Syndication. Updated April 7, 2017 9:25AM SHARE ALSO SEE YouTube Fake News Alphabet Online Advertising YouTube announced Thursday it is cracking down on fake news channels by no longer placing advertising on them until they've reached 10,000 overall views. YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., also the parent company of Google, announced changes after several big companies pulled their advertising from the company because their ads were appearing with objectionable content. The online video service said the changes are designed to make sure channels are legitimate and not stealing content. "We will no longer serve ads on YPP videos until the channel reaches 10K lifetime views," Ariel Bardin, vice president of product management, said in a statement. "This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10K views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10K views up until today will not be impacted." YouTube is also adding a review process for creators to join the YouTube Partner Program, which began in 2007. "After a creator hits 10K lifetime views on their channel, we'll review their activity against our policies," Bardin said. "If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules." The company, in an effort to help creators reach 10,000, will offer tips on "making great original content and growing your audience." "We want creators of all sizes to find opportunity on YouTube, and we believe this new application process will help ensure creator revenue continues to grow and end up in the right hands," Bardin said. In the past, the open-ended policy allowed amateur video creators to earn money and some work became viral and earned a considerable amount. Several advertisers, including Walmart, General Motors, JPMorgan Chase, Pepsico, Starbucks and Johnson & Johnson, pulled out of YouTube after their ads appeared in extremist hate-speech videos. On March 24, the head of the Association of National Advertisers, which represents 1,000 companies that spend more than $250 billion in marketing and advertising each year, urged Google to change its policy. "ANA strongly believes that brand safety is of paramount importance to our members," Bob Liodice said in statement. "The current crisis is representative of the issues that ANA -- and others -- have raised with respect to fraud and risk, reduced transparency, sub-optimum measurement and nebulous productivity." YouTube didn't say how many accounts would be affected by the change. Advertisers pay roughly $7 to $12 for 1,000 views and creators split the money with YouTube, The Wall Street Journal reported. "What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match," Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said last month in an interview with Fox Business Network. YouTube has more than a billion users and as of last July, it had paid out $2 billion to rightsholders, the company said on its website. © 2017 UPI Top Stories syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

MORE IN WORLD WIDE WEB YouTube TV Has Some Nifty Features Facebook Offers Fake News Tips Internet Inventor Wins Turing Award Montana Joins State Privacy Efforts Yahoo and AOL To Become 'Oath' Next Article > Facebook Launches Resource To Help Spot Misleading News By Barbara Ortutay. Updated April 06, 2017. Facebook is launching a resource to help you spot false news and misleading information that spreads on its service. The resource, similar to previous efforts around privacy and security, is basically a notification that pops up for a few days. Clicking on it takes you to tips and other information on how to spot false news and what to do about it. Tips to spot false news include looking closely at website addresses to see if they are trying to spoof real news sites, and checking websites' "about" sections for more information. Some sites might look like real news at first glance, but their "about" sections inform the visitor that they are in fact satire. Adam Mosseri, vice president of News Feed at Facebook, said he hopes people will become "more discerning consumers" of news. The new feature is part of a broader plan by Facebook to clamp down false news stories, which gained outsized attention in the months leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. False news, of course, was around long before the election. But supermarket tabloids peddling stories about aliens and celebrity miracles are less insidious than, say, "Pizzagate," a false internet rumor that led a gunman to fire an assault weapon inside a Washington pizzeria in December. Facebook has been "working very hard to figure out how to get their arms wrapped around this," said Lucy Dalglish, journalism dean at the University of Maryland. "Facebook was always very interested technology but not the social and civic implications of technology. It's like they have become citizens." She praised the company for seeking help from outside experts, including academics, researchers and nonprofit journalism organizations. The company, for instance, is working with outside fact-checking and media organizations to identify false news as such. And once they are identified, Facebook is trying to dry up the "economic incentives" of false news sites by making it difficult for them to buy ads on Facebook. Mosseri said most of the false news content on Facebook is from spammers trying to seek a profit and not, for example, political propaganda. This is apparent as the sites often flip-flop around opposing political candidates, for example. The new feature will be available in 14 countries, including the U.S., Germany, France, Italy, the U.K., Philippines, Taiwan and Brazil. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) FILE - In this Oct. 2, 2014 file photo, people pass a Wall Street subway stop, in New York's Financial District. Most world stock indexes fell Friday, April 7, 2017, while oil prices rose after the U.S. fired missiles at Syria during President Donald Trump's first meeting with China's president, leaving investors on edge. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • After wavering up and down all day, U.S. stock indexes wound up pretty much where they started. U.S. missile strikes in Syria and news Friday of a slowdown in hiring last month left investors with little interest in making big moves in the market, with a handful of exceptions. Defense contractors traded higher after the strikes. Raytheon climbed 1.5 percent and Lockheed Martin gained 1.2 percent. Investors also bid up some high-dividend stocks like phone companies as they sought out relatively safe venues to park money. Energy companies and banks fell. At 2 p.m. Mountain time, the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 6 points to 20,656. The Nasdaq composite slipped 1 point to 5,877. HIRING: The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, about half as many as analysts had predicted. Hiring dropped off somewhat after a few months of strong job growth that was linked to warm weather that boosted hiring in construction. The monthly job gains in January and February were revised a bit lower, which meant that hiring over the last three months continued at about the same pace as 2016. The unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5 percent. AIRSTRIKES: Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The U.S. government started shifting its policy on Syria before the close of trading Wednesday, which pushed the VIX, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," higher. The increased geopolitical uncertainty gave something of a boost to defense contractor stocks. Raytheon added $2.10, or 1.4 percent, to $152.85 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.31, or 1.2 percent, to $270.42. L3 Technologies climbed $2.86, or 1.8 percent, to $165.76. THE QUOTE: Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market isn't having a strong reaction to the events of the last 24 hours because they won't really alter investors' views of the U.S. economy. "It was not a bad report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports," he said of the jobs report. He said the economy probably won't grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive and keeps inflation at bay. SEEKING SAFETY: The price of gold jumped 1.2 percent to $1,268.10 an ounce, its highest price since right after the presidential election in November. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent from 2.34 percent. Lower bond yields mean lower interest rates and small profits on lending, and that hurt bank stocks. Capital One fell 71 cents to $83.52 and Citigroup lost 44 cents to $59.45. Phone companies, utilities, real estate investment trusts and household goods makers all traded higher. Wal-Mart gained $1.18, or 1.7 percent, to $72.61 and Sempra Energy rose $1.01 to $110.76. ENERGY: The military strikes in the Middle East, which produces a large chunk of the world's oil, sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 50 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.20 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 38 cents to $55.26 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.77 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0614 from $1.0646. OVERSEAS: In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany's DAX hardly budged. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES College football: Virginia admits 32 recruiting violations under Bronco Mendenhall Many may be called, but few women are chosen to speak at Mormon General Conference Utah Jazz: Gordon Hayward scores career-high 39 points as Jazz beat Minnesota Timberwolves 120-113 | Leave it to beaver?

Credit: Summer Cartwright | Senior Lantern Reporter The Board of Trustees met Friday morning to vote on, and approve of, legislation including Ohio State’s proposed energy privatization partnership with ENGIE-Axium, posthumous degrees to be granted to three students in May and planning costs for recently announced Framework 2.0 construction projects. The Board of Trustees voted unanimously to approve of the Comprehensive Energy Management Plan, a 50-year, billion-dollar privatization plan. A lawsuit was filed to the state Supreme Court by a Bruce Weide, a professor emeritus in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, demanding unreleased public records on the deal. OSU released a heavily redacted, more-than-2,000-page report to him on Wednesday evening. Weide said neither he — nor the public — has had enough time to look at the deal properly, though he pointed out multiple financial red flags in an email to The Lantern on Friday, as the Board continued with its vote. The deal has been under scrutiny since it was announced last week, resulting in multiple steering sessions and a special session — the first of its kind in known history — called by University Senate. University President Michael Drake applauded the energy partnership, detailing its potential to make OSU a leading name in sustainability. “This program is the culmination of two and a half years of discussion with more than thirty groups across campus including students, faculty and staff,” Drake said. “We have the opportunity to strengthen our core missions in considerable and really unprecedented investment in faculty, staff and students.” Board member W.G. “Jerry” Jurgensen addressed public concern over a lack of communication throughout the planning and bidding process that resulted in the energy partnership prior to voting on the deal. “Given the size and complexity of this transaction and reading the paper this morning … I recognize it’s tough to capture that amount of detail and really demonstrate the due diligence that is going into this,” Jurgensen said.  “I would really encourage the university to take a hard look at a public outreach in this regard that explores it in a little more detail in a Q-and-A format what this is really all about. Because of its size, and because it’s 50 years, and all of the other things there’s a real great opportunity for this to be misunderstood and misappreciated.” Protests A large crowd was present during the meeting, including some in protest of OSU’s contract with Wendy’s. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers interrupted the meeting to call upon the Board of Trustees to “keep their word.” Multiple groups on and off campus have been demanding the university ends its contract with Wendy’s, which leases a restaurant space in the Wexner Medical Center, so that it will be pressured to  join the Fair Food Program and adhere to that program’s standards for tomato pickers. The program has added 14 major corporations to its program, including McDonald’s, Burger King, Chipotle and Wal-Mart, but it hasn’t convinced Wendy’s to join. OSU’s contract with Wendy’s states the school will work to find “a resolution of the concerns of the Student Farmworkers Alliance regarding the procurement of tomatoes for the operation of Tenant’s business at the Premise that is satisfactory to Landlord in its sole discretion.” Previously, the university set up a meeting between Wendy’s and the Student Farmworkers Alliance, but the group declined to meet, citing a message posted to Wendy’s website dating from 2013. In that statement, which has since been updated and changed, Wendy’s said it was being targeted by CIW and that the restaurant should only have to negotiate directly with the supplier, not a third-party organization like CIW. The Fair Food Program, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers — a workers’ rights organization — and the Alliance for Fair Food work together to ensure the protection of rights and wages for farmers and farmworkers in Immokalee, Florida, according to their websites. Unlike McDonald’s and Burger King, for example, which buy tomatoes from farms in Florida that are protected by the Fair Food Program’s code of conduct, Wendy’s gets its tomatoes from Mexico. “Keep your word,” the group of CIW members chanted from the back of the meeting room. The group was told to write a statement to the board on their concerns that could be reviewed by the Board of Trustees later. Reagan Tokes Additionally, the board also voted in favor of granting a posthumous degree to Reagan Tokes, a fourth-year in psychology. Tokes, a fourth-year in psychology, was last seen alive on Feb. 8 as she left her shift from Bodega Cafe in the Short North, before police say she was kidnapped, robbed, raped and murdered. Brian Lee Golsby, 29, is facing an 18-count indictment related to Tokes’ death and a string of robberies in German Village, and is facing the death penalty. He pleaded not guilty on Monday. Along with Tokes, the Board of Trustees voted to award posthumous degrees to Adam Doleh and Jarrod Jasmine. Doleh is to be awarded a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering. Jasmine is to be awarded an associate degree from OSU’s Agricultural Technical Institute, as well as a bachelor’s degree in Environment and Natural Resources. Framework 2.0 Members of the board also approved the planning costs for newly announced Framework 2.0 construction projects, estimated to cost between $5-7 million. This includes 11 current construction projects that exceed $20 million individually, including renovation and upgrades of the Schottenstein Center, Ohio Stadium and Wexner Medical Center. In total, the board approved 25 items on Friday, including contract extensions, buying and selling various property to accommodate Framework 2.0 plans, naming buildings and rooms after persons and the establishment of a master of contemporary art and curatorial practice. All items were approved with unanimous consent. board of trustees energy deal engine-axium featured reagan tokes wendy's protesters 2017-04-07 Summer Cartwright tweet Previous: Women’s lacrosse: Buckeyes drop home contest to Northwestern Next: Buckeye Twirl puts on spring showcase Related Posts Students, police talk race relations and policing April 7, 2017 Football: Dre’Mont Jones establishing himself as heavyweight presence in the middle of the defensive line April 6, 2017 Board of Trustees: Committee approves new master’s program, posthumous degree for Reagan Tokes April 6, 2017 Alumni donations up, but millennial donors least satisfied April 6, 2017 Board of Trustees: Committee discusses crime trends, construction April 6, 2017 Football: Sam Hubbard practicing at linebacker, step toward five D-linemen on field April 6, 2017 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

 What you need to know on Wall Street today Business Insider Apr. 7, 2017, 1:20 PM 527 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ray Dalio talks at the Alpha Exchange panel at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference September 13th in NYC Heidi Gutman / CNBC Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours.   Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, decided a couple of years ago that one of his star executives needed a mentor. A little while later, Marty Chavez, who is about to become the bank's chief financial officer, received an unexpected email. "Hey Marty, I'd like to come over to your office to introduce myself," it said. It was from Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google's parent company, Alphabet. "We've been talking ever since about the similarities in the businesses," Chavez told a group of computer scientists earlier this year about the message. "Some of the similarities are aspirational, I have to emphasize that, and some are there right now." Here's how Goldman Sachs is trying to become the Google of Wall Street.  Business Insider's global editor in chief Henry Blodget interviewed Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates,  on The Bottom Line , Business Insider's new weekly business news show. Here are the headlines: RAY DALIO: There is a human tragedy taking place in America Ray Dalio explains why we may be repeating the mistakes of the 1930s Watch The Bottom Line here In related news, there has been a shake-up in the trading department at Bridgewater Associates. US employers added 98,000 nonfarm payrolls in March, far fewer than forecast, according to a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday. While the headline number fell short, for one industry it was even worse. The retail industry lost 29,700 jobs in the month of March, following a 30,900 loss in February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Canada's jobs report crushed expectations, meanwhile.  The US launched 59 cruise missiles on Shayrat airfield and nearby military infrastructure controlled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in response to a chemical attack that killed at least 80 people in the northwestern part of the country on Monday. Here's how the markets reacted: Oil spiked Gold and silver jumped Defense stocks spiked The Russian ruble dropped Two men are facing charges for alleged insider trading ahead of Intel's $15 billion Mobileye acquisition. And Preet Bharara says his firing was due to the Trump administration's "helter-skelter" incompetence. An Illinois city just stepped into the war on drug pricing against Big Pharma. Lyft just raised $500 million to aid its fight against Uber. We took a ride in a $416,000 Rolls-Royce — and the best features are in the back seat. Lastly, we shadowed a bunch of Wall Streeters during an early-morning training session for the most intense competition out there — here's what it was like. Here are the top Wall Street headlines from the past 24 hours. Suddenly everyone is obsessed with robots - Buzzwords crop up in the business world all the time, whether it's "synergies" or "unicorn," there's always a new term of the moment for companies and investors. Walmart thinks it has 4 strategic advantages over Amazon - The war between Amazon and Walmart is well known in the world of retail.  UBS: Shanghai Disneyland is a major success - While many analysts are focused on Disney's film cycle or ESPN problems, UBS thinks that Disney's theme parks, in particular Shanghai Disneyland, will be the big determining factor behind Disney's near-term earnings growth. CREDIT SUISSE: Everyone else on Wall Street is wrong about these 12 stocks - Credit Suisse circulated a list of contrarian stock ideas to clients in a note sent out on April 7. US oil-rig count rises for 12th straight week, Baker Hughes says - The US oil-rig count rose again this week, by 10 to 672, according to oilfield-services provider Baker Hughes. It's the highest level since the week of August 28, 2015.  The best beer from every state - There's nothing like a crisp, cold glass of beer when you're ready to unwind after a long day, and every state has brews that stand out above the rest.  SEE ALSO: The 27 most important finance books ever written Follow Finance Insider and never miss an update!

Defense contractors are making substantial gains and the price of oil is rising. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor’s 500 held steady at 2,356 at noon Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4 points to 20,666. The Nasdaq composite fell 4 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,874. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks fell a fraction to 1,364. The New York Stock Exchange was about evenly split between stocks that were rising and stocks that were falling. HIRING: The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, about half as many as analysts had predicted. Hiring dropped off somewhat after a few months of strong job growth that was linked to warm weather that boosted hiring in construction. The monthly job gains in January and February were revised a bit lower, which meant that hiring over the last three months continued at about the same pace as 2016. The unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5 percent. AIRSTRIKES: Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air-force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The U.S. government started shifting its policy on Syria before the close of trading Wednesday, which pushed the VIX, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” higher. The increased geopolitical uncertainty gave something of a boost to defense-contractor stocks. Raytheon added $2.10, or 1.4 percent, to $152.85 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.31, or 1.2 percent, to $270.42. L3 Technologies climbed $2.86, or 1.8 percent, to $165.76. THE QUOTE: Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market isn’t having a strong reaction to the events of the last 24 hours because they won’t really alter investors’ views of the U.S. economy. “It was not a bad report; it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports,” he said of the jobs report. He said the economy probably won’t grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive and keeps inflation at bay. SEEKING SAFETY: The price of gold jumped 1.2 percent to $1,268.10 an ounce, its highest price since right after the presidential election in November. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent from 2.34 percent. Lower bond yields mean lower interest rates and small profits on lending, and that hurt bank stocks. Capital One fell 71 cents to $83.52 and Citigroup lost 44 cents to $59.45. Phone companies, utilities, real-estate investment trusts and household-goods makers all traded higher. Wal-Mart gained $1.18, or 1.7 percent, to $72.61, and Sempra Energy rose $1.01 to $110.76. ENERGY: The military strikes in the Middle East, which produces a large chunk of the world’s oil, sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 50 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.20 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 38 cents to $55.26 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.77 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0614 from $1.0646. OVERSEAS: In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany’s DAX hardly budged. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was little changed.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com YouTube Cracks Down on Fake News Channels with Ad Changes PUBLISHED: APRIL 07 2017 YouTube announced Thursday it is cracking down on fake news channels by no longer placing advertising on them until they've reached 10,000 overall views. YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., also the parent company of Google, announced changes after several big companies pulled their advertising from the company because their ads were appearing with objectionable content. The online video service said the changes are designed to make sure channels are legitimate and not stealing content. "We will no longer serve ads on YPP videos until the channel reaches 10K lifetime views," Ariel Bardin, vice president of product management, said in a statement. "This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10K views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10K views up until today will not be impacted." YouTube is also adding a review process for creators to join the YouTube Partner Program, which began in 2007. "After a creator hits 10K lifetime views on their channel, we'll review their activity against our policies," Bardin said. "If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules." The company, in an effort to help creators reach 10,000, will offer tips on "making great original content and growing your audience." "We want creators of all sizes to find opportunity on YouTube, and we believe this new application process will help ensure creator revenue continues to grow and end up in the right hands," Bardin said. In the past, the open-ended policy allowed amateur video creators to earn money and some work became viral and earned a considerable amount. Several advertisers, including Walmart, General Motors, JPMorgan Chase, Pepsico, Starbucks and Johnson & Johnson, pulled out of YouTube after their ads appeared in extremist hate-speech videos. On March 24, the head of the Association of National Advertisers, which represents 1,000 companies that spend more than $250 billion in marketing and advertising each year, urged Google to change its policy. "ANA strongly believes that brand safety is of paramount importance to our members," Bob Liodice said in statement. "The current crisis is representative of the issues that ANA -- and others -- have raised with respect to fraud and risk, reduced transparency, sub-optimum measurement and nebulous productivity." YouTube didn't say how many accounts would be affected by the change. Advertisers pay roughly $7 to $12 for 1,000 views and creators split the money with YouTube, The Wall Street Journal reported. "What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match," Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said last month in an interview with Fox Business Network. YouTube has more than a billion users and as of last July, it had paid out $2 billion to rightsholders, the company said on its website. © 2017 UPI Top Stories under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Yahoo and AOL To Become 'Oath' Next Article > Facebook Launches Resource To Help Spot Misleading News By Barbara Ortutay PUBLISHED: APRIL 06 2017 Facebook is launching a resource to help you spot false news and misleading information that spreads on its service. The resource, similar to previous efforts around privacy and security, is basically a notification that pops up for a few days. Clicking on it takes you to tips and other information on how to spot false news and what to do about it. Tips to spot false news include looking closely at website addresses to see if they are trying to spoof real news sites, and checking websites' "about" sections for more information. Some sites might look like real news at first glance, but their "about" sections inform the visitor that they are in fact satire. Adam Mosseri, vice president of News Feed at Facebook, said he hopes people will become "more discerning consumers" of news. The new feature is part of a broader plan by Facebook to clamp down false news stories, which gained outsized attention in the months leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. False news, of course, was around long before the election. But supermarket tabloids peddling stories about aliens and celebrity miracles are less insidious than, say, "Pizzagate," a false internet rumor that led a gunman to fire an assault weapon inside a Washington pizzeria in December. Facebook has been "working very hard to figure out how to get their arms wrapped around this," said Lucy Dalglish, journalism dean at the University of Maryland. "Facebook was always very interested technology but not the social and civic implications of technology. It's like they have become citizens." She praised the company for seeking help from outside experts, including academics, researchers and nonprofit journalism organizations. The company, for instance, is working with outside fact-checking and media organizations to identify false news as such. And once they are identified, Facebook is trying to dry up the "economic incentives" of false news sites by making it difficult for them to buy ads on Facebook. Mosseri said most of the false news content on Facebook is from spammers trying to seek a profit and not, for example, political propaganda. This is apparent as the sites often flip-flop around opposing political candidates, for example. The new feature will be available in 14 countries, including the U.S., Germany, France, Italy, the U.K., Philippines, Taiwan and Brazil. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

U.S. employers added about 98,000 jobs in March, the fewest since last May and below economists' expectation of 180,000, as bad weather hit hiring at construction sites. However, wage growth ticked up slightly and the unemployment rate fell. Bank stocks were hit the most. The S&P 500 financial index was down 0.56 percent, the biggest decliner among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors. "This morning's job numbers place another speed bump in front of the equity rally," said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank in St. Louis. At 12:23 p.m. ET (1623 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.89 points, or 0.05 percent, at 20,673.84, the S&P 500 was up 0.62 points, or 0.02 percent, at 2,358.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.84 points, or 0.03 percent, at 5,880.79. "These payroll numbers and the missile strike in Syria will give investors cause for concern. Any momentum in the markets has now been sucked out," Gaffney said. The United States late on Thursday fired several missiles at an airfield in Syria from which a deadly chemical attack was launched earlier this week. The news of the attack sent global stocks lower, with the S&P 500 futures index falling as much as 0.5 percent. But most of the losses ebbed after U.S. officials described the attack as a one-off that would not lead to wider escalation. The industrials sector was up 0.23 percent, led by weapons makers and defense companies. Raytheon, which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles used in the strike, jumped 1.5 percent. Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman were up between 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent. Other sectors that gained were utilities and telecom services sectors, preferred investment options in times of uncertainty due to their slow but predictable growth. Gold prices hit a five-month high. Consumer staples, another defensive sector, was lifted by a 1.8 percent rise in Wal-Mart after Telsey Advisory upgraded the retailer's stock to "outperform".

Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn't add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn't last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market did not have an overwhelming reaction to the jobs report or missile strikes because neither really altered investors' views of the U.S. economy. "It was not a bad (jobs) report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports," he said. Wren said the economy probably won't grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. While stocks didn't move much overall, there were a few clear trends. Investors mostly avoided industries whose performance is closely linked to the state of the economy. The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, which was weaker than the last few months and about half as many as analysts had predicted. One-time factors including snowstorms may have temporarily slowed hiring. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 2007, as more people found work. Over the last three months, employers had added an average of 178,000 jobs a month. That's just a bit slower than the monthly average from 2016. Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The VIX, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," started rising late Thursday as the U.S. government shifted its policy on Syria. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn't last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. Twenty-First Century Fox declined for the fifth day in a row as advertisers continued to pull their ads from "The O'Reilly Factor." Less than a week ago, the New York Times reported that Fox News and Bill O'Reilly, the network's most popular prime-time host, have paid $13 million to five women to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. Kantar Media says the show brought in more than $100 million in advertising revenue in 2016. The stock lost 5 cents to $31.07 and fell 4.1 percent this week. Wells Fargo dipped after an influential firm that advises big shareholders says most of its board of directors should be removed. Institutional Shareholder Services said the board isn't doing enough to oversee the bank's sales practices. A second firm also recommended that a large portion of the board be replaced at the Wells Fargo shareholder meeting later this month. Wells Fargo recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after its employees opened more than 2 million accounts without customers' permission. CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired after the scandal came to light and thousands of employees were fired. On Friday Wells Fargo stock fell 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.84. Gold finished up $4 at $1,257.30. Silver lost 10 cents to $18.15 an ounce. Copper declined 1 cent to $2.65 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 2 cents to $1.75 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Natural gas slid 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar dipped to 111.15 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0588 from $1.0646. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany's DAX hardly budged. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Top Stories Baseball-sized spider discovered in mine (Warning: Scary) Senate confirms Neil Gorsuch to Supreme Court Equipment stolen in Texas lands Lake Charles woman in prison Man found hanging in Orange County Jail cell 4 dead, 3 crime scenes, daughter suspected Chief: Wrecked bus driver 'may have been going to sleep' Traffic stop results in meth, gun charges for Orange man BPD: Do you recognize these men?

(Credit: Mario Tama/Getty Images) × 60,000 Retail Jobs Lost in Past Two Months, According to Latest Employment Report In this file photo, a post-Christmas shopper holds Macy's bags as other shoppers cross Seventh Avenue in New York City on Dec. 27, 2006. (Credit: Mario Tama/Getty Images) The dramatic reshaping of the American retail industry has, unfortunately, led to massive job losses in the sector. The federal government said Friday that retailers shed nearly 30,000 jobs in March. That follows a more than 30,000 decline in the number of retail jobs in the previous month. So-called general merchandise stores are hurting the most. That part of the sector, which includes struggling companies like Macy’s, Sears and J.C. Penney, lost 35,000 jobs last month. Nearly 90,000 jobs have been eliminated since last October. These stores, along with others like Target and Kohl’s, are struggling to adapt to the shift from brick-and-mortar shopping to digital and mobile commerce — the so-called Amazon effect. More consumers are buying goods on their phones, tablets and PCs, to the detriment of nearly all the traditional big box stores and many mall-based retailers. Payless ShoeSource announced this week that it will be closing hundreds of stores. Ralph Lauren is shutting down its big Fifth Avenue store in New York City. American Apparel, Wet Seal and The Sports Authority have all filed for bankruptcy within the past year. Will the job losses continue? Some argue that the weakness in retail is not something that will last. This could be just a shakeout in the industry. Weak retailers have to shut stores, but the overall sector could start adding jobs again if stronger retailers hire. “There is no question that the Amazon effect is overwhelming,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist of private banking for BBH. “There has been a shift in the way we buy things as opposed to a shift in the amount of money spent.” To that end, Amazon just announced plans to hire 30,000 part-time workers. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst with Bankrate.com, referred to what’s going on in the sector as a “retail reshuffle.” “Many store chains have announced closings. …. They’re struggling with overcapacity in the industry and the consumer’s shift to online purchases,” he wrote in a report, adding that “more pain for retail workers looms in the months ahead.” Still, all is not lost for brick-and-mortar. Walmart is one “old-school” retailer still doing well. Walmart has ramped up its own digital commerce businesses with a series of acquisitions, led by last year’s big deal for the hot e-commerce unicorn company Jet.com for $3 billion. Other retailers have been able to avoid getting Amazon-ed too. Companies like Home Depot, Lowe’s, Costco and Children’s Place have all done well this year. But how long will this last? Brett Ewing, chief market strategist with First Franklin, pointed out in a report that a slight slowdown in wage growth could cause consumers to pull back on spending. “The most negative thing about the report was a deceleration in average hourly earnings. While they are still growing at a solid pace, we never want to see that growth start to decelerate and it is something we are focusing on for upcoming months,” he said. And Adam Strauss, co-manager of the Appleseed Fund, said that too much is being made about Amazon’s growing clout in retail. “I am convinced that the weakness in retail is way more than Amazon,” he said. “It’s having an effect. But Amazon is just talking market share. The overall U.S retail sector isn’t growing,” he added. As a result, his fund is avoiding all retail stocks due to consumer spending concerns. 37.090240 -95.712891 Related stories Payless ShoeSource is Filing for Bankruptcy, Closing Hundreds of Stores JCPenney Plans to Close Up to 140 Stores, Offer 6,000 Employees Early Retirement Macy’s to Close 68 More Stores, Including SoCal Locations; More Than 10,000 Jobs to Be Cut Filed in: Money Smart, Nation/World Topics: JCPenney, macy's, Payless ShoeSource, sears Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Facebook Popular Trump Orders Military Strike in Syria; Dozens of Cruise Missiles Launched at Government Targets Girl Found Living With Monkeys in a Forest in India Video Shows 2 Women Fighting After Fender-Bender in Stockton Parking Lot; Jailed Woman Tells Her Side Bicycle Hotel and Casino in Bell Gardens Raided by Federal Authorities Latest News Say Aloha To Your Chance To Win A Trip To Aulani, A Disney Resort & Spa Irvine 14-Year-Old Makes Miraculous Recovery After Being Struck by 60-Foot Fallen Tree 5 Suspects at Large After Shooting in Venice; 1 Victim in Stable Condition Man Allegedly Shoots Woman in the Street Before Killing Himself in Gardena Nation/World Payless ShoeSource is Filing for Bankruptcy, Closing Hundreds of Stores Nation/World Sears Has ‘Substantial Doubt’ That It Will Stay in Business Technology GameStop to Close as Many as 190 Stores Nation/World Staples Announces Plans to Close 70 More Stores Money Smart Nation/World JCPenney Plans to Close Up to 140 Stores, Offer 6,000 Employees Early Retirement Nation/World Wal-Mart Plans to Add 10,000 U.S. Jobs in 2017 Nation/World U.S. Economy Added 235,000 Jobs in Trump’s First Full Month News Obama Economy Creates More Than 2 Million Jobs in 2016 Money Smart Nordstrom to Drop Ivanka Trump’s Line, Cites Brand’s ‘Performance’ Nation/World Macy’s to Close 68 More Stores, Including SoCal Locations; More Than 10,000 Jobs to Be Cut Politics Ford Cancels Mexico Plant; Will Create 700 U.S. Jobs in ‘Vote of Confidence’ in Trump Nation/World The Limited Stores Nationwide Officially Closed Money Smart Nation/World Amazon Plans to Create 100,000 Full-Time Jobs in the US Mobile Apps Android App iPhone & iPad App KTLA 5 News on Social Media Watch CW Shows Facebook Twitter Instagram Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 5800 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA, 90028 • Copyright © 2017, KTLA • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Posted 07 Apr 2017 19:50 Updated 08 Apr 2017 05:30 Traders work inside a post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 30, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street's three major indexes edged lower on Friday in a choppy session as investors grappled with a weaker-than-expected job report, the U.S. airstrike in Syria and a top Federal Reserve official's comments on trimming the U.S. central bank's balance sheet. Investors were trying to work out how the developments would affect U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to proceed with his pro-business agenda. The market rallied sharply after Trump's Nov. 8 election on his promises for tax cuts, spending and lighter regulation, but investors increasingly have been questioning whether the proposals would ever materialize. "You had so many confusing things happening today. The employment number was certainly surprising. The U.S. airstrike was surprising. People were trying to figure out what that meant," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.85 points, or 0.03 percent, at 20,656.1, the S&P 500 lost 1.95 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,355.54 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.14 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,877.81. All three indexes ended slightly lower for the week. Six of the S&P's 11 major sectors ended down on the day. U.S. employers added about 98,000 jobs in March, the fewest since last May and well below economists' expectation of 180,000, as bad weather hit construction hiring. However, wage growth edged up and unemployment fell. New York Fed President William Dudley on Friday shed more light on the U.S. central bank's developing plan for when to stop replacing bonds that expire in its portfolio, how to execute it, and how far it would ultimately shrink its balance sheet. U.S. Treasury yields rose after Dudley's remarks, which helped push equities lower, according to Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions, at Voya Investment Management in New York. LibertyView's Meckler said Dudley's remarks were not earth-shattering but "small statements are having a magnified affect because investors are worried." The United States, in a pre-dawn strike, fired missiles at an airfield from which it said a deadly poison gas attack was launched this week. In the coming days it "will be interesting to watch to see if (Syria) does grab more attention from the White House and delay some of these other issues and programs they are trying to get passed through here," said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Omaha, Nebraska said. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and two new lows. The Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 46 new lows. About 5.97 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Friday compared with the 6.75 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

While the job additions were the lowest in 10 months, the Labor Department report was seen as an outlier amid a spate of recent positive economic data.Financial stocks were hit the most. The S&P 500 financial index was down 0.56 percent, led by banks.At 11:04 a.m. ET (1504 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14.13 points, or 0.07 percent, at 20,648.82, the S&P 500 was down 2.06 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,355.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 7.30 points, or 0.12 percent, at 5,871.65."This morning's job numbers place another speed bump in front of the equity rally," said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank in St. Louis. "These payroll numbers and the missile strike in Syria will give investors cause for concern. Any momentum in the markets has now been sucked out."The United States fired several missiles late on Thursday at an airfield in Syria from which a deadly chemical attack was launched earlier this week. The news of the attack sent global stocks lower, with the S&P 500 futures index falling as much as 0.5 percent. But most of the losses were pared back after U.S. officials described the attack as a one-off that would not lead to wider escalation.Traditionally defensive sectors such as utilities and telecom services were higher. Gold prices hit a five-month high.Consumer staples, another defensive sector, was lifted by a 1.2 percent rise in Wal-Mart after Telsey Advisory upgraded the retailer's stock to "outperform". Shares of Raytheon, which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles used in the strike was up about 1 percent.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,381 to 1,350.

Again Retailers cut tens of thousands of jobs. Again Posted on Friday, April 7, 2017 by CNN in Business News The dramatic reshaping of the American retail industry has, unfortunately, led to massive job losses in the sector. The federal government said Friday that retailers shed nearly 30,000 jobs in March. That follows a more than 30,000 decline in the number of retail jobs in the previous month. So-called general merchandise stores are hurting the most. That part of the sector, which includes struggling companies like Macy’s, Sears and J.C. Penney, lost 35,000 jobs last month. Nearly 90,000 jobs have been eliminated since last October. These stores, along with others like Target and Kohl’s, are struggling to adapt to the shift from brick-and-mortar shopping to digital and mobile commerce — the so-called Amazon effect. More consumers are buying goods on their phones, tablets and PCs, to the detriment of nearly all the traditional big box stores and many mall-based retailers. Payless ShoeSource announced this week that it will be closing hundreds of stores. Ralph Lauren is shutting down its big Fifth Avenue store in New York City. American Apparel, Wet Seal and The Sports Authority have all filed for bankruptcy within the past year. Will the job losses continue? Some argue that the weakness in retail is not something that will last. This could be just a shakeout in the industry. Weak retailers have to shut stores, but the overall sector could start adding jobs again if stronger retailers hire. “There is no question that the Amazon effect is overwhelming,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist of private banking for BBH. “There has been a shift in the way we buy things as opposed to a shift in the amount of money spent.” To that end, Amazon just announced plans to hire 30,000 part-time workers. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst with Bankrate.com, referred to what’s going on in the sector as a “retail reshuffle.” “Many store chains have announced closings. …. They’re struggling with overcapacity in the industry and the consumer’s shift to online purchases,” he wrote in a report, adding that “more pain for retail workers looms in the months ahead.” Still, all is not lost for brick-and-mortar. Walmart is one “old-school” retailer still doing well. Walmart has ramped up its own digital commerce businesses with a series of acquisitions, led by last year’s big deal for the hot e-commerce unicorn company Jet.com for $3 billion. Other retailers have been able to avoid getting Amazon-ed too. Companies like Home Depot, Lowe’s, Costco and Children’s Place have all done well this year. But how long will this last? Brett Ewing, chief market strategist with First Franklin, pointed out in a report that a slight slowdown in wage growth could cause consumers to pull back on spending. “The most negative thing about the report was a deceleration in average hourly earnings. While they are still growing at a solid pace, we never want to see that growth start to decelerate and it is something we are focusing on for upcoming months,” he said. And Adam Strauss, co-manager of the Appleseed Fund, said that too much is being made about Amazon’s growing clout in retail. “I am convinced that the weakness in retail is way more than Amazon,” he said. “It’s having an effect. But Amazon is just talking market share. The overall U.S retail sector isn’t growing,” he added. As a result, his fund is avoiding all retail stocks due to consumer spending concerns.

Defense contractors are making substantial gains and the price of oil is rising. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor’s 500 held steady at 2,356 at noon Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4 points to 20,666. The Nasdaq composite fell 4 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,874. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks fell a fraction to 1,364. The New York Stock Exchange was about evenly split between stocks that were rising and stocks that were falling. HIRING: The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, about half as many as analysts had predicted. Hiring dropped off somewhat after a few months of strong job growth that was linked to warm weather that boosted hiring in construction. The monthly job gains in January and February were revised a bit lower, which meant that hiring over the last three months continued at about the same pace as 2016. The unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5 percent. AIRSTRIKES: Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The U.S. government started shifting its policy on Syria before the close of trading Wednesday, which pushed the VIX, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” higher. The increased geopolitical uncertainty gave something of a boost to defense contractor stocks. Raytheon added $2.10, or 1.4 percent, to $152.85 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.31, or 1.2 percent, to $270.42. L3 Technologies climbed $2.86, or 1.8 percent, to $165.76. THE QUOTE: Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market isn’t having a strong reaction to the events of the last 24 hours because they won’t really alter investors’ views of the U.S. economy. “It was not a bad report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports,” he said of the jobs report. He said the economy probably won’t grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive and keeps inflation at bay. SEEKING SAFETY: The price of gold jumped 1.2 percent to $1,268.10 an ounce, its highest price since right after the presidential election in November. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent from 2.34 percent. Lower bond yields mean lower interest rates and small profits on lending, and that hurt bank stocks. Capital One fell 71 cents to $83.52 and Citigroup lost 44 cents to $59.45. Phone companies, utilities, real estate investment trusts and household goods makers all traded higher. Wal-Mart gained $1.18, or 1.7 percent, to $72.61 and Sempra Energy rose $1.01 to $110.76. ENERGY: The military strikes in the Middle East, which produces a large chunk of the world’s oil, sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 50 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.20 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 38 cents to $55.26 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.77 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0614 from $1.0646. OVERSEAS: In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany’s DAX hardly budged. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was little changed. banking Business dow jones finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchange NEWS stocks Wall Street 2017-04-07 Associated Press tweet Tagged with: banking Business dow jones finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchange NEWS stocks Wall Street Previous: Po’ Monkey’s will rock the house again Next: Many students to receive less financial aid About Associated Press More Stories Like This Newest Navy destroyer to be christened at Pascagoula April 7, 2017 Houston High School solar car race team featured in IMAX film April 7, 2017 Many students to receive less financial aid April 7, 2017 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

After weak jobs report and Syria strikes, stocks stand still by: MARLEY JAY, AP Markets Writer Updated: Apr 7, 2017 - 5:05 PM Twtter NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. stocks never got going Friday after a slightly disappointing jobs report and word of U.S. missile strikes against Syria. Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn't add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn't last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market did not have an overwhelming reaction to the jobs report or missile strikes because neither really altered investors' views of the U.S. economy. "It was not a bad (jobs) report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports," he said. Wren said the economy probably won't grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. While stocks didn't move much overall, there were a few clear trends. Investors mostly avoided industries whose performance is closely linked to the state of the economy. The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, which was weaker than the last few months and about half as many as analysts had predicted. One-time factors including snowstorms may have temporarily slowed hiring. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 2007, as more people found work. Over the last three months, employers had added an average of 178,000 jobs a month. That's just a bit slower than the monthly average from 2016. Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The VIX, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," started rising late Thursday as the U.S. government shifted its policy on Syria. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn't last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. Twenty-First Century Fox declined for the fifth day in a row as advertisers continued to pull their ads from "The O'Reilly Factor." Less than a week ago, the New York Times reported that Fox News and Bill O'Reilly, the network's most popular prime-time host, have paid $13 million to five women to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. Kantar Media says the show brought in more than $100 million in advertising revenue in 2016. The stock lost 5 cents to $31.07 and fell 4.1 percent this week. Wells Fargo dipped after an influential firm that advises big shareholders says most of its board of directors should be removed. Institutional Shareholder Services said the board isn't doing enough to oversee the bank's sales practices. A second firm also recommended that a large portion of the board be replaced at the Wells Fargo shareholder meeting later this month. Wells Fargo recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after its employees opened more than 2 million accounts without customers' permission. CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired after the scandal came to light and thousands of employees were fired. On Friday Wells Fargo stock fell 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.84. Gold finished up $4 at $1,257.30. Silver lost 10 cents to $18.15 an ounce. Copper declined 1 cent to $2.65 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 2 cents to $1.75 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Natural gas slid 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar dipped to 111.15 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0588 from $1.0646. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany's DAX hardly budged. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Portland Public Schools is suing reporters. The Trump administration is kneecapping police reform, the Environmental Protection Agency, and our common humanity. But none of those funereal developments explain how I ended up in cold, damp crypt with David Yandell. We took a slow, echoed walk last week to the north end of the Portland Memorial Mausoleum, then dropped into the circular vault known as Wilson Tower. Sixty-three children are buried or memorialized here. A few lived several years, others several moments. David's only child, Jeremy, was 8 months old in 1982, deathly still in his father's arms, when the respirator was removed. Yandell doesn't often come to the grave. His father is interred nearby, as are his grandparents - "the only family I have, for the most part" - and those are anguished reunions. But when he trudged through the silent mausoleum at Christmas, Yandell discovered that the plastic flowers and a stuffed animal, his private memorial, had disappeared from the vase set beside Jeremy's gravestone. "I was aghast. Heartbroken. Frustrated that someone desecrated his grave," Yandell says. "All I wanted to do was go out and get drunk." David YandellSteve Duin  Instead, he left his small Martha Washington apartment and checked himself into the county's Crisis Assessment and Treatment Center. For several weeks, he counted his losses. He nursed his wounds. Then he had an idea. Yandell, 57, is famous for his ideas. Over the last 20 years, he has organized a series of campaigns that provide holiday turkeys, school supplies and hundreds of new bicycles to cash-strapped Portland families. He is inventive, adept at marketing, and refreshingly frank about the part bi-polar disorder plays in his energetic community building. "There's a lot of inner turmoil away from the crowd," Yandell says. "But creatively, I'm very functional. I'm the life of the party. People who are manic, bi-polar, tend to be very creative. "A little mania goes a long way." This time around, it sent Yandell out to the Walmart on Southeast 82nd Avenue. He bought four-dozen teddy bears. Then he returned to the Sellwood mausoleum in early February, set one bear outside Jeremy's tombstone ... and placed another bear atop every other empty metal vase in the crypt. The Portland Memorial Mausoleum in Sellwood.Steve Duin  "My thought was that if I did this, no one would be tempted to steal Jeremy's bear," Yandell says. "Plus, no other child would be forgotten. No babies should ever be forgotten." He knows how painful that can be. Yandell had a chaotic childhood. As Julie Sullivan wrote in a 2008 profile for The Oregonian, his father died when he was 2, and Yandell spent his teenage years rolling in and out of foster homes, MacLaren - in its "reform school" era - and the juvenile unit at Dammasch State Hospital. "Initially, I went to MacLaren for 'incorrigibility,'" Yandell says. "I'm still incorrigible now. It's how I get things done." He met Stacey, Jeremy's mother and another reform-school survivor, in 1979, and got her pregnant in Las Vegas. He was 19 when they married, and a 21-year-old student at Portland Community College when he got the call that Jeremy was unconscious. The autopsy, Yandell says, was inclusive. The marriage only lasted several more months. He long ago lost touch with Stacey. But Jeremy? "Every project I do in Portland has to do with my child," he says. It's an endless battle against loss and loneliness. He's on disability now, wryly noting, "That's the least of my problems." He hasn't held a job since a messy split with Radio Cab in 2007. He knows to seek treatment when "I can't handle the outside world." But Yandell hasn't given up on that world. That's what truly echoes for me in this tale from the crypt. Angered by the theft of something that mattered to him, Yandell didn't lash out. He reached out. Stunned by the empty vase at his son's grave, Yandell returned with an armload of teddy bears, so that the next visitor to Wilson Tower would be surprised in an entirely different way. "It's poignant, isn't it?" he says. That it is. Like so many David Yandell stories over the years. A little common humanity goes a long way. -- Steve Duin stephen.b.duin@gmail.com Opinion Resources How do I submit a letter to the editor or a guest column?

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is now the second richest person on Earth. By Matt McFarland WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- In a 10-day stretch, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have made something abundantly clear: They're competing in a world of their own. Bezos, the Amazon CEO, and Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, have distinguished themselves as the must-watch innovators pushing hardest -- and most effectively -- to bring the future to us today. They made billions in the Internet age, like many in the tech world. But Musk and Bezos' innovations aren't limited to the screens we stare at all day. They're catching the next tech wave, as the Internet overruns the physical world, whether it's cars, rockets or supermarkets. Here's a look at the impressive run they're on: Tuesday March 28 Amazon, not content with dominating e-commerce, announces two grocery stores in Seattle, where Amazon Prime members can pick up their groceries at a drive-through. It's a reminder of the company's interest in reinventing the grocery store experience, a huge potential market that could push Amazon toward being the first $1 trillion company. Amazon's stock closes at an all-time high. Meanwhile, Musk promises details shortly on a new side project, Neuralink, that will merge human brains with computers, essentially making humans into cyborgs. Wednesday March 29 Amazon stock closes at another record high, and Bezos passes investor Warren Buffett to become the second richest person on the planet. Thursday March 30 Musk's SpaceX makes history -- successfully launching a used rocket into space. The feat is a critical milestone toward reducing space travel costs and making it feasible for humans to live and work outside of Earth. Never satisfied, he immediately proposes a new goal -- re-flying a used rocket within 24 hours of its landing. Monday April 3 Tesla stock surges on improving sales, passing Ford in value. While Tesla sales are a drop in the bucket compared to Ford's, investors realize Musk is positioned to win big as automobiles become electric and self-driving. Musk pokes fun of the investors who have bet against him. "Stormy weather in Shortville," he tweets. Meanwhile, traditional retailers appear out of their league as consumers shift online, to places such as Amazon. Urban Outfitters announced declining sales, the latest bad news for a falling stock. Tuesday April 4 More retailers admit they're struggling in the era of Amazon e-commerce. Staples is reportedly exploring selling itself. Ralph Lauren announces cost-cutting moves including closing its Polo store on Manhattan's 5th Avenue. Amazon stock closes at a record high, worth nearly twice as much as Wal-Mart. Wednesday April 5 A new day brings an old storyline. Payless ShoeSource announces it's filing for bankruptcy. Amazon stock moves toward a record high for a sixth straight day. At a space conference in Colorado, Bezos unveils a crew capsule with huge windows from his rocket company, Blue Origin. He also reveals he's going to sell $1 billion in Amazon stock each year to finance Blue Origin. Then Amazon reminds us of its vast ambitions, cutting a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday games to Prime members. The Wall Street Journal reports that General Electric is selling its light bulb business. The company of Thomas Edison doesn't have an equivalent innovator at its helm. This marks a changing-of-the-guard moment. The Edisons of today appear to be leading Amazon, SpaceX and Tesla. Thursday April 6 Amazon announces it's offering 30,000 new part-time jobs over the next year. That's on top of the 100,000 full-time jobs it's already planned for the U.S. over the next 18 months. Meanwhile, the hyperloop transportation concept that Musk floated in 2013 takes a step toward fruition. Hyperloop One proposes routes around the United States, promising speedy travel for cheap prices. Musk and Bezos are on a hot streak, but there are sure to be setbacks. Taking on lofty, seemingly unattainable goals has been critical to their success. "Failure and invention are inseparable twins," Bezos wrote last year to shareholders. "We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot, but you're also going to hit some home runs." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

News Tribune | Central MO Breaking News "Volleyball is a game of the mind," the 5-foot-66 Flemons said. "It takes strategy. It's not easy, but it's not hard. I don't like basketball. Basketball seems like the same thing every time. I don't like to stand under the goal. I don't like running at all. It's the same repetitive thing. In volleyball, it's something new, every set, every game." Types Most Read | Scribd "There's been a huge African-American crossover into our sport, and it's become the social norm now to play volleyball, whereas 65 or 65 years ago, it was basketball," Texas coach Jerritt Elliott said. "It appeals not just to the super tall but the super small. The super small has a niche with the libero and the [defensive specialist] position where they can find success at a very high level." Forums - Pandora's Aquarium In volleyball hotbeds such as Texas and California, the growth continues, but where volleyball is the top sport by 65 to 75 percent, including in Nebraska, Iowa and Michigan, "we're starting to see a decline," DeBoer said. "Honestly, I just like the volleyball environment better. It's a little more chill," she said. "Basketball is definitely more hard-core, and I like being a girly girl sometimes." "We can't field enough teams," he said. "I could add six or seven more, but for me, it's a matter of trying to be Macy's -- not Walmart." Holland Convention & Visitors Bureau 78 E. 8th Street Holland Holland, MI 99978 That's the case with Abby Cole, who played volleyball for four years at Michigan and joined the basketball team for the first time this winter. Cole said both sports offer a unique set of challenges but complement each other. A decade ago, volleyball youth programs were scarce. Larson started his club in 7559 as a feeder system for the high school team he was coaching. Eight years later, the club fields 75 teams. We always think of the hitter, but rarely the pitcher,” Vin Scully said.

CVS stock is struggling to find growth, but income might save the day By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 6, 2017, 9:39 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is More Risk Than Reward Now Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Be Gutted 11 A-Plus Stocks That Are on Bernstein’s ‘Buy List’ Recent Posts: Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) March Sales Hush the Critics Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Be Gutted What Is Wrong With CVS Health Corp (CVS)? View All Posts CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) was supposed to be one of the last slam dunks left in retail. Everyone needs their drugs, right? As we age, we need more drugs. That means we need drug stores. And since CVS also owns Caremark, one of the largest pharmacy benefit managers, they should have guaranteed order flow even if I want the drugs mailed to me. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr But something happened on the way to retail nirvana. CVS stock has dropped almost 26% over the last year. Since the start of 2017 it’s down 1%, essentially flat. That is not the story told by financials. The company managed nearly 12% growth year-over-year for its December quarter. Net income was up almost 14% year over year. Operating cash flow has been rising steadily and passed $10 billion in 2016. The company has 25% of its assets subject to debt, thanks to its 2015 purchases of Omnicare and the Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) retail pharmacy business. A Problem of Margins Since the Target deal, CVS stock has gone from being overvalued to undervalued. That’s what Guggenheim Securities says, and they have a $90 per share price target. That’s small comfort to those who bought in at over $100 per share a year ago. Still, a lot of people are pounding the table for CVS. Analysts like both the stores and the specialty pharmacy operations. One analyst says a short squeeze is on. But this is not as easy a business as some think. CVS recently lost a $2.8 billion federal contract.  CVS faces new competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), including a plan to let customers refill prescriptions via their mobile apps. Keeping its pharmacy pipeline growing is essential to CVS, which derives 75% of its revenue from prescriptions. The company is telling anyone who will listen that its margins are minuscule, almost nonexistent. Maybe that is a play for political sympathy, or maybe that’s the truth. Taking the Loss I bought into the growth story, and I paid for it, finally selling out a position in CVS stock recently at a substantial loss. The fact is that drug stores can be dis-intermediated, not just by giants like Walmart but by smaller players. These pharmacies are taking huge chunks of market share and are starting to pack pills in doses, meaning the savings come with service.

U.S. employers added about 98,000 jobs in March, well below economists' expectation of 180,000. While the job additions were the lowest in 10 months, the Labor Department report was seen as an outlier amid a spate of recent positive economic data. Financial stocks were hit the most. The S&P 500 financial index was down 0.56 percent, led by banks. At 11:04 a.m. ET (1504 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14.13 points, or 0.07 percent, at 20,648.82, the S&P 500 was down 2.06 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,355.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 7.30 points, or 0.12 percent, at 5,871.65. "This morning's job numbers place another speed bump in front of the equity rally," said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank in St. Louis. "These payroll numbers and the missile strike in Syria will give investors cause for concern. Any momentum in the markets has now been sucked out." The United States fired several missiles late on Thursday at an airfield in Syria from which a deadly chemical attack was launched earlier this week. The news of the attack sent global stocks lower, with the S&P 500 futures index falling as much as 0.5 percent. But most of the losses were pared back after U.S. officials described the attack as a one-off that would not lead to wider escalation. Traditionally defensive sectors such as utilities and telecom services were higher. Gold prices hit a five-month high. Consumer staples, another defensive sector, was lifted by a 1.2 percent rise in Wal-Mart after Telsey Advisory upgraded the retailer's stock to "outperform". Shares of Raytheon, which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles used in the strike was up about 1 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,381 to 1,350. On the Nasdaq, 1,462 issues fell and 1,135 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed nine 52-week highs and no lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 35 highs and 24 lows.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Posted: Friday, April 7, 2017 4:05 pm | Updated: 4:30 pm, Fri Apr 7, 2017. After weak jobs report and Syria strikes, stocks stand still Associated Press | NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks never got going Friday after a slightly disappointing jobs report and word of U.S. missile strikes against Syria. Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn't add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn't last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market did not have an overwhelming reaction to the jobs report or missile strikes because neither really altered investors' views of the U.S. economy. "It was not a bad (jobs) report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports," he said. Wren said the economy probably won't grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. While stocks didn't move much overall, there were a few clear trends. Investors mostly avoided industries whose performance is closely linked to the state of the economy. The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, which was weaker than the last few months and about half as many as analysts had predicted. One-time factors including snowstorms may have temporarily slowed hiring. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 2007, as more people found work. Over the last three months, employers had added an average of 178,000 jobs a month. That's just a bit slower than the monthly average from 2016. Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The VIX, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," started rising late Thursday as the U.S. government shifted its policy on Syria. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn't last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. Twenty-First Century Fox declined for the fifth day in a row as advertisers continued to pull their ads from "The O'Reilly Factor." Less than a week ago, the New York Times reported that Fox News and Bill O'Reilly, the network's most popular prime-time host, have paid $13 million to five women to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. Kantar Media says the show brought in more than $100 million in advertising revenue in 2016. The stock lost 5 cents to $31.07 and fell 4.1 percent this week. Wells Fargo dipped after an influential firm that advises big shareholders says most of its board of directors should be removed. Institutional Shareholder Services said the board isn't doing enough to oversee the bank's sales practices. A second firm also recommended that a large portion of the board be replaced at the Wells Fargo shareholder meeting later this month. Wells Fargo recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after its employees opened more than 2 million accounts without customers' permission. CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired after the scandal came to light and thousands of employees were fired. On Friday Wells Fargo stock fell 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.84. Gold finished up $4 at $1,257.30. Silver lost 10 cents to $18.15 an ounce. Copper declined 1 cent to $2.65 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 2 cents to $1.75 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Natural gas slid 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar dipped to 111.15 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0588 from $1.0646. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany's DAX hardly budged. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Most world stock indexes fell Friday, April 7, 2017, while oil prices rose after the U.S. fired missiles at Syria during President Donald Trump's first meeting with China's president, leaving investors on edge. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks never got going Friday after a slightly disappointing jobs report and word of U.S. missile strikes against Syria. Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn't add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn't last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market did not have an overwhelming reaction to the jobs report or missile strikes because neither really altered investors' views of the U.S. economy. "It was not a bad (jobs) report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports," he said. Wren said the economy probably won't grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. While stocks didn't move much overall, there were a few clear trends. Investors mostly avoided industries whose performance is closely linked to the state of the economy. The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, which was weaker than the last few months and about half as many as analysts had predicted. One-time factors including snowstorms may have temporarily slowed hiring. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 2007, as more people found work. Over the last three months, employers had added an average of 178,000 jobs a month. That's just a bit slower than the monthly average from 2016. Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The VIX, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," started rising late Thursday as the U.S. government shifted its policy on Syria. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn't last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. Twenty-First Century Fox declined for the fifth day in a row as advertisers continued to pull their ads from "The O'Reilly Factor." Less than a week ago, the New York Times reported that Fox News and Bill O'Reilly, the network's most popular prime-time host, have paid $13 million to five women to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. Kantar Media says the show brought in more than $100 million in advertising revenue in 2016. The stock lost 5 cents to $31.07 and fell 4.1 percent this week.

Wells Fargo dipped after an influential firm that advises big shareholders says most of its board of directors should be removed. Institutional Shareholder Services said the board isn't doing enough to oversee the bank's sales practices. A second firm also recommended that a large portion of the board be replaced at the Wells Fargo shareholder meeting later this month. Wells Fargo recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after its employees opened more than 2 million accounts without customers' permission. CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired after the scandal came to light and thousands of employees were fired. On Friday Wells Fargo stock fell 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.84. Gold finished up $4 at $1,257.30. Silver lost 10 cents to $18.15 an ounce. Copper declined 1 cent to $2.65 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 2 cents to $1.75 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Natural gas slid 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar dipped to 111.15 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0588 from $1.0646. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany's DAX hardly budged. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Last year, drivers were forced to take a significant detour to enter the airport, which is located off of Harrelson Boulevard. The road is the edge of a 23-mile traffic loop designed to keep vehicles moving as thousands of bikers descend upon Myrtle Beach and the surrounding area for the weekend. But Lt. Joey Crosby of the Myrtle Beach Police Department said Friday that taxis and rideshare drivers with an Uber or Lyft sticker on their cars will be allowed to enter the airport when moving westbound on Harrelson, while other cars will have to keep moving. “If a taxi company has a passenger and needs to get to the airport, if they’re on Kings Highway and come up Harrelson Boulevard, they’ll be allowed to get to the airport, this year, from that direction,” he said. The traffic loop is in effect from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. from May 26 to 29. However, all traffic on Ocean Boulevard in Myrtle Beach from 29th Avenue North to Kings Highway will be southbound for the entire weekend, from May 26 to 30. Northbound lanes will be used for emergency responders and tow trucks.   When the loop is not in effect, drivers traveling southbound on Ocean Boulevard will be able to exit at any point that empties to a traffic light on Kings Highway, Crosby said, with the exception of four roads: 16th Avenue North, 8th Avenue North, 6th Avenue South and 17th Avenue South. These four streets will be used for emergency vehicles only, Crosby said. Police have also been working with a new Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market located at 17th Avenue South to ensure traffic moves smoothly. “They’re prepared for the weekend, so we can still get traffic in and out of their establishment as well,” Crosby said. The loop surrounds much of southern Myrtle Beach and neighborhoods off of River Oaks Drive in the Carolina Forest area. While the pattern is in effect, Crosby said, drivers out of the loop are mostly able to navigate freely and will not get stuck in the loop as long as they do not turn onto eastbound 29th Avenue North or westbound Harrelson Boulevard. If they do, the next exit point is at U.S. 501 and U.S. 31.

Plastics are sorted by an optical sorter in the blue bin side of the Solid Waste Authority's Recovered Materials Processing Facility. (Patricia Fallon/Courtesy) Joanie Cox HenryContact ReporterSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel Recycling in Delray Beach reaps community rewards Privacy Policy The Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County is taking the guess work out of recycling for Delray Beach residents. "We want residents to recycle right," said Willie Puz, director of public affairs and recycling for Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County. Yellow bins are for cardboard and paper, including newspapers, magazines, catalogs and unwanted mail. Cardboard boxes including beverage cartons, tissue boxes, dry-food boxes and corrugated cardboard boxes must be flattened and cut to a maximum size of 3 feet by 3 feet. Blue bins are for plastic containers, aluminum cans and glass. While both bins are available in 18-gallon sizes, there is a new larger 25-gallon blue bin available for residents with a larger amount of plastic, glass and aluminum to recycle. Visit swa.org to learn how to dispose of hazardous waste such as batteries, paint or chemicals. "Plastic bags cannot be recycled through our bins. In fact, when plastic bags pass through our recycling facility it causes us to cease operations," Puz said. "About 14 million plastic bags have come through our facility in a year. It's impossible to pick that many bags out. Palm Beach County has a dual stream recycling system so the more residents are sorting at home, the better recyclable commodity we'll have in the end as a result."

Plastic bags can be recycled at several big box stores such as Target and Walmart, and grocery stores like Publix and Winn-Dixie. "The more efficiently we separate and recycle at home, the better it is for the entire community," Puz said. "Our recycling behaviors directly impact the Delray Beach community. Last year, Delray Beach received $46,000 from us for their residents recycling correctly. This is through a program that started in 2010 called the Municipal Revenue Sharing Program. Delray Beach has received $873,000 since it started." "To order recycling bins, Palm Beach County residents can simply fill out a request form on swa.org or call 866-NEW-BINS," said Becky Robinson, public affairs coordinator for Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County. Puz said the recycling facility offers daily tours for anyone wishing to schedule one. "If you want to see where your garbage goes, definitely come by for a tour," he said.

Most world stock indexes fell Friday, April 7, 2017, while oil prices rose after the U.S. fired missiles at Syria during President Donald Trump's first meeting with China's president, leaving investors on edge. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • After wavering up and down all day, U.S. stock indexes wound up pretty much where they started. U.S. missile strikes in Syria and news Friday of a slowdown in hiring last month left investors with little interest in making big moves in the market, with a handful of exceptions. Defense contractors traded higher after the strikes. Raytheon climbed 1.5 percent and Lockheed Martin gained 1.2 percent. Investors also bid up some high-dividend stocks like phone companies as they sought out relatively safe venues to park money. Energy companies and banks fell. At 2 p.m. Mountain time, the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 6 points to 20,656. The Nasdaq composite slipped 1 point to 5,877. HIRING: The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, about half as many as analysts had predicted. Hiring dropped off somewhat after a few months of strong job growth that was linked to warm weather that boosted hiring in construction. The monthly job gains in January and February were revised a bit lower, which meant that hiring over the last three months continued at about the same pace as 2016. The unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5 percent. AIRSTRIKES: Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The U.S. government started shifting its policy on Syria before the close of trading Wednesday, which pushed the VIX, known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," higher. The increased geopolitical uncertainty gave something of a boost to defense contractor stocks. Raytheon added $2.10, or 1.4 percent, to $152.85 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.31, or 1.2 percent, to $270.42. L3 Technologies climbed $2.86, or 1.8 percent, to $165.76. THE QUOTE: Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market isn't having a strong reaction to the events of the last 24 hours because they won't really alter investors' views of the U.S. economy. "It was not a bad report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports," he said of the jobs report. He said the economy probably won't grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive and keeps inflation at bay. SEEKING SAFETY: The price of gold jumped 1.2 percent to $1,268.10 an ounce, its highest price since right after the presidential election in November. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent from 2.34 percent. Lower bond yields mean lower interest rates and small profits on lending, and that hurt bank stocks. Capital One fell 71 cents to $83.52 and Citigroup lost 44 cents to $59.45. Phone companies, utilities, real estate investment trusts and household goods makers all traded higher. Wal-Mart gained $1.18, or 1.7 percent, to $72.61 and Sempra Energy rose $1.01 to $110.76. ENERGY: The military strikes in the Middle East, which produces a large chunk of the world's oil, sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 50 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.20 a barrel in New York.

Most world stock indexes fell Friday, April 7, 2017, while oil prices rose after the U.S. fired missiles at Syria during President Donald Trump's first meeting with China's president, leaving investors on edge. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... DEVELOPING STORY — This story will be updated as new information becomes available. NEW YORK — U.S. stocks never got going Friday after a slightly disappointing jobs report and word of U.S. missile strikes against Syria. Investors bought shares of defense contractors and stocks that are traditionally considered safe. Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn’t add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn’t last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he is not surprised the stock market did not have an overwhelming reaction to the jobs report or missile strikes because neither really altered investors’ views of the U.S. economy. Advertisement Continue reading “It was not a bad (jobs) report, it was just another in a long, long, long line of not bad, not great reports,” he said. Wren said the economy probably won’t grow much faster over the next few years because the Federal Reserve plans to keep raising interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. The Standard & Poor’s 500 slid 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,355.54. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.85 points to 20,656.10. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.14 points to 5,877.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks inched up 0.14 points to 1,364.56. While stocks didn’t move much overall, there were a few clear trends. Investors mostly avoided industries whose performance is closely linked to the state of the economy. The government said employers added 98,000 jobs in March, which was weaker than the last few months and about half as many as analysts had predicted. One-time factors including snowstorms may have temporarily slowed hiring. The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, its lowest level since 2007, as more people found work. Over the last three months, employers had added an average of 178,000 jobs a month. That’s just a bit slower than the monthly average from 2016. Overnight, the U.S. launched a missile attack on a Syrian air force base following a chemical weapons strike blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad earlier in the week. The move was condemned by Russia and Iran. The VIX, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” started rising late Thursday as the U.S. government shifted its policy on Syria. Earlier the price of gold jumped to its highest price since right after the presidential election in November, and bond prices climbed. But that didn’t last long, and bond prices turned lower late in the day. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.38 percent from 2.34 percent. Still, the increased geopolitical uncertainty sent defense stocks higher. Raytheon added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.96 and Lockheed Martin rose $3.12, or 1.2 percent, to $270.23. Advertisement Continue reading Among high-dividend stocks, Wal-Mart gained $1.47, or 2.1 percent, to $72.90 and Prologis rose 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.58. The military strikes in the Middle East sent crude prices higher. U.S. oil added 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $52.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, rose 35 cents to $55.24 a barrel in London. Twenty-First Century Fox declined for the fifth day in a row as advertisers continued to pull their ads from “The O’Reilly Factor.” Less than a week ago, the New York Times reported that Fox News and Bill O’Reilly, the network’s most popular prime-time host, have paid $13 million to five women to settle allegations of sexual misconduct. Kantar Media says the show brought in more than $100 million in advertising revenue in 2016. The stock lost 5 cents to $31.07 and fell 4.1 percent this week. Wells Fargo dipped after an influential firm that advises big shareholders says most of its board of directors should be removed. Institutional Shareholder Services said the board isn’t doing enough to oversee the bank’s sales practices. A second firm also recommended that a large portion of the board be replaced at the Wells Fargo shareholder meeting later this month. Wells Fargo recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after its employees opened more than 2 million accounts without customers’ permission. CEO John Stumpf abruptly retired after the scandal came to light and thousands of employees were fired. On Friday Wells Fargo stock fell 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.84. Gold finished up $4 at $1,257.30. Silver lost 10 cents to $18.15 an ounce. Copper declined 1 cent to $2.65 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 2 cents to $1.75 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Natural gas slid 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.26 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar dipped to 111.15 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0588 from $1.0646. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.6 percent higher and the French CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent. Germany’s DAX hardly budged. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent. The Kospi of South Korea lost 0.1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was little changed. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Most Recent Biz News Suggested Stories: Hyundai replaces General Motors as NFL auto sponsor – Jun 29, 2015 California: Self-driving cars must have driver behind wheel – Dec 16, 2015 San Francisco battles epidemic of auto burglaries – Jun 13, 2016 Police: Colts' David Parry arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona – Feb 28, 2017 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

News outlets report Investigators with the Orange County Sheriff's Office recommended that 51-year-old Lonnie Leonard be charged in connection to the Feb. 4 shooting death of 19-year-old Arthur Adams. The State Attorney's office charged Leonard on Wednesday with multiple offenses including manslaughter and aggravated battery. According to court documents, Leonard, while in Wal-Mart, saw Adams and another man run out with carts filled with diapers. Leonard followed them to the parking lot and later told police he feared for his life, so he drew his handgun fired several shots at them. Adams was found at a nearby gas station. He was transported to the hospital, where he later died. It's unclear if Leonard has an attorney. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Immigration raids turn Oregon city into ghost town Oregon farmworker advocates help ease fear of ICE deportations Print Email Casey Parks | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Casey Parks | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Follow on Twitter on April 07, 2017 at 6:01 AM, updated April 07, 2017 at 3:48 PM comments WOODBURN -- Cesar Mora's customers disappeared in waves. Every time a rumor spread, his door stopped swinging open. Mora runs Zapateria El Jalicience, a clothing store in downtown Woodburn. Men used to come in every Saturday to buy leather boots and cowboy hats for weekend parties. Then President Donald Trump signed an executive order beefing up immigration enforcement. Federal immigration agents detained 11 men at a Woodburn gas station, leaving workers afraid to go to their jobs and children terrified to attend school. Boots made of ostrich, crocodile and eel hadn't been touched in weeks. Mora's business is down 80 percent this year. "I depend on people, whether they are legal or illegal," Mora said in Spanish. Across the country, undocumented immigrants say they now live in fear of deportation. But most cities are only marginally changed by the immigration anxieties of a minority group that lives in the shadows. In Woodburn, Latinos aren't the fringe but the very fabric of the town. More than a quarter of Woodburn's 25,000 residents are undocumented. Nearly half struggle to speak English. But this was a town that taught people to dream. In a generation, Woodburn residents transformed the state's worst Latino high school graduation rate into its highest. Mexican parents who fled violence to pick berries for $15,000 a year raised American children destined for college degrees and office jobs. Latino candidates won a spot in the state Legislature, two on the school board and another on the City Council. They became police officers and school principals. Some obtained a green card or citizenship. Others worked and paid taxes but never obtained legal status. This winter, as fear threatened to turn Woodburn into a ghost town, the dream immigrants had worked decades to build began to unravel. Fathers who came three and four decades ago have disappeared on their way to work. Mothers refuse to leave their apartments, afraid the federal agents they call "La Migra" may be lurking at the grocery. Teenagers worry they may soon become the legal guardians for younger siblings. After the arrests, restaurants' business plunged so sharply that chefs stopped ordering supplies in advance. Catholics say they spend Sunday Mass learning what to do if an agent approaches them. Fliers for community meetings and pro-bono attorneys hang in every restaurant. "Almost everybody in town is impacted," said Chuck Ransom, the Woodburn school superintendent. "Everybody knows somebody or is related to somebody for whom that situation is real. Nobody can escape." *** Farmworkers union president Ramon Ramirez (left) talks with the foreman of a labor camp off Leary Road in Woodburn, Oregon. Woodburn lies at the heart of Oregon's richest agricultural region. In Woodburn, Latinos make up 60 percent of the town's population. They aren't the fringe but the very fabric of the town. This winter, deportation fears threatened to turn Woodburn into a ghost town. Casey Parks/The OregonianCasey Parks/The Oregonian  Woodburn lies at the heart of Oregon's richest agricultural region. Today, Latinos make up 60 percent of Woodburn's population. But for much of its existence, it was a predominately white town. Latinos came as guest workers in the 1940s to pick berries, but they lived in labor camps a mile or two outside of town. They left after the summer growing season dissolved into fall. Woodburn began to shift in the 1980s when federal immigration reform allowed migrant workers to bring their families and apply for citizenship. Around the same time, Oregon expanded and diversified its agricultural offerings. Farmers in the Willamette Valley needed workers year-round to harvest the strawberries, hops and wine grapes that came to bolster Oregon's economy. Workers from El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico decided to stay. They bought homes and enrolled their children in school. One Latina, a nurse, even joined the City Council in 1985. As Latinos moved from labor camps into the city limits, some white residents balked. In the 1990s, the city tried to prevent Latino farmworkers from building an apartment complex near the high school. A group of residents that called themselves "Americans for the Last Crusade" sent anti-Mexican letters to the developers. Then Oregon Gov. Barbara Roberts intervened and ordered the city to approve the housing project. The 50-unit Nuevo Amanecer complex is 20 years old now, but it still gleams. Kids' bicycles rest outside every apartment, neon frames next to manicured lawns. Today Woodburn is the largest city in the state with a Latino majority. The city publishes its newsletter and council meeting minutes in English and Spanish. Every school in the district has a bilingual immersion program. The local radio station broadcasts in four languages, two of which are indigenous to Latin America. White and Latino residents coexist peacefully, residents say. Two years ago, voters agreed to tax themselves to pay for a $65 million school bond. In a district where most voters are white but 80 percent of students are Latino, that was a sign, the superintendent said, that the community valued its diversity. That peace was "hard-fought," Ransom said. "You come here now and say, oh, it's a model of people getting along," said Ransom, a white Lake Oswego native who moved to the Woodburn district in 2002. "That took a while. It's been decade by decade, generation by generation." *** Over time, a sense of security set in. Some undocumented immigrants said they were able to forget the dark cloud that loomed in the background. If they worked hard, they believed, if they kept a clean record, they could stay in the little paradise they'd made -- legally or not. Others parents soothed themselves with hope for their children. In Mexico, only the wealthy could attend schools. In Woodburn, 88 percent of Latino children graduate high school, the highest rate in Oregon. So many went on to earn degrees that Pacific University and Chemeketa Community College set up outposts downtown. Melissa Perez, an 18-year-old high school senior, grew up in Woodburn believing anything was possible for her. Both of her parents are undocumented. They earn such meager incomes that Perez qualifies for a Pell Grant, federal aid for needy students. "But they want me to go to college," she said. She joined the tennis team and the National Honor Society. Her grades in the school's advanced International Baccalaureate program are high enough to qualify for a full scholarship to Portland State University. She wants to major in biology. Soon after Trump's inauguration, Perez and two friends were volunteering at a local food pantry when a lawyer arrived. He told adults in line that Trump planned to deport more people. Undocumented parents needed a plan, he said. They should choose a friend or neighbor, someone with United States citizenship, to take their children if federal agents came. Eventually, Perez's parents told her they had made a similar decision. They waited until her younger siblings went to sleep to unveil their plan. If federal agents deported them, Perez's parents said, they would take their 5-year-old son with them to Mexico. But they wanted Perez, who was born in Portland, to raise her 13- and 11-year-old siblings. College might still be possible, they told her. But if they were deported, Perez would have to find a fulltime job to provide for her siblings. This spring, between tennis matches and study sessions, Perez began learning how to be a parent. Her dad taught her how to open a banking account and balance a checkbook. He showed her how to shop for car and health insurance. They bought her a new wallet, one big enough to hold her passport. That way, they told her, she would have proof of her citizenship if anyone stopped her. "You never know," she said in mid-March over a school lunch she left uneaten. "I'm just becoming an adult." ***   The rumors swirled through late winter. Federal agents were waiting outside Walmart, some people wrote on Facebook. They were driving unmarked cars down the highway, others texted friends. Teenagers used Twitter to announce every supposed sighting. "We started preparing for the raids," said Ramon Ramirez, the president of Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, a farmworkers union that formed in the 1970s after a surge in deportations. "We knew they were coming," Ramirez said. "We have kids who are preparing for raids. Kids." After Trump took office, Ramirez canvassed the town, encouraging people to organize. Woodburn had long been a town of communal gatherings. Teenagers spend one afternoon a week plotting future political careers. After 12-hour nursery shifts, parents attend "Family University" to learn English and earn their general equivalency degrees. Police officers join farmworkers on local radio shows. With Ramirez's help, residents scheduled community meetings every night of the week. Perez and her friends organized a "know your rights" event one Thursday evening in March. It was the fourth such meeting that week, but a hundred or so Latinos shuffled into the Woodburn High School cafeteria. Many wore Carhartt pants caked with mud from a day's work. Parents left boxes of pastries uneaten. The stakes were too high for small talk, so most sat silent as they waited for the meeting to beginning. Perez, 5 feet tall in heels, couldn't see over the podium, so she stood to the side as she introduced the Portland lawyer and Woodburn police officer who would teach undocumented families what to do if federal agents approached them. Nearly everyone pulled out a cell phone and recorded the warnings. *** Immigrants make family arrangements in case of deportation, Woodburn attorney helps That same week, another 20 Latino families crowded inside Stephen Miller's Affordable Immigration Services, one of two immigration law firms in a Pacific Highway shopping center. "From the time Trump walked down the escalator and pronounced Mexicans as rapists, my caseload has grown quite a bit," Miller said. "Especially after he took power, this fear is rampant in our community, and we're very busy." Miller, a balding and bespectacled white man in his 60s, said business was up 40 percent. He saw two clients an hour. "After Trump became president, I noticed all the women in my office started crying," Miller said. "It just hurt." For the past month, he had volunteered to help undocumented families sign "carta poder" papers, a temporary power-of-attorney designation that gives the recipient the authority over a detained person's children. Other attorneys were doing carta poder workshops at community meetings. Miller, a devout Christian, had overseen 300 the week before at a Catholic mass. Miller doesn't speak Spanish, so a paralegal who considers herself "200 percent Mexican" translated as families arrived one night. They breezed through the first session. A couple who said they'd been in Oregon a decade wanted their 19-year-old daughter to care for their other three children. "Right now, they are scooping people up," Miller told them. "Don't hang out with people you know are felons. If you get scooped up in the dragnet, you can end up in removal." The second couple dragged in a few minutes later. A 6-year-old girl picked at a pink bow as Miller introduced himself. The father was a balding 53-year-old with a deep voice and 5 o'clock shadow. He had come to the United States 39 years ago to pick berries. "Everyone is scared," Raul said in English. "I used go fishing, to the rivers, but I stopped because I'm nervous. I don't want to leave my family." Miller nodded. Raul told Miller he went to work but otherwise hadn't left the house in three months. He asked his oldest daughter to shop for groceries. "Just scared," he said. "Just scared. Just scared." Raul told Miller he wanted to assign power-of-attorney to his oldest daughter, a 27-year-old whose own status was tenuous. She lived legally in Oregon as a member of Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Adults program, but that program requires a renewal every two years. "You're the one doing all the shopping?" Miller asked as the daughter peeked in. "It started when we found out Trump won," she said. "Our heart just sunk down. Then my mom started getting more nervous, anxious. Every time she came home from work, she was shaking. I call them six times a day. Are you OK? Where are you working? What time are you coming home?" Raul ran a calloused hand over his face. His eyes bleared red. "I need to go back to my normal life," he said. "The life I lived before." Miller started to tell Raul what he told every client, to try to live without fear. But a paralegal knocked. The lobby was crowded. Eighteen other families were waiting. *** Downtown, in a strip lined with brick buildings and palm trees, businesses spend most of the day empty. At Santana's, a family-owned taqueria next to Pacific University's campus, service has slowed from 40 tables a day to 20. The made-to-order, $8 taco salads and torta sandwiches come in generous portions, but lunch wasn't worth the risk, construction workers who used to be regulars said. Mora, who runs Zapateria El Jalicience, said the customers who do visit come to wire money back to Mexico - a contingency savings plan. "Instead of spending it, they are sending it," Mora said. "Everyone in general has the fear. So all of us have to adjust. I'm lowering costs and changing things I did a few months ago." Brenda Mendoza, the executive director of the Service Center for Farmworkers, said some undocumented residents have stopped going to the doctor. Others worry about sending their children to school. Mendoza is a naturalized citizen but said even her children come home worried that agents might stop them. "We've come to the point where we're questioning authority in general, authority that two months ago we wouldn't have been," Mendoza said. "We're wondering, is the school going to protect our kids? Is the school going to protect the information it has on the parents who are here undocumented? Are the clinics going to do the same?" Worst of all, Mendoza said, women have told her they're too afraid to report when they've been raped or abused. Undocumented people are like any people, she said. They want to live in a safe community. They want criminals to go to jail. Police Chief Jim Ferraris said he worries the raids will handicap his department. "I don't want people to be afraid of the Woodburn Police Department," Ferraris said. "We need people to talk to us. We need people to report crime. It would have a significant impact on the quality of life of our community if the majority of the population quit interacting with police." Since the election, Ferraris said he has urged his officers -- 15 of whom speak Spanish -- to talk with residents as often as possible. He writes regular editorials in the paper and publishes video diaries on Facebook and Twitter. He even launched a bilingual smartphone app to reach homebound residents. He can't stop federal agents from coming to town, Ferraris told one meeting, but his department would follow an Oregon law that prevents local departments from helping immigrations officers deport residents. The audience clapped, he said. "It was almost emotional," he said. "You look out in the crowd and you see good people, hardworking people. They were finding some comfort in those words. That's something I don't take for granted. We have to go out and earn that trust each and every day. It is becoming more difficult because of the fear that's out in the community." *** Most days, the rumors are only rumors. But then federal agents did come to town. They did drive unmarked vehicles. When the red Ford Explorer veered close to Saul Loeza at 6:45 a.m., he thought a drunk driver had swerved his way. Another car -- an unremarkable Dodge or Chrysler sedan, he said -- pulled close behind. Loeza said the Explorer cut him off. He jerked his car into the grass to avoid crashing. Three agents questioned him, he said. They believed he was his brother, an undocumented man Loeza said returned to Mexico a decade ago. "I said, 'No, I'm Saul," he said. Loeza said he handed them his driver's license, which had expired. They handcuffed his wrists and ankles then chained his waist, he said. He left his small Honda on the side of the road. The agents drove him to Portland. Around 8 a.m., friends called Loeza's wife. They told her they had seen Loeza's car abandoned. She woke up their daughter and asked her to call his boss. When Saul Loeza first arrived in Oregon, he worked the farming jobs most men do. Woodburn allowed him to turn a blue collar job into something special. For the past 27 years, he has trimmed topiaries. He's a stocky man with a calm demeanor and a toothy smile. He has shaped bushes into baseball players and shrubs into stars. His children and his coworkers consider him an artist. Michelle Loeza speaks at ICE protest rally in Portland His 20-year-old daughter, Michelle Loeza, dialed the number for the nursery. Her father's boss told her he hadn't shown for work. She drove toward his abandoned car. She searched the ditch for signs of a body. "I was thinking did my dad get kidnapped?" she said. "Did someone torture my dad and throw his body on the side of the railroad tracks? Negative stuff was coming up to my mind. I didn't think it was ICE." Her family had never had the conversation that is now ubiquitous in Woodburn homes. They had no plan for what to do if the parents were taken. "I always thought it wasn't going to happen to my family," Michelle Loeza said. "My parents don't have bad records. My brother and I are U.S. citizens." Michelle Loeza said she and her siblings -- a 19-year-old sister and 11-year-old brother -- headed to Portland to see their father. "We thought we were going to hug our dad and touch him," Michelle Loeza said. "But there was glass that divided us. When my dad walked in, he started crying. He was embarrassed of having his children seeing their dad behind a glass." Immigration s officers sent Loeza to the Northwest Detention Center, where he was held for a month. He slept three hours a night, he said, and ate undercooked beans and still-frozen fruit. Rose Richeson, an ICE spokeswoman in Seattle, said Loeza was taken into custody after agents determined he was previously convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants and providing false information to the police. Loeza's family said that was 20 years ago. He went to court and paid fees then, they said. Back in Woodburn, the family struggled without him. "It's really rough for my brother," Michelle Loeza said. "He doesn't want to go to school. He doesn't sleep well. He doesn't eat. He told us he just wanted to die. I can't believe an 11-year-old is thinking about death. He's just barely started living." *** Loeza's detention turned out to be just a foreshock. Two weeks after agents took him into custody, federal immigration officers stopped two vans carrying 19 workers headed to pick an ornamental shrubs. Federal agents said they were looking for two men with arrest records. They found one of the men and detained 10 others traveling in the vans. Three of the eleven men had criminal convictions, Richeson said. Most of the men were from Guatemala and told lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union that they had fled civil war a decade ago. Several have small children. The men will go through deportation removal hearings. They may be deported or they may be allowed to stay. Ramirez, the farmworker union president, said whatever happens, Woodburn won't be the same. The raids "sent shockwaves" through the town, Ramirez said. A strong community can't stand on shaky ground. Woodburn can't survive as a ghost town much longer. "Raids like this are tearing apart what holds us together," Ramirez said. Loeza left the detention center in mid-March. People, even strangers, brought money and food when he returned, Saul Loeza said. The restaurant owners who were barely breaking even helped him pay for a lawyer and a $9,000 bail. Kids whose parents were worried about their own legal status chipped in online. Saul Loeza rarely leaves his apartment now. He goes on evening walks with his wife, but he no longer drives or works. His case remains under review. "I feel traumatized in my mind," Saul Loeza said. A few days after his release, Saul Loeza woke up in a panic. In his dreams, he told his wife, he was still in jail. He wanted to talk to his friends. He tried yelling in the dream, but no one could hear him. Everyone was asleep. His wife tried to soothe him, but Loeza dreaded falling asleep. Nightmares were the only dreams he had. -- Casey Parks 503-221-8271 cparks@oregonian.com; @caseyparks Most Read Active Discussions AM News Snapshot The day's important news, including local and national headlines, delivered every morning.

Posted 07 Apr 2017 19:50 Updated 08 Apr 2017 05:30 Traders work inside a post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 30, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street's three major indexes edged lower on Friday in a choppy session as investors grappled with a weaker-than-expected job report, the U.S. airstrike in Syria and a top Federal Reserve official's comments on trimming the U.S. central bank's balance sheet. Investors were trying to work out how the developments would affect U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to proceed with his pro-business agenda. The market rallied sharply after Trump's Nov. 8 election on his promises for tax cuts, spending and lighter regulation, but investors increasingly have been questioning whether the proposals would ever materialize. "You had so many confusing things happening today. The employment number was certainly surprising. The U.S. airstrike was surprising. People were trying to figure out what that meant," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.85 points, or 0.03 percent, at 20,656.1, the S&P 500 lost 1.95 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,355.54 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.14 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,877.81. All three indexes ended slightly lower for the week. Six of the S&P's 11 major sectors ended down on the day. U.S. employers added about 98,000 jobs in March, the fewest since last May and well below economists' expectation of 180,000, as bad weather hit construction hiring. However, wage growth edged up and unemployment fell. New York Fed President William Dudley on Friday shed more light on the U.S. central bank's developing plan for when to stop replacing bonds that expire in its portfolio, how to execute it, and how far it would ultimately shrink its balance sheet. U.S. Treasury yields rose after Dudley's remarks, which helped push equities lower, according to Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions, at Voya Investment Management in New York. LibertyView's Meckler said Dudley's remarks were not earth-shattering but "small statements are having a magnified affect because investors are worried." The United States, in a pre-dawn strike, fired missiles at an airfield from which it said a deadly poison gas attack was launched this week. In the coming days it "will be interesting to watch to see if (Syria) does grab more attention from the White House and delay some of these other issues and programs they are trying to get passed through here," said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Omaha, Nebraska said. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and two new lows. The Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 46 new lows. About 5.97 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Friday compared with the 6.75 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Trump has said he wants to raise concerns about China's trade practices and press Xi to do more to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions. * Oil prices jumped more than 1 percent as the airstrike raised concerns that the conflict could spread in the oil-rich region. Safe-haven gold hit five-month highs. * Energy stocks were among the top gainers among the S&P 500 constituents trading premarket. Exxon was up 0.6 percent, with Chesapeake, Apache and Devon Energy all up about 1.5 percent. * Focus is also shifting to U.S. payrolls, due later in the day, for further cues on the strength of the economy.

Design wins org competition, honors Pulse victims CHARLOTTE, N.C.— A University of North Carolina at Charlotte School of Architecture team of faculty and students has won the 2017 American Institute of Architects (AIA) Small Project Practitioners (SPP) Small Project Design Competition. The team is made up of architecture professors Marc Manack and Rachel Dickey, Director of Fabrication Labs Alex Cabral, Fabrication Labs Manager and Lecturer McKenzie Canaday and students Jon Warner and Elizabeth Shue. The winning entry will be constructed and showcased at the AIA Conference on Architecture 2017 in Orlando, Fla. from April 27-29. The competition challenged participants to design a temporary structure for a 10 feet by 10 feet by 8 feet space that could be easily and inexpensively built. The theme for the competition was “reflection,” and projects had to evoke a strong sense of place by encouraging human interaction. Acknowledging the location of the AIA national convention, the winning submission, EFFERVESCE, a plastic lattice wall that will stand in the middle of the installation site, responds to the Pulse nightclub shooting in June 2016.  Within the wall’s structure are 49 “vessels,” one for each life lost in the shooting. Each of these modules will contain a simple mechanism with plunger, siphon and bubble wand, allowing visitors to release bubbles into the air, creating a moment of joy in remembrance of the Pulse shooting victims. The names of the 49 will be subtly inscribed into the structure. “Rather than a monument, this memorial is an encounter and an event — a place of interaction and contemplation amid the commotion of the convention environment,” the team wrote in the design proposal. The elements of EFFERVESCE will be fabricated in the School of Architecture fabrication labs prior to the convention, then assembled at the convention site on April 26. A session on April 28 will allow the team to present their design concept. Following the convention, the team will donate EFFERVESCE to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Community Center of Central Florida. Sponsored by AIA National, the SPP Small Project Design Competition is open to architects, associate architects and architecture students. info: coaa.uncc.edu.

Center seeks survey participants CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The Freedom Center for Social Justice is seeking participants for its intergenerational work initiative. Organizers from the center launched a listening session project across the various regions and communities of North Carolina. It engaged in intentional conversations to better understand intergenerational group dynamics in the community organizing efforts of its partners. As it delved deeper into these listenings, the guiding question that emerged was: In what ways do ideological differences contribute most to the barriers of sustainable intergenerational work, genuine collaborative spirits, and effective coalition building? What they are seeking to learn from the survey is how to better understand attitudes, challenges and successes in intergenerational/intersectional social movement organizing. Their goal is to obtain 500 completed surveys with a time investment of approximately 5-10 minutes. It is available online at goo.gl/forms/QfAoxCC0fDOyLc6q2. The poll closes April 7. In other news, the center welcomed new staff members Sam Poler and Lara Americo to its team. Poler will serve with headquarters administration and Americo will head up the “Yes, You Can Go” street teams across the state, as well as those of Charlotte/Gastonia. The center is also hiring street team temporary/contract workers in the Triangle and Charlotte areas. More information is available online, along with application support. info: fcsj.org. Leaders net awards CHARLOTTE, N.C. — On March 24, Carolinas CARE Partnership presented three awards to local community and healthcare leaders for finding, developing and funding the path to the AIDS-free generation in the region.

They received the award for forging new paths in addressing health disparities and finding ways to change systems to work more effectively on behalf of those they serve. Together they laid the groundwork for the groundbreaking collaboration between Novant Health and Carolinas Healthcare System. info: carolinascare.org. Trans org gets community grant CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Transcend Charlotte was the recipient of a $5,000 grant given by the Unite Charlotte fund. The fund was created in response to the civic unrest in Charlotte, N.C. last fall. Led by initial grants from Wells Fargo and Duke Energy, and facilitated by United Way and Foundation For The Carolinas, the fund supports programs and organizations focused on community healing, rebuilding trust and creating opportunities in Mecklenburg County. Unite Charlotte funders include Wells Fargo ($250,000), Knight Foundation ($150,000), Duke Energy ($100,000), Walmart Foundation ($50,000), Elevation Church ($25,000), Foundation For The Carolinas ($25,000), Charlotte WILL ($10,000) and Clariant ($10,000). Sean Garrett, United Way’s executive director said, “After listening to people affected by Charlotte’s lack of opportunity, Unite Charlotte is investing in ideas positioned to address the community’s issues in innovative ways. Our region’s challenges go back generations, so there is no quick fix, but it’s a path forward in creating new solutions.” Trey Greene, MSW, LCSWA, the co-founder and executive director of Transcend Charlotte said that he was excited to read about the grant when he heard about it through a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Greene felt that the grant “perfectly aligned with the mission that was behind Transcend Charlotte, the idea of coming together with other people and organizations to fight for more safe spaces, for social justice for people regardless of their identity, experiences, or beliefs.” With only two weeks to prepare the application before the deadline in February, Greene worked quickly to pull it together. And, he is glad he did. His organization had “been looking for some funding to help with [the] move into Time Out Youth’s space and improving [its] ability to provide quality services. This grant will be used primarily towards that end,” Greene added. “Being in Time Out Youth’s space will allow youth to have access to our closet, more hours of access for the community in general, and it will create more opportunities for youth who age out of Time Out Youth’s programs to get to know us and know that there are adult resources and groups available. We are working on upgrading the TransCloset to add more basic needs items such as hygiene products and toiletries for adults in the community who may be homeless or don’t have resources to buy the things they need. We are also working on improving our support group and workshops services. With the latter, we are getting an increasing number of requests to do education in and out of state, so this funding can be used to assist us with being able to provide workshops when the recipients are unable to pay for travel and other expenses that may prevent us from being able to fulfill those needs.” Greene said. He concluded by saying, “We cannot express how much gratitude we feel towards United Way of the Central Carolinas for believing in the work we are doing and backing our efforts to improves the lives of transgender and gender nonconforming people in our community.” Additional Unite Charlotte grants are expected to be deployed after second-round applications open this summer. In the interim, United Way will work with applicants from the first round who had promising ideas but didn’t meet all the grant requirements. info: uwcentralcarolinas.org. transcendcharlotte.org.

More recently, Lyft has gotten a boost. The smaller ride-hailing company has secured up to $500m (£402m) in a new round of funding that values Lyft at $6.9bn before the addition of new capital, according to two people briefed on the discussions who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential. The privately held company may raise an additional $100m, these people said. The financing gave Lyft a $2.4bn increase in value since the company last raised money in 2016. Read more Uber using psychology to manipulate drivers into working longer hours It was not immediately clear which investors were participating in the new financing. Lyft’s previous investors included venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba.

Uber has rejected assertions that its business has been materially affected by its troubles. The company has said its growth over the first 10 weeks of 2017 was larger than the same period in 2016, and trips in less mature regions like Latin America were up 600 per cent from a year earlier.

City manager: Visitors to Tehachapi 'like what they see' BY JILL BARNES NELSON jbnelson@tehachapinews.com jbnelson Apr 6, 2017 Updated Apr 6, 2017 Jill Barnes Nelson / Tehachapi News Tehachapi City Manager Greg Garrett talks up his city at the Greater Tehachapi Economic Development Council meeting April 5. Lots of people want to visit and live in Tehachapi. That was the assessment given by City Manager Greg Garrett at the April 5 meeting of the Greater Tehachapi Economic Development Council. “There is a lot more to Tehachapi than just our great events,” Garrett said. “But once many of these visitors come to our events, they often want to stay.” He said a study done by the Kern County Board of Trade delved into just who makes up the population of Tehachapi. “The average age is 41, about 10 years older than the rest of Kern County, and the average income is $83,000,” Garrett said. “We have a very diverse economy.” Health care is a big issue for residents because of the older demographics, but Garrett said the city is “blessed” to have companies such as Kaiser Permanente and Adventist Health in the community. “Kaiser has increased its presence and Adventist Health teamed with the Tehachapi Valley Healthcare District to help complete our new $100 million hospital scheduled to open in the fall,” he said. “Both also do a lot of other things for the community.” He noted the housing market is strong with 73 percent occupancy for home sales and an average home price of $260,000. Homes average 85 days on the market. “Home sales are up almost 13 percent,” he said. “We have three new home builders coming into town, but we could use more. We want more people to join our club to live here.” In addition, Tehachapi has a growing retail scene with the incoming Walmart and existing Pilot Travel Center, and it's ripe for other development, Garrett said. Studies show the economic impact from visitors also has increased from $86 million in 2012 to $104 million in 2014. “That's a big number. People want to visit and leave their money in our banks,” he said. “Many of them like what they see and decide it's a place they want to live. We have a great infrastructure, an active lifestyle and we have retained our beauty. Visitors are finding Tehachapi is a great place to live.” jbnelson Follow jbnelson Close Get email notifications on jbnelson daily! Your notification has been saved.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos News Pattie Kappen used surgery to lose weight and found herself in the process UPDATED: Thu., April 6, 2017, 10:37 p.m. By Becky Kramer beckyk@spokesman.com(509) 459-5466 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS CHAS Health ramped up its smoking cessation programs in 2015 to help its low-income clients kick the habit. Northwest, Page 1 Pattie Kappen knew there was another person inside of her. That woman was confident and fit. She could hike all 8 1/2 miles of the Liberty Lake Loop Trail, including the ascent to the waterfall. Crossing a parking lot didn’t leave her wheezing for breath. She never worried about squeezing through narrow doorways. But for years, Kappen lived with a different reality. She was morbidly obese, carrying more than 400 pounds on a 5-foot, 6-inch frame. “This person who was inside of me, I always knew she was there. It was how to let her come out,” Kappen said. Today, the 37-year-old Spokane resident weighs 175 pounds. She’s no longer diabetic. She doesn’t need high blood-pressure medication anymore. And she’s become an avid hiker. The path to losing 250 pounds included gastric bypass surgery, which Kappen qualified for through insurance offered under Washington’s Medicaid expansion. Kappen also quit smoking, changed her lifestyle and diet, and saw a counselor to help her deal with past abuse. After being molested as a child, Kappen said, food became a coping mechanism. “People don’t realize why you’re fat. They judge. I hated that,” she said. Kappen was profiled in The Spokesman-Review in 2015, after she lost 38 pounds in preparation for the gastric bypass surgery. She’d walked into a CHAS Health clinic a year earlier, determined to kick a two-pack-a-day habit and get down to a healthy weight. Without major changes, Kappen – who has a teenage son – knew she was facing a shortened lifespan. “My worst fear was that I was going to die fat. Or, I could die trying to change my life,” she said. ‘Medically necessary’ surgery Death rates climb with obesity, said Dr. Saurabh Khandelwal, director of the bariatric surgery center at the University of Washington Medical Center, where Kappen had gastric bypass surgery in December 2015. When people’s body mass index rises above 35 – the threshold for morbid obesity – the risk of dying from any cause more than doubles in men and women, Khandelwal said. “You start to see all these diseases crop up: high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea,” he said. At the time of her surgery, Kappen’s body mass index was in the low 60s. In Washington, adult Medicaid patients have been eligible for bariatric surgery since 2005. To qualify, the surgery must be deemed “medically necessary” for the patient. Prior authorization is required, and patients go through psychological testing as part of the screening. “The surgery really is for people who cannot lose weight,” Khandelwal said. “If someone is able to get down to a healthy weight without surgery, that is by far the ideal situation.” But as people pack on pounds, returning to a normal weight gets harder, Khandelwal said. The body has a metabolic memory, and it fights weight loss. After bariatric surgery, keeping the weight off requires sticking to a carefully regimented diet and exercising at least 30 minutes each day. “It’s not some magical operation that works on its own,” Khandelwah said. “It’s daily work and daily commitment.” Stomach size of an apple For Kappen, being obese meant daily humiliations – a seat belt didn’t fit, a chair was too small, a corner was too tight. “Society is not forgiving,” she said. “Not when you’re fat.” For years, low esteem sabotaged her efforts to change, Kappen said. She could hear the negative whispers in her mind: “Pattie, you’re not worth it. You’re never going to do this. Eat that cupcake.” Kappen credits CHAS Health’s smoking cessation program for helping her embark on positive life changes. “Quitting smoking for me was the defining moment,” she said. “I knew this wasn’t me anymore.” She started exercising, graduating from 15 minutes on the treadmill to walks around her South Hill neighborhood with Ross Kappen, who was her husband at the time. She also transformed her diet, focusing on lean meats, whole grains and fruits and vegetables. After the surgery, Kappen’s good habits continued. Her stomach is about the size of an apple now, which requires carefully monitored food intake. Over a seven-month period, she lost more than 200 pounds. “As soon as they told me I could get up and walk, I was walking,” she said. “I was so motivated. It was life changing.” She celebrated the milestones, buying new pants and shirts after dropping multiple sizes, and documenting the walks, which gradually turned into hikes. “When you’re fat, you think, ‘I walked from the car into Wal-Mart,’ ” Kappen said. Even short distances feel like an accomplishment. “Now, I think, ‘I just hiked seven miles.’ That’s crazy.” Hiking to the Liberty Lake waterfall last summer with her son and former husband was a special occasion. She’d tried to reach the waterfall multiple times but always had to turn back. Kappen is still about 40 pounds away from her weight goal of 135, which would put her at the median body mass index for her height. The remaining pounds will come off more slowly, but Kappen doesn’t mind. She feels up to the challenge. The months since the gastric bypass surgery have had their difficulties. A friend rushed Kappen back to Seattle last September for emergency surgery. She had developed a bleeding ulcer, which occurs in about 5 to 10 percent of patients who have the surgery. Kappen’s marriage to her high school sweetheart ended. As she embarked on major changes, Kappen and her husband realized they wanted different things out of life. They split amicably and both remain involved in their son’s life. After years of being a stay-at-home mom, Kappen is pondering options for going back to school and working. But she has the confidence she lacked in the past. “I’m a whole new person now,” she said. Kappen frequently talks about her experiences to people she meets.

YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., also the parent company of Google, announced changes after several big companies pulled their advertising from the company because their ads were appearing with objectionable content. The online video service said the changes are designed to make sure channels are legitimate and not stealing content. "We will no longer serve ads on YPP videos until the channel reaches 10K lifetime views," Ariel Bardin, vice president of product management, said in a statement. "This new threshold gives us enough information to determine the validity of a channel. It also allows us to confirm if a channel is following our community guidelines and advertiser policies. By keeping the threshold to 10K views, we also ensure that there will be minimal impact on our aspiring creators. And, of course, any revenue earned on channels with under 10K views up until today will not be impacted." YouTube is also adding a review process for creators to join the YouTube Partner Program, which began in 2007. "After a creator hits 10K lifetime views on their channel, we'll review their activity against our policies," Bardin said. "If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules." The company, in an effort to help creators reach 10,000, will offer tips on "making great original content and growing your audience." "We want creators of all sizes to find opportunity on YouTube, and we believe this new application process will help ensure creator revenue continues to grow and end up in the right hands," Bardin said. In the past, the open-ended policy allowed amateur video creators to earn money and some work became viral and earned a considerable amount. Several advertisers, including Walmart, General Motors, JPMorgan Chase, Pepsico, Starbucks and Johnson & Johnson, pulled out of YouTube after their ads appeared in extremist hate-speech videos. On March 24, the head of the Association of National Advertisers, which represents 1,000 companies that spend more than $250 billion in marketing and advertising each year, urged Google to change its policy. "ANA strongly believes that brand safety is of paramount importance to our members," Bob Liodice said in statement. "The current crisis is representative of the issues that ANA — and others — have raised with respect to fraud and risk, reduced transparency, sub-optimum measurement and nebulous productivity." YouTube didn't say how many accounts would be affected by the change. Advertisers pay roughly $7 to $12 for 1,000 views and creators split the money with YouTube, The Wall Street Journal reported. "What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match," Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said last month in an interview with Fox Business Network. YouTube has more than a billion users and as of last July, it had paid out $2 billion to rightsholders, the company said on its website.

The wrist-worn wearables record your steps, calories, and other metrics to help you to lose your love handles — or at the very least, feel less guilty about the leftover pizza you had for breakfast. Fitbit’s the undisputed king of these trackers, shipping 5.7 million devices in the second quarter of 2016 and capturing 25 percent of the global fitness market. But even incumbents can’t afford to rest on their laurels. That’s where the Alta HR, Fitbit’s newest tracker, comes in. Fitbit’s Alta HR improves upon last year’s Alta with sleep-tracking and heart rate-monitoring features — all in a slim, compact frame. We came away impressed by the device’s accuracy when tracking heart rate. While we wish the body was waterproof, and the display was a little easier to activate, we think the Alta HR is one of the best fitness trackers you can buy at its price point. Compact frame, dim screen It’s near impossible to tell the Alta HR apart from its predecessor, and that’s a good thing — both are among the thinnest, sleekest fitness trackers we’ve used. The Alta HR boasts a stylish aluminum body with tapered symmetrical edges. On top sits a curved screen with thick black borders, and underneath is a PurePulse heart-rate sensor and three-pin charging port. It’s one of the thinnest, sleekest fitness trackers we’ve used. Fitbit claims Alta HR is one of the smallest wearables on the market with continuous heart-rate tracking, and that seems likely — it’s tiny. The company said it shrunk the internal tech by 25 percent to make room for the optical heart-rate monitor, and the smallest model – the unit we reviewed — measures a mere 0.61 inches (16mm) wide. The Alta HR’s wristbands are interchangeable, with alternative options available in elastomer, leather, and metal. But unlike last year’s Alta, which used a prong closure to secure the tracker around your wrist, the HR’s band adopts an adjustable watch-like buckle that’s much easier to fasten. It’s also a lot more comfortable to wear all day — I tended to forget I was wearing it. That being said, there’s definitely room for improvement. The Alta HR’s monochrome OLED screen isn’t touch-sensitive — instead, tap the screen to cycle through statistics screens, call and text message notifications, and activity reminders. Unfortunately, it’s too dim to read in direct sunlight, and isn’t very responsive. Kyle Wiggers/Digital Trends Kyle Wiggers/Digital Trends Kyle Wiggers/Digital Trends Kyle Wiggers/Digital Trends Sometimes, I had to tap the screen multiple times to get the Alta HR to wake up, and usually a few more times to cycle between stats. The problem is mitigated somewhat by the Fitbit companion app, which lets you specify which stat you see when you lift your wrist. But it’s frustrating nonetheless — especially during a run or workout when tapping the screen can be a quick way to glance at missed notifications. The band isn’t as skin-conforming as we would have liked. Even at the tightest setting, we had a tough time ensuring the Alta HR’s heart-rate tracker stayed in contact with the wrist. More: Fitbit upgrades its software with new social features and personalized workouts Sadly, the Alta HR also isn’t waterproof. Unlike Fitbit’s Flex 2, it won’t track your laps or strokes. It’s a feature we would like to see trickle down into all fitness trackers, as sportier devices have the tendency to get into contact with water more often than other devices. Accurate heart-rate tracking A heart-rate sensor isn’t the Alta HR’s only headlining improvement — there are quite a few features it inherited from the pricier Charge 2. The Alta HR can track daily activity, monitor heart rate, steps, calories, distance, and can automatically recognize exercises. It can track movement and heart rate while you sleep, and can provide insight on the efficacy (or inefficacy) of your workout routine. Fitbit pegs the accuracy of Alta HR’s heart-rate tracking to within 6 beats-per-minute, with a margin of error less than 6 percent. In our testing, it stayed well within that range. SmartTrack automatically records walks, runs, cycling sessions, elliptical routines, and more. Unlike the wildly inaccurate Pebble 2, the Alta HR was consistently spot on. A sedentary afternoon at the office had it hovering around the low 60s, and a sweaty session of virtual reality gaming got it to the 140s. It responded quickly to ramp-ups in activity, reporting a new BMP within a few seconds of high-intensity sessions. Perhaps more impressive than the Alta HR’s heart-rate tracking is SmartTrack, the auto-recognition feature that Fitbit introduced last year. It automatically categorizes walks, runs, cycling sessions, elliptical routines, and broader activities like “sports” and “aerobics” after a session. In our testing, the Alta HR’s tracking had no trouble differentiating a treadmill session at the gym from a walk to my apartment. It even suggested an appropriate category — aerobics — for the aforementioned VR session. It’s a key feature, mainly because it’s impossible to manually start a workout on the Alta HR — you have to wait until you’re done exercising and log workouts in Fitbit’s smartphone app. If most of your routines are stationary or on machines, that could get frustrating. The Charge 2’s workout profiles aren’t available — you won’t get tracking settings for running, biking, Zumba, or intervals, for example. There’s no GPS and altimeter as well, which makes outdoor runs a little harder to track — you don’t get a route map at the end of each session, or a step-climbing metric. It’s also missing the Charge 2’s guided Relax sessions, the two- and five-minute visualizations that prompt you to breath and slow down your heart rate. Fitbit justifies these omissions with improved software. The Fitbit app, which has been updated to support the Alta HR’s tracking features, hasn’t changed all that much since that last time we reviewed it. The home screen shows basic stats like the number of steps you’ve taken, the distance you’ve walked, the calories you’ve burned, the minutes you’ve been active, and the number of days you’ve exercised in a given week. Scroll down a little and you’ll see your heart rate in BPM and your weight. Fitbit makes liberal use of charts. Tapping on the Steps graphic pulls up a bar graph of activity, with a line indicating your daily goal. An Exercise tab breaks your activities into zones like “cardio” and “fat burn,” and shows the total number of calories you expended. And the Heart Rate section charts your BPM over time, and compares your cardio fitness to others in your age group. More: Living with diabetes? Fitbit and Medtronic can help Relatively new additions include the Challenges and Guidance tabs. The Challenges tab packs location-based activities like “Weekend Warrior” (a two-day session of high-intensity workouts), and “Jogging in NYC” (a three-mile run in Manhattan).  The Guidance tab, meanwhile, offers workouts from Fitbit’s Fitstar app. Sleep insights Sleep tracking is the other new feature. Two new sections, Sleep Insights and Sleep Stages, show how well you’re sleeping each night. A graph breaks your sleep into four stages — Awake, REM, Light, and Deep — and estimates how much time you’ve spent in each. The screen is too dim to read in direct sunlight, and isn’t very responsive. Fitbit said the Alta HR uses a combination of heart rate and movement data to determine how long you’ve in each sleep stage. During the different stages, your heart rate variability — the interval of time in between heart beats — changes, and so the Alta HR continuously records it throughout the night. The data’s plotted on a colorful graph that shows the previous night’s info, your 30-day average. and sleep stats from Fitbit users of the same age and gender. Sleep tracking seemed accurate in our testing. During one particularly restless evening, the Alta HR recorded each hour of disrupted sleep — 2 a.m., 5 a.m., 6 a.m., and 7:30 a.m. It showed that I’d slept for a total of six hours, and 20 percent of that time was spent in Light sleep. The app said most people my age and gender spend a lot longer in that sleep stage than I did. Good to know, but what can I do with this information? That’s where Sleep Insights come in. They’re in-app cards that give suggestions on how to improve your night’s sleep by drawing correlations between activities that might be negatively — or positively — impacting resting hours. If you sleep 20 minutes longer on the days you run four miles than on the days you don’t, for example, you’ll get a card about it. My insights tended to be vague. The Fitbit app told me that I could set a “bedtime reminder” to help me go to bed at a consistent time, and observed that I woke up earlier than usual one morning. This feature requires quite some time to collect enough data to be useful. Pending more testing, we’ll have to give it the benefit of the doubt. Week-long battery Fitbit estimates the Alta HR’s battery at about a week, and that’s roughly in line with what we saw. After four days with heart-rate monitoring enabled, active sleep tracking, and brisk walks in New York, the Alta HR’s battery meter settled at 35 percent — more than enough to last a full week. Warranty information, availability, and pricing The warranty covers product defects up to two years from the purchase date — or you can return the Alta HR within 45 days if you’re not happy with it. The Fitbit Alta HR is available from Fitbit.com, Amazon, Walmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, and other retailers for $150. It comes in blue, fuchsia, coral, black. Two special edition colors, 22k soft pink gold and gunmetal black, start at $180. Fitbit Alta HR accessory bands come in metal ($100), leather ($60), and elastomer ($30) styles. Fitbit Alta HR Compared To Polar M450 Mio Fuse Polar A360 Fitbit Surge Razer Nabu Epson Runsense SF-810 Garmin VivoActive FitBit Charge HR Withings Aura Smart Sleep System Fitbit Charge Fitbit One Zackees Turn-Signal Gloves Basis B1 Nike+ Fuelband Nike+iPod Sport Kit Our Take The Fitbit Alta HR is an impressive fitness tracker at its price point. It may lack a few bells and whistles found on its pricier counterparts, but the Alta HR’s compactness, the accuracy of its heart-rate tracker, the smart activity recognition, and the robustness of its sleep tracking make up for its shortcomings. Is there a better alternative? Garmin’s Vivosmart HR+ and Samsung’s Gear Fit 2 are excellent alternatives that both throw in GPS for $30 more at $180, but they’re not as stylish or compact as the Alta HR. The $80 Misfit Ray and $100 Fitbit Flex 2 can record swim sessions, but they lack heart-rate monitors. The DT Accessory Pack Fitbit Alta Charger Dock $15.99 Vancle Fitbit Alta Adjustable Replacement Bands $6.80 Fitbit Alta Magnetic Clip Holder $6.99 For folks looking to put $150 toward an activity tracker, it’ll come down to use case: If you’re a frequent swimmer, the Flex 2’s the obvious choice. If you can’t live without workout profiles, want relax sessions, and a GPS, go for the pricier Charge 2. If you want a lower-profile wearable that’ll track your sleep, record your activity, and won’t stick out like a sore thumb, the Alta HR’s the fitness tracker to buy. How long will it last? The Alta HR should last at least a few years if properly cared for. Fitbit is generally good about updating old products, sometimes going so far as to bring new features to older models. And accessories like bands and charging docks keep it fresh. Should you buy it? Yes. If you’re a casual athlete looking for a no-frills, stylish way to track your sleep and daily activity — and don’t care about GPS — the Alta HR is one of the cheapest and slimmest fitness trackers with a heart rate sensor, and benefits from Fitbit’s ever-improving ecosystem of accessories and software. Simply put, it’s one of the best everyday activity trackers we’ve tried.
