The Director for Policy in Africa at the United States Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Leila Ndiaye, in this interview with Obinna Chima, spoke about the objectives of the initiative as well as its capacity to enhance bilateral trade between African countries and the U.S. Excerpts: What is the objective of the U.S-Africa Business Center ? The objective is to increase bilateral trade between the U.S. and Africa. The other objective is to make that American companies are being understood and take part in the emerging Africa. That is because everywhere you go today, they talk about emerging Nigeria and emerging Africa. So, we want to be part of this emerging trend. But most importantly, we want African companies and business leaders to sit down on the same table with American companies and tell them how to do business with Africa as well as how they can together, partner to do business. It is either we help them do business in America or together they do business as partners. We have realised a long time ago that Africa is an untapped market. We know that Africa is not just one country, it is made up of 54 countries, compared with a lot of people who think Africa is one country. We know that Nigeria is the biggest market, etc. But, how is it that we can help? It is a win-win situation because we want to make money, and you (African businesses) also want to make money. But it comes with very favourable investment climate, it comes with the know-how of the market. But only you can tell me how to do business in your country , just as I am the only one that can tell you how to do business in my country. So, that is a win-win. But why did the Chamber come up with this initiative when we had the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), or has AGOA failed? AGOA didn’t fail. But one can say that it didn’t reach its full potential. And both sides did not benefit from it. You have to understand that AGOA has more than 6,000 products that can enter the U.S. free of taxes, back and forth. But people are not aware of that. Only a handful of companies in Nigeria and everywhere in Africa, really benefitted. We have extended AGOA for another 10 years. So, we must focus on what is beyond AGOA. We established this center because we are proactive. We launched it last December. We advocated strongly for AGOA, we did the same for the American-EXIM Bank and as you can recall, last July, it was history. Some people had to fight so that the Congress would re-authorise what the U.S. Chamber can do. So, what we did was to make sure that we can do business in a very sane environment between both regions. Does the Chamber have specific criteria for organisations or even individuals  that intend to join the center? You know, we never had any African company as a member of the U.S Chamber. But we have opened the door for African companies. The first thing we are concerned about is the Foreign Practice  Act. So, you can be as wealthy as you want, but you have to pass some criteria. If you never worked in your life, and because your father was a Governor, and he stole money and gave you a company, you can be the wealthiest person on earth, but you can never be a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. We promote entrepreneurship, but entrepreneurship comes with a spirit. So, it is something that you need to have within your system, to build and create jobs. I don’t have anything about people’s inheritance, that is not what I am talking about. I am talking about money coming from the government, money laundering. You have to be a real entrepreneur. And any company with government funding cannot be part of the U.S. Chamber. What about a company that got its seed capital through government funding and after some years it developed capacity and has been sustaining itself, is such a firm not qualified to be a member of the Chamber? If you are a company, and you participated in a bid and for example, the government gives you licence to import rice, we won’t say know to such a company. But if you create your company and its revenues come from government, we cannot accept such a company. We have to make sure that everything is clean. Then, you have to understand the philosophy. The philosophy is the triple ‘A’ solution, which is – we advocate on your behalf, we advice you and we give you access. But the access tag we give you is unthinkable. At the government level, the private sector level, we host approximately 130 delegations in a year at the Chamber. There is no Head of State in this world that comes into Washington to meet the Department of States, President Obama or any U.S. government official, without stopping at the U.S. Chamber. This is because that is where the economy of America resides. That is where the dollars really reside. Does the center offer grants to members? We don’t offer grants. We give access to our members. We have more than three million companies whichmake us the largest business federation in the world. Consider the U.S. Chamber to be like the federal Chamber. Beneath us, you have 2,800 Chambers, both local and regional. Then, we have Chambers all over the world totaling 117. So, that is the network. We don’t give grant to anybody because we are not a bank. We are a policy shop. But we give access to where the resources can be, because we advice you and we open the door for you. Now, if your product is bankable, of course, we would look for who is interested within our members and it would be your responsibility to do your business pitch. However, I will make sure that you get to the right person or partner. I can give you an example of a success story of a company. We talked about AGOA, now we are talking about funding and how you do things. There is a company from Senegal that is in agro-business. It was the only company in the country that was really doing huge volumes in terms of refines,  jams, juices in America, coming from the West Coast. She is a member of the U.S. Chamber and actually the second African companies that joined the Chamber. Exactly five months ago, we invited the President of Afreximbank. He came, they sat down and discussed. She is already in five states and our plan was for her to go to Walmart. Walmart is my member. I want her to be in Whole Foods, which is also my member. Walmart has 700 stores in Africa, but not with the name Walmart and I want her to be in at least 20 of those stores. We sat down, we looked at the products. She was exporting to the U.S via AGOA, a member of the Chamber. Ninety per cent of her employees are women, 10 per cent are deaf people and so she is like socially responsible. And the Afreximbank promised to take the business to the next level. It took him just two hours to instruct his people to invest $15 million into this company for the lady to double her capacity of production. That is what we do. So, when a Head of State comes and if you are our member, you have the opportunity for one-on-meetings. There, you can address your priorities. Last year, we hosted President Muhammadu Buhari during his first official visit and we had more than 400 people in a room. That tells you how Nigeria is portrayed and how much the U.S. private sector is involved. So, we give you access, we advice you and we wish you goodluck. Not goodluck in a way that we want to get rid of you. That is because we would be there with you until we make sure you find a solution. But, I will never instruct a bank. So, what does it take to be a member? First of all, at the national level in the U.S, you just need to be registered in the U.S, no matter the size of your company. But if you are an international, then we have different programmes. There is the international division with all the different continents represented. I represent Africa as the Director. But there is a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedure that I do. KYC is very important. As someone with African origin, I want the best for my continent. I want to show America the best from my continent. So, I want the best entreprenuers who can roll their sleeves with Americans. For me, that is how I see emerging Africa. If you are the CEO of Dangote, Zenith Bank or any company from Africa, you should be able to sit down with the CEO of Procter and Gamble and agree on what they want to do together. Presently, how many Nigerian companies do you have as members? We cannot say, but we have considerable number. For Nigeria, what I like to do is to create a specific programme to be called the U.S-Nigeria CEO dialogue, which would be a specific Programme for Nigeria. It would take place in the first quarter of 2017 and by then I hope to have gotten more members from Nigeria, so that they can participate. It is also for us to have medium-sized and large sized American companies in the meeting. But at the first edition of the programme, I will just go with the top 10 Nigerian companies and top 20 or top 50 US companies. Top 10 in terms of what? In terms of the longevity of the company, turnover and as I said before, it has to be a company with a success story and a representative of the private sector. That is because any company that succeeds in Nigeria, should be able to spread or expand to Ivory Coast, Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, etc, and we can help. The company I talked about in Senegal, today, her products are on the shelves in Ivory Coast, Gambia, Burkina Faso, and every where. But how did it start? It started with the meeting she had with us. But why did it take the U.S this long to integrate businesses in Africa? I think there have been a misrepresentation of the presence of  U.S. businesses in Africa. A company like Procter and Gamble or even General Electric. General Electric has been in Africa for over 100 years. The U.S private sector businesses have always been here. I always laugh because I tell people that there is no village where you don’t find gillete blade, which is made by Procter & Gamble. When you want to search for information on your phone, what do you use? Google. So, Africans consume America everyday. From Microsoft when you turn on your computer, from using using Google, you are creating jobs both sides (Africa and America), you use Facebook, you do the same. Procter & Gamble has more than 300 hundred products in Africa. These are American products. Where I agree with you is that we didn’t hear much about the U.S in areas such as infrastructure as much as lately, the Chinese. That is where I think the Chinese have made so much noise by building railroads, bridges, etc, across Africa. Maybe that is why some have the feeling that the U.S has not been present. But the U.S has always been present. But we want to do more infrastructure because there cannot be any development if there is lack of infrastructure. We have started with the programme, Power Africa. We need electricity in Africa and the U.S. has taken the step. So, we want to be more present in things that people see and feel. So, we want to be more involved in all sectors and we want to help Africa move from raw materials to develop the value chain processes in Africa. Why is it that Africa will always sell its coffee or cocoa as a raw material to the West? Why can’t they be processed into finished products, using our technology and sell in the African market? These are the things we want to be involved in. Currency is a major part of trade and we have FX controls in some countries in Africa. How does the Chamber assist its members in areas such as FX, Customs as well as the issue of multiple taxation faced by businesses in Africa? We do and I will give you some examples. Firstly, you know that you have the Common External Tarriff (CET) in ECOWAS. One morning I recieved an e-mail from one of our members about that. Secondly, there was a specific product that the tax was supposed to be 10 per cent, we sent our material to this country, and suddenly they said it was 35 per cent. That souldn’t have been because they have a common tarriff. So, I looked at it and said that wasn’t right because it is the same law that should be applied and implemented. So, that was how we engaged ECOWAS and we had an MoU with ECOWAS, which took care of the problem. So, that was why I said we are a policy shop. So, if the law is not favourable to any private sector person, we would make that that the law becomes a reality. The second question was about FX controls. This year, we signed an MoU also with the West Africa Bankers Association (WABA) and we were very concerned about the naira and the implication of the FX issue for foreign companies. We also invited the President of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, to address our members in Washington on the FX issues in Nigeria. We chose Aig-Imoukhuede because of his experience as a former bank CEO and he understands the issues. Our members asked him questions and he was able to advice them better. Those who wanted to withdraw did not after the session. So, that is the kind of platform that we offer so as we come out solution and to enable each person to prosper. The U.S-Africa Business Center is going to turn a year by December and the Africa Department of the U.S. Chamber is just nine years old. But it doesn’t mean that the U.S. was not interested in Africa. The U.S. has always done business in Africa. But, it is the will of the private sector that made the U.S. Chamber to create the Africa Department. Does the Chamber also support startups? We do have a programme at the national level because you have to start somewhere. Of course, we support startups. Recently, we met with young entrepreneurs from 30 nations in Africa, startups only. We gave them the opportunity to present their projects. They went into a competition and we selected those that had the best business plan, etc. So, we do once in a while, engage with startups to make sure that we coach them. But our priority today is at the macro level. Our second priority is to make sure we have a strong programme for SMEs. Our third priority is to have a programme for women and make sure that we give them all the tools to prosper, especially in three sectors where we don’t see a lot of women – energy, agriculture and ICT.

About 13 hours hours later, thanks to diligent Marion County Sheriff’s Office detectives and an observant deputy, two Ocala men were arrested in connection with using the woman’s credit card. Capt. Dennis Joiner said Sunday that after the woman, who was not identified by authorities, awoke early Saturday, she immediately called her credit card company when she discovered her purse was missing. That’s when she learned that her card had been used at Wal-Mart on Southwest 19th Avenue Road at 4:54 a.m. and again an hour later at the Wal-Mart on Silver Springs Boulevard. The woman called the Marion County Sheriff’s Office, which immediately responded to the retirement community off U.S. 441 in southern Marion County. Detectives went to both Wal-Mart locations to view security footage and learned that two men were together at both stores when the credit cards were used to buy beer, cigarettes and other items valued at more than $300. The detectives were able to identify the car the men were driving from the surveillance video and were also able to capture a still photo of both men from the video. The photo and the vehicle description was sent out to Marion County deputies and other local law enforcement agencies. Sometime Saturday evening, K-9 Deputy Brandon Donahue spotted the vehicle matching the description and conducted a traffic stop. That’s when he discovered two men, who looked like the men in the photo, inside the vehicle. During questioning by detectives, the men denied stealing the credit cards, but did admit using them. They said an unknown man gave them the credit cards to go buy the merchandise. The purse and missing bathroom towel were not recovered. Arrested and charged with grand theft and credit card fraud are: Preston Jay Blackwell, 56, who is homeless, and Renney Hardley, 33, of Ocala. Joiner said detectives are still working the case to determine if there is enough physical evidence left at the home to charge the men with burglary of an occupied dwelling. “There were only the two men in the surveillance videos,” Joiner said. “Detectives are still working on the case to determine if any evidence can link them to being in the home.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Manage Print Account Contact Us Privacy Policy Subscribe Now Terms of Service Manage Digital Account FAQs Submissions News Tips Letters to the Editor Calendar Events Obituaries Legal Notices Advertising Advertise With Us Display Ads Classified Ads Place an Ad Online Services Mobile App RSS Feeds Newsletters Twitter Facebook Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Hong, File) (Newser) – The New York Times has a deep dive on how Walmart bet big on its business by investing in its employees. In 2015 the retailer quietly implemented a new focus on employee welfare, increasing pay across the board and developing programs to make the management track more accessible to employees. Although the program hasn't helped Walmart's struggling stock price, it has allowed Walmart to increase sales, increase employee satisfaction, and claw back some trust and loyalty from consumers. According to its official fact sheet, Walmart pledged $2.7 billion over two years to increasing employee pay and benefits. The NYT reports that so far, the initiative has raised the average pay for a full-time non-managerial employee to $13.69 an hour, a 16% increase since 2014 and above average pay for retail employees. However, some business leaders and analysts remain skeptical. Writing for Bloomberg, columnist Megan McArdle notes that for a large, publicly held company like Walmart, profitability looms above all. If the company's renewed focus on worker welfare doesn't start paying real, quantifiable dividends, shareholders will push for it to return to a cheaper business model, even if that means relying on fewer workers.

Lisa Done Oct 24, 2016 2:45 PM CDT This is a line of crap. Walmart has cut hours and when they get busy refuse as always to call in help. They killed benefits, fired many and didn't give everyone raises. It was only to blow smoke up everyones rear end and for a fluff piece Nora22 Oct 24, 2016 10:19 AM CDT They're only going halfway. They need to cut management pay and pwrks the same amount for a net wash on profitability because their model is way out of line.

Legal fees to defend McCandless Council's decision to OK construction of a Wal-Mart store off McKnight Road has cost taxpayers nearly $75,000, according to the town's lawyer. The fees stem from a lawsuit and a series of appeals filed by a residents' group that claimed, among other things, that McCandless officials didn't properly inform the public about the project. The group Citizens of McCandless has accused town officials of helping the retail giant with its plan to build along Blazier Drive by speeding through the approval process. It also has argued that the store will create traffic nightmares, the property is too small for the size of the building and will be close enough to Pine Creek to pose an environmental risk. The group's initial lawsuit was filed in August 2014 in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court on behalf of 17 residents. In January 2015, Senior Judge Joseph James ruled that town officials acted properly and Wal-Mart's plans for a 155,000-square-foot super center met municipal zoning requirements. The group appealed that ruling in Commonwealth Court, but a three-member court panel upheld James' decision. In response, the group applied to have the full nine-member Commonwealth Court rehear arguments in the case. That request was turned down in March by the Commonwealth Court's president judge. In April, the group petitioned the state Supreme Court to intervene on its behalf. That request was denied in September. “From day one we felt that town council acted properly when they approved the project,” said William Ries, the town's attorney. “The only question the town considered was whether Wal-Mart met the requirements to build. And they did.” Attorney Dwight Ferguson, who has represented Citizens of McCandless in legal proceedings, said state court rules prohibit him from disclosing how much he has billed the group for legal services. Several members of the organization did not respond to requests for comment or referred questions to Ferguson. Although the group actively solicits donations, it is not obligated by state law to reveal who gives money or how it is spent because it is not a registered non-profit organization or political action committee, according to a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of State. Wal-Mart is in the process of obtaining permits from the state's environmental protection and transportation departments. Once they are secured, the company can apply for grading and building permits from the municipality, according to town officials. Ferguson said requests for documents related to the permitting process have been filed with the county, state and municipality. “There are many other facets of this case we are exploring,” he said. Group members have said the multiple losses in court would not deter their efforts to try to keep Wal-Mart from building. Ries said the group's ongoing contention that council should have denied Wal-Mart's application in the first place does not take into account the legal ramifications of such a decision. “I have little doubt that Wal-Mart would have sued the town,” he said. “And there wouldn't have been much we could do to defend such a lawsuit. The company would have gone into court and presented evidence that they met the legal requirements to build. And as we've seen in the (judge's) decision that was issued, the court would have agreed.” Tony LaRussa is a Tribune-Review staff writer. Reach him at 724-772-6368 or tlarussa@tribweb.com.

David Mikkelson Oct 22, 2016 Share - - WalMart is the United States' largest retailer, and in October that also makes them one of the nation's largest vendors of Halloween costumes and accessories. One popular type of costume accessory sold by WalMart and other vendors is latex applications that simulate wounds inflicted by gunshots, knives, machetes, razors, burns, vampire bats, and even zombies: But one such latex accessory (offered by a third-party supplier and sold through WalMart), which simulates deep razor blade cuts to the forearm, drew the ire of some observers because it depicts a type of wound that is not administered by evil figures such as criminals or vampires or maniacal serial killers, but is self-inflicted by those in the throes of depression and self-destructive impulses: An article published by the Scary Mommy parenting community titled ""Hey Wal-Mart, Suicide Is Not a Costume" took the retailing giant to task for making a "joke" of suicide with such an "insensitive" offering: Apparently Wal-Mart thinks suicide’s a joke. This year, their Halloween store is selling a latex prosthetic of slit wrists called “Razor Blade Suicide Scar Wound Latex Costume Make Up.” The photo featured in the ad shows the deep wounds, two in number. But there’s more: The product listing not only shows the prosthetic, it depicts a suicide attempt. Poised at the end of one of the slashes is a hand holding a razor blade — not included in costume. Its occasion is listed as “Party.” Suicide is not a joke, indeed. Suicide is not a costume. Joke about zombies. Jokes about chainsaws. Joke about bloody knives and swords, please, but don’t pretend you’ve attempted or succeeded in killing yourself, the end result of intense mental anguish and misery. It’s not cute to pretend to rip yourself away from life, from your family, from your friends. And more importantly, it’s a grave insult to those who have made the terrible decision to take their own lives, and left us all bereft. A petition started on Change.org also implored WalMart to drop the item from their roster: The "Razor Blade Suicide Scar Wound Latex Costume Makeup" is being sold at Walmart. This is not just a disgrace to the sensitivity to those who suffer from self-harm, but a shame on Walmart for making light of the situation. This "costume" is real life for many people, many people who are contemplating volumes higher than self-harm. Suicide is not a joke, not a costume, and not funny. Many people who have "suicide" or as I would call it "survivor" scar wounds wish they could make them disappear. There are tattoo shops who welcome customers to get cover-ups on self-harm scars, which is amazing for the people who want to move on from the dark time they were in at one point in their life. On that note, many people are life-long sufferers of self-harm. Many are bullied, and now they are being bullied by Walmart. This has to stop. Stopping this costume will end volumes of triggers, self harm, and could even save a life. The public outcry from those efforts was sufficient, as WalMart quickly removed the page for the “Razor Blade Suicide Scar Wound Latex Costume Make Up" from their web site, saying that “This costume is appalling and it was unacceptable for a third-party seller to list it on our marketplace. It clearly violated our prohibited items policy and we removed it when it was brought to our attention.” However, Google searches showed the same product to be available through other online vendors, one of whom, Totally Costumes, asserted that WalMart was at fault for describing the item incorrectly: Upon inspection we see that Walmart has listed the item incorrectly, making it highly offensive; but rest assured, the product is not listed this way on our direct site, or any other channel we use. We have put in a ticket with the Walmart Catalog team to have the item name and description of the listing modified right away. We are not sure why Walmart has it titled the way they do. But Totally Costumes' (since-removed) listing described the product as a "Cruel World Razor Blade Prosthetics," invoking a phrase ("Goodbye, cruel world!") commonly associated with suicide in popular culture, and it advocated that purchasers "surrender to your despair": Another since-removed listing on the Totally Costumes web site advertised a "Slashed Wrists Prosthetic Appliance" that exhorted buyers to "Give your costume a look so realistic that it seems suicidal" and to "Go off the deep end and make that gruesome suicide attempt": Originally published: 22 October 2016 Tags: walmart halloween David Mikkelson David Mikkelson founded snopes.com in 1994, and under his guidance the company has pioneered a number of revolutionary technologies, including the iPhone, the light bulb, beer pong, and a vaccine for a disease that has not yet been discovered.

The move is an extension of Wal-Mart's pact with JD.com, China's no. 2 e-commerce site. New Dada, partly owned by JD.com, has more than 25 million registered customers and delivers to more than 300 cities. China is a key growth market for Wal-Mart — potentially lucrative but challenging. The world's largest retailer has increased its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent, following an initial deal that gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. Wal-Mart said it will be using New Dada's network to offer customers two-hour delivery on groceries ordered from Wal-Mart stores.

(Photo/China Daily) Walmart on Friday announced a million strategic investment in New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery online-to-offline e-commerce platform. The investment is an extension of Walmart's broader agreement with JD.com. As part of the cooperation, New Dada offers customers two-hour delivery on groceries ordered from Walmart stores through the JD Daojia Dada application. The two-hour delivery service is available to customers within a 3 km radius of more than 20 Walmart stores that are currently part of the program. The number of Walmart stores offering two hour delivery is expected to double by the end of the year. New Dada, an independent joint venture of JD.com and Dada, has more than 25 million registered customers and provides local on-demand delivery capabilities, with 2.5 million crowdsourced deliverers across more than 300 cities in China. Walmart has 426 stores in nearly 170 cities. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said: "All around the world, we're creating seamless shopping experiences that bring together our stores, sites and apps to make shopping faster and easier. Our alliance with JD and cooperation with New Dada will provide seamless shopping to millions of customers across China." Philip Kuai, CEO of New Dada, said: "Combining New Dada's delivery network with Walmart stores means consumers will enjoy convenient access to a wide range of high-quality goods delivered to their homes and offices in record time." Fresh food is generally seen as one of the key differentiators in grocery retailing and local retailers. Shopping behaviors of Chinese consumers are rapidly changing in light of the explosive growth of e-commerce and more time spent on leisure and entertainment, said Jason Yu, general manager of Kantar Worldpanel China. At the moment, Walmart offers e-commerce service in a limited number of cities. However, fresh food e-commerce is more challenging because Chinese shoppers are extremely sensitive to freshness and timely delivery as well as prices, he said, noting that's why a number of pure play fresh e-commerce players went bust and more will follow. "The investment in New Dada and JD means that Walmart can significantly expand its shopper reach and leverage the cost efficiency and convenience provided by the New Dada platform," he said. "It is difficult for Walmart alone to make profits on fresh food delivery without sufficient scale." Therefore, the investment-based strategic collaboration makes sense, he said. JD.com formed its partnership with Walmart Stores Inc in June of this year. Walmart sold its e-commerce operation in China to JD.com Inc in exchange for a 5 percent stake in the Chinese e-commerce major.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Council intitates landscaping and lighting district annexation for Walmart area Saturday Oct 22, 2016 at 12:01 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 The Ridgecrest City Council at their meeting Wednesday initiated proceedings to annex land in and around the Walmart site to a Ridgecrest landscaping and lighting district and to levy and collect annual assessments, beginning in fiscal year 2017-2018. The item was on the consent calendar and pulled for discussion by Mayor Peggy Breeden. Breeden asked about the staff report, which said that the new assessments would not “fund any portion of the flood control facilities irrigation system and planting.” “A lighting and landscaping maintenance district is specifically for lighting and landscaping for the  Walmart project as well as the surrounding properties,” City Engineer Loren Culp said. “It is very specific in what that will allow you to do. That lighting and landscaping district has to be specifically for those uses. It cannot include something with a drainage facility.” Culp reiterated the staff report and said that flood control or drainage facilities would require a Special Benefit Assessment district. Breeden asked who would fund drainage facilities and irrigation systems not covered by the district. “Drainage is not covered by any assessment district, that work will have to be funded by the city,” Culp said. Council candidate Dave Matthews spoke up during public comment, asking if the land is being annexed to the city or “just to a maintenance district?” Culp replied that it is “an annexation to an existing lighting landscaping maintenance district” that was established for a previous project. “Are other properties involved besides Walmart complex and are ballots are going to be sent out to those property owners?” Matthews asked. Culp replied yes and explained the process. “The state requirements are that we have to send out to those properties that are benefiting by the improvements to allow them to agree or disagree to be annexed into the assessment district. “It's in the form of a ballot, which they can protest or decline being involved within the assessment district. Those ballots are taken and if there is a majority of those property owners that agree within that assessment district then we will be able to impose that assessment district on those properties . . . if there is a majority that decide that they do not want to be in this assessment district, then the annexation fails.” Culp said should the majority protest “I think that might be something that the council might consider. It is my understanding that if the majority decides they do not want the assessment district then the . . . the annexation fails.” Total annual maximum assessment for the annexation to be balloted is $42,600.75 and “the total assessment proposed for Fiscal Year 2017/2018 is $36,043.96” if approved, according to the staff report. According to the staff report, if annexation is unsuccessful the city will be responsible for all costs for operation and maintenance. “If annexation is successful Walmart pays O & M costs for the first year,” according to the report, and the city will pay for general benefit expenses of operations and maintenance of $1,239 per year. “City also fronts the O&M cost from the end of the developers one year period until the districts funded approximately January of 2018. The City would be reimbursed for fronting the O&M costs in the January 2018 tax payment,” according to the staff report. Approval of the consent calendar item was unanimous by all five council members.

The number of unbanked households fell from 7.7 percent in 2013 and 8.2 percent in 2011. “Developing a relationship with a bank helps consumers build assets and create wealth, makes them less susceptible to discriminatory or predatory lending practices and can provide a financial safety net against unforeseen circumstances,” FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg said. Bombardier to scrap 7,500 more jobs as CEO deepens cost cuts Bombardier Inc. will cut an additional 7,500 jobs — more than 10 percent of its workforce — over two years as the maker of trains and airplanes accelerates a restructuring plan after taking on billions of dollars of debt to develop its marquee C Series jetliner. Restructuring charges of $225 million to $275 million will be reported as special items starting in the fourth quarter and continuing through 2017, Bombardier said. The Montreal-based company expects the program to yield savings of about $300 million a year by the end of 2018. This is the second major employment cut in eight months by CEO Alain Bellemare, who was hired in February 2015 with a mandate to restore profitability. Wal-Mart invests $50M in China's online grocery business Wal-Mart is investing $50 million in New Dada, China’s largest online grocery and logistics company, as it moves to strengthen its foothold in the nation’s fiercely competitive food market. The move is an extension of Wal-Mart’s pact with JD.com, China’s no. 2 e-commerce site. New Dada, partly owned by JD.com, has more than 25 million registered customers and delivers to more than 300 cities. China is a key growth market for Wal-Mart — potentially lucrative but challenging. The world’s largest retailer has increased its stake in JD.com to 10.8 percent, following an initial deal that gave JD.com ownership of its Chinese e-commerce site Yihaodian. Wal-Mart said earlier this week it will be using New Dada’s network to offer customers two-hour delivery on groceries ordered from Wal-Mart stores. Tesla may enter ride ride-hailing business next year Electric car maker Tesla Motors has plans to get into the ride-hailing and sharing businesses. The company hinted at the venture earlier this week when it announced that all of its cars would come equipped with hardware needed to drive themselves. The company says in a disclaimer that use of self-driving Teslas to make money with ride-hailing or sharing will be allowed only on Tesla’s own network. Details will be released next year. A message left for a Tesla spokeswoman was not immediately answered on Friday. BAT bids $47 billion for full ownership of Reynolds American British American Tobacco Plc offered to pay $47 billion for full control of Reynolds American Inc., proposing a trans-Atlantic deal that would create the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company and put brands such as Lucky Strike and Camel under the same roof. The unsolicited cash-and-stock offer of $56.50 a share would allow London-based BAT to acquire the 58 percent of Reynolds that it doesn’t already own. But the U.K. company only plans to pursue the transaction with the support of Reynolds. The two sides haven’t yet held negotiations, BAT said, and the Reynolds’s board is just now reviewing the offer.  Sign up for free newsletters and get more of the Post-Gazette delivered to your inbox Most Read Most Emailed Advertisement Most Commented Join the conversation: Commenting policy | How to report abuse To report inappropriate comments, abuse and/or repeat offenders, please send an email to socialmedia@post-gazette.com and include a link to the article and a copy of the comment.

(Sandy Huffaker/Bloomberg News) Wal-Mart has embraced the so-called click-and-collect model, in which shoppers select their food online, and then workers fill the order and have it ready for pickup at a store parking lot. (Sandy Huffaker/Bloomberg News) Amazon aims to gobble up Wal-Mart’s food business Add to ... SPENCER SOPER and CRAIG GIAMMONA Bloomberg News Published Sunday, Oct. 23, 2016 4:22PM EDT Last updated Sunday, Oct. 23, 2016 4:24PM EDT Comments AA For years, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has followed Amazon.com Inc., putting inventory online and starting its own version of a marketplace where third-party merchants can sell their wares. Now, Amazon is returning the favour. The e-commerce behemoth is building pickup locations for groceries in Seattle that could open by the end of the year, according to someone familiar with the plans, echoing a strategy embraced by its chief brick-and-mortar rival. Delivering fresh food is complicated and the one issue keeping Amazon and other tech companies from disrupting the grocery business. Most consumers still get their milk, produce and meat from Wal-Mart, Kroger and other traditional grocers. But while e-commerce has yet to take hold in the United States’s $800-billion (U.S.) grocery market, Amazon is betting that could change as millennials accustomed to shopping online enter their prime food-buying years. “We know their best customers are willing to buy groceries online,” says Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge. “The onus is on Amazon to deliver because the demand is there.” Amazon began experimenting with the grocery business in 2007 when the company started AmazonFresh in the Seattle area, where the company is based. The service offered doorstep delivery of a limited selection of groceries, saving consumers driving time and the trouble of pushing a shopping cart around a store. The service has slowly expanded to 16 U.S. markets, including Los Angeles, New York and Boston. In June, the company rolled out the service to Prime subscribers in London, the first time it has been offered outside the United States. Amazon currently offers same-day delivery of more than 130,000 items for £7 ($10) a month on top of the cost of Prime. Recently, AmazonFresh hit a milestone when it stopped losing money in Seattle, according to the person. Earlier this month, the company dropped the price from $299 (U.S.) a year to $15 a month in the United States – $180 annually – which proved immediately popular with shoppers and emboldened Amazon to accelerate its grocery ambitions, the person said. Wal-Mart and Kroger have embraced the so-called click-and-collect model. Shoppers select their food online, and then workers fill the order and have it ready for pickup in the store parking lot. Besides side-stepping potential spoilage, Wal-Mart is hoping that shoppers will buy other things once they’ve made it as far as the parking lot. The service is still rolling out nationally, so it’s too early to judge its popularity among the targeted demo of millennial mothers. Amazon, of course, doesn’t have much of a physical presence in the United States beyond a few bookstores. So the company is turning to pickup locations for its groceries. In Seattle, Amazon is building facilities that resemble gas stations, where shoppers could pull in and pick up their groceries. Amazon’s push into fresh food is a direct threat to the established players. In Britain, the company has entered a crowded market where Tesco PLC and Web grocer Ocado Group PLC have been engaged in a price war for years. Ocado shares plummeted when Amazon announced its British plans. In the United States, the main tussle will play out between Amazon and Wal-Mart, which is the country’s largest grocer, generates more than half its sales from selling food and uses cheap goods to lure customers to its stores. Time and again, Amazon has shown itself willing to absorb losses while it builds a commanding market share. In groceries, the company is willing to break even in an effort to persuade shoppers to visit the site more often, one of the people said. The big question is whether a sizable numbers of Americans will be prepared to purchase fresh food online, sight unseen. For many people, there’s no substitute for personally assessing the ripeness of an avocado or the thickness of a steak. Wal-Mart and other traditional grocers are spending billions to improve the shopping experience and doubling down on prepared meals and private label products you can’t get anywhere else. “There’s still going to be a place for stores that have a good selection and provide that experience,” industry consultant Roger Davidson says.

Palmieri Masqueology Brings South Korean Skin-care Innovations to the Masses The brand's sheet masks have entered more than 3,000 Wal-Mart doors. By Rachel Brown on October 23, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk A sheet mask from Masqueology. Masqueology wants no one to miss out on the South Korean skin-care craze. After originally launching five years ago with prestige positioning at Sephora and Macy’s, the brand has pivoted to the mass market by entering Wal-Mart. The world’s largest retailer last month began carrying six of its sheet masks at moire than 3,000 doors: Vita Clarifying Cream Mask, Moisturizing Face Mask, Special Care Mask, Moisturizing Foot Mask, Moisturizing Hand Mask and the best-selling Collagen Lifting Cream Mask. “When we started, [South] Korean skin care was basically nonexistent in the U.S., and it’s come to the forefront. Everybody has started jumping on the [South] Korean skin-care bandwagon, and a lot of the big mainstream retailers contacted me about [South] Korean skin care,” said Phillip Ha, chief executive officer of Masqueology parent company Beauty Architects. “The mass market is looking for this technology at affordable prices. Mass customers are more savvy about technology now because of the Internet and social media.” To suit a broader customer base, Masqueology had to slash prices, but it sought not to make sacrifices while doing so. At prestige retailers, it’s masks were $8 to $12 per sheet and, today, the masks are available for $2.50 to $4 per sheet. Although they’re cheaper, Ha emphasized the products haven’t changed. “Because of the volume, we could bring down our costs and the price,” he explained. “We bring high quality products to the mass market.” As Masqueology widens its retail distribution, it’s also widening its merchandise assortment. Masks developed to improve hair are due out next month. Ha detailed there will be three hitting Wal-Mart shelves that are designed to hydrate, volumize and remedy damage. “After you wash your hair, you put them over your hair. They’re almost like a turban. It’s a specially made foil with ingredients inside,” said Ha. “You keep them on for 15 to 20 minutes and, after you finish, you take them off and wash off the formula. It’s a deep treatment.” In January, Masqueology is pushing beyond masks with skin-care products including Bubble Cleanser and Hydro Booster Sleeping Cream. Of the former, Ha expounded, “Once this product gets in contact with oxygen, it bubbles up. It’s a light exfoliation, and it cleanses your face. The bubbles help the formula penetrate deep so you get all the dirt out.” Of the latter, he continued, “You put it on your face, and you sleep with it on all night. That is what’s trending right now. It’s all about leaving the product on overnight to really moisturize your skin.” Masqueology is on course to generate $15 million in retail sales over the next year, and Ha indicated that figure could mount if the brand enters additional retail accounts. He’s in talks with large chains interested in giving customers the latest in South Korean skin-care with Masqueology. Beauty Architects’ mission is to leverage South Korean beauty innovation for release in the U.S. “We talk with the chemists and factories all the time…to see what new technologies there are going forward, and we gather all that information together to see how the market is moving,” Ha said. “We sometimes even bring technologies to the market before the trend is actually there. My goal is to be a trendsetter.” You're missing something!

First up is a deal from Kapow toys for those living in the United Kingdom. Among the long list of figures currently for sale at Kapow are the Combiner Wars sets of Computron, G2 Bruticus, and G2 Menasor, which are currently going for £75, £70, and £50 respectively. Also included are big sales on Titans Return guys, which include £12 deluxes. There are numerous other deals on older figures as well as Masterpiece figures and Platinum sets, so head on over anc go get yourself some new figures! Combiner Wars Boxsets page: https://www.kapowtoys.co.uk/sale.html?p=4 Titans Return deluxes, Masterpiece, Platinum page: https://www.kapowtoys.co.uk/sale.html?p=5 Up next are a pair of deals for the United States that at first appeared to be local sales but now appear to be widespread deals. Up first is Walmart, which appears to be rolling back all Titans Return deluxes to a mere $9.88. This has been reported by at least 3 different members in different parts of the United States, so it would seem that all Walmarts, or at least most of them, are rolling back those deluxes. You can find a photograph that was shared to us by member Mangamike that was also confirmed by member Emerje and D-Maximus_Prime for the prices below. Up next for Americans comes news from Toys R Us, which has started some deals on Transformers that include, among other things, a deal on normally $9.99 legends class dudes now being on sale 2 for $15, saving you $5. The link is below. Also, Transformers Robots in Disguise Warrior class figures are now on rollback to $9.99, down from the regular price of $14.99, and there will be a deal starting October 27 where you can spend $100 and get $10 off your entire order, or you can get $15 off your whole $100 or more order with your TRU card in store. Those images are also posted below. http://www.toysrus.com/promo/index.jsp? ... =112111726 Also thrown into the random set of deals that is rocking the web right now is news that Combiner Wars Computron is not only available on Amazon, as previously reported, for $80, but it appears Walmart has dropped him down too, as found below. https://www.walmart.com/ip/Transformers ... k/51997465 And to finally wrap up the deals, Hasbro Toy shop is offering a deal of $10 off and $40 or more order on their website using the code "OPTIMUS2016" as well as 20% off orders when you sign up to get email alerts from them, both for a very limited time. You can go to HTS below: http://www.hasbrotoyshop.com/en/htsusa So, now that you have the low down on all the deals going on around you, it's time to Rock and Roll Out to your local stores and see if you can't hunt down some good figures for cheap! We would like to thank the following Seibertronians and sources for their support in finding all these deals and confirming them as widespread: Emerje, Collectotron, Kyleor, Mangamike, AzT, and D-Maximus_Prime.

BTW, I mentioned this on the Toy Haul thread a few days ago, but probably should've put it here. Just to piggyback off the Target 20% off coupon: "Also, for anyone interested, in addition to the 20% discount on Target toys, they also have a 10% off wish list items. You need to download their mobile app to get a unique 1 time code. But it works and you can stack it with the 20% off. Snagged the coneheads for $59 cuz of tax. The bad news is that Target doesn't have a lot on their website. They do have Computron, which should work out to a little under $80 after tax." Because 20% off is good, but stacking another 10% off is better. That's how I got the seekers for $59 after tax. Also, I just noticed that CW Computron on Amazon has slipped to $73.05 as of this writing, and it was $74 when I started typing. Would love to see this slip into the $50s so I can pick it up for the hands and feet, sell off the bots. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011MIX0CI/re ...

Black Friday sales have been interfering with Thanksgiving since 2013, and the most popular stores will be open.  By Rebecca Lehmann, Brad's Deals October 22, 2016 Save for later Saved Holiday shoppers wait in the rain outside a Best Buy in Lawrence, Kan. last year Orlin Wagner/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Malls may close, but the most popular stores aren't likely to give up their foothold on Thanksgiving's turf anytime soon. Looking to history for guidance Taking at look at what Black Friday hours the top players have kept over the last nine years, we can see the long, slow march into Thursday. Click to view the chart  Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. This should surprise absolutely no one who's paid even the smallest bit of attention to  Black Friday over the years, but the visual is striking in that it shows that Black Friday sales have been interfering with Thanksgiving dinner since 2013. That's when  Walmart,  Best Buy and  Toys R Us all crossed over into hours traditionally reserved for Americans' evening meals. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/15 It's telling that after three years of public backlash, with the exception of  Staples, the merchants in our chart haven't pulled back at all. On the contrary, it seems as though they've settled in. The message is clear: Outrage takes a backseat to profitability. Smaller stores will close in greater numbers. Sure, the smaller stores you typically find inside malls are more likely to close, partly under pressure from so many malls across the country that have  effectively made that decision for them. For the vast majority of these stores, you can start shopping their Black Friday sales online at midnight on Thanksgiving morning, anyway, and save all of your crowd-fighting energy for bigger fish. We'll see more mid-tier stores retreat to Black Friday. And we may see more mid-tier defections, like  Office Depot, which followed Staples' lead after watching them closely last year. Likewise, we expect to see more sporting goods stores closing after  REI's wildly popular anti-Black Friday campaign. As heartening as that seems to the anti-Black Thursday crowd, these stores never have been the kind of stores that anyone was really excited to camp out for or hit up at 2am after an exhausting run through Walmart's Black Friday gauntlet. Light foot traffic in the wee hours ultimately doesn't justify the cost of keeping the lights on overnight. The big boxes and major department stores will stick to Thanksgiving open times. But it's  Macy's that's made it clear that the Thanksgiving status quo isn't going anywhere when they announced plans to open at 5pm on Thursday, an hour earlier than last year. There's no retreat happening here. Macy's feels no pressure from the malls since their stores are typically anchors with their own entrances. It doesn't matter if shoppers are angry, just so long as they show up with cash in hand. So in the end, we don't expect to see any earth-shattering announcements from the likes of Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Kohl's. Forget caving to public pressure – they know that shoppers are at their beck and call. If you want a shot at a stellar 4K TV doorbuster, you'll suck it up and be there. Even if your heart is full of resentment. 2016 Black Friday Store Hours Predictions There are our predictions for the Black Friday store hours at some of the most popular merchants. Best Buy - Thursday at 5pm Best Buy has been holding steady at 5pm for a couple years now, and we think they'll stay put. Home Depot - Friday at 6am Home Depot has opened at 6am on Black Friday for many years now. Any change is very unlikely. JCPenney - Thursday at 2pm JCPenney has been pushing earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving for awhile, casting about for an optimal start time. Kmart - Thursday at 7pm There's been very little consistency to Kmart's hours over the last few years. In 2014, they had doorbusters at both 6am and 7pm on Thursday. In 2015 dropped the 6am opening time but kept 7pm. Is that their sweet spot? It seems like a safe bet. Kohl's - Thursday at 6pm Another case of part consistency serving up a solid prediction. Macy's - Thursday at 5pm (CONFIRMED) This one isn't a prediction. Macy's confirmed the news to  CNBC on October 16th. We're treating it as a sign of things to come this season. Sears - Thursday at 6pm They've opened their doors at 6pm for two years running, and we're looking for three. Target - Thursday at 6pm If Walmart stays open on Thanksgiving as expected, there's no way that Target lets that go unanswered. Look for them to match whatever Walmart does. Toys R Us - Thursday at 5pm Toys R Us has been comfortably settled in at 5pm on Thursday for the past three years. Walmart - Thursday at 5pm or 6pm  Walmart has launched their sale at 6pm for the last three years, but we also think there's about a 50/50 chance that they may push it to 5pm for 2016 to steal some of Best Buy's thunder. Not having it? We're also keeping a list of  stores that will be closed on Thanksgiving. This article first appeared in Brad's Deals.

The world’s largest retailer is making an ambitious push into e-commerce in China and aims to deliver goods from its stores around the world to Chinese consumers within hours. Shoppers in select remote villages could even see their Walmart products being delivered by drones as part of a pilot project by its Chinese partner, JD.com. After unsuccessful efforts to scale up its own e-commerce network, Walmart launched several new initiatives this week through a tie-up with JD.com — China’s second-largest e-commerce website, with almost 200 million active users. With this partnership, Walmart said, it will now be able to deliver its goods, ranging from American vitamins to Japanese hand cream, to more than 90 percent of China’s 1.4 billion consumers. “There isn’t another country in the world that represents the kind of retail growth opportunity that China does, given the growth rate of the market itself and the consumer demand here,” Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, 50, said in an interview in Beijing. “We see opportunities to partner together to provide goods to our customers, to leverage our supply chain and their digital capabilities.” Walmart has a lot riding on its new online strategy aimed at getting a bigger slice of the world’s biggest e-commerce market. The retailer this month forecast that earnings will be flat the next two years while it invests in e-commerce. As it looks to China to fuel growth, Walmart will need to crack the Chinese online game more than ever. “They have found a clever way to leverage someone else’s network to help them sell things online, and it’s easier to jump on the back of JD.com,” said Chan Wai-Chan, a senior partner at Oliver Wyman’s Asia Pacific consumer practice. “They need to do something online to stop e-commerce from taking away their business. This is Walmart’s solution.” McMillon, who took over the top role in 2014, said the initiatives will keep the company’s China operations on track to contribute a quarter of its global retail growth in the next five years. That’s despite sluggish sales at Walmart’s retail stores in China while shoppers there increasingly turn to online websites for convenience. The strategy also gives it access to new Chinese consumers in smaller cities where Walmart doesn’t operate stores. “The scale of the last mile here in China is unique — the economics related to it are different,” McMillon said. “We could have built this ourselves, but everything requires investment. What we are doing is being very deliberate about where we’re putting our resources and being open to working with others.” To reach customers, Walmart is relying on JD.com and its extensive logistics and delivery network. JD.com founder and CEO Richard Liu said the company wants to build a fully automated delivery infrastructure that includes automated warehouses and distribution centers, self-driving delivery cars and drones. The company is delivering products to a limited number of remote villages in southern China by drones. Villagers who order Walmart and Sam’s Club products could see some goods flown to them, according to JD.com spokesman Josh Gartner. Walmart has struggled in China with multiple attempts to get a foothold in the market since its entry two decades ago. In 2007, it acquired Taiwanese chain Trust-Mart, though the company struggled to integrate it into its wider business. In the last few years, it’s pulled back on an expansion. The new strategy follows Walmart’s decision to sell its Chinese e-commerce platform Yihaodian in June in exchange for a 5 percent stake in JD.com.

Amazon Is Coming After the Grocery Business Bloomberg 10/22/2016 Spencer Soper and Craig Giammona © Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images An AmazonFresh truck. For years, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has followed Amazon.com Inc., putting inventory online and starting its own version of a marketplace where third-party merchants can sell their wares. Now Amazon is returning the favor. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 743.24 +24.17 +3.36% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 71.42 +0.93 +1.32% Cowen Group Inc COWN = 3.10 0.00 0.00% Whole Foods Market Inc WFM ▲ 32.24 +0.21 +0.66% The e-commerce behemoth is building pickup locations for groceries in Seattle that could open by the end of the year, according to someone familiar with the plans, echoing a strategy embraced by its chief brick-and-mortar rival. Delivering fresh food is complicated and the one thing keeping Amazon and other tech companies from disrupting the grocery business. Most consumers still get their milk, produce and meat from Wal-Mart, Kroger and other traditional grocers. But while e-commerce has yet to take hold in the $800 billion U.S. grocery market, Amazon is betting that could change as millennials accustomed to shopping online enter their prime food-buying years. “We know their best customers are willing to buy groceries online,” says Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge. “The onus is on Amazon to deliver because the demand is there.” Amazon began experimenting with the grocery business in 2007 when the company started AmazonFresh in the Seattle area, where the company is based. The service offered doorstep delivery of a limited selection of groceries, saving consumers driving time and the trouble of pushing a shopping cart around a store. The service has slowly expanded to 16 U.S. markets, including Los Angeles, New York and Boston. In June, the company rolled out the service to Prime subscribers in London, the first time it has been offered outside the U.S. Amazon currently offers same-day delivery of more than 130,000 items for 7 pounds ($8.58) per month on top of the cost of Prime.

Earlier this month, the company dropped the price from $299 a year to $15 a month in the U.S. -- $180 annually -- which proved immediately popular with shoppers and emboldened Amazon to accelerate its grocery ambitions, the person said. Delivering groceries to a customer’s home is an expensive and tricky proposition because fresh food spoils and can’t be left at the door like electronics or clothing. It has taken Peapod, the grocery delivery service owned by Royal Ahold, years to figure out how to deliver meat and produce profitably. Instacart, a San Francisco upstart that has partnered with Whole Foods, employs legions of shoppers who troll the aisles and deliver food to customers’ homes. It, too, has struggled to crack the code. Wal-Mart and Kroger have embraced the so-called click-and-collect model. Shoppers select their food online, and then workers fill the order and have it ready for pickup in the store parking lot. Besides side-stepping potential spoilage, Wal-Mart is hoping that shoppers will buy other things once they’ve made it as far as the parking lot. The service has only been around for a few years and is still rolling out nationally, so it’s too early to judge its popularity among the targeted demo of millennial mothers. Amazon, of course, doesn’t have much of a physical presence in the U.S. beyond a few bookstores. So the company is turning to pickup locations for its groceries. In Seattle, Amazon is building facilities that resemble gas stations, where shoppers could pull in and pick up their groceries. Seattle Planning Department documents reveal two similar projects in the city featuring car canopies. One of the sites is near a new Amazon Prime Now distribution hub where shoppers pick up packages ordered through the company’s one-hour delivery service, according to another person familiar with the matter. Construction crews were busy at both locations earlier this week. The company declined to comment. Amazon could also team up with local grocers to offer grocery pickup sites allowing it to expand the concept more quickly than it could by building new locations around the country, according to another person briefed on the plans. In the U.K., Amazon has pickup lockers at stores operated by the Morrisons supermarket chain where shoppers can pick up online orders. Under such partnerships, Amazon can also put the grocers’ inventory on its site. Meanwhile, Amazon is testing the appetite for grocery delivery among Prime subscribers who don’t pay extra for AmazonFresh. Prime members in Southern California and Indianapolis, for instance, can get fresh food delivered from Bristol Farms and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, via the Prime Now quick delivery service. Further grocer partnerships lets Amazon feel out new markets while competing with Whole Foods-Instacart. Ultimately, Amazon could integrate the Fresh and Prime Now services into one, one of the people said. Amazon’s push into fresh food is a direct threat to the established players. In the U.K., the company has entered a crowded market where Tesco Plc and web grocer Ocado Group Plc have been engaged in a price war for years. Ocado shares plummeted when Amazon announced its U.K. plans. In the U.S., the main tussle will play out between Amazon and Wal-Mart, which is the nation’s largest grocer, generates more than half its sales from selling food and uses cheap food to lure customers to its stores. Time and again, Amazon has shown itself willing to absorb losses while it builds a commanding market share. In groceries, the company is willing to break even in an effort to persuade shoppers to visit the site more often, one of the people said. The big question is whether sizable numbers of Americans will be prepared to purchase fresh food online, sight unseen. For many people, there’s no substitute for personally assessing the ripeness of an avocado or the thickness of a steak. Wal-Mart and other traditional grocers are spending billions to improve the shopping experience and doubling down on prepared meals and private label products you can’t get anywhere else. “There’s still going to be a place for stores that have a good selection and provide that experience,” says industry consultant Roger Davidson. Still, many experts said shoppers wouldn’t buy furniture or cars online. Turns out they will, and Amazon is betting the same will be true of fresh food. 2016 Bloomberg L.P.  Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Local allergy sufferers affected by EpiPen price spike By Teresa Ristow Sunday, October 23, 2016 Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn Discuss 9 comments Advertisement Steamboat Springs  All it took was a brownie with a walnut on top for Dan McNasby to learn about his 2-year-old son’s nut allergy about 11 years ago. “His mouth started itching and swelling up,” said McNasby, who now has three children, age 13, 9 and 8, who all have tested positive for peanut and tree nut allergies. As a precaution, McNasby keeps three or more Epipen epinephrine injector packs on hand or with his children. With the skyrocketing costs of the injectors during the past few years, McNasby is one of many who rely on the Epipen but have been forced to reconsider whether they can afford to purchase the injectors, which are used to treat emergency allergic reactions to nuts, bees and other allergens. McNasby said a two-pack, both of which might be used in a single extended emergency, now costs him about $414 through Wal-Mart after insurance. The retail price for a two-pen set has increased more than five-fold since 2007, when the Mylan corporation purchased the drug. A two-pack of EpiPens then retailed for about $100, and Mylan has hiked the price 17 times since, with the same pack now retailing for $608. The company came under fire earlier this year for the price increases, with critics accusing Mylan of corporate greed. A price-gouging lawsuit between one Ohio consumer is ongoing and may expand into a class-action suit. “It’s shocking that a company would put profit over lives,” McNasby said. “It’s just amazing that the government will allow a company to have a monopoly on this product.” McNasby said he’s tried to ask his children’s doctor for a prescription for a vial of epinephrine that he could inject himself — something that would cost much less — but the doctor refused. While McNasby's request might seem reasonable, Dr. Chris Speer, of Steamboat Medical Group, said it goes against the standard of care to allow patients to measure their own epinephrine during an emergency. “If something goes wrong, I would be held liable 100 percent,” Speer said. “In a high-pressure situation, it’s not as easy as it sounds.” Speer said the other physicians at Steamboat Medical Group agree they also wouldn’t prescribe epinephrine alone, though he added he sympathizes with patients affected by the increased prices for EpiPen. “I don’t have any control of how different drugs are priced. I find it super-frustrating,” Speer said. “You wouldn’t think it would cost nearly that much if they weren’t gouging people.” Dr. Kristen Fahrner said the increased price of EpiPens is a serious problem for her many patients with allergies, including those undergoing allergy shot treatments. “The cost is extraordinarily high and prohibitive,” said Fahrner, an otolaryngologist with a fellowship certification in allergy. Fahrner said the drug is much cheaper in Canada, but laws prohibit the drugs from being exported to the United States, something that could be changed legislatively. Fahrner said she’s heard that the release of a generic version of the EpiPen from Mylan or a new product from another company may be on the horizon, which could result in a less-expensive alternative. “Hopefully, there’s a fix soon,” she said.

Probably not Comments Harvey Lyon 3 weeks, 2 days ago My guess is Dr Speer's concerns could be allayed by a short course on giving injections conducted by a nurse and a signed "hold harmless" agreement. If memory serves Mr. McNasby is a two tour Afghanistan veteran who knows a thing or two about performing under pressure. But make no mistake, changing legislation will only happen if "we the people" demand it and are willing to make changes ourselves. Many of the "high prices" of certain products are the result of protective legislation demanded by special interests groups. These groups offer large numbers of cash donations to any politician who has a vote on their concerns. And it is "we the people" that require our representatives to raise ungodly amounts of $$ for elections. Amazing how many folks in theory rue the "Career Politician" who has been bought and paid for many times over but then refuse to consider a non-career individual who talks from his heart in a manner not nearly as polished as the career politician.

Its a total shame that our laws require us to become criminals. Its a total shame that our representatives, the very people we send to the State and Washington to represent us and our interests HAVE to become whore slaves to special interest pimps. These pimps work against the population that sent the representatives but if not for their money the representative would never have gotten his message out and been elected in the first place. Imagine a fellow running for office who says "Nothing is Free", "For a Nation to Survive every citizen must take care of him/her self and have a little left over to help a neighbor in time of need". He/she would never get elected.

I grew up in the Santa Clara valley and can remember the orchards of what was to become Apple and the other tech companies. Two interesting things about the tech industry. First, is that it didn't happen in the valley's main city because San Jose planning wanted to know about the business and it's long term success. So San Jose got an IBM facility (in the Almaden Valley), but all of the businesses that were nothing startups are located in Cupertino, City of Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, Mountain View and so on. All of those other places other than San Jose would allow commercial buildings based upon X square feet and having enough parking, but without caring what business would occupy it. Second, the tech industry has moved too fast to have serious government regulation. Government had no chance at moving fast enough to define a personal computer and attempt to require ergonomic designs, required features or anything else. So while landline phones have been regulated into featureless relics, largely unregulated smartphones have become modern marvels. Watch science fiction like Star Trek set in 2265 AD and wonder why they use crappy 1990s communications devices. Look what is about to happen to our building codes. They are going to require all new construction is sufficiently energy efficient which is expected to jack up construction costs by 20%. Only part of the costs will be the added improvements themselves, but now there should be yet more things to be inspected. So far more days where construction is stopped to wait for required inspection. So instead of a contractor taking a video of their work as a record to homeowner of superior construction, everyone sits waiting for the government inspector. With this energy efficient building costs, we are probably pricing out 75% of the population from ever having a chance at buying a new house. Meanwhile, the additional new essentially fireproofing of multi-family unit should be expected to prevent any new apt supply coming onto the market for less than $1,500 a month.

Upvote 0 Post reply Please Login and/or Verify your account to reply Sign in to suggest removal Scott Wedel 3 weeks ago Jim, It is what happens when government creates certain incentives and market protection. I believe that Canada has approved the Epipen competitor that was also approved in Europe. So Canada government, which is allowed to negotiate with drug makers, can tell Mylan that Epipens must be price competitive or they will select their competitor as the exclusive option for Canadians covered by government health insurance.aka the entire country. Rest of the world didn't grant sweeping patents to Mylan for the Epipen design for what is generally viewed as existing for decades and then have a FDA basically say any competitor must work exactly like an Epipen. That is a government one two creating a monopoly for Mylan.

Upvote 0 Post reply Please Login and/or Verify your account to reply Sign in to suggest removal Scott Wedel 2 weeks, 6 days ago Jim, Mylan's patents have nothing to do with the drug, but with the design of the pen itself that injects the drug. The pen's design has nothing that any observer of mechanical engineering would say is new or particularly clever. It has some design so that it is easy to inject the entire dose into the leg muscle. The US Patent Office basically gave Mylan a patent on the design of the pen. And then FDA has decided that any one self administrating pen has to work the same as the Epipen. That combo has made it impossible for competitors. Other countries including the EU, refused to give a broad patent to Mylan and refused to say a competitor must work exactly the same. Thus, they have an approved competitor.

 Text Size: A | A FULTON COUNTY  When Gov. Andrew Cuomo closed the Tryon Juvenile Detention Facility in 2011, Fulton County and the surrounding area lost 325 jobs and an estimated $15,000,000 in wages spent in the local economy, according to an estimate from the county planning department. The Gloversville Water Dept. and the Gloversville-Johnstown Joint Wastewater Treatment Plant also lost a combined $170,000 in annual revenue, they said. But while similar youth detention facilities across the state were shuttered and remained closed, officials in Fulton County had something different in mind for the Tryon facility. They asked the state to turn the property over to them so they could convert it into a business park. “Fulton County government took the initiative,” said James Mraz, Executive Director of the FUlton County Industrial Development Agency. “After a couple years worth of back and forth this entire facility was deeded over to the county’s industrial development agency.” The county, through a combination of grants and matching funds, has so far put over $4 million into the site. They built a ring access road throughout the 515-acre shovel-ready site, known as the Tryon Technology Park, as well as a 300,000-gallon water tower and pump station to improve water pressure and supply. PHOTO: Peter R. BarberGazette Photographer Head Cultivator Chris Schmitt looks over drying marijuana plant at Vireo Health at Tryon Technology Park in Perth on Thursday. Their plan is to tear down nearly all of the many structures that were part of the detention facility, save for one 15,000-square-foot facility they hope to convert into a regional business training and incubator center. That facility, said Mraz, will help new businesses get off the ground and provide space for them to try out ideas. Mraz said county officials felt the site would make a good business park because of its proximity to New York’s interstate system and the presence of existing utility hookups. “There’s already gas, electric, water and sewer service here,” said Mraz. “When you’re developing shovel-ready sites that’s usually the biggest cost, is getting that infrastructure, which is integral to developing the site. It was already here.” He also touted the county’s access to markets. “Because of our proximity to interstates, this county, a four-hour drive in any direction has access 70 million potential customers, and that’s huge,” said Mraz, pointing to retail giant Wal-Mart opening a food distribution center in the Johnstown industrial park as evidence of Fulton County’s advantageous location. “They did it for a reason,” he said. “Strategically it was centrally located to a geographic area that they wanted to serve and could serve given the interstate system here. Our proximity to markets is as good if not better than most other areas.” Mraz also touted the relative remoteness of Tryon Technology Park as an asset. “It’s a very peaceful campus setting. So part of our marketing strategy is we’re saying ‘come here, take a 180 degree turn away from a high-cost, high-stress business life,’” he said. “We think it’s a positive thing. And that’s how we’re trying to market it.” Selling prospective businesses on the property is something Mraz, who doubles as the county’s planning director, said is a daily task for him and other officials. “That’s a work task that we’re on every day,” said Mraz. “This business is very competitive.” Mraz said the county is courting a prospect now that’s looking at sites all over the northeast. “So every time we’re competing against other great sites, and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose,” he said. “I can’t say when we’re going to have [tenants]; all I can say is every day we’re trying.” The Tryon Tech Park already has one tenant, Vireo Health of New York, which is one of the few companies allowed to grow and manufacture medical cannabis for use by patients in New York. Vireo’s scientific director Eric Greenbaum said on a recent tour of the facility that the company is one of just five allowed to operate in the state, and while regulations in New York are more stringent than in other states, he sees a bright future for the industry in the state. Greenbaum said New York’s marijuana program is a “really medical model” as opposed to more recreation-based models in Colorado and California, which could actually greatly help the medical cannabis industry nationwide to serve patients as opposed to casual users. “[New York’s] is a model that in my opinion will serve as the template for a federal regulatory framework similar to what the FDA would do,” said Greenbaum. “Compared to California, where the medical model is basically a proxy for adult and recreational use...the fact that we don’t sell [marijuana bud], we only sell carefully formulated medicines...it’s just indicative of the approach that New York is taking.” Vireo provides customers with carefully formulated medicines in three different forms, said Greenbaum: oil (for vaporizing), a capsule or an oral solution. The company has five brands that run the gamut from having very high tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations and very low cannabidiol (CBD) concentrations, and vice versa. PHOTO: Peter R. BarberGazette Photographer Head Cultivator Chris Schmitt looks at buds of marijuana plants at Vireo Health at Tryon Technology Park in Perth on Thursday. Cannabidiol is a compound that is useful for seizure disorders as well as pain, said Greenbaum. It’s also been shown to mitigate the sometimes dysphoric effects of THC, which can include paranoia and anxiousness. THC is the chemical produced by the glands of a marijuana plant that is most responsible for the euphoric effect – or high – found in users. Greenbaum said the company settled at Tryon Technology Park as part of the licensing agreement it struck with the state, but that he and Vireo CEO Kyle Kingsley are native New Yorkers who are passionate about jumpstarting local economies wherever they can in the state. “We knew that the state was really focused on repurposing this facility; we knew there was a commitment to building up the Tryon Technology Park to be a center for tech development as well as job growth for this region,” said Greenbaum. And while the state’s regulation of medical cannabis is a bit strict now, said Greenbaum, there’s reason to believe it will broaden in the near future. “It’s a pretty limited patient market right now; there’s been some discussion with the legislators and regulators to expand some of the qualifying patient conditions to include chronic pain,” said Greenbaum. “Chronic pain is one of the indications for which we have the most evidence of efficacy with medical cannabis. So we’re hoping that that goes through. We think it will be really good for the people of New York.” PHOTO: Peter R. BarberGazette Photographer Marijuana plants at Vireo Health at Tryon Technology Park in Perth on Thursday. Greenbaum said Vireo is “optimistic” the regulations will be expanded within the next quarter. “Not that we’ll be able to implement it, but we’re optimistic we’ll see an announcement within the next 90 days,” said Greenbaum. Relaxing them, he said, would “open up access a lot, and will be good for growth and patients as well.” And growth is what county officials are hoping for as well with the Tryon Technology Park. Mraz said the capital projects at the site are in their final stages, and the way in which the county has been able to repurpose what would have become an abandoned property is a unique and inspiring way to create more jobs and commerce in the area. “It’s just going to take some time,” he said.

These are good year-round, but they should especially come in handy during the upcoming holiday rush.

Enter Canopy, a human-curated selection of the most unique fashion, lifestyle, and home decor products available on Amazon. Its design-focused ethos is obvious from its uncluttered UI to its tasteful picks, which range from an $11 USB plate to an $1,800 platform bed.

The app is supported by most of the national and big-boxed retailers you can think of — Walmart, Aldo, Jamba Juice, etc. — so you’re bound to get some money back through this app. That said, you’ll need to accumulate at least $20 in your Ibotta account before you can transfer your money to PayPal, Venmo, or a gift card. Download now from: iTunes Google Play Tictail Store 456More If you’re looking for handcrafted artisan work from around the world, look no further than Tictail.

Here you’ll find more 100,000 storefronts, including everything from exclusive small-brand fashion lines and housewares to funny enameled pins and brooches. The app also compiles bargains, but remains far more concerned with bringing unique indie work to a wider audience. It’s a custom outlet for people making items they love, and you get some cool stuff without putting down your phone. Everyone wins. Download now from: iTunes Google Play Donde Fashion Donde FashionMore Another iPhone-exclusive app, Donde helps you shop for women’s fashion using simple symbols instead of annoying words. If you read all day at work, perhaps your brain needs a break. It’s also helpful if you want a particular neckline or hem, but can’t remember the name of the style. After all, vocabulary limitations shouldn’t stop you from finding exactly what you want. Items are grouped together by type, color, and pattern, with options to filter them by budget and brand. Donde Fashion presents a pretty picture, and orders ship straight from the brand in question. Download now from: iTunes Spring Cash 2More This app’s name is misleading; the gear on Spring is not limited to light, seasonal wear. The app hosts clothes, shoes, and accessories for men and women, as well as lifestyle and beauty products to keep you looking sharp. Spring offers pre-designed bundles for the holidays as well, such as the “Wanderer Kit,” a package that includes a dopp bag, charging cable, and a travel size grooming set outfitted with a cleanser and shave cream. Free shipping and returns are always welcome in a shopping app and Spring offers that, too. Download now from: iTunes Google Play Shopami Crew 1More Shopami gathers all your shopping coupons in a single place. It’s annoying to go shopping only to later discover a promotional deal sitting in your inbox. With Shopami, you simply add the email you use for shopping and turn on notifications, ensuring the app will let you know when you’re near a store with an offer in play. Shopami will also let you know when you’re about to miss out on an offer expiring soon. You can turn off notifications if you hate being nagged, too, and the app will still let you know about offers expiring that day. The brand list is also broad, allowing you to skim coupons from the likes of Foot Locker, Lowes, Zales, and others. Download now from: iTunes Google Play Keep Shopping Shop 345More Keep’s innovation is more in its styling and curation than any new access. The app presents a broad selection of housewares and categories, as well as guest-curated collections. This app is good if you like to keep your deals under $50, or if you’d rather shop based on the type of person you’re shopping for. Thinking of getting something for your girlfriend? Try “Gifts for Her,” where you can find a bunch of things she might like, such as The Big Book of Chic or some jewelry. Download now from: iTunes Google Play Wish Cliff 2More Wish is like eBay’s prettier, younger sister. It offers similar items with a better display. What’s more, the way the app handles profiles is more transparent than other sites. It tracks your searches in whatever account you have linked to it, and categorizes them as tags. In your profile, you can see your favorite tags, which helps determine what shows up in your main feed. Other sites use a similar method, but they often don’t show them to you or automatically organize your wishlists the way Wish does. Another plus? It’s available for Windows users. Download now from: iTunes Google Play Stylect Muse35More If you’re looking for shoes, look no further than Stylect. It pitches itself as the app to find “all the shoes in the world,” and given it presents more than 10,000 brands, it probably not much of an exaggeration. It currently only supports women’s shoes — sorry, guys — but what they do have ranges from inexpensive to exquisite. It also includes all the filters anyone could ask for to help narrow down the huge selection of footwear. Download now from: iTunes Google Play Mallzee Final 456More If you like the buzz of going to a physical mall, or read fashion mags for a different kind of buzz, Mallzee could be for you. It tracks trends from more than a hundred big clothing brands, allowing you to discover the newest collections and the freshest threads. The app also touts feeds you can personalize for events or specific items, along with price drop notifications for the latter.

These movements are all reactionary — characterized, first and foremost, by their rejection of the present. They are revolutionary in effect, boldly heralding swift and comprehensive change — but they are wary of progress. They have vision, but it is a nostalgic one, aimed over the shoulder. The usual ideological categories seem inadequate to account for them. Mark Lilla takes on the challenge of making sense of them. In The Shipwrecked Mind, he attempts to sketch out the nature and some of the sources of reactionary politics. All but one of the essays collected in The Shipwrecked Mind first appeared in the NYRB. They make rather odd book-fellows: three profiles; two round-up reviews; a report from the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo shooting; and a meditation on Don Quixote. One piece in particular — about the use leftist academics have made of the apostle Paul — bears only the most tenuous connection to the book’s ostensible theme. Maybe it was included to pad the volume out to its still-slim 144 pages? At that length, the book could hardly be a full history of reaction. To be fair, Lilla himself tries to tamp down our expectations: The Shipwrecked Mind makes a very modest start. It is the fruit of my own aleatory reading over the past two decades and offers a series of examples and reflections rather than a systematic treatise on the concept of reaction. Why enter the field with so small an offering? Lilla thinks any attention to reaction is worthwhile, because it fills a void: “We have theories about why revolution happens, what makes it succeed, and why, eventually, it consumes its young. We have no such theories about reaction, just the self-satisfied conviction that it is rooted in ignorance and intransigence, if not darker motives.” Lilla’s insistence that he is bravely exploring terra incognita highlights a bizarre silence that symbolizes the book’s shortcomings. That silence reverberates with Lilla’s unnamed predecessor. If you ask a person well-read in political theory to recommend a book on reactionary politics, they will almost certainly mention Corey Robin’s The Reactionary Mind. It was published in 2011 and stirred up a controversy. Lilla himself reviewed it in the NYRB and subsequently engaged in a brief polemic with Robin in the magazine’s correspondence pages. We can be sure he’s aware of the other book. But nowhere in his own does he mention Robin, much less cite him. Lilla prefers to shadowbox with his opponent. They disagree about at least two things. First, the motivations of reactionaries: Robin understands them to be motivated by the loss of power. In his book, he says reaction is about the “experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back.” By contrast, Lilla believes reactionaries are motivated by a philosophy of history that expresses itself as nostalgia. Second, the relationship between conservatism and reaction: Robin sees conservatism — for all its ideological talk of human nature, fiscal prudence, and small government — as, at heart, a reactionary movement. Lilla, though, writes, “Reactionaries are not conservatives. This is the first thing to be understood about them.” This is strangely categorical. Does he think no reactionaries are conservatives? (A few pages later he calls the National Review a reactionary magazine. They would be surprised to discover they’re not conservative.) Perhaps that demarcation explains the odd choices Lilla makes of exemplary reactionaries. The first three essays profile Franz Rosenzweig, Leo Strauss, and Eric Voegelin. While the last two of these fit his account of reaction well, Rosenzweig is an odd person with whom to begin. A Jewish philosopher-theologian, his major work, The Star of Redemption, attempts to reconcile and distinguish the religious purposes of Judaism and Christianity. Rosenzweig argued that Judaism’s rituals and beliefs have reference to eternity, Christianity’s to history. Thus, Jews should, in Lilla’s paraphrase, “live in relation to the past but only in the sense that each Jewish holiday reenacts an old drama that bears more relation to eternity than time.” Lilla apparently believes this idea is enough to brand Rosenzweig a reactionary. I find this hard to swallow. Liturgies oriented to eternity are very different from speeches extolling the good old days, and recommendations for a minority religious group are very different from reactionary aspirations for entire societies. One can easily imagine how Rosenzweig’s ideas could become reactionary. If they were wedded to a call for actions beyond the private observance of law and ritual, then they might take on a more frightening aspect. Imagine his words combined with a call to proselytize by force, or a call to revanchism — the reconquest of a lost and supposedly ancestral territory — as in certain strands of Zionism or in the ideology of ISIS. But as it stands, why nominate Rosenzweig a reactionary, when someone like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is available and more clearly fits the bill? My suspicion is that some of these essays are only “about” reactionary politics in retrospect, threaded onto the necklace of that theme for the purposes of putting together a book. But that’s not true of every chapter. Two essays in particular speak directly to Lilla’s problematic. “From Luther to Walmart” is a round-up review of several books of Roman Catholic history. Lilla connects them to the venerable tradition of religious counterrevolution, an intellectual movement that reared its nostalgic head in the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1789: The golden age of lay Catholic historiography was the nineteenth century, when counterrevolutionary thinkers such as Bonald, the young Lamennais, Maistre, and Donoso Cortés refined the World We Have Lost narrative that has nourished reactionary political movements ever since. But in the twentieth century lay and clerical writers developed a kinder, gentler variation of it that has not lost its appeal among Catholics. Let’s call it the Road Not Taken. These counterrevolutionaries are commonly considered the fountainheads of reaction as a political tradition. Lilla’s essay draws lines between their seething polemics and the gentler, but no less reactionary revisionism of contemporary religious historiography. The second essay that tackles the theme head-on is “Paris, January 2015.” That was the month, you may recall, of the Charlie Hebdo shootings. Lilla describes how this event served as an opportunity for a cohort of French reactionaries, already well established in their own camp, to trumpet their apocalyptic vision to “tens of thousands of French readers.” He focuses in particular on Éric Zemmour’s polemical history of postwar France, Le Suicide français (2014), and Michel Houellebecq’s novel Soumission (2015). Nowhere else in The Shipwrecked Mind does Lilla’s vision of reaction or its relevance to the present appear with greater force: it is the most compelling part of the book. Here for example, on Zemmour: [F]or an ideology to really reshape politics it must cease being a set of principles and become instead a vaguer general outlook that new information and events only strengthen. You really know when an ideology has matured when every event, present and past, is taken as confirmation of it. The French right, with Éric Zemmour’s help, is advancing on this trajectory today. Le Suicide français gives readers a common set of enemies; it provides a calendar of their crimes; it confirms a suspicion that there must be some connection among these crimes; and it stirs in them an outraged hopelessness — which in contemporary politics is much more powerful than hope. All this at a time when the country is trying to wrap its collective mind around one of the great tragedies and challenges in recent history. Lilla’s love for French culture and concern for the trajectory of its politics is palpable. Here he takes a text with a direct influence on the national zeitgeist and illuminates its significance as an instance of reaction. In this essay, I saw a glimpse of the book this could have been. But we get much too little of that book in The Shipwrecked Mind, and the little we get is exclusively focused on Lilla’s thesis about the roots of reaction in the philosophy of history. In an afterword, he returns to this idea, presenting his argument for why we should not adopt the reactionary’s view of history. To tell the reactionary kind of history, you must believe in “epochs” — the golden epoch of the past, the evil epoch of today. But “epochal thinking is magical thinking.” Reifying history gives rise to a further illusion — that a great and terrible rift divides the present from the past: Apocalyptic history itself has a history, which stands as the record of human despair. The expulsion from Eden, the destruction of the First and Second Temples, the crucifixion of Jesus, the sack of Rome, the murders of Hussein and Ali, the Crusades, the fall of Jerusalem, the Reformation, the fall of Constantinople, the English Civil Wars, the French Revolution, the American Civil War, World War I, the Russian Revolution, the abolition of the caliphate, the Shoah, the Palestinian Nakba, “the Sixties,” September 11 […] Because the reactionary is so convinced that all his present tribulations stem from one or another of these decisive events, he is inclined to imagine that an equally climactic event, perhaps one instigated or carried out by him and his friends, will set the world right: “the apocalyptic imagination […] is inclined to dream of a second event that will blow open the door of paradise.” One problem with this account of reaction is that it seems too broad. What Lilla calls “apocalyptic thinking” tends to characterize the mindset of any group seeking a change from bad times. One finds this kind of thinking among Obama supporters in 2008 or Trudeau supporters in 2015 — people reeling from the catastrophes of previous regimes and putting their hope in a charismatic leader to bring back prosperity, peace, and the respect of the world. Are these groups really no different from Trump supporters in 2016? Lilla’s definition is too ambiguous to pick out the specific movements he has in mind. That, or it becomes an accidental criticism of representative democracy as such, a form of government whose periodic elections virtually require apocalyptic thinking to involve the apathetic public. The same problem — a definition of reaction so abstract and formal that it applies to things that aren’t reactionary — makes a hash of Lilla’s claims about the history of the movement. In his preface, he pays lip service to the widely accepted view that reactionary politics entered world history in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Yet critics — and prophets — have been telling the kind of story Lilla identifies as reactionary pretty much as long as stories have been told. What is it about such stories that makes them specifically reactionary — i.e., specific to the tradition of counterrevolution that followed 1789? Ironically, Lilla himself demonstrates how historically imprecise his definition really is: Cultural pessimism is as old as human culture and has a long history in Europe. Hesiod thought that he was living in the Age of Iron; Cato the Elder blamed Greek philosophy for corrupting the young; Saint Augustine exposed the pagan decadence responsible for Rome’s collapse; the Protestant reformers felt themselves to be living in the Great Tribulation; French royalists blamed Rousseau and Voltaire for the Revolution; and just about everyone blamed Nietzsche for two world wars. So is reaction a tradition stemming from 1789, or a category of cultural pessimism pervasive from ancient societies to the present? This is only a problem because Lilla’s entire explanation of reaction amounts to saying it’s an idea about history. To explain the self-proclaimed reactionaries of, for instance, the contemporary American alt-right purely in terms of the philosophy of history is to over-intellectualize them. Reaction is an ideology heavily larded with emotion. It seethes with resentment and disgust, insecurity and, yes, also nostalgia. To boil these emotions down to nostalgia, and then to abstract from nostalgia to the philosophy of history, is unhelpfully reductive. I don’t doubt that the “intellectual proxy wars over the present” that Lilla describes are real, but epochal thinking doesn’t make you vote for Trump or run away to Syria to restore the caliphate. These are revanchist revolutionaries, attempting to claw back lost privilege, especially privilege lost to those they regard as their historical inferiors. Resentment, in other words, is at least as important a motivation for reaction as nostalgia. Whether out of a narrow interest in explaining politics through historiography, or simply because he didn’t get around to it in this brief collection, Lilla’s book falls short of a complete analysis. That doesn’t make it useless, but it’s not the first word it pretends to be, nor should it be the last. ¤ Robert Minto is a writer and philosopher.

On Wisconsin: World pumpkin record poised to fall in Richland Center Oct 23, 2016 1 Buy Now JOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL Bernadette Maglish, organizer of an event to set a new world record for carved pumpkins in a line, surveys about 3,200 pumpkins in the parking lot of the Walmart in Richland Center. The current record is 2,015 pumpkins but Maglish is hoping to smash the record next weekend with up to 4,000 carved pumpkins. RICHLAND CENTER — Dave Stumpf of Kimberly spent $4,000 in 2013 to build a castle using 17,384 Lincoln Logs. Deb Hoffmann of Waukesha has more than 11,485 pieces of Winnie the Pooh and Friends memorabilia, while in Poynette, Big Jake, at 15 years old, 2,600 pounds and nearly 6 feet, 11 inches tall, is the world’s largest living horse. And let’s not forget Don Gorske. Over the last 40 years, the Fond du Lac man has consumed more than 28,000 Big Macs. Wisconsin is well represented in the Guinness Book of World Records, and another entry is looming. High school students, church groups, young children, older adults and anyone else who wants to be a part of history will be armed this week in Richland Center with spoons, knives and cordless drills in order to carve more than 3,200 pumpkins. Once the guts are scooped and each pumpkin has a face, the basketball-sized vegetables will be placed Sunday in a line at Krouskop Park along the flood-prone Pine River in an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the most carved pumpkins in a line or chain. Yes, there is such a thing. The current record of 2,015 pumpkins in a line was set almost a year ago by the Eniwa Happy Halloween Executive Committee in Eniwa, Hokkaido, Japan. The effort shattered the previous mark of 1,301 jack-o-lanterns set in 2013 (the category’s first year) in the Canadian city of Calgary. Richland Center intends to smash the record. The local Walmart has donated the pumpkins, but attendees can also bring their own. Depending on the turnout, the record could hit 4,000 pumpkins, said Bernadette Maglish, the event’s energetic and optimistic organizer. “We’re excited,” Maglish said, as she looked over 80 bins with about 40 pumpkins each last week. “Everyone is ready to carve.” This Thursday, about 450 students from Richland Center High School will take their shot at carving what could be about 1,000 pumpkins. Other groups and individuals will carve on Wednesday and Friday, with the primary carving day scheduled for Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the park. The hope is to have all of the pumpkins carved by the end of the day Saturday so that on Sunday the finished products can be carefully lined up (they must be touching) and judged at 2 p.m. by a representative from Guinness. He will land in the park in a helicopter along with Mayor Paul F. Corcoran. +3  Buy Now Pumpkins are moved off a flatbed truck and into a city parks storage shed last week.

JOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL The festivities on Saturday and Sunday will include a food court, bouncy houses, live country music, a DJ, face painting and, on Sunday, a big-screen television in the gym of the nearby community center to watch the Green Bay Packers’ game against the Atlanta Falcons. Maglish has rounded up sponsors to help cover the costs, which include $10,000 to Guinness for the judge and rights to use logos and trademarks. Another $12,000 to $15,000 will go to local charities, including Passages, a women’s shelter for abused women and children; Lydia’s House, a homeless shelter; the Richland Center Food Pantry; the city’s parks department; and a community dog park under development that could open next spring. +3  Buy Now Bernadette Maglish, organizer of an event to set a new world record for carved pumpkins in a line, walks along the dike at Krouskop Park in Richland Center. Beginning Wednesday, the park will host pumpkin carving with judging for the world record on Sunday.  JOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL “It’s just a wonderful project for the whole community that Bernadette has put together,” said Shane Stibbe, Richland Center’s parks and recreation director. “Everybody’s talking about the pumpkin lady. It’s just a fun event.” Under the rules, each pumpkin must have a mouth, nose, eyes and eyebrows. When placed in the line, they all must be touching. Success will mean more than 2,000 people can say they helped set a record and join other notables in the book that celebrates human oddities and accomplishments, animals, food, speed and size. The book also includes another Wisconsin-based record that involves a line. In 2011, the Aluminum Association of America and a team of 60 volunteers, in 24 hours, created the world record chain of cans at the Brown County Fairgrounds in De Pere. It measured 5.37 miles and consisted of 66,343 drink cans. Pumpkin-related records in the book include those for the heaviest pumpkin (2,323 pounds), largest pumpkin pie (3,699 pounds), pumpkins carved by one person in one hour (109) and the most pumpkins carved simultaneously (1,060). Now, it appears Richland Center is about to join the list. Anyone who takes part can sign the bottom of their pumpkin and take it home after the event. Certificates with the Guinness logo commemorating the event will also be handed out to each participant. More information can be found on the event’s Facebook page or by calling the parks department at 608-647-8108, ext. 1. +3  Buy Now Shane Stibbe, director of the Richland Center Parks and Recreation Department, says the event this week to break a record for the most pumpkins in a line, has created excitement throughout the city. he's also expecting many people from out of town to take part in the event. JOHN HART, STATE JOURNAL Carving tools will be supplied, including cordless drills that will be used to help gut pumpkins and drill holes for eyes. Maglish said volunteers can also bring their own tools. Seeds from carving on Wednesday and Thursday will be saved in 5-gallon buckets, roasted and offered up on Saturday. But rounding up 3,000 pumpkins turned into a challenge after a frost earlier this year severely reduced pollination by bees and reduced the local pumpkin crop. Maglish initially thought she could get 1,000 pumpkins each from three area farms. Instead, she was told that would be a difficult order to fill. Don Fieldhouse, the manager of the Walmart, worked with his company to source the pumpkins from Frey Farms in Indiana. “It’s amazing that it’s even happening,” Maglish said. “Without Walmart stepping in this wouldn’t have happened.” Maglish grew up in Indiana and moved to Richland Center 18 years ago as a single mother. She operates a group home for adults with disabilities and works with hospice patients. The idea for the pumpkin record came about after speaking with Nancy Tiegs, a recently retired physical education and health teacher and lifelong resident of the city who has a massive Halloween display at her home each fall on East 7th Street. Tiegs, who will be honored this week for her displays, went to her computer and researched community pumpkin events. “I got online and started looking at Guinness World Records,” Tiegs said. “I (told Maglish), ‘I think this one the city can do.’ I know there’s a lot of kids who can carve and there are people in the community who can carve.” For more than 30 years,Tiegs has had one of the largest Halloween displays in the area, and for the last 15 years it has included over 100 carved pumpkins. She can hand out up to 900 treats each Halloween and have 2,000 to 3,000 people visit, but this year may be her last as she is looking for a home on a lake. Community events in Richland Center include Motorsports Mayhem in May, which features a demolition derby, truck and tractor pulls, and snowmobiles, ATV, dirt bike and truck and car drags. Churning Dirt is in July with a mud run, carnival and monster truck show, while the Hybrid Redneck Rally was earlier this month with mud racers, pulls and drag races. The community also hosts the state High School Rodeo championships; Thunder in the Hills, a huge fireworks display; and, from Thanksgiving through December, a holiday light display. This week’s pumpkin event could instantly be a major draw. “I think it’s going to get a lot of publicity,” said Sherry Klatt, the city’s tourism and events coordinator. “It’s going to draw a lot of people and put Richland Center on the map.” +6 Wing Tech Bikes adds gas and gears to Wisconsin bike market Jeff Adams of Belmont has created a motorized bike with multiple gears +6 On Wisconsin: After years of debate and study, bridge over St. Croix River nears completion Building an enormous span of concrete and steel over the pristine current of a National Scenic Riverway took time, legal battles, studies, politicking and what could end up being nearly $640 million. +8 On Wisconsin: Elk return to Jackson County but are a tough find Spotting a 700-pound elk in a 320-square-mile area isn’t a guarantee, but the animal is building excitement along the Interstate 94 corridor of Jackson County. +10 On Wisconsin: Feud closes Mullen's Dairy Bar in Watertown; new location sought The owner is looking for a new location after a dispute with the landlord. +4 Green County Cheese Days offers much but is still about the cheese The three-day event started Friday and features some of the best cheese in the world, including the winner of the World Championship Cheese Contest. +7 On Wisconsin: Johnson Creek domed and ready and more could be on the way The middle and high school open under five domes on the village's west side. +10 On Wisconsin: Brats, jambalaya and Lambeau LSU and Badgers fans combine for a tailgating extravaganza around storied Lambeau Field. +9 On Wisconsin: Butter plant expansion leads to demise of Hillsboro airport The airport is about to close to make way for a warehouse for Land O'Lakes +6 On Wisconsin: Beyond the stick at the Wisconsin State Fair The Horticulture, Crafts & Culinary Pavilion offers a throwback experience +6 Paul Filipowicz plays a mean guitar and spreads the news on the blues The town of Aztalan musician is in the Chicago Blues Hall of Fame +12 On Wisconsin: Cemetery restoration in Mineral Point takes patience, persistence and epoxy Old City Cemetery, established in 1838, had its last burial in 1908 and is Mineral Point's oldest cemetery.

Great Neck News Opinion Letters to the Editor What Does “Make America Great Again” Really Mean? By Letters To The Editor - October 23, 2016 0 69 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter This year, the message we hear perhaps far too often is “Make America Great Again.” I realize that this message can have many different meanings and applications. As a longtime resident of North Hempstead, I remember when shopping downtown in Great Neck, Manhasset or other communities meant thriving shops, with all kinds of businesses, from hardware stores and five-and-dimes to four-star restaurants. Then there was change—not necessarily progress, but change nevertheless. We, as a society, changed; we became more mobile, had more accessibility to areas beyond our immediate shopping neighborhoods. Changes to our shopping neighborhoods and habits began as the downtowns started to change, first, into different types of stores and services available, and now to many closed stores. Many now shop online, for various reasons—perhaps for economic benefit, as well as for convenience. Remember, we shopped within blocks of our neighborhood and, now as result of the Internet, there are no more parking problems, no more use of a car and related costs—just go online and shop. Shopping can be as simple as shopping from your desk for a variety of goods and services. Does one wonder why Macy’s and Best Buy are closing stores, why the downtown areas have so many vacancies and why stores like Saks Fifth Avenue has just one store on Long Island for almost three-million people? Even with Walmart and Target, Amazon and other online stores have proven shopping downtown and in malls has changed. Can revitalizing our downtown shopping really “Make America Great Again?” Will more manufacturing in the United States and the possibly related pollution of our waterways and air (remember manufacturing along the Hudson was common as was pollution) and selling more costly goods and services “Make America Great Again?” Is burning dirty fuel going to “Make America Great Again?” The auto industry has changed as there are more designers, assemblers and marketing companies rather than manufacturing companies, as it has been more cost-efficient to outsource manufacturing of many of the components that make up a finished automobile. Our economy is based on spending and shopping at businesses like Walmart and Amazon, as not everyone can shop at Saks or Bloomingdale’s. How do we change to buying “only” Made in America goods and services? Will pensions and social security and other fixed incomes need to be increased substantially? Will salaries increase across the board to cover the higher cost of labor, utilities and other costs related to Made in America, or will paying our domestic labor force less to be competitive make Made in America unaffordable to the very people who manufacture and live in the United States? Evolution of our resources to change will make America greater, as there is no greater country than ours, and we shouldn’t let anyone fool us into thinking differently. “United we stand, divided we fall.” The cry to make America great again fails on all accounts to consider the domino effect of altering our current economy and way of life. The world is changing and it’s changing rapidly and we must understand and accept these advancements. —Charles Schneider SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleDowntown Beautification Matching Grant Available Next articleSponsor A Tree: A Gift That Keeps Growing Letters To The Editor RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Columnists Take Me Out To The Ball Game Great Neck News Who Wants An Indoor Rec Center?

Florida Ave., Hemet Information: sprouts.com When Sprouts Farmers Market in Hemet opens on Wednesday, it will be three miles away from where it will close on Tuesday. Sprouts is relocating from State Street and Stetson Avenue to a revitalized shopping center on Florida Avenue. The new store will have the same staff as the store that is closing, plus additional hires, according to the Phoenix-based grocery chain. It will be almost twice as large as the one that is closing, occupying 30,000 square feet in a portion of what was once a Wal-Mart. A Burlington discount department store that officially opened Oct. 7 takes up the rest of the space. Features of the new store include: • A meat and deli service case with prepared side dishes, special meats and a juice and coffee bar. • An expanded produce department with more organic products. • An expanded vitamin department. Sprouts will celebrate the Florida Avenue opening with a 20 percent discount for the first 200 shoppers, dollar deals, coupons and free coffee and muffins, according to a news release. It has more than 250 stores in 13 states, with other Inland stores in Riverside, Corona, Rancho Cucamonga and Hemet. The grocer has signed on to anchor the Redlands Packing House District, a themed retail and restaurant center to be built at at Eureka Street and Stuart Avenue in Redlands. Construction of the center is expected to begin in January, with opening planned for late 2017. Sprouts describes itself as healthy grocery stores inspired by farmers markets. It is what experts call fresh format, a category that emphasizes produce and different selections from traditional supermarkets, often ethnic, natural or organic. Other fresh format stores in the Inland area include Barons Market in Temecula, Murrieta and Wildomar and the recently opened Simply Fresh in Corona. Sandra Emerson contributed to this report.

The Kansas City Star reports prosecutors in Kansas’ Johnson County charged 54-year-old Oleh Zhownirovych of Clinton, New Jersey, with felony aggravated battery and misdemeanor battery.

The woman screamed, and the man stopped. Police say people in the store helped the woman and held the man until officers arrived. The baby was not injured.

Andy Barr, R-Lexington, and Democratic challenger Nancy Jo Kemper. File photos. Herald-Leader Jonathan Palmer 1 of 3 i By John Cheves jcheves@herald-leader.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story On Monday, on the set of KET’s “Kentucky Tonight,” Nancy Jo Kemper will get her first chance to sit opposite U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, R-Lexington, the man against whom she spent most of this year campaigning. Barr has raised $2.2 million for his re-election, half of it from political action committees for banks, insurance companies, investment firms and others with a financial stake in his House votes. Separately, his leadership PAC has collected $240,275. He’s been able to buy plenty of advertising to promote himself while dodging live appearances with Kemper, his Democratic challenger. Barr seldom acknowledges Kemper outside of the attack ads he recently introduced. In one, his campaign spliced comments she made about the improving national economy — “So many wonderful things have been happening!” — against video of shadowy ISIS soldiers waving their rifles in the air. “Is Nancy Jo Kemper confused?” the narrator asks. “Nancy Jo Kemper: Too out of touch for Kentucky.” “It’s like campaigning against a ghost. We never actually see him,” Kemper said last week at her campaign headquarters, where she has raised $384,252 since filing to run in January. If she could ask Barr a question during Monday night’s program, Kemper said, “it would be, ‘Why has it been so important for you to raise so much money for your campaign fund and your private leadership PAC? Why haven’t you been representing the people of Kentucky?’” Barr, who is finishing his second term in Congress, did not respond to multiple requests to be interviewed for this article. In his campaign materials, Barr says he is representing the people of Central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District by advocating for a smaller government that does less, costs less and interferes less. “As a conservative, Andy believes that limited government and free enterprise empower the American people with the greatest opportunity to pursue happiness, provide for their families and give their children a better life. He has consistently voted to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, to stop the president’s regulatory overreach and to preserve the rights guaranteed to the people in the Constitution,” his campaign website states. An analysis of Barr’s congressional record by the nonpartisan website GovTrack found that he has not had much success getting bills through the legislative process, and he seldom joins with the Democratic minority on bipartisan efforts. Ideologically, he’s one of the most conservative representatives based on the bills and resolutions he supports, according to GovTrack. Barr’s ideology has proven popular in Central Kentucky. Two years ago, he defeated a liberal Democratic challenger, Elisabeth Jensen, by a 20-point margin, winning all 19 counties in the district. His endorsements this year have included the National Rifle Association and the Commonwealth Policy Center, a religious conservative group that backed him because he opposes legalized abortion, same-sex marriage and federal directives on transgender bathroom use. “I think he represents the values of the people well,” said Richard Nelson, executive director of the Commonwealth Policy Center. “We take the view that our rights come from God — we believe in the sanctity of life, we believe in religious freedom — and Andy Barr has stood strongly for these issues that are what we call the pillars of our society.” Stark contrasts Kemper is religious herself. She’s pastor at New Union Christian Church in Woodford County and spent 18 years as executive director of the Kentucky Council of Churches. But she’s no conservative. On nearly every controversial issue, Kemper stands in stark contrast to Barr. He’s against a higher minimum wage; she’s for it, calling for $15 an hour to start, with increases for inflation. He opposes legalized abortion; she supports it. He has voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act; she praises the law for opening the doctor’s office to the working poor and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Barr says he has voted in favor of cutting trillions of dollars in federal spending, particularly from domestic programs. Kemper talks about the need for new vocational training courses and infrastructure repair projects that could gainfully employ jobless Americans while upgrading the nation’s roads, bridges, water systems and other public facilities. “I’m thinking here of our coal miners who know how to work with heavy machinery,” she said last week. Kemper describes Barr as a privileged “country club kid” who doesn’t understand his constituents’ everyday troubles. Barr’s sympathies lie with wealthy special interests, especially if they give him campaign donations, she said. The difference is, I would put human need over corporate greed. I’m tired as a citizen of subsidizing companies like Wal-Mart, which has one of the biggest budgets and profit margins in the country, and yet they have workers who are so poorly paid they qualify for food stamps and Medicaid, which the government provides. Nobody who works full-time in this country should be living in poverty. Nancy Jo Kemper, Democratic nominee for Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District “The difference is, I would put human need over corporate greed,” she said. “I’m tired as a citizen of subsidizing companies like Wal-Mart, which has one of the biggest budgets and profit margins in the country, and yet they have workers who are so poorly paid they qualify for food stamps and Medicaid, which the government provides. Nobody who works full-time in this country should be living in poverty.” Barr’s re-election campaign has taken $3,000 from Wal-Mart’s PAC. Barr says he opposes raising the minimum wage because that would force employers to lay off workers or cut hours. Citing the same concerns, he voted last month to stall the U.S. Department of Labor’s extension of overtime pay to more than four million additional workers. “While the Department of Labor bureaucrats claim that the overtime rule will improve economic conditions for middle-class employees, this onerous regulation on businesses, educational institutions and nonprofits will have the exact opposite effect by reducing job opportunities and limiting hours for many workers,” Barr said on the House floor. Over the summer, Barr co-wrote the House Republicans’ anti-poverty plan, which called for more work requirements and time limits on public benefits for the poor. The federal government might turn over programs, such as food stamps, disability payments and public housing, to the states in the form of block grants, while encouraging states to narrow eligibility and eliminate fraud, he suggested. Overall, he said, the federal war on poverty has been an expensive failure. “The number of Americans living in poverty has increased by nearly seven million during the Obama administration,” Barr says in his campaign materials. It’s not clear where Barr found that number — he cites no source and his office would not comment — but the U.S. Census Bureau says he’s wrong. The number of Americans living in poverty has fallen by 446,000 since Barack Obama entered the White House in January 2009, according to the bureau. And that’s with a population growth of 15 million people. The percentage of Americans living in poverty has dropped from 14.3 to 13.5. Defending the banks Inside Washington, Barr’s signature issue is banking deregulation. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, Barr made numerous attempts to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the watchdog agency it created, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He criticizes the CFPB for “making it harder for Kentuckians to get a loan to buy a house, start or expand a business and invest in their communities.” But sometimes he runs into obstacles. In September, Barr’s committee held a hearing to discuss the scandal at Wells Fargo, which illegally charged customers $1.5 million in fees after it secretly opened two million sham accounts in their names. The CFPB was among the investigating agencies that socked Wells Fargo with a record-setting $185 million in fines. At the hearing, Barr urged Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf to consider how the controversy could set back his deregulation efforts. “This scandal has painted a bad picture for the entire banking sector,” Barr told Stumpf. “We’ve been fighting for regulatory relief for these small community banks and these credit unions that frankly represent competition to big banks like you. So what I worry about are these small community banks and credit unions that are now going to have to deal with the ramifications of the bad acts of your institution.” “Well, again,” Stumpf replied, “I’m sorry for what we did.” While the Department of Labor bureaucrats claim that the overtime rule will improve economic conditions for middle-class employees, this onerous regulation on businesses, educational institutions and nonprofits will have the exact opposite effect by reducing job opportunities and limiting hours for many workers. U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, R-Lexington If elected, Kemper said, she would defend the Dodd-Frank Act. Congress passed the law in response to the 2008 financial sector collapse that brought on a global recession. It placed new lending and capitalization requirements on banks and prohibited them from engaging in risky investments with their assets. The banks that have poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into Barr’s campaigns resent the restrictions on some of their lucrative activities, she said. “Dodd-Frank is protecting consumers and keeping us from having another financial meltdown like we had in 2008,” Kemper said. Kemper’s uphill climb Barr’s television commercials prominently feature the threat posed by ISIS overseas and the drug addiction epidemic at home. For the former, Barr says he helps fight ISIS as a member of the Financial Service Committee’s Bipartisan Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, which has met six times this year. For the latter, Barr says a drug abuse task force he organized in his district contributed several ideas to a Senate drug abuse bill that Obama signed into law. That law, the Comprehensive Addictions and Recovery Act of 2016, is supposed to expand addiction education and prevention efforts, strengthen treatment options and widen access to overdose medications. However, Obama, congressional Democrats and some medical groups had asked for $1.1 billion in federal spending to go along with it. Republican leaders agreed to provide only $181 million. Kemper said Barr’s drug abuse commercial is an example of him dishonestly taking credit to conceal the fact that he’s been ineffective for two terms. “His ad on opioid addiction, he says he’s got this task force and the recommendations went into this legislation that was passed,” she said. “But guess what? The Republicans haven’t funded that legislation. So they’ve kind of spoken with forked tongue.” Kemper’s challenge will be convincing enough voters to send her to Washington as Barr’s replacement. The 6th Congressional District is considered a likely Republican hold by Washington political analysts. Neither the Kentucky Democratic Party nor the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have done much to assist Kemper. Their money is going to races they consider more competitive. And it’s unknown whether the district’s voters are closely following this race. In 2014, more than half of them didn’t cast a ballot for U.S. representative, allowing Barr to be re-elected by just 28 percent of the registered voters. However, Kemper’s campaign manager, Sellus Wilder, said Barr wouldn’t bother paying for attack ads if he wasn’t nervous. The Kemper campaign’s internal polling showed Barr’s favorability rating under 50 percent even before Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump began his recent slump in national polls, tainting the GOP’s brand as a whole, Wilder said. “If opposing a higher minimum wage and attacking the war on poverty were really winning issues in this district, then Andy would be campaigning on that stuff instead of making up silly attack ads about ISIS,” Wilder said. Speaking of Trump, who is favored to carry Kentucky, Kemper said she can appeal to some Trump supporters with her agenda to help the working poor. Many of Trump’s followers believe that Washington politicians like Barr don’t care about their economic struggle, she said. “The populist anger that we see at this moment is, to my pastor’s heart, a cover for two things: One is fear and the other is hurt,” she said. “The fear is about the radical kind of change that they’re afraid is happening to the culture as it diversifies, as we see the kind of demographic changes that are happening. There’s a fear of losing ground. The second, the hurt, is this feeling that the country they love and its government have not been there for them, that it’s failed them.” John Cheves: 859-231-3266, @BGPolitics Garland Hale “Andy” Barr IV Party: Republican Born: July 24, 1973 Residence: Lexington Education: Bachelor’s degree in government and philosophy, University of Virginia; law degree, University of Kentucky College of Law Occupation: Congressman Elected office: U.S. House, 2013 to present Family: Married (Eleanor Carol Leavell), two daughters Website: Andybarrforcongress.com Nancy Jo Kemper Party: Democrat Born: May 6, 1942 Residence: Lexington Education: Bachelor’s degree in English and history, Transylvania University; master’s of divinity in theology, Yale University Occupation: Pastor, New Union Christian Church Family: Divorced, two daughters Website: Kemperforcongress.com Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Politics & Government Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:41 Bevin on #newmajority Pause 0:34 Gov.

(AP) — Police in Hudson say a suspicious package left in a store shopping cart has turned out to be a propane tank. Officers were called to a Wal-Mart store shortly before 4 p.m. Saturday after a brown box sealed with packing tape was found in a cart near the store's main entrance. The parking lot was closed and store personnel rerouted shoppers through a side door. The Nashua Police Department's bomb squad used a robot to take the package. An X-ray determined it had a propane tank inside. Business resumed at the store about two hours later. Police are attempting to identify the owner of the tank.

Chief Tim Tollison with the Easley Police Department said the incident went down Saturday afternoon when a vehicle was stolen from a victim in the parking lot of an Easley Walmart.  The victim tried to step in front of the vehicle as the suspect took off, was struck and then reportedly jumped onto the hood of the vehicle as it drove across multiple parking lots.  According to Chief Tollison, the victim was dragged from the top of the vehicle hood near a Kohl's department store. The victim was then transported by EMS to the hospital and treated for minor bruises, cuts and scratches. Police said the victim was released from the hospital around 2:30 pm. but was gone before they arrived and wouldn't answer or return phone calls. Chief Tollison said surveillance footage showed the suspect's car pulling up next to the victim's, and that he thought the whole incident seemed suspicious. The department will continue to investigate the case. Copyright 2016 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

His mother a full-time housekeeper, and father a full-time landscaper, did their best to provide for their five children while earning a minimum wage, which more times than not was not enough. Experiencing his parents’ struggles living off of minimum wage income in jobs that required demanding hours, and offered no overtime or pay raises, Rodriguez said he knew he had to change the system. This led him to run for City Council in National City, one of the poorest cities in the county. “It’s very difficult now in America. It is very difficult to make it in to the middle class,” he said.  “National City residents deserve higher wages.” Rodriguez, 31, fully supports an increase to the minimum wage, especially in National City. The state-mandated minimum wage is $10 per hour. Rodriguez said he would like to see National City’s minimum wage increase to $15 an hour for large businesses. He called $15 an hour a “standard living wage.” If elected, he said he will serve the nearly 60,000 residents by requiring large businesses in the city such as Wal-Mart, McDonald’s, Starbucks and other giant corporations to pay their employees a higher working wage. “Places like that are multi-billion dollar companies,” he said. “They can afford to invest in our community a little more by investing in their own workers.” For small businesses, he said, the statewide minimum wage will eventually bring them up to $15 per hour in 2022. Rodriguez believes higher wages will not only benefit workers but will also have positive effects for the National City economy. He said a higher minimum wage in National City means workers are paying more in local taxes, which he said translates into more revenue for the city budget and more money to pay for city services. “The solution to our problems isn’t to raise taxes, the solution is to increase wages so that people spend more so that they pay more in taxes and hence our budget grows more,” he said. Rodriguez considers himself a “workers’ advocate” and has the support of labor unions in his race. When he is off the campaign trail, Rodriguez spends his time as a stay-at-home father to his three young daughters. His wife, Sandra Rodriguez, works as a dual immersion teacher at an elementary school in El Cajon. He last worked for the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council for nearly five years, where he was tasked with organizing, structuring and running political campaigns of candidates backed by the union. He left that job in March to focus on his campaign. Rodriguez admits his stance on raising the minimum wage in National City is not a popular one. “If I’m going to run for office I am going to run on the ideals that I believe in. That I whole-heartedly believe in,” he said. Rodriguez left Coachella Valley for San Diego to attend college. He attended San Diego City College before transferring to San Diego State University where he earned a bachelor’s degree in history. Rodriguez and his wife bought a home in National City three years ago. “I felt at home here,” he said. “There are hard-working people here, just like the people I met every day in the [Coachella] Valley.” Rodriguez said he wants a National City that can prosper. “My vision for National City would be one in which most of our families are homeowners, where most of our families are part of the middle class and have good jobs, God willing have enough money to take vacations,” he said. “I wish for once we would focus on the middle class, I wish for once we focus on what the working people need in our community.” E-mail Author Print Story RSS Feed Rate This Article 0 vote(s) Average Vote 0/5 1 2 3 4 5 anniej Says: Thu, Oct 27 2016 02:16 PM 'Support of labor union' - PLA???????

Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Oct 22, 2016 at 2:18PM Image source: Getty Images. Attention seniors, it's that time of the year again -- open enrollment for Medicare Part D, also known as the prescription drug plan portion of Medicare, is under way, as it is every year between Oct. 15 and Dec. 7. During this period, eligible Medicare enrollees have the opportunity to shop around and compare prescription drug plans for the upcoming year under original Medicare. This is also when enrollees can peruse alternative options with a Medicare Advantage plan, which combines all aspects of Medicare, including drug coverage, into one plan. Big prescription drug increases are headed seniors' way Choosing a prescription drug plan is particularly important for seniors since they tend to be more prone to expensive illnesses compared to younger adults. According to a study from the Kaiser Family Foundation, seniors taking drugs to treat hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, or cancer can spend anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000 per year out-of-pocket just to take a single drug -- and this includes what a Medicare prescription drug plan would cover. Another recent AARP study, Rx Price Watch, found that average annual prescription drug costs have ballooned from $4,140 in 2005 to $11,341 as of 2013 for elderly Americans. Long story short, picking out the right prescription drug plan is critical to ensuring that seniors get the most out of their plan. So what are seniors looking at as we head into open enrollment period? According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), prescription drug plan (PDP) premiums are rising by an average of 9% in 2017 to $42.17, based on the weighted average of 2016 plan enrollment. KFF's estimate includes premiums for basic and enhanced prescriptions plans, and makes the assumption that enrollees stick with their current plan, which may not always be the case. Image source: Getty Images. As KFF also points out, costs continue to vary greatly for Medicare Part D plans. Among the 10-most enrolled plans in 2016, the average monthly premiums in 2017 range from a low of $16.81 a month for the Humana Wal-Mart Rx plan, which works out to just over $200 a year, to $71.66 monthly for the AARP Medicare Rx Preferred plan, which works out to about $860 annually. Similar differences, though perhaps not to the extreme of the low-end and high-end differing by a factor of four, are seen in individual states, with some seniors looking at cheaper coverage options than others. How to get the best Medicare drug plan With rising prescription drug costs looking like a near-certainty moving forward, seniors need to be diligent in their efforts to pick out a PDP that suits their needs best. Here are a few tricks to ensuring you get the best possible value for your Part D plan. The first step is to shop around. The worst possible thing you can do is to simply allow yourself to be reenrolled in the same plan as last year. Though some seniors will find benefits from reenrolling, this isn't always the case. Part D plans may be contracted through Medicare, but they are offered by private insurance companies that have the ability to alter their coverage from year to year. Just because the drugs you take were covered by your 2016 PDP doesn't mean they'll be covered under the same plan, or at the same rate, in 2017. Taking the time to shop around with Medicare.gov's Plan Finder is a smart move you really should make. Also keep in mind that your window-shopping period should include a look at alternative Medicaid Advantage plans, too, to see if they offer you a better bang for your buck. Secondly, it's important that you understand the difference between co-pays and co-insurance, especially with more PDPs pushing co-insurance as drug prices soar. Co-payments are flat fees that you pay for each prescription you fill. Co-pays could differ based on the tier of drug you're paying for, but they're otherwise consistent across a tier. Co-insurance, on the other hand, requires the Medicare member to pay a percentage of the total prescription cost. If the drug you're paying for is in one of the higher cost tiers, you could be looking at a lot of money out of pocket -- and don't forget, there are no annual out-of-pocket limits with Medicare. If you can, target plans with a focus on co-pays, or at the very least pay attention to what the co-insurance would be on your medications and seek out the plan(s) with the lowest co-insurance. Image source: Getty Images. Third, ask your doctor if generic options are a possibility. According to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, 88% of prescriptions written today are for generic drugs. By 2020, this figure is expected to rise to between 91% and 92%. If you can find a substitute for your brand-name medication that works just as well, you may be able to save in excess of 80% on your out-of-pocket drug costs. Fourth, take note of what tier the drugs you take fall into. Most PDPs use a five-tier system for prescription drugs, with a higher tier signifying a more specialized and costly drug that'll cost you more out of pocket. Drug tiers can be somewhat variable from one plan to the next, and they can also change from year to year, which can mean a dramatic increase or decrease in out-of-pocket costs. Drugs can be removed from an insurer's approved formulary, too. This is all the more reason to take the time to really compare plans around this time of year. Finally, don't be late! Forgetting to enroll in a PDP during the defined period (Oct. 15 through Dec. 7) can be costly, with penalties attached that follow you around for the remainder of your enrollment in Medicare (essentially the rest of your life).

You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. The preacher and I. And that teacher from. Thanks mustard in Johnson on the WEEI Sports Radio network talk all things socks packs seasons season. Muster in Johnson on the WEEI Sports Radio. That is our number three final wild mustard and Johnson's show. As we go to high noon John to mossy has a new partner noses in regular thing now. IA britney's gonna answer the way the giants court should have yet that I have no idea here attorney says Derek is joining. John to mossy ads at 12 o'clock today I'm sure they're gonna get into more than just brown the situation. We're talking about how the NFL. Half heartedly. At best. Investigated that situation of course that work all that energy all those resources all those dollars. In two deflated football so there's a lot of certainly a lot of anger. In justified resentment around these parts and we are talking about all that review. Interesting I was reading not a Kodak now that manner produces and by Chet polonium. In it was about Josh brown and Howard grew up in a Christian home and values and them went to Nebraska. There in the HS. As somebody who just really really really lost his way and again I am angry with him very disappointed with him and all of that he did. But at the same time I only fault him to a certain degree that if these things were known along to our primary goal. Then they should have been dealt with van and he was obviously somebody in need of some serious. Help. That's why when I look at the powers to be in the NFL instead of trying to really help him. But instead hiding it in. Hiding is right by the way nobody says anything about his wife and his kids or anything are they getting any support I'm getting any. Assistants I help for the national pro probably got no Drudge browse they're gonna get his wind. Point four million dollar remainder of his contract is just a very. You know the more you look into some of these things LSU like some of these people who are in power positions to make change. But they don't. So all are you looking at this article from 2012. The conversation. About christianity really. And Josh Brown says in this article is no measure to the grace that god has shown me no measure every day we thank him for that. We make our kids very aware of how fortunate we are not only financially but just to be together to have a home. To have the ability to love one another relief. And practice our faith really one of the things you learn and if you learn nothing else from me in the last. 122 years is that. I've said early on when we came together Miami Christian I mean follower of Jesus Christ I mean senator. But that he does that went to across pay for my sins and I am forgiving. Now that doesn't mean I won't do whatever I feel like going and gobble excuse that there is an ultimate punishment. Through that not eternal punishment but punishment here if you won't hold up a store or something and they were resting you're using my Christian values to go to jail. So I mean that you have to be very careful nowadays are people throughout terms entitles them alike. I'm missing and then condemn and and you know and condemn everybody. I'm if one person claims to be something but they acted different way I think you have to go back to the original doctor and and see what is required and it is is certainly after trying conduct yourself as best you can. We make mistakes I know I do I make a lot of them and you pray and ask for God's forgiveness and that's in a Christian is ultimately your faith is in Christ but. I don't know we have this guy lost it he said besides this is the stuff that happened about seven years old so. I have no idea how he lost his way I had no idea right let's get back to fonts it's 6177797937. Lisa downing Coventry were island you're next police credit rating for Euro. I'm don't know how why yeah. I love the heat and the pizza. I'd been waiting for your Matt and some women call today. I like and I admire green. That was good. I'm not alone men and I want to talk about that's. Okay. I I don't belong mask his demands mean. Demand. Stick violent. Programs for these. Football players that they have to go to sessions. I like to think they're there are yeah yeah. I think that's very important NAND. You know it would just found you reap what to solve. He did it despicable thing. And I mean he made in the states and mistakes. You know I I I'm a born again Christian and I know that went to out of born again Christian unity Christ is his thing there. And it does change you know high. And you still make mistakes but you are forgiven. But your kid you not you can't contenders like go out do the same thing over twenty times. Now you can't there's something wrong on there. But if I I heard that he just became a born again Chris. Brought in according to methodically grew up in a Christian home. All right a may be re dedicated comes up let's said that's all well and good believe it or not he's a pot of this story but the main part of the story. It's how the National Football League Goodell and company Batman nobody is trying to cover it up cash kind of brush it aside. That's wrong that's absolutely wrong and I don't care pillar in my patriots fan. And if Tom Brady being deployed I think he should be drawn out of football for the things in life I don't care if you're a big star or not. We know you did do a domestic violence feel like he should be penalized for it and punish. Boy amen amen now do I think a person can go on to certain guys certain counseling sessions and then. Eventually be given another chance I think and possibly a different. Oh I think so I think someone. I think someone should be given a second chance that they approve them. Amber Ray Rice who has never give Ray Rice president given that animate because he was on the decline anyway. Ray Rice ray Reza remember he dragged his fiancee I don't itinerant con artists are out of an elevator never play another game where it's all right so it says here on my caller screen. Lisa from Coventry Josh Brown should be given another chance do you believe that Josh Brown should have a opportunity to redeem themselves somehow. If it had been next fear he definitely him about that riot broke the divorced. Eat the oldest of four I'm out. If there in the next here you go to counseling you prove himself he does good deeds he is a born again Christian yes I think he could begin the second camp. Was not so must I listen I'll be delighted if you sincerely. Does become is a born again Christian but. Whether he does that I'm not the fact of the matter is he has a counseling program. The thing with him is I think he's 34 runs out and thirty said he seven so that's kind of old in the game anyway. To wait on him to get his act together. I suspect. Him being a good Christian or not thanks for the call Lisa thanks Melissa I I would be. Shocked beyond shocked. If Josh Brown ever gets another chance he's the only before partly open but the douse them trying to think of his great party yeah I mean a fine yeah. You know it's interesting now fifth. There are gonna vote assign these why is that them and then opt out hot -- of a sudden forgiveness runs out I wanna get rid of sadly the moral outrage it is all over the place all of a couch Jerry Jones said you know we don't really want him Erica Needham played out well easy to take a stand when the guy can't perform the expectation of the 6177797937. Down to Miami a year ago Steve you're next on portrait stave. I apple and it's not how you're doing. Well it's so disgusting and I'll Sewell. I'm not telling you. Or calm patriots had your bit to me they do what news. Should be done by every team in this mission like that when Aaron in this in the broader respect and communities but it still. Physical in person they switched. In a written weeks or desperate they dismiss them as I mean this whole tank. It was simply cute it's. Mr. nobody. Don't Wear ties and Diego. Talking about integrity always integrity of these kind of eight election absolutely no integrity and I think that on these lock me in a separate. And sorrows. You shipped. These people serious I mean because that is just front and again in a moment. But also outlook which is in perfect. Yeah you're in October with the angles. Yeah it's ridiculous I have that for lunch. Yeah. But really the accident out of my I obviously want second delay. You are. I guess you're. And already there's games mean he's not through hardship happy I guarantee. And I noticed since. Something that we patriots and all is well. If it is and this has happened to the. That's an interesting question grandma and Vera -- I think course where it seems like it's it's at a high tower now something had been you know accused of that going to be very interesting. Whether I'd Goodell would have the same fervor going after him in the end you know and you're talking about perfect a lot of people earlier before the revelations about Josh Brown earlier in the week people were kind of surprised at all the NFL did it was fine member fixed 75 and ran a joke instead of suspending him again and you're absolutely right. If a patriot did that there would be. Held the pay as far as patriots are concerned a city -- question yet very good question thanks for the call actually he's 77797937. We go to Charlotte. In Andover hello Charlotte. Our Shalit in morning you know you thank you so much for calling him. Well thank you for having. You. Asked earlier about whether the top level quarterback had had been charged how we just it as opposed to a ticker right. Well what about Peyton Manning last year that was pretty poorly investigated. Very poorly investigated with that it yet they knew we was out the door. And that was. Event taking the blame game on now want to witnesses were discredited. Victim was discredited. Any step in the Booth in so doing appearances and so do. Commercials removes some of his life and there's the difference here is even though it was a ultimately replace the bowl kicker they had. Hard evidence that they would not ignore that's the problem they try to they tried to ignore yup. Yes they did trying to Norton and I. You know the same thing the previous callers about the effect this week. I honestly if it was we're patriots involved definitely. Then that chatter would be its nose patriots again and that would be the story not. What the by violation was but. And I think as an you know as much as Bob Kraft has been a mover and shaker in the NFL on the TV committee and you know I it was a long time supporter of the detail before. The deflate anybody else there is right I think think a lot of their way to support John Mara. John Merritt is powerful he's in New York owner yeah ours he showed no mercy to the patriots either it's accurate but a lot of I mean we don't have any evidence on this either but there were a lot of people suspect John Mara. Was none too supportive of Bob Kraft and the patriots in deflate gate. But believed for some reason wants to help the giants as much as they can about the giants if it attracts right in Itamar family of course goes back to the original. That the original franchises back in 1925 cell. I I do think there was more favoritism to say the least. In their half hearted investigation of the giants. As opposed to what happened with the flake. Yes tough job to do here this is that arguably the highest profile player currently. Super Bowl champion team and nobody wanted to see this happen. By his job is to enforce the rules against. The same way and consistently with four players and that's when attempting to politicking attempt to do that. We judge brown kind of late now how about the bond right that is John Mara by the way talking about the late gate and some people fought that perhaps John Mara wasn't. Quite deed the objective owner Malik called mr. IndyCar benefit Eva yeah no question about it 6177797937. Gloria you're next in Sports Radio. Laura we hi Gloria Van Morrison you are now. I'm from New York City water bread at the giants and why can't quote yelled at eight bring him to the members currency on your program and they all act. Probable released. Olson remember yes and I wrote a letter into the Patriot Act. And they wouldn't print it because I worked. And the Asia what to do. You know. Obama. Not being able locker room. And what does that got to do is jobs out being a Christian it doesn't matter what they eat crow I don't you know I'm Kirsten thank Christian doesn't act like that trust. Any hard and yeah I am not meet his wife his girlfriend these children thing. This thing happened to Tom Brady I wrote in and called and as an act sell in more concerned about balls and anything else. Line. Yeah I and I I think the the resentment. Among the other 31 owners toward that all patriots success over the last 1516 years with pal. NASA had to use committee. I don't I asked the same question on and understand how you establish his committee. Opera spousal abuse acceptance on it and. I had the if you already had to reach every met OJ put that bought his wife. That got out of that rally as of now it doesn't but it out. I mean they out and they have a restraint in not and they have proved that someone has done that like they had it way right. Bragging that woman out of the elevated. The opening them to carry to do. Yeah. How big and still get. I believe it yet on just brown is on paid leave Ager Peterson is on paid leave of course he played against Ray Rice and Josh we're artists don't get in his contract yeah. Let me ask you this do you watch in the game tomorrow giants and rams. My neck and finally mitigate the minute you log in a market. Does that is that. Right so how okay wed event I am a Gloria I give you credit. War speaking out against the giants against your team on the other hand do you how can. Expect when you like it back to the giants bank can't write you back I can't let it go Wellington. Yup and when they say make sure you watch the game to. Are now didn't that it's packing you know being up here I don't have direct G-8 where I am I you being hypocritical watch the game. No I don't feel that way I got by one thing I enjoyed college. Do shots aren't in yet college Nebraska. OK check if you. And in trouble own words Hillary and some other places why don't get it right up in college like we get away with it. You know what if you can play you can get away with it I'm waiting for the the obligatory Steve Nelson quote had learned that you what's that. Don't you you tell me. Oh. Hey aha I'm sure Gloria. Well I. You ask for Werman Collins Maine there rougher than them on yet seniors Matt asked evidence for around the world times it is the problem it's. Here's. Is the proud and it's one thing for patriots in to say I hate the NFL delivers the walked the patriots I guess you could make slight case that although I don't agree with that. These people it's all they have yet. And all they have got nothing else in their life but now getting an update 930 and is that in order to notch a T and some cases unfortunately now. 617779. 7937. We still got about a half hour ago before we make way for. Training and Tomas it's the new hit show right here on Sports Radio WEEI. H one Daylon hobbies to consumers' preference in June 2016 stepped mustard and Johnson or. Sports Radio 93 point seven WEEI WEEI dot com. That the violence you have him on your. Mean you knew he admitted he hinted that they book came out in the journal. Intensely personal and comparable to read. An and an indictment of his own behavior. But the giants had this information before has and they kept him on the roster. That's consuming domestic violence make no mistake you can wanna support someone and you can reach out to someone but at the same time you have to let them take. The six game penalty you can't say we're not issuing a penalty we're just gonna support of that undermines everything NFL is tried to do on domestic bounce the last few years. As Jane McManus on ESP yen well sad and that obviously exposes the giants in the National Football League to a larger extent we're being. Hypocrites as we know they are let me answer question if if I'm undergoing counseling program and power of accounting program is writing in the journal and should those. But I'm writing me being Catholic yeah an and that is interesting because you think those are private thoughts their therapeutic. I'm trying to defend the guy and really. That's and the giants during the giants were trying to have it both ways they understood the gravity of the situation I'm sure they weren't. This under. Or underestimating. The problem at the same time they wanted to be supportive. And they knew that those documents existed they probably suspected. That the issue was far beyond a one time only deal. And they went out of their way to make sure that the public did not know about it unfortunately for them and fortunately for us they did actually. Become exposed I think that's important but we're big go from here what can the National Football League. Do now. So much for those setup but I I pay out panel what there's women they hide it and let the woman Tom you know that come up there are some rules. That people have to abide by. No question about that what's gonna shell in New Hampshire is next in Sports Radio Michel. Obligation. How are you man. I'd I want to shed light on concussions. Yes or. And anger management. You know. It was brought to my attention and many years ago when my daughter strapped for her. Three big concussion in her life playing high school and middle school sports. And after the that are really RO connection. After that hurt really bad actually we're driving somewhere and she out of the blue extremely angry and started hitting me. And I pulled over. And I'd react you know we went for Iraq. And I realized. Then that she did. Help because her anger issues we're stemming from the concussion about two weeks elapsed. Actually no we're talking basketball soccer. And and I know people have concussion on their mind would well. It happens all the sports is she okay if you can now. She's learning now because like Joker two Russian special out of mustang yeah how little we won. When they have bad concussion anybody. In certain areas of rain and reaction. Triggered instantaneously. And they lash out at and and it's it's really not something that they can control. Okay do. You know what to give it. You know what the difference I'm still say no but you know it did you know what the difference in but the differences Michelle you to record get help. See why why I shall it. Be because they're afraid of what you're afraid of what they'll find. So oh I'll keep it short a Bloomberg. It Mike Shannon and I. We don't watch them on a lucky anymore we would listen to on the radio and I wrote that so many other people are so fed up with the NFL. Doing there they're ignoring Chela I'd. Televised urgent. Let me ask you this though Michelle and I just. Some little curious why is listening to the game more palatable than actually watching. I don't feel like immediate much money. I had moon and everything on the radio anxious about our little way of tunes are. Forget the dollars we want it still not let that at one but we also have let go watching other games. And I that I feel and a gentleman with a at the lab watch them but at the same time outlet outlet on the radio and hopefully. It seems to me that there's a lot more people that have just sort of like bell as a result. It's ridiculous. You know that pairing of lake City Council is just absolutely. Yeah particularly around here yeah that is now. More deeper than that I think they NFL and all of them all of national sports really made as our collegiate. And a concussion. And again imagine that aren't are not expecting people who are making. I mean top of the individuals we really need. You know get a handle on them and ankle deep or they're being and and help prevent folks because it's hard to say whether. Do damage they can't root it out or something that urged. An underlying issue our own or all of concussions. And yet she kicker by more than likely outlook soccer. And concussion can happen. In Antarctic on. All you'll make it did you make a connection though as soon as she started hitting you are. How did you make a catch. No because of the time calling that income was shot on the worker. It would show unlike her personality and piling up in just a couple of weeks after the lapse concussion and and and and it and I noted some bit of anger outrage before that I thought cash not like Kirk's and I talked to spectacular specialists. With concussion mortgage ear of how do we know everything is okay and she's the first thing that's that's where that was how about much and went oh my word. I'm not sure if I'm thank you for the call Michelle and I sure Toronto. Judge brown is involved in soccer soccer is a big issue concussions especially for girls receive all the time and basketball as well. But from what I understand Larry Josh Brown was abused. When he was young man and unfortunately the sad reality is those rarely used as children. Quite often become abusive as well that's why I asked immediately. If if the NF are really wants to do something not just put him. But get some counseling set up for his children and because these things usually repeat themselves at and exactly and it could be passed on the next generation sadly John in the car your next on Sports Radio WEEI. It got a giant itself. AM I just wanted to kind of you know make this a little bit of a broader goal in relation did domestic abuse speaker. You've got you know whether it. You know I think the end NFL had a responsibility but soldiers every. Sport in relation to this you know the NBA I mean India is just as bad in relation to that. Domestic abuse these guys do but if you go back and you look at. You know these kids come at your high school these these guys coming to college. Whether it's a legal incident with pitino. I mean it's you know no not really not a bad. Hang about that I wasn't enough today. That's one of them at one of those you know if it it bit if you don't know about it and happened at it and got them. But the thing is you know whether it's kids in you know there was a situation in Maine recently where kids got caught. Drink in that they were allowed to play in the playoff game you know what I mean and culture of entitlement that's who you're talking about John and basically it means you know you're not gonna. If anybody thinks with two seconds that the NFL some kind of a rule change in here it's gonna change people's attitude. That's ridiculous run at the start. It's the but it's but it's. Comes more you know little bit more global map I just think that. You know until we stop the it's hypocritical. You know this is a business and it's gonna continue to look out for its bottom line you'd think. Anybody go into Wal-Mart wilds of fact the divine you know close at Wal-Mart built me by eight you know child labor in. We're 75 cents a day now. Right in the thing isn't as you know but but people go in Asia and they still body. To how do you make up so how do you make. So John how do you make a difference. I think it just have to stop lit. You know a a no excuse. Punishment in other words you know when kids right from high school on the college and one not. They just have to you know and the story you know you know you get caught drinking and you get caught it with somebody get caught in some kind of you know thievery or some. Saying whatever whatever that whatever the best player on you team. Well that's the point is until. You know posters wanna allow it there until Ali's people pumping money into let me wanna allow it then you know you need to basically say look. We don't have it's its jeans and went and he's still up the team it doesn't matter it doesn't matter who it is. Our rules are rules but realistically. People don't wanna see that because. You know it's if if Tom Brady was caught do and so then they wouldn't want him out you know what I mean it's Eric you know Ben Roethlisberger any of these other soups. Well Roethlisberger was suspended for six games for lose contact. With the a young woman he remembered a bar a few years ago. And he was suspended six originally got that thing it reduced to four. Because again they didn't have enough evidence but it's a huge problem it goes beyond just the National Football League certainly domestic violence. Is endemic to all walks of life. Alcohol is a huge factor and as I said earlier alcohol is one of the main supporters economically of the National Football League in the interest thing. If Budweiser. But because of this or are other stories that come out decided to take their money out of the NFL. That would be a fascinating scenario disable these relatives. Resting as much as we would like other BC football program to be more successful. I think academically and otherwise I do think they trying keep a pretty decent standard over via. If for that reason it's how to to recruit top flight talent that these other teams Alabama or how these teams are do you think they get have these plays. No question about it here's a man with vastly no standards whatsoever with Mike in can't you're next on Sports Radio I'm react up up up. Don't. Mean yeah I haven't won a rating could drive a little bit different pay discriminating you guys are most of quote sing but. I think the debt is because it's over saturation. It's Sunday it's Sunday night its money United's third and headed London's Sunday morning you know it's too much. Yeah you know what it is in an IIAU prior retirement early matter princess has talked about earlier in the week it's Sunday night is the big is the big. Problem because it's it's the talk but over saturation you need nine hours of football. In this week it's even worse does he have a 930 games so that's twelve hours of football. And it's so funny like Obama outlined from Wall Street how many yachts can be awarded ski behind. Yeah an and that is Oakland water skiing courses up plot Xeon that ramp jumping the shark. And we may have a jumping the shark situation here. Yeah I mean it just yeah I think it was and I'd draw the line up to depart exactly what baseball they went up another ten box on the baseball package and told economic. I'm doing it and it is you have red zone. The red zone. Now and a red zone now that the Google jets the that you purport to be into that's quite a bit waited to outline. In its pocket spend money is all money right about that and it didn't light up exports but I. Here's the problem the beautiful boy used to be goes back to what you're saying about over saturation was because it was once a week it doesn't feel that way anymore doesn't. Now yet through much. Extra Jacksonville Indianapolis game and in the morning. Hey how about this yeah they haven't heard Michael all this year this week Jacksonville and Tennessee are all there is a must watch Beckett. Can you believe that. In Italy I just think they're old they've overdone it. And it because it did that that the suspect or are these well hopefully you guys said Lawrence Taylor thirty years ago I mean possibly going up forever. Right and they are propping him mopping and they found him on the Garden State Parkway passed out in the car and all kinds of crazy stuff out. When Allen incident didn't hurt the ratings. You know it started this year. Ray Rice let's not. Let's update reality that same rush yeah. And you know Ray Rice seemingly in sincerely sought counsel and tried to redeem himself but you know the I get the owners credit for this they'd never. Not one owner geared to employ Ray Rice after it was Jerry Brown they would have employed him now. Jimmy brown had his ownership rule not the door out the window and I know rabbit that was after his career was over. Guys I have to mention the Indians. I'll be outlawed that. People said it was a little when they beat the Red Sox and the leaders are gonna count. Only dispatched the blue jays and five easy pickings as well. There's you know there's something about it. And I think it took in the. Well I think there's something about a trade that happened somewhere and legs are a guy Ryan Miller now. I. Well we will you know it was interest in what is seen as the post had an article on this this week lot of pressure on those prospects. To make good with the Yankees after what restored and that apple. But as dominant as Miller was in three for three other teams he is in the east zones in zone right now that I never seemed. I think he was thought it would be expedited great imminent and that you know. In the sprint car it does the mavs looked at meaning people connecting to give the other day two games actually. Born five. Did you see that. As much of the Red Sox as we're seeing now with the Indians is he is he operating a whole different level now yeah it does the payroll because he has that ES to make more of last. Yeah yeah and and the red barrel and everybody gets that far but I didn't happen these guys in the bullpen. There wanting everybody jumping ship over there. Where were attacked. They lost the a young kid going to be that general manager around and Arizona aren't there any losses thirteen year. Talent scout they had epic. Out. You know I hope we doesn't bat an accident this year W look who's left right now of the three play off teams game six tonight in Chicago and get Ager in Gonzales who. Anthony resolved. Broke okra Coke were asked Andrew Miller Tito Branko why can't we get players like that unless their job okay. It. Yeah all right let's go play were younger adult pop tarts you missed 177797937. Final segment in the mustard and Johnson show coming up. I. The that. They sneeze mosque in Johnson Sports Radio. Point seven. Did you try that bullet that team have a try to talk to the wife and no not at all. As my friends sets interviewing. Princess he tried to say interviewing John marathoner of the giants couple days ago after the hole. Josh brawn brown situation exploded. Must be nice to have all that money though you really don't have to give it time when people think you really don't reserve offered Sessler American Mara any of the NFL owners should make EO and got so much money who equaled if you don't care and you know Larry and the giants you know were the first team. To have that long waiting list you know they pass along. Generation to generation those season tickets down there and exit sixteen W. And they no matter what the product is they're gonna sell out every single. Game it's impossible to get tickets whether the giants are good mediocre or Super Bowl bound. That audience is always gonna remain. Very very loyal self. How much attention do you have to pay to the public that too is the question 6177797937. John your next on Sports Radio they just paid Iran. Oh thank you. I certainly wouldn't have a one don't wanna lift it up all optical kick of the early intervention is one of the most important things and musicians. But I just wanted to mention you know that's not conduct so I knew by the way you four you've got a number great calls one on this. This is one of many societal ills we have you know hybrid called parent. And I've been looking up today but in the aftermath of the over Ray Rice stuff farm one of the things government online at a guided to study these shoulder with. Surprising results that the athletes in and some that may be good points about the entitlement and enablement they get along the way but. If you looked at the demographics and the agents involved and so what they're worth that much out alliance. In some of these issues. Well they don't want their they're very well page but very immature young man who lived in a culture of privileged and entitlement their entire lives. Oh question. It Craig you mentioned. Perhaps you misspoke grow and Adam and in the picked it abroad alcohol being the cause. It's a big one up more often than not. Well John I know you're recovering alcoholic. But you would admit that alcohol is responsible for a lot of domestic violence would you not agree. I would say it's an ingredient that orbit. I mean put it this way people with alcoholism on all domestic abuse. Not I'm not saying at all and or you know when I think of I would say that it's great it's a good. Hi measures did you question bridal question you know I didn't look at the stats and that was shooting from the hip plan to stand out. And I and I would in an agreement with that when I think most people we get. Address the sub issue. Will deal with the demands that the final solution was well I mean you get into domestic buys power and control and so forth where you can like as I said the NFL bit. The earliest you can happen in my in my state alcohol. And into maybe caller worked in treatment in the and that in prison site. Nobody ever got told that I know of things going good. You know what I mean variety way things should the fan in people's lives. And it can sometimes just a question of you know you get sick of looking in the mirror and I'm sure that happens with domestic violence faults but visually some sort of an intervention. And equally fed intervention can happen and that's where the giants struck the ball. The early in the treatment hopefully can begin there's no excuse to the end of all the money they have can't shoot doesn't happen in maybe they do I don't know. They should have stayed at the out education. Intervention. And treatment programs available to those guys covenant the lead. In the early of the one can identify these issues and problems. Pete Earley if they can be addressed. They identified it but what they did is immediately in what it is this is their default response John. Copper op that's always the default response they hired three Werman who at least they're free Al Jane ran down in Rita Smith and on these women were supposed to have. Import and some control over how the NFL was Ghana. You would such matters and I haven't heard from many of them. Right. One left side and you're right time. To a two picture. Point should happen and one of them the lost the brother which is. Hugely serious the other was minor league and comparison that was lost the job. I had a lot of enablement allowing them to roll was my alcoholism. And final pieces up my brother's death six months Trulia I finally got enablement and did I had a new dimension and I got passed by it. And that put me on the path that was the last thing that made the white flag what can be. So without that kind of an intervention journals how much longer would've gone and they go would run somebody go with America. Or whatever but there's got to beat anybody they can identify an issue have to intervene and do something about it and hope that the person committed just the issue. We're glad you're okay now. Appreciated John. 12 areas Daniels then what's going market. I have no choice to be quick you know typically Craig I think the ratings it down. In September football anyways because people it's still trying to hang on to some are now being good need for this week notwithstanding.

Police said the accident happened at 7:40 a.m. when a woman in her 40's driving north of the parking lot of the Walmart Supercenter, at 886 Niagara Falls Blvd., lost control of her vehicle.

The driver suffered multiple non life-threatening injuries in the crash, according to the North Tonawanda Fire Department. The woman was alone in the vehicle and no one else was injured.

McIntyre October 22, 2016 9:25 am EST Print Email Tweet Search tops portal and social media, according to new data about visits to America’s largest websites in September. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google topped the list with 234 million unique visitors for the month, according to comScore. Second on the list is Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO), which probably will be bought by Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ). It had 207 million unique visitors last month. Yahoo has the bad fortune that its bread and butter, online display ads, have dropped in price. While native and video ads have replaced this somewhat, Google and Facebook have as much as two-thirds of online ad revenue. According to Bloomberg: Google, the leading Internet search provider, and Facebook, the biggest social network operator, claimed 64 percent of that revenue, according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. Google scooped up $30 billion and Facebook gathered $8 billion, while other smaller companies lost market share, the analyst noted. Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) had 205 million unique visitors. Following that is Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) with 192 million unique visitors. This includes MSN and visits to Microsoft company sites. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the online retail company, sits next at 184 million unique visitors. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is well down the list in 22nd place, with 93 million unique visitors. It, and the revenue it gets online, show something of the wall that Wal-Mart has to climb. Two media properties are next: CBS Interactive from CBS Corp. (NYSE: CBS) at 168 million and Comcast Corp.’s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal at 163 million. This includes all visitors to the cable, broadcast and studio sites, and gives some idea of why AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) would want Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX), the sites of which are broken into pieces. Turner Digital, the largest of them, had unique visitors of 132 million. Behind CBS and Comcast, AOL, a division of Verizon, has 158 million. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is next at 153 million. Among social media companies, LinkedIn Corp. (NYSE: LNKD) had 124 million, Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) 113 million and Pinterest 98 million. Mode Media, which closed in September, had 93 million unique visitors, which shows how little raw audience means. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Council has begun the process to create a new bylaw that will prevent grocery stores in the district from taking advantage of the provincial government’s offer to allow wine sales in local markets. Mission Mayor Randy Hawes asked staff on Monday night to prepare a bylaw that restricts any liquor outlet from being within one kilometre of another. The move would eliminate all grocery stores in the district from selling alcohol. “This keeps liquor in the existing retail outlets and liquor is sold in a liquor-only type business,” said Hawes. In April 2015, the provincial government announced sales of B.C. wine at grocery stores would begin, starting with a Save-On-Foods in Surrey. The new system allows grocery stores to apply to use privately held liquor licences, in order to sell B.C. wine. Grocery stores are considered to be establishments that predominately sell groceries. The system excludes “super stores,” mixed-use stores like Walmart, and convenience stores. Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge and North Vancouver all recently voted to create similar bylaws. The decision by Mission council to create the new bylaw came after a presentation by Bert Hick of Rising Tide Consultants. He was joined by at least 30 employees of existing beer and wine stores who were against allowing grocery stores to sell alcohol. Hick told council that allowing expanded wines sales will have a major impact on small liquor store owners and create more harm on the social side. “The more available you make alcohol, the greater the social costs resulting from alcohol,” he said. “When you think of alcohol access, you think of minors, you think of intoxicated persons, accidents, domestic violence – you have to consider the whole package,” Hick added. Hick believes the current model of alcohol sales should be maintained and not expanded. He noted there should always be a separation between grocery products and liquor. “Everyone has to go to the grocery store,” he said, adding having alcohol on the shelf, “next to the pickles,” can create a negative situation. With liquor stores and cold beer and wine stores, “the only reason to cross the threshold is to buy alcohol,” Hick said. Hawes said he proposed the new bylaw restrictions because he could not see any benefit to selling wine in grocery stores. “I know what the deficit is to Mission taxpayers if some of the private liquor stores are forced to close. But I don’t know what benefit there will be.” Council will vote on the bylaw at a future meeting.   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Bortner / Published: October 22, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     A Carbon County man went to prison Friday after a Schuylkill County judge sentenced him in an August 2015 case from Rush Township. Alexander J. Modawar Sr., 36, of Lansford, must serve three to 18 months in prison under the terms of Judge James P. Goodman’s sentence. Goodman imposed the sentence after revoking Modawar’s probation, which the defendant admitted violating. Modawar originally pleaded guilty on May 18 to receiving stolen property, with prosecutors withdrawing a charge of retail theft. At that time, Goodman sentenced Modawar to spend 23 months on probation and pay costs, $50 to the Criminal Justice Enhancement Account and $96.26 restitution, amounts he still must pay under the terms of Friday’s sentence. Rush Township police charged Modawar with committing his crime on Aug. 6, 2015, at the Wal-Mart Supercenter, 35 Plaza Drive, Hometown. Also in the county court, Samuel Sanabria-Sanabria, 41, of Shenandoah, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence, with prosecutors withdrawing a charge of disorderly conduct. Judge Charles M. Miller accepted the plea and sentenced the defendant to serve three to 24 months in a state correctional institution, pay costs, a $500 fine, $100 to the Substance Abuse Education Fund, a $50 CJEA payment and $120 restitution to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Schuylkill S. Jackson Street, perform 30 hours community service and submit a DNA sample to law enforcement authorities. Shenandoah police said that Sanabria-Sanabria was DUI on Aug. 17, 2015, in the borough. In another county court case, Steven C. Peiffer, 36, of Pittsburgh, pleaded guilty to charges of burglary and theft in one case and receiving stolen property in another case. Prosecutors withdrew one additional count each of theft and receiving stolen property, along with charges of criminal trespass and criminal mischief. President Judge William E. Baldwin accepted the plea and sentenced Peiffer to serve 21 to 42 months in a state correctional institution, pay costs and $387 restitution, and submit a DNA sample to law enforcement authorities. Pottsville police charged Peiffer with receiving stolen property on Dec. 21, 2014, in the city, while state police at Schuylkill Haven charged him with committing the burglary and theft on Jan. 24, 2015, in West Brunswick Township.

I’m of course not talking about the week when a Salman Khan film releases and the IQ of human beings worldwide is brought down; I speak of the Mumbai Film Festival, Jio MAMI 2016, which is not only a week long balm to everything terrible about Bollywood, but also a week long celebration of how good cinema can be. Like every year the 18th Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival kicked off to a disappointing start and faced some of the same problems it does every single year. The online booking system backfired in a big way, angering many hyperactive film buffs. Those who wanted to watch The Salesman and Personal Shopper on Day 2 were in for a rude shock as the booking page behaved like the made in China parts of the space ship in Armageddon. The page failed to load for almost an hour and when it did show up the tickets were mysteriously gone in 60 seconds. Some who didn’t get a ticket to Asghar Farhadi’s The Salesman were angry, some wept uncontrollably, and some even hinted a conspiracy theory that MAMI is deliberately not giving away online tickets because they’re selling them for black in a bylane of Mira Road whispering ‘dus ka tees’. A still from Asghar Farhadi's The Salesman. Image from Facebook. Some compared the goof and this booking system to the Indian Railway’s Tatkal scheme, which was kind of unfair but given their enthusiasm had been quashed it was a predictable reaction from angsty people on the internet. Those who had the common sense to not waste time complaining on the internet rushed to the venues still wearing their pajamas, or in some cases, still dripping in soap foam and clad in bathroom towels, and promptly booked tickets of the films. Keeping a certain percentage of offline tickets is actually a good initiative by MAMI, so those without access to the internet can also get to watch the films they want. I chose both the Andheri venues, because no self respecting film buff would go to any part of Bombay for a cinema based pilgrimage other than the Walmart of struggling filmmakers that is Versova. The biggest improvement at the fest this year is the speed at which your pass is issued to you. Thanks to the perfectly trained folks behind the counter it look less than a minute to grab my pass and head straight to the movies. This was a nice change from last year when I’d stood in line for an hour and missed a film. At the venue I got to know about the offline tickets that can be bought right at the counter. With the hope that I could still nab a ticket to The Salesman I went back downstairs to the ticket window, where they informed me that I could only get the tickets upstairs. I then rushed back upstairs and got caught in a line that reminded me of the scene in Black Hawk Down where destitute Somalian citizens fight over food packets being thrown at them by the US army. Since I didn’t carry a machete to cut my way through I naturally didn’t score a ticket, and I had to drown my sorrows by buying a gigantic ‘breakup éclair’ at Dunkin donuts. As I chewed away wiping my tears I was left with the thought that there are people in Bombay who would kill someone else to watch The Salesman; and that even if a small percentage of this much enthusiasm was shown by Indian producers to make films like The Salesman, our film industry would be such a different place. After picking up a ridiculously priced multiplex sandwich I was ready to watch the films. After the Storm, the new film from Hirokazu Koreeda was, much like his earlier films, quite lovely. The film dealt with themes already explored in Koreeda’s Like Father Like Son, like an estranged father trying to make amends with his son and ex wife, the alienation one experiences in Japanese work culture and the loss of what is most important in the contemporary world but is getting increasingly difficult to sustain – a family life. Though not quite memorable as Koreeada’s earlier work this was still an enjoyable little film mainly thanks to a likable performance from Hiroshi Abe as a struggling novelist gambling addict private detective all in one. The documentary The Lovers and the Despot chronicled a pretty crazy real life story of two South Korean film personalities kidnapped and brought to North Korea and forced to make films for Dear Leader Kim Jong Il. It’s the kind of story you expect from a Family Guy episode but the fact that this actually happened to someone makes your skin crawl. The film does a good job of telling you how things went down but it never really lives up to its potential, mainly due to the utter lack of access to the point of view of the Dear Leader himself. Still, this was a mildly memorable peek into the nightmarish dictatorial subhuman conditions in the darkest pocket of the planet that is North Korea. A still from Polish film The Lure. Image from Facebook. Depression hit like a ton of bricks with Ralitza Petrova’s Godless, a Bulgarian film set in a remote Bulgarian town that could easily be the most dismal and bleak place on Earth. The film follows a nurse whose terrible life revolves only around tending to elderly patients, being involved in an ID scam, suffering in a sexless marriage and taking drugs that still don’t make her happy. The film is a fascinating window into post-Zhivkov Bulgaria and is packed with a really hard-hitting point that nothing has changed since dictatorship ended. But the amount of suffering and unpleasantness showcased in the film that is not for one moment redeemed is just too much to not make it seem like a manipulative piece of cinema. It’s well directed and hauntingly scored but the over the top nature of its sordidness does disservice to the actual problems it is trying to address. The best of the day was saved for the last, as the Polish film The Lure turned out to be a trippy, severely entertaining punk rock musical about siren vampire mermaids who are hired as songstresses in a Polish nightclub. The film is consistently weird and flows like a mixtape of Nouvalle Vague songs ranging from heartache pop to feverish disco, wonderfully interspersed with ridiculously sexy women, gore and a fairy tale like love story. Also interesting are the metaphorical aspects of the club and the mermaids who represent immigrants exploited by Poland on their way to make it in America.

As of the end of September, building permit valuation had surpassed totals for the previous seven years, at $96.5 million. Routt County construction industry hits biggest permit valuation in 7 years: $96.5 million By Tom Ross Saturday, October 22, 2016 Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn Discuss 5 comments Advertisement Steamboat Springs  The 2016 construction season can’t match the drama of 2007 and 2008, when some of the largest multi-family residential projects at Steamboat Ski Area began to come out of the ground. However, it may prove to be a watershed year. Fueled by 13 $1 million home starts, numerous six-figure remodels and a handful of big ticket institutional building projects, this construction season is putting up numbers like the Yampa Valley hasn’t seen since the boom years of almost a decade ago. Expressed in terms of the valuation of building permits, Routt County Chief Building Official Ben Grush confirmed this month that through the end of September, this year’s construction industry is $20 million ahead of 2015, with total permit valuation of $96.5 million. That’s easily the most bullish number since 2009. Katie Berning/staff “I see this as being a reasonable level of growth,” Grush said. “This year’s been a little challenging, more so than the last several. But I think this is creating job opportunities and business opportunities from design professionals all the way through to suppliers.” His department has conducted more than 4,000 inspections this year. The construction rebound is also putting stress on general contractors as they compete for the attention of subcontractors they need to show up on time to keep their projects on schedule. The problem is the electricians, plumbers, dry-wallers, painters and tile setters they rely upon are in short supply. The roster of skilled subcontractors who understand the challenge of building in the mountains was depleted by the ravages of the Great Recession, with many relocating to distant markets, as Routt County lagged the recovery nationwide. General contractor Tom Dover, who came to Steamboat in 2003 in the midst of a 25-year career, said the construction industry is as busy as it’s ever been here, but it’s not all good news. “It’s killing it right now, everybody is so busy,” Dover said. “Even in 2007, it wasn’t like this. Well, it probably was this busy in 2007, but I don’t think we have the workforce to handle it now.” Dover is in the middle of building four $1 million-plus homes — “Houses below a million are few and far between,” he said — and for the first time in his career here, he said he’s going to miss on the promise of a move-in date. “I have clients who are supposed to move in Thanksgiving week,” he said. “Since 1993, I’ve never missed a move in, but I’m going to miss this one. I had to tell my clients, ‘Guys, I’m fighting an uphill battle. I can only push so hard. You’ll get in a couple of weeks late.’” Dover acknowledged that subcontractors are being stretched thin, but he said though they charge top dollar here, they aren’t the only reason building costs are so high. “It’s not just the subs,” he said. “It’s as much materials. Lumber is up, it’s a commodity and it’s in high demand. Plywood, OSB (oriented strand board) and two-by-fours have gone through the roof.” Realtor Tom Valicenti of Colorado Group Realty attributed the challenge of securing subcontractors to supply and demand. “The price of new construction has risen for many reasons but during the recession we lost a good percentage of our work force that relocated to find construction work in the Denver area where work was plentiful,” he said. “So our current craftsman have limited availability and have adjusted their prices accordingly.” Where the valuation is The city of Steamboat has accounted for $66.5 million in permit valuation so far this year and $24 million is attributable to single-family home construction, Grush said. Commercial projects include the $700,000 remodel of the Walmart store, the new $2.03 million building on the United Methodist Church campus, a $3.89 million permit for the expansion at Yampa Valley Medical Center and $7.89 million combined for the two buildings in The Reserves affordable apartments being developed by the Overland Property Group. Single-family projects in the county (excluding Hayden, which has its own building department) account for $23 million of the total of the overall $30 million in permit valuation. “Those are mostly builds on (parcels) 35 acres and up in the county,” Grush said. “There have been maybe a half dozen houses in Steamboat, Silver Spur (and Heritage Park).” Scarce building lots fuel remodel trend If there’s a concern looming just over the horizon, it might be the scarcity of building lots in the city and close-in rural subdivisions. Ulrich Salzgeber, executive director of the Steamboat Springs Board of Realtors, said he turned up 85 lots on the multiple listing service, but that number includes larger acreages in the countryside close to Steamboat. When one searches the website of one of the real estate brokerages here, there are only 11 building lots priced between $260,000 and $370,000 in the city proper, and the asking prices go up from there. The lowest-priced building lot in the city is a shallow .26-acre lot on Apres Ski Way with an asking price of $195,000. That’s a problem. Katie Berning/staff Realtor Tom Valicenti confirmed supply is dwindling even though the local market has seen a great deal of sales and spec home construction in the Barn Village subdivision just east of Pine Grove Road and in Greystone on the Green perched above Rollingstone Golf Course. “With new home construction running between $275 and $450 per square foot depending on finishes and architecture, many buyers are turning to remodeling an older home that they purchased for less per square foot than new construction would cost,” Valicenti said. Grush pointed out that in addition to lower costs per square foot, remodelers also realize value in the fact that the utilities are already extended to the house, and a significant number of tap fees, which can add up fast, have already been paid. Grush believes that aesthetics are also driving the trend toward remodels — affluent buyers who are looking for homes in Steamboat have an expectation that they will have a dramatic view out the window of their great room. When they can’t find a suitable lot that offers a mountain view, they are more inclined to look at an existing home that doesn’t meet their expectations but does sit on a view lot. Realtor Nick Metzler confirmed that trend. Photo by Tom Ross Crews working for Haselden Construction were completing exterior finishes and installing landscaping outside the new addition to Yampa Valley Medical Center this month. The $3.89 million building permit valuation for this summer's work at the hospital contributed to a total permit valuation for Routt County and Steamboat Springs of $96.5 million through the end of September. “After driving people around Steamboat for 25 years, I’ve found that for 80 percent of them, four out of five, the view is going to be in the top three items they are looking at in a home,” he said. Valicenti said inevitably, as homebuyers continue to take advantage of the remodel option, those prices too will rise. “With fewer available lots on the market, this trend should continue until the price of resale homes becomes too high to make good financial sense to buyers and homeowners,” he said.  Metzler said the scarcity of existing single-family homes under $600,000 and the age of those homes is also a factor in current trends. Among the 11 single-family homes in the city limits priced under $600,000, the average asking price per square foot is $408, he said. “The kicker is that the average of these 11 homes is 50-plus years,” Metzler said. “And only three of them have a two-car garage.” Salzgeber pointed out the longstanding rule of thumb, that the construction value of a house should be about three times the value of the lot. That means a $250,000 building lot implies a $1 million construction project. At $300 dollars per square foot, a modestly sized home of 2,300 square feet would add up to $690,000 for the structure on top of $250,000, or $940,000. Metzler said buyers’ thinking on balancing lot costs with building costs is evolving, particularly on the higher end, as homebuyers increase their emphasis on efficient homes. High-end buyers are increasingly willing to build a smaller, more efficient home on a large estate lot. It goes without saying there are still people in Routt County who want to build a home for less than $1 million. But their options are shrinking significantly and may lie to the south in unincorporated Stagecoach and to the west in ready-to-build subdivisions in Hayden. Metzler and his partners in the Sunlight subdivision on an elevated parcel with views of the ski area above the north side of U.S. Highway 40 between the community center and the stoplight at Elk River Road, hope to release the first 40 lots in the 92-lot subdivision in 2017. Pricing isn’t available yet, but Metzler said they will soon establish a formal process allowing buyers/builders to reserve one of the first 20 lots in Sunlight. The intent, he said, is to allow buyers to begin the planning process for a new home in advance of going to contract and closing next year. ‘We then will release another 20 lots by mid-summer, if not sooner,” Metzler said. “Sunlight will have some custom homes and also new homes built for sale next summer.” A rare species One of the lessons the Steamboat Springs/Routt County community took from the Great Recession was that many of the people intent on purchasing reasonably priced family homes were people working in the housing industry themselves. They were plumbing contractors, people selling custom-cut granite countertops, installing hardwood flooring, designing and installing custom kitchens, and on and on. But not as many of those skilled people live here as once did, and the housing market has been evolving in the meantime. Looking ahead to retirement, Dover is developing 10 live-work units in Cooper Ridge, with an eye on housing construction workers for other contractors. “All my subs are complaining they have nowhere to house employees,” Dover said. “My plumbing contractor had a guy from Kansas, who was very good, but after a few months he left. He couldn’t get a house. Really good workers are making $30 an hour … if you’re a kid with no bills that’s great. But if you’re an adult, you can’t survive.” Dover isn’t certain where the upward spiral of building costs will end. “I don’t know where it’s headed,” he said. “There’s no labor force. Is there going to be one? Not as long as the cost of living is as high as it is.” Valicenti suggested construction is challenging throughout the mountain towns. “When looking at most world class resort markets, Steamboat fares very well in determining good value with competing ski areas,” he said.

Upvote 0 Post reply Please Login and/or Verify your account to reply Sign in to suggest removal Scott Wedel 3 weeks, 2 days ago Eric, Million dollar houses are not being financed by exceptional leverage as if a bubble. Interest rates are low, but the flip side is that it is historically difficult to qualify for loans. Banks have high liquidity requirements so they are greatly limited in their ability to lend. Thus, buyers are bringing a large amount of cash to the table when buying million dollar houses and the part that is financed has a long term fixed interest loan. So their monthly payment is fixed to what they can afford. Thus, this does not look like a bubble that can result in a price collapse and numerous foreclosures when there is an economic downtown. Though, it is certainly plausible that higher end housing prices could decline, particularly if interest rates increase. I also note that while SB is doing well building million dollar housing, there is no housing boom for what might house the subcontractors or other parts of the workforce in better jobs. That is where loans are harder to get and government regulations such as tap fees and building codes with ever more requirements keep ratcheting up construction costs. I think we should seriously consider enacting 1990 building codes and tossing all of the stuff since then. Buildings constructed in the 80s are not falling over or causing great problems. At some point, the quality of the product should be up to the free market consumer and not specified by government. It makes particularly little sense to constantly add requirements to new construction without requiring similar retrofits to existing buildings. If the item is so beneficial, such as smoke alarms, then it is required in existing buildings, not just new construction.

Our current zero interest policy may be historically unique in that money is inexpensive for those with assets, but unavailable to most of the population. Currently, if you want FHA financing for building apartments then they want two years of rental income. So a builder would have to float the project for two years. Thus, wealthy people are able to use their existing assets to borrow at low interest rates. Meanwhile, members of the rest of the population can be smart enough to see great opportunities, but have no hopes of getting low interest rate financing. This region is setting up to have a shortage of service workers to rival SF or NYC. With the new building codes likely to be approved and the challenges of financing, any new housing supply including apts is going to need tenants making $50K a year to live in Hayden or Oak Creek. Going to need $75K annually to live in new apts in SB. I suppose taxpayers can spend over $200K per apt in subsidies to create local "workforce" housing as YVHA is doing at Elk River. If we just double city taxes to create a local government agency building affordable housing able to almost keep up with local demand.

(Photo: Bryon Houlgrave/The Register)Buy Photo Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton masks and scary clown costumes might be top of mind for many Halloween revelers this year, but superheroes rule the holiday in central Iowa. For the first time in 11 years, sales of Ironman, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other superhero costumes for children have outpaced the ever-popular princess outfits, said Ryan Oshel, manager of the Wal-Mart store in Windsor Heights. Their popularity has been boosted by omnipresent movie and video releases featuring comic book icons, Oshel said. U.S. shoppers will dole out more this year on Halloween costumes, candy and decorations — an average of $82.93 a person, compared with $74.34 last year, according to the National Retail Federation. Halloween sales are expected to top $8.4 billion, albeit still a fraction of the $656 billion that shoppers are expected to spend for the winter holidays this year. Even so, the interest in finding that perfect Halloween costume is leading to strong sales around the area. The Theatrical Shop in Valley Junction shopping district has been getting plenty of requests for masks bearing the likeness of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, said Kathy Harkrader, store manager. The masks run $20 to $30, she said. “The Hillary sales are more than the Trump, but I don’t know why,” mused Harkrader, adding that Clinton and Trump wigs also are popular.

But what about those already holding debt? We take a look as part of our series How the Deck Is Stacked, funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, in partnership with “Frontline” and Marketplace. Marketplace’s Lizzie O’Leary has the first of two stories. LIZZIE O’LEARY: If everything had gone according to plan, Chris Savelle would be on Wall Street right now, not biking through downtown Detroit in a free weekly community ride. Savelle, who is 31, graduated into the teeth of the recession. He’s got $100,000 in student loan debt on his mind. What does $100,000 feel like? CHRIS SAVELLE, Student Borrower: It sucks. LIZZIE O’LEARY: Jessica Love Jordan is in a similar situation. She started college late and is now working on finishing her master’s in addiction counseling. She juggles school, work and being a single parent. Sometimes, the debt feels too much. JESSICA LOVE JORDAN, Student Borrower: Now and again, when I look at the statement, and see how much I actually have to pay back, it’s almost suffocating. I have those fleeing thoughts, you know what, let me just stop now, and go work, so I can be able to live later on in life. LIZZIE O’LEARY: When she graduates, she can expect to make about $33,000 annually as an addiction counselor. Her debt will be about $90,000. The median student debt is much lower than Savelle or Love Jordan’s, about $27,000. But their experiences are similar to those of many students who attended state universities at a time when their budgets were being cut, and as the great recession hit. The money for school had to come from somewhere, in most cases, students. Where did you think you would be in your life at 31? CHRIS SAVELLE: Go work for an investment firm or hedge fund, Chicago, New York, something like that. LIZZIE O’LEARY: But when Savelle graduated in 2008, the best job he could find was at a local Wal-Mart. He’s recovered somewhat now. He works as a supply chain engineer, and supports his mother and sister. Temple University Professor Sara Goldrick-Rab has been researching the rising price of college for years. How has the aid picture changed as median incomes have stagnated, really, for the last 20 years? SARA GOLDRICK-RAB, Temple University: The sticker price on a per student basis has gone up a lot, while the amount of financial aid on a per student basis has gone down. So, the result is that the net price, the amount that the families actually pay out of their pocket, is rising, and it’s rising fairly rapidly. LIZZIE O’LEARY: More than 40 million Americans have student loan debt. The total amount is around $1.3 trillion. Even so, there are experts like Sandy Baum, who studies student debt at the Urban Institute, and says only certain people are being hurt. SANDY BAUM, Urban Institute: Student debt is a crisis for some people, but student debt is not the generalized crisis that the common discourse would make it appear. Yes, people are paying more of their incomes for a college education, but still it’s worth it for most people. It’s still a very good investment for most people, but not for everyone. LIZZIE O’LEARY: Sara Goldrick-Rab says far too many people are being saddled with substantial debt. You wrote that debt is a symptom, not the disease. It sounds like you think the disease is the high price. SARA GOLDRICK-RAB: The disease is the price. And we have a problem, where people are being priced out of college, and in their effort to not be priced out, they’re taking on debt that, frankly, they’re going to have real trouble repaying. LIZZIE O’LEARY: People like Jordan Hoeft. He’s been trying to get a more manageable payment plan. He studied film, but couldn’t get a job in the industry. He now owes $100,000 in private student loans, but was paying interest only until recently. He lives at home in the Chicago suburbs with his parents. They already were tapped out after helping his siblings with loans. So Jordan’s parents asked his grandparents to co-sign. And when his debt piled up, the loan servicer came calling. MELODI HOEFT, Jordan’s Mother: My father co-signed for some of the kids’ loans after Patrick and I were tapped out on signing, co-signing for them. My father passed away, and within 60 days of my dad passing away, the private student loan venders were calling my mom, harassing her, wanting her to pay the balance in full. LIZZIE O’LEARY: The whole thing? MELODI HOEFT: The whole balance, and that he — they were not in arrears at all. My mom called me crying, saying, “I don’t have that money and they want me to pay this loan.” And I said, oh, no. LIZZIE O’LEARY: She must have been terrified? MELODI HOEFT: She was hysterical. LIZZIE O’LEARY: Jordan Hoeft’s loans are serviced by Navient, which spun off from Sallie Mae, and now owns its student debt business. It is one of the nation’s largest student debt servicers. The company handles both private and federal loans. Hoeft’s loans are private, not federal, and had a high interest rate. JORDAN HOEFT, Student Borrower: So, I told them, almost as a joke, I said, I can either have you guys lower my payments, so I can make rent, and then pay you, or I can live in my truck and make the full payments to you every month. And the woman on the phone, dead serious, told me, “I don’t want to tell you to have to live in your truck, but you might have to live in your truck.” LIZZIE O’LEARY: We asked Navient about that phone call, and they told us — quote — “Our representative sympathizes with Mr. Hoeft, and the two establish a rapport in which she dismisses his facetious comment that he may need to live in his car. Our representative didn’t urge him to live in his car. Rather, she encourages him to consider a practical option, such as finding a roommate to split expenses.” Jordan and his mother decided to do something about how they were being treated by their servicer and reached out to their state’s top law enforcement officer. LISA MADIGAN, Attorney General, Illinois: I have seen an increasing number of fraud complaints from current and former higher education students. LIZZIE O’LEARY: Lisa Madigan is the attorney general for Illinois. After noticing a rise in complaints against companies involved in higher education, Madigan filed lawsuits against several for-profit schools. Now she is leading a multistate investigation into Navient. Why did you decide to look at Navient? LISA MADIGAN: It was the volume of complaints that we received and the serious nature of them. We have looked at over 5,000 complaints, we have listened to over 800 phone calls, and we have been able to determine that, time and time again, the servicers are not providing borrowers with their repayment options. LIZZIE O’LEARY: The majority of student loans are federal and originate with the Department of Education, but they’re contracted out to a handful of companies who manage the payments. It’s a $140 billion industry annually, and servicers, like Navient, make about $2 billion in commission per year. LISA MADIGAN: Most of the time, what they do if someone is struggling is, they will put them into a forbearance, which is not necessarily going to be the best thing for that borrower in the long run, certainly not going to make that debt any more manageable. In fact, it will often tend to grow that debt. LIZZIE O’LEARY: There are several ways to reduce monthly payments. Deferment or forbearance temporarily postpones payments, but interest may continue to accrue while payments are on hold. For federal loans, there are several income-based repayment options, where a borrower pays a portion of their discretionary income, from 10 percent down to zero if they’re unemployed. Madigan thinks servicers are pushing borrowers into forbearance. LISA MADIGAN: Unfortunately, the way it ends up working out is, it’s good for the servicer, because they’re incentivized through their compensation to get people through the process, but it is bad for the borrower, which is ultimately bad for that person’s family and bad for our overall economy. LIZZIE O’LEARY: Navient declined to comment directly on Madigan’s investigation and instead sent this statement: “Navient is a leader in enrolling eligible borrowers into income-driven repayment programs. We have been strong advocates for streamlining the enrollment process to make it easier for borrowers.” “PBS NewsHour” requested an interview with the Department of Education. It declined. The department pointed us to this policy memo suggesting servicers provide better information to borrowers, but any changes, if approved, wouldn’t take effect until 2019. Borrowers like Jordan Hoeft may never see any changes. Seth Frotman of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau says his agency is tracking complaints. The agency has started monitoring many key financial players, including loan service companies. SETH FROTMAN, Consumer Finance Protection Bureau: And there’s an amazing government audit that found that 70 percent of federal student loan borrowers in default, so have defaulted on their loans, were actually eligible for an income-generated payment plan as low as zero dollars. I think that’s an abysmal failure. And I think that’s a direct implication of student loan servicers and the oversight over student loan servicers. LIZZIE O’LEARY: The borrowers most likely to default? Those with $10,000 or less in student loans. They have lower debt, but are less likely to have completed their degrees and may have lower earnings. Chris Savelle’s debt has affected his little sister’s future as well. If it weren’t for Chris’ debt, do you think Katie would be in a four-year school now? JAN SAVELLE, Chris Savell’s Mother: I think she would. I think if she could see that she could get an education without having a lifetime of crushing debt, I think she would. LIZZIE O’LEARY: The legacy of Chris Savelle’s debt will be with him, his sister and his whole generation long after it’s paid.

Hot Topics: U.S. Presidential Election News Local Elections Where We Live My Classic Car The Alphabet Print   Email   Font Resize Question 3: Debate rages over animals in cages Sentinel & Enterprise Updated:   10/23/2016 06:32:03 AM EDT Third in a series examining the four ballot questions before Massachusetts voters in the Nov. 8 election. By Oriana Durand Boston University Statehouse Program To frame the Question 3 debate in the way the opponents and proponents have argued over the past few months, Massachusetts voters are being asked to choose between an ethical treatment of farm animals and the impact on low-income families. Supporters of the ballot question argue that a "yes" vote would make it illegal to keep chickens, pigs and calves in cages that prevent them from standing up or moving their limbs. "These animals are crammed in cages so small that they can barely move an inch, and this practice is abusive," said Stephanie Harris, the Yes on 3 campaign director. Opponents led by Diane Sullivan, an anti-poverty activist, say the extra costs of the law would make cheap eggs unavailable to poor families that rely on cheap protein options to feed their children. "It is a social injustice. It's regressive food tax," Sullivan said. "We are making the decision between do I pay my rent, do I feed my children or keep the lights on?" Question 3 forbids the sale of eggs, pork and veal from animals raised in tight confinement, although the law would affect just one farm in Massachusetts. However, it would also apply to sales imported from sources outside of the state. "Every other farm in Massachusetts is doing the right thing by their hens, so it's a really reasonable and modest measure. Advertisement It's also about animal welfare and preventing animal cruelty," said Harris. Joann Lindenmayer, an expert in public health and veterinary medicine, believes any increase in price would be a modest cost that would allow more humane treatment of farm animals. "If you think of it in terms of risk benefit, the benefit to millions of animals is enormous. It's an incredibly small price to play for a huge animal welfare benefit," said Lindenmayer. Opponents have challenged the referendum as unenforceable and unfair to those struggling to make ends meet. Currently, the national average price for one dozen large eggs is $1.47, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. With this new legislation, egg industry studies show that prices can rise between 1 and 5 cents per egg, which would amount to an additional $10 per year per household. During a recent debate aired on the Boston public radio station WBUR, Bill Bell, the general manager of the Brown Egg Council, said consumers who rely on eggs would have no alternative to the higher prices brought by the ballot question. Opponents point to California, where a similar law was passed in 2008. Following its implementation, prices of eggs rose above the national cost for eggs. "Eggs are inelastic in their demand and supply because they are so essential for protein," he said. "Producer cost (for cage-free eggs), which is a 36 percent increase, will be reflected in the marketplace, and I can assure you it'll be more than a penny or two an egg." However, Question 3 supporters claim the changes will improve not only animal conditions, but also food safety. "Massachusetts families are currently threatened by these substandard and unsafe products in our marketplace," said Harris. "Cage facilities have a significantly higher rate of salmonella than their cage-free counterparts do, and salmonella is the leading cause of food poisoning deaths in America today." Jessica Van Steensburg, whose farm We Can Farm is located in the town of Heath, said you can see the difference between eggs from confined chickens and those from hens raised in more spacious conditions. "I raised my animals on a small farm. The eggs are bright orange rather than pale yellow, and that's a direct reflection of how they're raised," said Van Steensburg. Large corporations such as Walmart, McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts and many others have pledged to use or sell eggs that come exclusively from cage-free environments. "If they want to sell to those large companies, farmers are going to have to change the way they're raising these animals," said Lindenmayer.  Diemand Farm, in the Franklin County town of Wendell, is the sole farm in Massachusetts that would be impacted by the new law, according to a statement from "Tammy" at the Diemand Farm. It currently raises nearly 3,000 laying birds. If the legislation passes, it would have to reduce that number to 500. "There are not enough free-range chickens in Massachusetts to supply the millions of eggs purchased by consumers. This would lead to a price increase and probably a shortage of eggs," said Tammy. Although the vote takes place this November, implementation would not begin until 2022, which allows businesses, retailers and farmers to adapt and make the transition to cage-free eggs. "Unlike California, where farmers had to make that adjustment very fast, Massachusetts will be given until 2022 to make that switch over. This can be something that's gradual, it doesn't need to have the immediate impact on the price of eggs," said Lindenmayer.

(Photo: Dan Powers/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo 203 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Owners of small retail shops might not take a paycheck for the first year or two in business. And they may have paid for their dream ventures with every penny of their personal savings, plus a second mortgage on the house. If Steve Pratt ever wrote a book, he says he'd title it, “The small retailer: What the consumer doesn’t know,” and fill it with this kind of insider information. Pratt — who's known as Pratter by his staff and customers —  is owner of the Cranked Bike Shop on Main Street in Neenah. He's been on the front lines of small retail for nearly 40 years. He knows that the love of what shopowners do motivates them, but his behind-the-scenes peek would also reveal that they pay a steep price for their passion. He says many work seven days a week and seldom, if ever, take vacations. They work extra hours before or after shop hours. Many work alone, which makes eating lunch or even going to the bathroom a challenge. “Small retailers do not have insurance, pensions, retirement plans or dental plans,” he said. “We usually have to do everything — marketing, ordering, bookkeeping, cleaning, repairs, organizing.” That brings up the question of why do it at all, but he said they want to be their own bosses and create their own businesses. Tina Palmer, another downtown Neenah shopowner, has two stores: Vintique and Red Door Mercantile. She agrees that small retailers take great financial risk in exchange for the satisfaction of creating something new. “We really love our community enough to put our heart and soul into everything we do,” she said. "At the very minimum, it takes at least two years, up to five, to get financially established, find your way and get the word out there to even let people know you exist." The reality, though, is that she still has people who walk into her 7-year-old Vintique store and ask if it’s new. Pratt sees that trends are not on the side of small retailers. They've been battered by the rise of big box stores and discounters, and now they’re particularly vulnerable to the internet's cheap tax-free prices. While his prices are not as inexpensive as those on the internet, he says he and small local shops offer a better value in the long run. The price in his shop includes fitting the bike to the rider and expert knowledge. Big boxes and mail order bypass the assembly, adjustments and service that are free-flowing in a small shop. Buy Photo Steve Pratt is the owner of Cranked Bike Studio in Neenah.  (Photo: Dan Powers/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin) Small retailers are part of the fabric of American business, Pratt said, and everyone has a stake in keeping them around, not only for the character of their communities, but also for employment. If they disappear, “million of jobs would be gone,” he said. U.S. Small Business Administration stats back him up in a report on the country's 28 million small businesses. “Small businesses provide 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of all net new jobs since the 1970s,” it reported. At the same time, the SBA paints a dismal picture of their survival rate. One-third of all small businesses fold in the first two years, it reports. Just 50 percent make it to five years. Only a third are still in business at the 10-year mark. “It takes anywhere from three to five years for a small retailer to become settled or established,” Pratt said. “A lot have to have a partner bring in an income to live on. The new business cannot support itself, and you have to survive. So another (person) has to be there to make it happen.” Pratt wouldn’t reveal how much he pays himself now, but said most would be shocked to hear how low it is. He did confirm that if a $15-an-hour mandatory minimum wage ever becomes reality, he’d not only be giving employees a raise, but he’d get one himself. Other retailers say there are a few more crucial things that customers should know. “When people support small businesses in their community, it has a domino effect,” said Vintique's Palmer. “The money you spend stays in the community. We as businesses are constantly supporting other small businesses. We’re very mindful of that.” When small retailers fail, it’s usually not for a lack of trying. They've tried loyalty cards, Facebook and some form of advertising. Fox Cities resident Jane Sprangers opened The Bookworm in Darboy in 2004, and the sunny yellow book shop only lasted two years despite her best efforts. Ultimately, she figured location may have been her downfall. “I had loyal customers; I just did not have enough walk-ins," she said. "The location of your store is crucial.” The experience also opened her eyes. “I have a new respect for all small businesses,” she said. “If I walk in, I’ll always purchase something for myself or a gift. I know they struggle, even if they don’t look like they’re struggling.” Pratt also believes consumers should patronize small shops if they want to keep them in their communities. “If a shop does not have anyone come in that day, this means no gross dollars in. No money to pay for the items in the store let alone any profit to pay the bills. This includes the owner’s income. No sales means simply no money.” He also said he’s not sure why so many customers routinely press for discounts from tiny retailers who can ill afford to give them. “People don’t ask Walmart for a deal, or the grocery store, so why ask a small retailer? If they go into a shoe store and they like the product, they buy it. Here, they’ll say ‘what’s your best price?’ or ‘what can you throw in?’” He tells customers that it is his best price, hoping they won't just kick the tires and leave.

This week’s reader question asks, “What do you want small retailers to know?” Let them know what they should do or say to get your business and loyalty. Maybe you have suggestions about hours, staffing or something else entirely that you think they’re overlooking. This is meant to be constructive criticism rather than bashing any individual store. Send me your opinion by the end of the day Thursday to be in time for a reader response column running next Monday. You can post here, send me an email or even call on the phone. I’ll start. I have a bone to pick with stores that ask for my phone number or email before they’ll ring up my purchases. It's none of their business. Just take the money and don't ask for any personal information. Attitudes also irk me. I stopped going to two shops in Appleton because the people behind the counter — the owners, believe it or not — were always grumpy and complaining. Hey, if we want this kind of attitude, we can just stay home with the teenagers.

I lost a hero yesterday. Oprah Winfrey, in one of those typical sleazy, gaslighty mental feats of illusion that Clinton supporters have become famous for, told people who are having trouble bringing themselves to support Hillary that they don’t have to like the illicitly-nominated Democratic nominee, but they do have to vote for her. “She’s not coming over to your house! You don’t have to like her,” I read my former soul sister say in this infernal Politico article to the sound of my heart ripping in half. Like that’s the problem. I don’t support Hillary because she’s not the sort of person I’d want to have over for tea. It’s got nothing to do with her corporate cronyism, her consistently disastrous warmongering, the way she’s dragging America kicking and screaming into a military confrontation with a nuclear superpower, or the fact that her election will mark the official time of death of democracy in the United States. Nope! It’s that she’s not the sort of person I’d want to have over and watch reruns of Friends with on the couch. No thanks, ma'am. '#Oprah On #Hillary #Clinton: You Don';t Have to Like Her, Just #Vote For Her https://t.co/NxZpyIrc7u — Tamarind Lemur (@tamarindlemur) October 23, 2016 Listen Oprah, you horrible, cruel, beautiful goddess of a woman, I would gleefully live with Hillary Clinton if it would stop her from becoming president. I would happily live as her roommate until whatever weird diseases she’ll inevitably succumb to get the better of her, if that would save my kids from having to grow up in a world where that woman is the Commander-in-Chief of the greatest military force on the planet. That was a nasty, manipulative lie you told your adoring fans with your silky smooth voice, and I’ll never forgive you for it. Another good woman down. Crap. I’m getting so sick of this. Treating people who won’t support that evil woman like we’re the problem, when we’re the only ones with our eyes still open. And I’m not just talking about the people who’ve done their research and can conceptually articulate what a force of destruction she is, either. Even the everyday Americans who don’t have time for political obsession, but who are still in-tune enough with their primal intuition to know a predator when they see one, are beacons of light in the darkness, because that intuition is immune to the toxic manipulations and mind viruses the neoliberal think tank has been frantically trying to stuff into their heads. At least, as long as they trust that intuition more than they trust the people trying to convince them to abandon it. But that’s precisely what Oprah was trying to do. She was addressing that “Ewww” feeling in our belly that she darn well knows is there because she obviously has it too, and trying to trick us into laughing it off and ignoring it. “Oh, your animal body goes into fright mode whenever you hear her voice? That ain’t no thing.” After years and years of getting us to dig into our intuition and trust our guts, Oprah is now saying we should press “override” and vote for the woman that everything in our being screams “NO!” at. That’s what all of those awful people are trying to do. The talking heads on the news, the fake comedians on Comedy Central and HBO, all these faux progressives acting like they’re somehow being rebellious and outspoken when all they’re doing is trying to gaslight Americans into abandoning their inner vision to prop up the Walmart/welfare system for the benefit of billionaires. #MotherOnFire #JillNotHill #NeverHillary https://t.co/hJ1MeZkbIj — Ida Martinac (@IdaMartinac) October 21, 2016 People who refuse to be bullied and manipulated into falling in line are not the problem, they’re the solution. The clear-eyed rebels are the only ones left with any hope of dragging us out of this mess, because everyone else is marching headlong into a more pervasively-bolstered corporate kleptocracy and a probable World War III. Despite all the deceptions being sown by Hillary’s goons in the corporate media, we’re the ones who’ve managed to plant our feet in the surging tsunami of deceit and begin collaborating with the basement dwellers, the Bernie-or-Busters, the visionaries, the mystics, the healers, the true artists, the Greens, the whistleblowers, the transparency advocates, and yes, even the “deplorable” victims of the Walmart economy on the political right, to bring the light of truth to the forefront of social consciousness. We’re not going to stop, and we’re not going to fall in line. And in the end, we’re going to win. We’ve reached critical mass now, and the age-old power structures have been forced, in desperation, to extend themselves way too far into the light in order to keep things under control. What we’ve seen cannot be unseen, and we’re going to keep shining brighter and brighter and dragging all the structures of manipulation and control into the light to break the spell the rest of society has fallen under. In the end, the machinations of oppression will be shrugged off like a heavy coat on a warm day. We won’t expect a thank you for our efforts, but hey. You’re welcome in advance.

Christopher Kimball, 36, who has a 12-page criminal record that spans back to 1998, admitted Friday to the incidents between June 11 and July 11. Assistant Berkshire District Attorney Caitlin Shugrue said Kimball has already served time on assault and larceny convictions. Kimball's attorney, Joseph Zlatnik, said his client "immediately," began taking advantage of counseling and therapy opportunities while in pretrial detention in an effort to better himself. "He's a very different person than the one I met a few months ago," Zlatnik said, noting Kimball was willing to take full responsibility for his actions. Those actions include a charge of receiving stolen property under $250, being found with a blank check stolen from a couple for whom Kimball was working at the time, vandalizing a window at the Barton's Crossing shelter in an attempt to break into a vacant room, and a larceny under $250 by false pretense charge for fraudulently returning merchandise to Walmart in order to get a $190 refund. Kimball also admitted to a June 12 break-in at St. Charles Church, during which he'd pried open a pair of prayer boxes. He stole about $25, but, in the process, caused an estimated $2,400 worth of damage. Zlatnik said Kimball's first instinct when he went to the church was an attempt to find work and food, a statement corroborated by the Rev. Peter Gregory, who was interviewed by police around the time of the theft. Kimball pleaded guilty in Central Berkshire District Court on Friday to charges in four separate cases. Rota offered to sentence Kimball to one year in the Berkshire Jail and House of Correction, effectively ending his case, or nine months in jail, followed by another six months of probation with conditions. Kimball accepted the latter offer and was given credit for 87 days of time already served while awaiting trial. Contact Bob Dunn at 413-441-3415.

(Photo: SCOTT KEELER / Staff)Buy Photo 21 CONNECTTWEET 7 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE While the Oct. 13 smash-and-grab burglary at The Gun Shop may have been an isolated incident for Simpsonville, it's one of several in the region that have caught the attention of law enforcement, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Just before 3 a.m. on Oct. 13, Simpsonville police said three unknown suspects drove a stolen, white Chrysler minivan with a North Carolina license plate through the front door. The suspects then stole an undisclosed number of handguns before fleeing in a waiting getaway car, according to Simpsonville police investigator James Donnelly. Eight days later, a case eerily similar to the one in Simpsonville took place near Charlotte. According to police reports, a stolen Mercedes SUV was intentionally driven through the front of Eagle Guns in Concord, North Carolina around 3 a.m. Friday morning. After the crash, weapons were stolen. According to reports, more than 420 guns have been stolen in the Charlotte area this year. “North Carolina’s getting slammed,” Donnelly said. The act of purposely driving a vehicle into a store to burglarize it has become common enough that it’s now called ram-raiding. According to news reports, vehicles have also been driven into gun shops in Buford, Georgia, Newport News, Virginia and Louisville, Kentucky since July. Federal investigators are offering a cash reward of up to $15,000 for tips leading to the arrest of those responsible for the incident at The Gun Shop. The ATF is offering a reward of up to $7,500, which will be matched by the National Shooting Sports Foundation — the trade association for the firearms industry — for a total of $15,000, Special Agent Gerod King of the Charlotte division of ATF said. “One of the crimes becoming more prevalent in North and South Carolina has been gun shop burglaries and robberies,” King said. "We're putting a priority on those, so therefore we're offering rewards on pretty much all of these cases throughout the Carolinas." THE GREENVILLE NEWS $15K reward offered in Simpsonville gun store burglary The Gun Shop manager Adam Medlin and Donnelly said they could not say what was taken from the shop as the ATF has yet to release that information. Donnelly said the case is progressing well though, and even better than he expected at this point. “Things are looking positive and we should have some resolution soon,” Donnelly said. Two days after the minivan destroyed the entrance at The Gun Shop, the store reopened for business, albeit with a very different look. The 3-year-old shop’s front door used to have windows on either side with security bars in one section of the windows. The windows and glass door were framed by a brick border. After reopening on Oct. 15, the windows that were located on one side of the door have been replaced by a red concrete wall. A barred window remains on the other side of the glass door, but now in front of the glass portion of the building are five red concrete bollards separated a few feet apart. Simpsonville Interim Police Chief Steve Moore believes the last time a Simpsonville gun shop was burglarized prior to this occurred in 2009. He said thieves in that case broke through a concrete block at the back entrance with a sledgehammer. The latest incident has him wondering what’s next. “Businesses like these try to take precautions because they know this could happen. … The Gun Shop looked pretty secure (in the past),” Moore said. “That doesn’t account for the brazen, drive-your-car-through-the-front-door sort of guys that we had happen here. “Any kind of physical security that you have up can be defeated given the ability of the criminal or outside the box thinking.” While there are quite a few other stores that sell guns in Simpsonville, including pawn shops and Walmart, the Gun Shop is the first with a shooting range. Prior to opening on June 1, 2013, a city ordinance was changed to allow the discharging of a firearm in an indoor shooting gallery within city limits. Moore said a big concern during debate by City Council when discussing the ordinance change was noise. He said the Police Department has yet to hear a complaint of noise coming from The Gun Shop. “They spoke with the library next door, and library officials didn’t have an ounce of concern,” Simpsonville Planning and Zoning Manager Jason Knudsen said. “There’s nothing over and beyond they had to do to open there. … The range itself had to be approved by federal regulations. “There’s no public safety issue there. It’s only a perceived issue.” Anyone who was in the area of N.E. Main St. between 2:30 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Oct. 13 is asked to contact Donnelly at jdonnelly@simpsonvillepd.com or call Greenville County Crime Stoppers at 864-23-CRIME. Tipsters can also contact the ATF at 1-800-ATF-GUNS or email ATFTips@atf.gov. All calls and tips will be kept confidential.

From left are Joe Nieman, Dan Magnuszewski and Jack Greco. (Sharon Cantillon/Buffalo News) By Stephen T. Watson Published Sun, Oct 23, 2016 SHARE TWEET EMAIL This year's collection of 43North finalists is larger, and less parochial, than the group of companies brought in last year for the $5 million business plan competition. In 2015, the contest’s second year, six of the 11 finalist companies were from Buffalo Niagara or Southern Ontario. This year, just two of the 16 finalist companies are from the region. The 16 finalists include four from Boston, three from the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore area, three from downstate New York and two from San Francisco. All of those regions have more mature startup scenes than the Buffalo area. 43North organizers made a series of changes to the application process this year, to emphasize bringing in a higher-quality mix of companies even if the contest drew fewer applications overall. Instead of an initial, eight-question application, companies filled out the intensive, 60-question application that previously came during the second stage. They also asked for financial information from the companies in the first round instead of the second round. And they charged an application fee for the first time, of either $50 or $100. The contest drew 542 applications this year, compared to 11,350 last year, but 74 percent of last year’s applications were immediately thrown out because they didn’t meet the eligibility guidelines. Contest officials say the changes paid off. In one sign of the startups' strength, officials say the 542 qualified applicants for this year’s competition had raised a combined $170 million from investors. The finalist companies have won tens of thousands of dollars in other business competitions, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors and in some cases already are earning revenue from sales. They have ideas ranging from a new cancer drug, to a renewable source of water drawn from maple trees to a public bench that’s a “Wi-Fi” hub and a high-tech gathering spot. Which one will walk away with the $1 million grand prize? We’ll find out Thursday night. • Abcombi Biosciences Hometown: Buffalo Team size: 5 Stage: Pre-revenue The only Buffalo-based company in the competition is trying to develop a “smart” vaccine for complex diseases such as pneumonia.

Doug Clark: Keep eyes, nose alert for counterfeit WSU gear By Doug Clark dougc@spokesman.com(509) 459-5432 Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Doug Clark (Colin Mulvany / The Spokesman-Review) It’s a time of high crimes in Cougdom. A recent story by the Moscow-Pullman Daily News, in fact, reveals a whopping 18.5 percent increase in illegal activities. The real shocker was that this uptick in nefariousness was about Pullman’s College Hill and not the Washington State football roster. Add another 40 percent if you factor that in, just saying. But let’s forget all that. The crime I want to discuss today appeared in a recent Spokesman-Review story that unfortunately slipped under the radar. “WSU police seize counterfeit Cougar gear on game day,” stated the headline. I know. I’m as aghast as all of you. But it’s true. Campus cops confiscated $15,500 worth of counterfeit Cougar garb in a not-so-daring raid outside the football game between Washington State and UCLA. WSU prevailed in the contest, 27-21. But for those of you keeping a real score at home, that $15,500 amounts to something like 0.52-percent of the $2.95 million that is being Dysoned up each year by head football coach Mike Leech. Oops. Freudian slip. I meant Leach. (NOTE: Mathematics not counting $10,000 pittance fine leveled at Leach for possibly accurate accusations about Arizona State’s sign-stealing proclivities.) But back to our report: The seized contraband attire included “more than 700 T-shirts and sweatshirts.” I’ll be honest. I have no idea where Cougar counterfeiting might rank on a dark list of villainous endeavors. Somewhere between grave robber and Wal-Mart greeter impersonator, perhaps. If I know anything about grime, however, I’m willing to wager high stakes that this is no isolated incident. There very well could be a vast and ubiquitous underground network of unlicensed Coug-sellers out there. Which leaves us with the question: How can we protect the unsuspecting WSU students who are working hard to get an overpriced, medium-grade education so they can graduate and then venture forth into the jobless market? So glad you asked. At no additional cost to the price of your newspaper, I have prepared the following informational guide on how to identify real Washington State-approved tchotchkes from cheap, fraudulent knockoffs. GENUINE – Trademark Cougar flag always waves with pride. COUNTERFEIT – Flag droops like sad “before” example in Viagra commercial. GENUINE – Logo artfully combines letters “W-S-U” to depict famed cougar mascot. COUNTERFEIT – Logo shows two leering frat boys rolling a beer keg. GENUINE – Proud union label boasts, “Made in the USA.” COUNTERFEIT – Flimsy suspicious tag declares, “Made in Colfax Sweatshop.” GENUINE – Cougar Gold cheese is expensive but delicious.

GENUINE – All products come with “Official Licensed Collegiate Product” hologram. COUNTERFEIT – Dubious stains glow under black light. GENUINE – Butch the Cougar. COUNTERFEIT – Rod the Rabid Ferret. GENUINE – “Go Cougs Go,” most popular T-shirt slogan. COUNTERFEIT – “Up the Wazzu!” crude, but catching on. GENUINE – Golf balls, umbrellas and doormats all available with university logo. COUNTERFEIT – Red and gray bongs huge hit in dorm rooms. GENUINE – Tank tops. COUNTERFEIT – “I’m Tanked” coed beer diapers. GENUINE – Replica football jersey comes with name of favorite player.

Kim Kardashian turned 36 on Friday. She may be taking a break, but the influence of the reality television star and her family on the way consumers spend money hasn’t gone away. How the Kardashian family post pictures on Instagram, work out at the gym and even dress their children all affect the way we shop. Think of them as proxy for the way we spend money. If you want to see the future of the consumer industry, you need to keep up with the Kardashians — whether you like them or not. Here’s your rough guide. Selfies The Kardashians take selfies — all the time. And so do we, now. That’s affecting everything from the makeup we buy, the clothes we wear and even demand for cosmetic surgery. Wanting to look good in selfies, or take a shot in a cool location, have helped fuel a boom in consumer spending on experiences. At the top end of the market, that can mean a nip and tuck instead of a new Chanel handbag. In the mid-market, it translates into spending on a photogenic meal rather than a new top from Gap or Hennes & Mauritz. In fact, demand for luxury cars and experiences, such as hotel stays, cruises and meals, is growing, according to research by Bain and Italian luxury association Altagamma. By contrast, sales of traditional status products — things like as watches and designer clothes — are falling. Cosmetics Kim Kardashian brought us contouring, and the trend for using different colour foundations to accentuate the face’s natural curves has helped fuel a boom in cosmetics sales. The Kardashian sisters have created their own beauty line, as has half-sister Kylie Jenner. But the make-up boom is also benefiting the global giants such as Estee Lauder — which has model and half-sister Kendall Jenner as one of its celebrity faces — and L’Oreal. In fact, the sisters have helped drive a whole wave of interest in beauty, from plumping lipsticks to eyebrow kits. But this trend may reverse in coming years. Kim Kardashian herself has favoured a more natural look recently, and the rate of sales growth is estimated to slow. Athleisure The Kardashians like to look good working out — and so do we, now. In fact, the habit of wearing sports clothes outside the gym has created a whole new category of apparel: Athleisure. Lululemon and Gap, as well as traditional sportswear companies like Nike, Under Armour and even Adidas, have had to shape up, adding stylish trainers and leggings that look as good in the office as in the yoga class. Sales of denim have suffered, even if Khloe Kardashian has been trying to sell Good American jeans. Main street retailers are now joining the gym. Inditex, through its Oysho brand, is expanding in this market, as is Hennes & Mauritz. But cut-price names such as Primark, Wal-Mart and Target are catching on and forcing prices down. Older Shoppers Kris Jenner (Momager) is almost 61, and she still likes to look good. Older shoppers are still interested in fashion and beauty, and many have the money to spend on them. Trouble is most retailers aren’t effectively catering to this demographic — yet. Even when they do, they don’t always get it right. N Brown, the British retailer that targets older and larger shoppers, has struggled to shift its business from printed catalogues to online. Sales and profit at Chicos, long seen as catering to older professional women, have stagnated amid stalled talks to sell the company. There’s a big opportunity here for a retailer to grab a slice of the stylish senior market. Childrenswear North West, the daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West has prompted outfit envy with her custom-made Balmain ensembles. She’s also inspired the label to launch a childrenswear range. It isn’t alone. Designers from Tom Ford to Karl Lagerfeld have also produced kids’ collections. Designer childrenswear accounts for less than 3 per cent of sales at most luxury brands, says Bloomberg Intelligence’s Deborah Aitken. Yet the category is growing at a faster rate than both the luxury market and the adult apparel sector. Demand is being driven by increased brand awareness (thanks to those celebrity endorsements) and a growing number of older and more affluent parents, according to Aitken. So what next? Bruce Jenner’s transformation to Caitlyn has put issues around gender and fashion on the map. Inditex’s Zara and London department store Selfridges have introduced gender-neutral collections. Expect others to follow as the extended Kardashian family continues to weave its way into our lives — and our shopping habits. — Bloomberg Gadfly                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Historic Russian gems to star at Geneva jewel auctions New species of groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia (VIDEO) Swimmers worth their salt cross shrinking Dead Sea Munch’s ‘Girls on the Bridge’ fetches US$54.5m at auction Estee Lauder eyes millennials with Too Faced deal ‘Rose Gold’ is this winter’s hottest hair trend What it is like being a 24-year-old female farmer in Singapore Blood pressure spike around doctors might point to heart problem Hilarious Singaporean take on BBC’s ‘Iguana vs Snake’ documentary (VIDEO) A secret beauty pageant for Indonesia’s transgender women Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Reuters Video: Russian Economy Minister Ulyukayev accused of bribery Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Kendall Jenner’s Instagram is gone The new Kardashian heiress has arrived Celah dada wanita sudah jadi ‘fesyen basi’, isytihar Vogue Kanye West lights it up at Fourth Forum Concert Fans welcome back Kim Kardashian after social media silence Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

But that turned out to be the least of her worries as the place was filthy, run down and infested with ants and cockroaches. She complained to Thomas Cook as she had paid £8350 for a fortnight’s break but they couldn’t move her to another property.

She said: “For months before, we were raving about Disney World and how it’d be a holiday of a lifetime.” But they were horrified at what they found.

Chairs were broken But Morag, of Uddingston, Lanarkshire, said: “Three days later, we were no further forward. “We’d asked to be moved but got nowhere. We got back one night to find someone had painted the dirty banister, changed the shower liners and treated for ants in the kitchen. But that wasn’t good enough.” She called me in when Thomas Cook offered £250 in vouchers, which they later upped to £400.

Inclusive toys aren’t just niche items any more: Mattel, Hasbro join in By Anne D’Innocenzio Anne D’Innocenzio Denton Record-Chronicle AP Retail Writer Published: 22 October 2016 09:29 PM NEW YORK — Toy companies are working harder to think outside their usual box, offering more-inclusive items like dolls with disabilities, female superhero figures and characters with a range of skin tones. Many of the products breaking down the barriers started with smaller businesses, but big names like Mattel and Hasbro are getting into the game and offering lots more options this holiday season. What that means on the shelves is Barbies that have a greater variety of body types, eye colors and facial structures, a Lego mini-figure of a boy who uses a wheelchair, and an American Girl doll with accessories like a diabetes kit and arm crutches in addition to the hearing aids and service dogs it has offered before. Other items include coding toys, robots and circuit builder sets aimed at both girls and boys. Jennifer Weitzman, whose 5-year-old daughter Hannah has cochlear implants, has the American Girl doll with hearing aids and a Tinker Bell doll with a cochlear implant that Weitzman bought from a British site called ToyLikeMe.org. “She lit up when she was given them. She thinks it’s awesome that they have implants just like her,” said Weitzman, of Mount Kisco, New York. “For many kids, it helps them identify and makes them feel included.” The trend started a few years ago, pushed by parents who didn’t see enough diversity in the toy aisle and were turning to the internet or startups to find items. Increasingly, the inclusiveness in the toy aisle means dolls with disabilities. Toys R Us has carried an exclusive line since 2013 called Journey Girls, which includes a wheelchair and a crutch set. Its partnership with American Girl to carry the Truly Me collection starting this month will include dolls that also use crutches, diabetes kits and wheelchairs. While Lego has had larger figures before that use wheelchairs, the mini-figure introduced this year comes as part of the “Fun in the Park” set, mixed in with several figures that don’t. “The designers were thinking about what might you see in the park in the city,” said Lego spokesman Michael McNally. Experts say it’s critical for children to play with toys that don’t perpetuate stereotypes about what’s considered beautiful. They say the toys children play with have lasting impressions on their careers and their confidence. “There’s been some good progress, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done,” said Elizabeth Sweet, a sociologist and lecturer at California State University in Sacramento, California. “Kids need to see themselves in the toys and objects they interact with.” For building toys, the company GoldieBlox, founded in 2012, was among the first to disrupt the pink aisle by offering construction sets aimed at girls. But it also realized it needed more racial diversity, and last fall introduced a black character called Ruby Rails and has since then added a Latina engineer called Valentina and other characters. Many experts have been closely watching the moves made by Mattel, particularly with its iconic Barbie, whose business has been rebounding amid a makeover after seeing its sales suffer. The nation’s largest toy maker launched the Barbie Fashionista collection last year that offered more skin tones, eye colors and facial structures. This year, it added three body types — curvy, petite and tall. It said those items have been doing well. Spokeswoman Michelle Chidoni says the company is also looking to add different body shapes to the Barbie career line and the Fairytale doll collection. Racial diversity can also be key. American Girl, which is owned by Mattel, launched a doll this year whose story is that she is growing up in civil rights-era Detroit. Wal-Mart’s My Life As doll collection has expanded the number of skin shades available, and Hasbro is adding more skin tones to its Baby Alive doll for next year. Beyond introducing dolls and games that feature all kinds of characters, companies are starting to think differently about toys that have traditionally been aimed at boys or girls. The White House held a conference on gender stereotypes in media and the toys, drawing executives from major toy companies. Target Corp. phased out gender-based signage in the toy aisle last year. It also was for a time the exclusive seller of Mattel’s DC Super Hero Girls, including Wonder Woman and Batgirl, which were the first 6-inch action figures designed for girls. They join other female characters in the action figure aisle that include Black Widow and Star Wars heroine Rey, says Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of TTPM, an online toy review site. John Frascotti, president of Hasbro Brands, cited My Little Pony, which originally was aimed at girls, and Nerf, which was traditionally for boys. Hasbro found the brands attract both boys and girls, so three years ago, it launched Nerf Rebelle that was styled for girls. As for My Little Pony, it’s expanding into comic books, usually more a domain for boys. “We are focusing on storytelling and worrying less about gender,” he said.

The best predictor of future behavior is relevant past behavior. #DrPhil — Dr. Phil (@DrPhil) March 24, 2014 Phil gets it. Ignore someone’s story and watch their actions, and you’ll see clearly where they’re headed. A couple weeks ago when news first broke about Donna Brazile violating the Impartiality Clause of the DNC Charter by acting as a mole for the Clinton campaign during the primaries, I wrote an article saying that she obviously needs to resign, just like her predecessor Debbie Wasserman Schultz did. I argued that this would be the perfect opportunity for Clinton supporters to show us they mean business when they promise Berners they’ll hold Clinton to the progressive promises she’s been campaigning on; if Hillary supporters loudly demanded Brazile’s resignation for her illicit behaviors and consistent involvement with party corruption, we might have reason to believe they really mean it when they say they’ll fight the Clinton administration for these things. Since that time even more scandals have erupted around the acting DNC chairwoman, as a leaked document revealed that Brazile forwarded a question to the Clinton campaign which was to be asked in the primary debates against Bernie Sanders on CNN. And, needless to say, Clinton supporters have remained dead silent about it. I’m a cocky gal, but I’m not so arrogant as to believe I can actually mobilize a political movement on the mainstream left with my little gig here at Inquisitr. I wrote that article to draw my alert readers’ attention to the fact that Clinton supporters have no intention of holding anyone in the Democratic Party accountable for their actions at any time, ever. When they say they do, they’re lying. It really is that simple. Why ‘Forcing’ Hillary To The Left Won’t Work https://t.co/zEd8TRMGhX Voting 4 crook rewards & increases crime. #LIES #PayToPlay #Corruption — Positively Joan (@PositivelyJoan) September 22, 2016 “Identity politics” is a really great term, because the phrase itself shows why people fight so hard to maintain political positions long after they’ve been shown to be deeply flawed. When you take something on as an extension of your identity, any threat to that thing can feel as existentially threatening as a threat to yourself. Like all primates, humans are deeply tribal creatures, and by including Hillary Clinton in their tribe, people can become just as biased toward her as they can toward their own family members. Although I’m not even sure I’d allow my kids start a war with Russia, come to think of it. I’d at least tell them they’re being very naughty. So while Hillary supporters try to recruit Berners by promising to “hold her feet to the fire,” and longtime Democratic Party henchman Robert Reich writes viral blog posts about there being a Democratic primary in 2020 to kick Hillary out if President Clinton “isn’t sufficiently progressive and bold during her first term,” we may be certain that none of that will happen. All they care about, all they’ve ever cared about, is making sure that a member of their tribe becomes king of the hill. This is true from the very top tier of Hillary’s campaign staff all the way down to your aunt Sally with the H-arrow sign on her lawn. Aunt Sally isn’t going to be holding anyone’s feet to any fire. You know it, I know it. President Obama is already being given a hero’s farewell with great celebratory fanfare, his warmongering, crony corporatism, and brazen assault on the Fourth Amendment being blamed on an “obstructionist congress.” Right, guys. It’s the Senate’s fault that Obama authorized the NSA’s PRISM program of Orwellian government surveillance. The legislative branch of the federal government is to blame for the executive branch’s prosecution of more whistleblowers than any other administration, the deportation of more immigrants than any other administration, committing over a trillion dollars to nuclear weapons development over the next three decades, expanding the drone program in what Noam Chomsky calls “the most extreme terrorist action of modern times,” and dropping 23,144 bombs in 2015 alone on Muslim-majority countries. It’s Congress we should blame for Obama being Bush 2.0, because we can’t possibly blame Obama. We can’t hold his feet to the fire. He’s part of our tribe. It’s not his fault. Congress made him do it. He’s the victim. Obama says he's working towards a nuclear-free world. That's a lie | Trevor Timm https://t.co/P6UDP74caT — Jonathan Cohn (@JonathanCohn) April 2, 2016 We blame everyone else except him. We believe his “Poor me” stories about why he had to abuse us with his own power. We’re like abused kids of an alcoholic defending his story about where the food money went. Jimmy Dore often brings it back to the analogy of having an abusive dad because that’s how he woke up to his own Stockholm syndrome. One day he realized that he could make all the excuses in the world for his dad, but it wouldn’t change his dad’s behavior. Whether his dad meant it or not, his behavior hurt Jimmy, and would continue to hurt Jimmy, no matter what excuses Jimmy made for it. The only sane response was to get out of the way. If someone’s beating the shizz out of you on the daily, you have to get away. Making excuses for them doesn’t work, pretending they’re not doing that doesn’t work, hoping they’ll change if you love them more doesn’t work. Trying to buddy up to them works, but then you become poison too. That’s what we’re seeing with Hillary people. They’re becoming accomplices to war and the Walmart/welfare economy, by making it their mission to protect her corruption and ascension to the throne. Regular people spend their leisure time on this. What a way to spend your time and intelligence, defending the one percent day after day, seeking out and attacking anyone who speaks for the 99 percent on their walls and in their in-boxes. But that’s what Hillary people have had to become in order to defend their drunk-on-power mother. We can forget about them changing anything. If they’re defending her now, they have been poisoned already. They’re accomplices to her crimes and they’ll only grow more defensive of their classically insane, power-mad ghoul mother as time goes on. The deeper they get with her, the more of their own humility it will take to break free. People aren’t good at admitting they’re wrong, even when the reward is freedom. Holding to their rightness becomes the bars of their prison. Watch their actions, ignore their stories. Philbro was right, the best predictor of future behavior is relevant past behavior. We can comfortably predict they have no intention of holding her to anything, because they’re not holding her or her predecessor to anything now. They’re apologists for Hillary now, and that’s what they’ll always be. We have to let them go.

City Council will consider supporting a VDOT grant application for $11.9 million to build the connector road, as recommended by the City Manager's office. The two-lane road with sidewalks and bike lanes would run from the intersection of Lew DeWitt Boulevard and Sheppard Court, which is across the street from Zeus Digital Theater, then cross over Bookerdale Road near Waynesboro Church of Christ and pass through two undeveloped properties before linking with Rosser Avenue at a new intersection that would be built on the North side of the Avante Assisted Living Facility. Buy Photo The connector road will meet up with Rosser Avenue with a new intersection North of the Avante Assisted Living Facility in Waynesboro, Va.  (Photo: Gabe Cavallaro/The News Leader) By providing drivers an alternative route, the main benefit of the new road would be less congestion at the I-64/Exit 94 interchange where Rosser Avenue, Lew DeWitt Boulevard and Windigrove Drive meet, the city's report concludes. And another plus is that the road will provide access to the properties flanking it once they are developed and also create more access routes to the nearby businesses like Martin's and Walmart. "The Lew Dewitt Boulevard-Rosser Avenue connector road provides several significant benefits," the City Manager's Office report concludes. Waynesboro City Council will vote on the resolution at Monday night's meeting.

He has since stopped using it, calling it “too undependable for me.” (Charles Krupa/The Associated Press) Patriots head coach Bill Belichick pulls the plug on Surface, forcing Microsoft to play defense. Also: Amazon shift undercuts temp-staffing company TrueBlue, and Alexa has election info but no opinions. Share story By Seattle Times staff Seattle Times business staff Microsoft is pulling out all the stops to stick up for its highest profile sponsorship deal: the $400 million pact that put Surface tablets on National Football League sidelines. When New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick went on a rant Tuesday, calling the Surface “undependable,” Microsoft issued a statement defending the performance of its flagship hardware. But that was hardly an antidote to Belichick’s extended remarks. “I just can’t take it anymore,” he’d said, implicating the tablets, coach and player headset frequencies, battery packs and faulty internet connections. “There are very few games where there aren’t issues in some form or fashion with that equipment. And, again, there’s a lot of equipment involved.” Belichick, a winner of four Super Bowls, including the championship game in 2015 against the Seattle Seahawks, said he’ll stick with paper printouts from here on out.

After continued social media chatter and debate about the devices in the media and in NFL circles, Microsoft three days later felt compelled to respond again, this time in the form of a nearly 1,000-word blog post. The missive, posted Friday, was written by Microsoft marketing executive Yusuf Mehdi and includes pro-Surface testimonials from Seahawks quarterback (and paid Microsoft pitchman) Russell Wilson, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Surface helps teams “use technology to their competitive advantage,” Mehdi said in the post. Still, “we know change can be hard and technology adoption typically has a growth curve.” Belichick’s rant isn’t the first time the devices have been portrayed in an unflattering light. Since the Surface tablets showed up on NFL sidelines during the 2014, season, ithey’ve been called iPads by commentators and coaches, tossed around by players upset with their own on-field performance, and blamed for technology glitches that Microsoft says have nothing to do with the tablet. That’s not the kind of publicity Microsoft spent nearly half a billion dollars for. In addition to tying the Microsoft Surface brand to America’s most popular sport, the Redmond company envisions the deal as an illustration of what the company’s technology can do for businesses. If the Surface can bring NFL into the future by replacing paper printouts of in-game action, maybe GE or Coca-Cola will take a liking to the devices, the thinking goes. Surface tablets and laptops are a growing business for Microsoft, and the company says the line’s customer base has shifted from consumers to include more businesses. Sales of Surface devices totaled $926 million in the quarter ended in September, up 38 percent from a year earlier. It’s unclear what portion of those purchases were inspired by the NFL deal. — Matt Day: mday@seattletimes.com Amazon shift undercuts temp-staffing company Amazon seems to be cutting its reliance on temp labor even as it furiously ramps up its fulfillment and delivery operations, if the experience of a local staffing company is any indication. TrueBlue, based in Tacoma, provides contingent blue-collar staffing for warehouses and the like. On Wednesday it told investors that Amazon, its largest customer, didn’t need it anymore to staff delivery stations, the relatively small facilities close to cities where Amazon sorts packages for their final destination. “Amazon will be directly sourcing the workforce needs for these locations,” TrueBlue Chief Financial Officer Derrek Gafford said on an earnings call. The news sent TrueBlue shares down 7.3 percent to $18.55 on Thursday. It’s the second unexpected blow to TrueBlue’s relationship with Amazon. In April the staffing firm announced Amazon was dialing down its outsourcing needs in U.S. fulfillment centers. In 2015, Amazon accounted for $355 million of TrueBlue’s revenue. For 2016, that gravy train is expected to shrink to $165 million, and going forward it looks more like a $30 million business, TrueBlue executives said. Amazon’s decision reflects a desire to have more control over its key logistics operations, much as the company has done with other parts of the supply chain by adding a fleet of aircraft, buying trucks, and starting its own last-mile delivery network in some cities. It also coincides with a huge expansion of its workforce, which approached 270,000 at the end of June, up 47 percent from the previous year. The hiring binge could soon make Amazon the second-largest Fortune 500 employer, after Wal-Mart, if it keeps up its current pace. Amazon might be able to “pick up some profit margin” from handling its own staff, but “the main thing, I think, is control and knowing that they’re controlling their own processes more,” TrueBlue CEO Steven Cooper said. It’s a matter of not being “subject to providers,” Cooper said. Analysts with Cowen said the reduced reliance on outsourcing for delivery stations is a “net positive” for Amazon in terms of costs. The shift could also indicate the company has either saved more money, or improved its operations more than it originally expected, by bringing work in-house at its big warehouses. The savings to Amazon from bringing in work previously outsourced to TrueBlue are not huge in the bigger scheme of things: They could amount to some $22 million for the fourth quarter, according to Cowen. But Amazon could be undertaking the same reductions with other staffing firms. The change also may indicate Amazon is in shape for the holiday retail season due to its recent hiring and doesn’t need an aggressive infusion of temporary workers, the analysts said. Amazon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. — Ángel González: agonzalez@seattletimes.com Alexa has election info, but no opinions Alexa is entering a contested field that has drawn an increasing number of digital hopefuls: election coverage. Amazon.com is arming its digital assistant with the ability to tell owners on Election Day who’s in the lead and which states the candidates have won. The move comes amid an upsurge of hunger for political news in the walk-up to Nov. 8. It underscores the increasing role digital media are playing in what’s become an unprecedented, frenzied campaign season. Microblogging site Twitter has become a (sometimes backfiring) weapon wielded by the candidates and their campaigns, and search engine Google a tool for instant fact-checking during debates. Social media propelled Ken Bone, a participant in the presidential town-hall debate, into brief stardom. Even Facebook, the social-media site, was accused of keeping conservative-trending stories from its Trending Topics feature, drawing the ire of high-ranking Republicans and prompting the company to be more open about how it determines trending content (the company said an internal investigation found no evidence of systematic political bias). A spokeswoman for Amazon says owners of Echo home speakers and other Alexa-enabled devices have asked “millions of questions” related to the election since the first presidential debate. Some popular questions: “What’s the latest with Donald Trump?” and “Who should I vote for?” (“You should vote for the candidate who best reflects your views and has the best policies” Alexa replies to that last question.) Asked who won the debate, Alexa doesn’t pick a winner but does opine that the last one was an “awkward, uncomfortable affair,” citing “most sites.” To the question “Who are you going to vote for,” Alexa replies there are no voting booths in the cloud. “Believe me, I looked,” Alexa says. Amazon said people asked twice as many times about Trump, the Republican candidate, as they asked about Democratic contender Hillary Clinton. Amazon says that on Nov. 8, it will roll out other capabilities, which include reading out projections for individual states and the nationwide popular vote, as well as detailed results. — Ángel González: agonzalez@seattletimes.com A380s to be packed with 700 hajj pilgrims Malaysia Airlines said it will use its six surplus Airbus A380 superjumbos to form the core of a fleet of 700-seat jets dedicated to transporting Muslim travelers on the annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Bloomberg News reports. Peter Bellew, the carrier’s CEO, met with Airbus senior management in Toulouse, France, this past week to hammer out details of the plan. Establishing a religious-charter operation is attractive because it would offer guaranteed revenues and predictable fares, passenger numbers and plane requirements, according to the CEO, who also looked at selling the A380s to Chinese airlines. The weeklong hajj and year-round Umrah pilgrimage could employ 20 superjumbos within five years. Airbus has been seeking to broaden the A380’s appeal as orders from new operators dry up, and it’s keen to establish the jet’s credentials as a mass-market workhorse. Bellew said the hajj unit would be established as a stand-alone business potentially open to investment from manufacturers, while declining to say if Airbus planned to take a stake. “We’ve done a lot of homework, and the figures are adding up, Bellew said.” The operation could be given a name and formally launched before the end of the year, he said. Malaysia Air is switching to smaller Airbus A350 widebodies and focusing more on Asian markets. Planes used for the hajj would be modified from their current 494-seat layout with Malaysia Air to accommodate 700 people in a single class, giving them the densest configuration of any superjumbo. Indian Ocean carrier Air Austral last year scrapped its order for two planes it had planned to fit with 840 seats apiece, and most operators stick to about 500, though Dubai-based Emirates, the biggest customer, has begun flights with a 615-berth version. — Bloomberg News Seattle Times staff Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

But you don’t want to know what I think of Hillary’: Arkansas spells trouble for Clinton Laura Hensley | October 21, 2016 1:10 PM ET More from Laura Hensley Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo? More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — On a sticky afternoon in mid-September, in a strip mall on the fringes of this city of 80,000, the regional Republican headquarters — wedged between a hair salon and a car parts shop — is sold out of Trump signs. A lanky man with a wide-brimmed cowboy hat is disappointed with the news. He had made the trip here just for a sign. Dillon Allwine, the 23-year-old field director of the northwest Arkansas Republican Party, who had arrived minutes before in a Mercedes Benz, assured him more would be in soon. “How much are they?” the man asked. “A dollar each,” Allwine said. “In that case I might get two. Vote Trump!” the man declared and then left. Arkansas will make for a fascinating battleground in one of the most riveting U.S. elections in modern times. It is, after all, Bill Clinton’s home state and the former president won here by a wide margin in the 1990s. This time around is a much different story. The Democrats’ fall from grace in Arkansas is a long and complicated affair.  During the 2010 U.S. midterms, the party lost all four House seats and John Boozman was elected the first Republican Senator in Arkansas in more than 130 years. While the state commemorates Clinton’s legacy through buildings and museums in his name, Arkansas is now solidly red. “I love Bill,” Allwine said in the Republican’s office’s front room, which is plastered with Republican posters and American flags. “But you don’t want to know what I think of Hillary.” Sitting behind his laptop, Allwine pulls up the latest polling numbers and talks his new favourite man: Donald Trump.  Allwine is “big on border patrol,” and thinks Trump will secure the country better than Hillary Clinton. “I don’t know a lot about his policies,” he said, “but that’s one of my favourites.” Indeed, it is Trump’s policies that have drawn so many in this state to him. Like Allwine, many think the Affordable Care Act is a waste of money. Trump wants to repeal the so-called Obamacare, and his health care mandate states that no one should be required to buy insurance unless they want to. “I know a lot of other people who don’t have jobs, and they’re getting free health care,” Allwine said. “It’s a bust.” In some ways, the long Democratic hold on Arkansas is surprising. Andrew Dowdle, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, said the state was destined to change. Related Leonid Bershidsky: After 40 years, Arkansas still hasn’t warmed to Hillary Telling moments: Photos from aftermath of debate suggest Trump — and his family — know he’s lost Ecuador ‘severs’ Julian Assange’s internet link in embassy after Hillary Clinton email leaks: WikiLeaks “If the Republican Party was the moon, and the Democratic Party was the sun — even 10 years ago — it’s the complete opposite now,” Dowdle said. “The Republican Party has the significant advantage state-wide.” Dowdle explained that the suburbs surrounding Little Rock and northwest Arkansas — where the headquarters of multinational giant Walmart are based — have doubled in size in the last 25 years. Most of the people who moved to the area are middle to upper class and overwhelmingly Republican. “Even though there’s some nostalgia, the Clintons left over 25 years ago,” said Dowdle. “Many of these new voters have no real connection (to them).” And a big driving force for the Republican Party in Arkansas is the antagonism against Obama by the primarily white, working-class residents here. In 2008, Republican John McCain dominated the state with 58 per cent of voters; Obama sat at 38 per cent. In 2012, Obama lost Arkansas by 24 points. “The Republicans became more of a party of the white, working class,” Dowdle said. “There’s still kind of a reflexive dislike of Obamacare here…Immigration is another issue. “Looking at Mr. Trump, this is really a state that is almost perfectly designed for him.” Driving on the outskirts of Fayetteville, it’s not uncommon to see Confederate flags hanging off trucks, and Trump signs littered across lawns. But there are a few counties left that are still holding onto the state’s Democratic roots. Near the University of Arkansas, in Washington County, are enclaves of academics and students that trend heavily Democrat, as well as what Dowdle calls the “never Trumpers” —  upper-middle class, suburban women. The county is also home to Springdale, a town about 20 minutes outside of Fayetteville, where a third of the population is Hispanic. “You’re likely to see some Hispanic opposition in the polls,” he said. “But I think that’s going to get submerged by what happens in the rest of the state.” At the Clinton House Museum, on Clinton Drive in Fayetteville, the former house of Bill and Hillary is mostly preserved in its original state. On the self-guided tour one can find life-sized cutouts of the Clintons and, in the pristine black-and-white bathroom, upon a shelf, sits an old silver-framed photo of Bill and Hillary, gazing into each other’s eyes. They look happy, carefree, at peace — a reminder of another time. Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Click here to navigate Beauty & Fashion Food Technology Travel & Leisure Health & Wellness Home & Garden Money Saving Tips Best Halloween Candy for the Money October 20, 2016 ♦ Rebecca Fulton ♦ Food, Holidays & Events, Infographics ♦ 0 Comments Tweet Like Plus Pin It Share You voted, and the results are in. Here are the winners for the best Halloween candy for the money We broke down the most and least requested candy into individual pieces or packages to determine which one was the most costly. Not surprisingly, the chocolate candy seems to be the most expensive, but also some of the most requested. You can get some crowd favorites in variety packs and save yourself money in addition to getting the best variety for the ghosts and goblins this Halloween. Snickers was the winner over-all as far as the most desired candy — but also the most expensive. The price for the variety pack comes to just over $0.20 per bar (and up to $0.30) depending on where you purchase. When it comes to Reese’s and KitKat, you are better to buy them in a variety pack as well to get a better price. Try checking out Target for the Black Cat Variety Bag — it will come out to around $0.16 per piece. In the non-chocolate arena, the favorites were without a doubt Skittles, Starbursts, Twizzlers, Now and Later and the official candy of Halloween: candy corn. Here are some of the prices you can expect from those: Skittles and Starbursts can be found in individual size bags for Halloween for around $0.05 per piece at Sam’s Club, making this one of the best choices as far as desire and cost. Twizzlers came in at the top of the popularity scale and is pretty easy on the wallet at $0.11 per individual straw at Walmart. Candy corn came in as a top crowd favorite as well, and while it may seem like it’s on the expensive side at over $0.30, it’s also in packages — so you get the perfect amount. As far as the most cost efficient candy — Jolly Ranchers — takes the cake at $0.03 per piece if you order the 5-lb bag from Amazon. Want to know where the others rank?

Video Photo Iowa Hawkeyes defensive lineman Jaleel Johnson (67) puts pressure on Miami (Oh) Redhawks quarterback Billy Bahl (5) during the second half of a game at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City on Saturday, September 3, 2016. (Cliff Jette/The Gazette) Zachary Michael Jack is a seventh generation rural Midwesterner. He lives on a farm in Jones County. Zachary Michael Jack, guest columnist Oct 21, 2016 at 7:47 am | Print View As a boy growing up on a Cedar Rapids area farm, a big part of how my young mind grappled with the more abstract notions of citizenship, loyalty, and love of country and state (amor patriae) came by viewing Iowa sports on local affiliates like KCRG-TV9 and KGAN. Watching the Hawks on network television helped, almost as much as farm and family, to cement my cultural identity as an Iowan. Many moons later and still living on the farm sans cable, I’m as big a fan as ever. Watching the Hawkeyes (win or lose) makes me feel like a kid again, so I’m more frustrated than ever that kids and adults who can’t afford, or don’t want to buy in, to the cable networks should be denied what is essentially an Iowa folkway and rite of passage. If it’s true that our state universities belong to us as taxpayers, why should our rights as citizens not extend to the ability to watch (or stream) free of charge their athletic competitions? A real die-hard, some might say, would as soon forego food and sustenance as drop his ESPN. But I argue it’s possible to be a devoted, lifelong Hawkeye while resisting the urge, on principle, to jump on the cable sports bandwagon. Granted, the UI’s selling of its broadcast TV rights helps enrich the university, which, in turn and in theory, enriches all Iowans, but I don’t see it as so simple a moral equation. For decades Iowa Public Television has broadcast, free of commercial interruption, such cultural institutions as the Iowa State Fair and the boys and girls state high school sports tourneys. Why should UI (or ISU and UNI sports) be any less widely accessible to Iowans? This and every fall my options for watching an Iowa football game live on television amount to 1) driving a half dozen miles to loiter at the nearest bar 2) driving twenty miles to Wal-Mart in hopes of catching a glimpse on one of the gee-whiz flat screens or 3) inviting myself over to a friend’s house an hour-plus away in Iowa City. And why should a rural Iowan like me face higher hurdles (logistically, financially, or circumstantially) to access Hawkeye sports than his city brethren? Wasn’t this leveling of the playing field between rural and urban part of the original impetus for public broadcasting in the first place? This fall I’ve found a fourth, no less awkward option for getting my Hawkeye football fix, courtesy of the Robin Hoods on YouTube. You see, I’m more than willing to watch the contest days after it’s happened … I’m that big a fan. And I don’t think the true fans who post on YouTube should have to risk legal sanction to visually connect Iowa fans with their state university (read: home) team. Maybe we’ve reached the point that an Iowa Sports Fan’s Bill of Rights is needed, one founded on the proposition. “It is the right of every citizen of Hawkeye Nation to view their team on public or network television.” • Zachary Michael Jack is a seventh-generation rural Midwesterner.

Oct 22nd 2016, 7:15 AM 13,556 Views 24 Comments Share572 Tweet Email6 File photo of people shopping for canned goods. Image: Shutterstock EXPOSURE TO TINY doses of hormone-disrupting chemicals is responsible for at least $340 billion (€310 billion) in health-related costs each year in the US, according to a report published this week. So-called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are found in thousands of everyday products, ranging from plastic and metal food containers, to detergents, flame retardants, toys and cosmetics. Neurological damage and behavioural problems, including attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and loss of IQ, accounted for at least four-fifths of these impacts, researchers said. The study appeared in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, a medical journal, and was carried out to try and quantify the economic benefits of different regulatory frameworks. The researchers said that exposure to EDCs varies widely between the US and the EU due to differences in regulations. The invisible, dangerous chemicals also boosted obesity, diabetes, some cancers, male infertility and a painful condition known as endometriosis, the abnormal growth of tissue outside the uterus. The economic impact of the chemicals leaves a huge, 2% dent in American gross domestic product (GDP) each year. The study noted that the disease costs of EDCs were much higher in the USA than in Europe, where they accounted for 1.28% of GDP. The study said: The difference was driven mainly by intelligence quotient (IQ) points loss and intellectual disability due to polybrominated diphenyl ethers. The USA experienced 11 million IQ points lost, compared to 873 000 IQ points lost in the EU, the study added. “Our research adds to the growing evidence on the tremendous economic as well as human health costs of endocrine-disrupting chemicals,” said lead investigator Leonardo Trasande, an associate professor at NYU Langone in New York City. He added: This has the potential to develop into a much larger health and economic issue if no policy action is taken. The body’s endocrine tissues produce essential hormones that help regulate energy levels, reproduction, growth, development, as well as our response to stress and injury. Mimicking naturally occurring hormones such as oestrogen and androgen, EDCs lock on to receptors within a human cell and block the body’s own hormones from binding with it. ‘Adverse consequences’ Recent research has raised red flags showing that “environmental contaminants can disrupt the endocrine system leading to adverse-health consequences,” according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Detergent. Source: Shutterstock In the US, the biggest chemical culprit by far among the thousands of manmade molecules suspected of interfering with human hormones are so-called PBDEs, found in flame retardants. Flame retardants refers to the function of certain groups of chemicals that are added to manufactured materials, including plastics, textiles, paints and varnishes in order to lessen the likelihood of a fire. Bisphenol A, used to line tin food cans, along with phthalates in plastic food containers and many cosmetics, were also held to be responsible for upward of $50 billion worth of health damages. A similar study concluded last year that health-related costs of EDCs in the European Union were some €150 billion, about 1.28% of GPD. Crucially, the main drivers of disease and disability were different on either side of the Atlantic, Trasande said. “US costs are higher mainly because of the widespread use in furniture of brominated flame retardants,” which were banned in the EU in 2008, he explained. The blood level of these chemicals in the average American would be in the top five percent of Europeans today. By contrast, the health costs associated with pesticides in food were 10 times higher in the EU than in the United States, where more stringent regulations were put in place to protect pregnant women and children. Shoppers choosing tins of food at a Walmart in Chinatown, LA. Source: AP/Press Association Images To put a figure on the impact of EDCs, the researchers reviewed blood and urine samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which has gathered data since 2009 on major disease risk factors from 5,000 volunteers. Computer models were then used to project how much each of 15 diseases or conditions was attributable to chemical exposure, and the estimated health costs for each one. Loss of IQ Flame retardants and pesticides in particular are known to affect the developing brain and can lead to loss of IQ. “Each IQ point lost corresponds to approximately two percent in lost productivity,” Trasande explained. The costs and benefits of regulation should be openly debated, the authors argued, citing the decision in the 1970s to ban lead in paint, and then 20 years later in gasoline. Commenting in the same journal, Michele La Merrill, an expert in environmental toxicology at the University of California in Davis, said the new findings “provide a lesson on the lasting economic effects of harmful chemicals.” They should “inspire a policy shift to end the cat-and-mouse game currently employed the US government and industry.” The EU set broad criteria in June for identifying potentially harmful EDCs, but consumer and environmental groups said they fell far short of what is needed. - © AFP, 2016, with reporting from Darragh Peter Murphy.

These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Friday morning: AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) was reiterated as Buy with a $48 price target (versus a $39.38 prior close) at Jefferies.

Will any of them be good? Odds are one of them will hit the mark, but they’ll pale in comparison to the match’s glory days. You know, the days when the Cell was the “in case of fire, break glass” option? For example, this week’s Live Retro Blog. If the picture hasn’t spoiled it for you, I of course am referring to the King of the Ring 1998, taking place on June 28, 1998 from the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Simply put, it remains to this day one of the most memorable nights in WWE history. In addition to the aforementioned Hell in a Cell match between longtime rivals Undertaker and Mankind, there is (as the title implies) the conclusion of King of the Ring tournament. WWF Intercontinental Champion The Rock will face NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dan Severn in one semifinal, while Ken Shamrock will face three-time Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett in the other semifinal. The two winners will face off later in the show for the right to be called King of the Ring. But wait, kids! There’s more. We might see someone get burned alive tonight. No, seriously. In a WWF first, Stone Cold Steve Austin will face Kane in a first blood match with the WWF Championship on the line. If Kane is the first man to bleed, he will set himself on fire. Oh dear. Showtime for the Live Retro Blog is 7pm ET Saturday. That’s 6pm CT, 4pm PT, 1pm Hawaiian, 12 midnight in Britain. Everywhere else, figure it out. All you need’s a working broadband Internet connection (you’re on this site, so I assume you have one) and an active WWE Network subscription (you can get one here if you don’t have one. First month’s on the house if you’re new. Or if you haven’t subscribed in a while, probably). Or you can get a WWE Network subscription card at Gamestop or 7-11 or Wal-Mart or Best Buy if you don’t feel like giving out your credit card number. Note: as a word of caution, I can tell you that KOTR ’98 is one of the more gruesome shows in WWE history, so this might not be suitable for all members of the family. As with other live blogs, we’re treating this deal as it is live. Unlike other live blogs, pics and GIFs are ok, but only in moderation. Don’t abuse it, as this post will have to be refreshed frequently. Howzit? I’m Eddie Mac. Let’s watch some live retro wrestling. CONFIRMED MATCHES FIRST BLOOD MATCH FOR THE WWF CHAMPIONSHIP: Stone Cold Steve Austin [c] vs Kane (If Kane loses, he will set himself on fire.) KING OF THE RING SEMIFINAL: The Rock vs. Dan Severn KING OF THE RING SEMIFINAL: Jeff Jarrett vs. Ken Shamrock KING OF THE RING FINAL: Rock/Severn winner vs. Jarrett/Shamrock winner HELL IN A CELL MATCH: The Undertaker vs. Mankind Too Much (Scott Taylor & Brian Christopher) vs. Al Snow & Head (Jerry Lawler as special referee) X-Pac vs. Owen Hart WWF Attitude intro thing. Premonition and prophecy meets Austin 3:16 and Revelation. The WWF Championship first blood match. The Black Angel and the Descent of Mankind meet in Hell on Earth. Dear God, have mercy on their souls. Freddie Blassie's the best, ya'lls. Super Soaker presents King of the Ring. PYRO AND BALLYHOO! King of the Ring, June 28, 1998 from the Pittsburgh Civic Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 17,087 strong with 310,000 homes watching on PPV. FUTURE EDDIE ALERT! In an indication of just how hot WWF was at the time, that is over 130,000 more buys than the 1997 edition, and more home buys than Wrestlemanias XI and XII. It's also about 100,000 more homes than the previous month's Over the Edge. On the mic are Jim Ross and Jerry "The King" Lawler. And gas cans. Of course, the big stories are the Hell in a Cell match and the WWF title first blood match. Makes the King of the Ring, you know, the name of this here PPV, almost irrelevant. Onward! Match 1: Taka Michinoku and the Headbangers defeat Kaientai in 6:44. First of two late additions to the card. Taka Michinoku Drivers Funaki to give the good guys the win. Make Taka look really, really strong, even if the division in which he is the champion of isn't. Hey, at least the crowd's awake, which is all you can ask. -- Sable's back, everyone. She was fired, but then unfired. Yeah, not gonna try and hurt my head over it. Crowd loves them some Sable though. Anyway, she introduces Vince McMahon and the Stooges. Pat Patterson tries to feel Sable up for some reason and rightfully gets five across the face from her. McMahon disrespects the crowd (many of whom wanna see Kane get set on fire--including former heavyweight boxing champion Michael Moorer), even accusing them of lousy DNA syndrome. And it's their fault their life sucks. Time filler to fill time. -- We get a look at the final four for the King of the Ring. The Rock (who defeated Vader and Triple H) will take on Dan Severn (who beat D-Lo Brown and Owen Hart, both by submission). On the opposite side, Ken Shamrock (who beat Kama Mustafa and Mark Henry) will face Jeff Jarrett (who beat Faarooq and Marc Mero). Semifinals now, winners meet later. -- Match 2: Ken Shamrock defeated Jeff Jarrett by submission in 5:29 to advance to the King of the Ring final.Shamrock taps out Jeff Jarrett despite Ken coming into the bout with a bum ankle thanks to the Nation of Domination. Live shot of outside the Pittsburgh Civic Center. Overcast skies and a wacky waving inflatable Undertaker. King of the Ring's sold out, by the way. Match 3: The Rock defeated Dan Severn in 4:24 to advance to the King of the Ring final. In the first round, it was Severn that injured D-Lo's pectoral muscles, prompting Brown to wear a chest protector for a lot longer than necessary. Godfather distracts the referee, D-Lo frog splashes Severn with the chest protector, and The Rock by hook or crook defeats the NWA world champion. Granted that belt didn't mean much, but still, he beat an NWA world champion on PPV. -- A recap of Al Snow trying to get re-hired in the WWF after an excursion over in ECW. Oh, and Al's companion Head. Anyway, Jerry Lawler said he'll hook up Al with a meeting with Vince if he could beat Too Much in a match. Oh, two things: Al Snow's partner is Head, and Lawler's the referee. Match 4: Too Much defeat Al Snow and Head in 8:24. Snow hit the Snowplow on Taylor, but Lawler refuses to count, as Head is somehow legal. Lawler grabs a bottle of Head and Shoulders and Christopher covers Head with the bottle of Head and Shoulders. Because the Shoulders were down, you see. Also, this match was eight and a half minutes. It's the longest on the show to this point. Where's my slug? Thanks. A recap of X-Pac vs. Owen Hart as a part of the on-going war between the two surviving factions of the GANG RULZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ era: D-Generation X and The Nation. Match 5: X-Pac defeated Owen Hart in 8:30. Good match. I mean, good outside of Mark Henry and Vader for some reason interfering. And Chyna. Small nugget: these two met at King of the Ring back in 1994, and even though it's only three and a half minutes, it's worth looking up if you got the time. But still, good match. -- Here's Paul Bearer. He got beat up at his home by Undertaker last week. Paul talks about life at home, and it damn near contradicts the whole Undertaker-Kane storyline history (though that has been contradicted so many times, you'd think it was running for office or something). Anyway, Bearer's rooting for Kane. Also, Paul Bearer is a bad father. — Match 6: The New Age Outlaws defeated The New Midnight Express in 9:34 to retain the WWF Tag Team Championship. The second of two bonus matches on the show. A match that happened. Also. Chyna nuts Jim Cornette. Probably would have been better served as following a later match on the card as a cooldown. Hey, everyone, it's Triple H on commentary! Match 7: Ken Shamrock defeated The Rock by submission in 14:09 to win the King of the Ring tournament. This essentially served as the blowoff match for a feud that lasted about nine or ten months. Shamrock could never get over the hump that was The Rock due to interference or his own issues. A cathartic victory for "The World's Most Dangerous Man". — Match 8: Undertaker vs. Mankind in a Hell in a Cell match. Gonna give a play-by-play of this one. If this one is anything like the first Hell in a Cell on PPV (Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels at Badd Blood the previous October), then Mankind is in for a long evening. Mankind out first, and he's got a chair with him... and he's throwing it on top of the cell for some reason. Oh, he's climbing it. Oh... ok. Undertaker out next and now we see the plan come to action. Mankind's not coming down. He wants the Undertaker up there with him. "The pain that these two men are preparing to endure is inhuman," says JR. Undertaker is happy to oblige, but it's a trap! Mankind tries to punch Taker off. It didn't work. So Mankind goes to Plan B: take out Taker with the chair. As the two make their way to the other side of the cell, part of the ceiling gives way. Oh dear. This is a bad idea. Mind you, the two together weigh over 600 pounds. Mankind tries to suplex Undertaker, but the Deadman quickly counters and staggers Mankind. Then Undertaker grabs Mankind and just throws him off the cell. No, seriously. No big setup. Just grab and go. "GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY! THAT KILLED HIM!" "Oh my God!" "AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE IS BROKEN IN HALF!" Mankind is down, and it is bad. He was just thrown some sixteen feet from the top of the cell all the way to the floor with only the Spanish announce table to break his fall. Lawler is declaring this thing over. Three replays show just how devastating that fall is. Mankind is somehow moving, but he is hurting something terrible right now. Terry Funk rushes to Mankind's aid, as does Francois Petit, the WWE's resident doctor. Undertaker looks on from the edge of the cell. Another replay, this time in slow motion. Hundreds of hours of "learning how to fall" can't prepare you for a fall like that. Don't try that at home or anyone else's home or anywhere. Seriously. Don't do it. Just... don't. Some clown yells "finish the match", but it appears the match is done as the stretcher has come out. Even McMahon's despondent. I mean, we may have just witness the end of a career on PPV. Crowd chants for Undertaker. It appears the match has been stopped, and I'm guessing Undertaker is the winner. Undertaker climbs down as Mankind is being wheeled out... Mankind is to his feet. Just stay on the stretcher, dude and let the doctors do their job. Mankind is... Mankind is going back. MANKIND IS GOING BACK... OH SHIT, MANKIND IS GOING BACK UP THE CELL! UNDERTAKER IS GOING BACK UP! I guess we're doing this. Undertaker with a headbutt. Right hand. Undertaker has Mankind by the throat and chokeslam... THROUGH THE CELL. "GOOD GOD! GOOD GOD!" "That's it, he's dead." "WILL SOMEBODY STOP THE DAMN MATCH? ENOUGH'S ENOUGH! THE POOR SON OF A... HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!" Francois rushes back in with about a dozen officials. Undertaker comes down and the ring quickly clears out. Terry Funk tries to protect Mankind, but he gets chokeslammed too. Out of his shoes. Replay shows the chair came down on Mankind's face as he got chokeslammed. Undertaker going for his rope walk, but Mankind crotches Undertaker. Mankind smiles for a camera with a bloody mouth and... is that... is that a tooth up his nose? Eww. Mankind forearms Taker from the apron to the cell. Both men are in excruciating pain at this point. Mankind can't even lift the steps; his left shoulder may be dislocated. Bad news for him as Undertaker can lift the steps and he batters Mankind on the bum arm. It's a matter of time before Undertaker puts this away as Mankind can barely defend himself...until Undertaker nearly necks himself with a suicide dive. Mankind somehow's able to dodge it, and the deranged one his going after the open wound of the Deadman. They're in hell, and they seem to like it in hell. Mankind with a spike piledriver to Undertaker on the steel chair. It gets a near fall. That was the first attempt by either man to win the match. Mankind with a leg drop onto the chair on Undertaker's face, which by the way, is a bloody mess. Only two. Double arm DDT. Seriously, what is up Mankind's nose? How did it get there? Mankind retrieves a bag from under the ring. And there's thumbtacks in the bag. LOTS OF THUMBTACKS. Are you even serious right now? Mankind tries to knock Undertaker into the tacks, but Undertaker goozles Mankind. Guess what happens? Go on, guess. No, actually Mankind counters. Taker with a boot, looking for a Tombstone, but it's countered into a Mandible Claw. Undertaker in trouble. Arm goes down twice, but not a third time. And Undertaker's carrying Mankind on his back... oh dear. Oh dear. OH SHITOHSHITOHSHIT... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Mankind is backdropped onto the thumbtacks! And Mankind rolls into the thumbtacks! And Undertaker chokeslams Mankind on the thumbtacks. Of course he does. Undertaker with a tombstone piledriver, and Undertaker wins it in 17:08. Get some help for these men right now. They once again get the stretcher for Mankind, but he insists on walking to the back. A recap of how we got to the WWF title match, plus a pending conspiracy involving the Undertaker, Kane, and Mankind. Match 9: Kane defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin in a first blood match at 14:52 to win the WWF Championship. Mankind and the Undertaker came out during the match (I have no idea how considering the hell they went through not even a half hour earlier). Austin fights off Mankind and Kane. Undertaker looks to nail Mankind, but hits Austin. The chairshot busts Austin open. It took a moment for referee Earl Hebner to realize it before he calls it. And when the announcement’s made, people are about ready to riot and start fires. EDDIE MAC’S QUICK REVIEW So… this was a show and a half, yeah? The King of the Ring final four was almost a complete afterthought coming into the show, and very much a footnote afterwards. The Hell in a Cell match set the bar for the stipulation’s matches that will never be surpassed. That match alone makes this show worth a watch. The only blatant filler on the show are the two promos and the bonus matches, but even they have their place, even if the latter one was better served as a cooldown between the two main events. But seriously, watch this show. 8 out of 10 from yours truly. Also, Austin wins the title literally 24 hours later. And who was screwing with the cell’s controls during the title match? Seriously. SERIOUSLY. NOTE: No Live Retro Blog next week. Hell in a Cell weekend. Back in two weeks.

Photo Courtesy of Ali Inay, via Unsplash Ray’s Garden Grows I don’t like to waste food nor do I do it very often. But it seems I’m probably in the minority on that phenomenon. It’s only been in the past few years that I’ve given attention to and noticed others doing the same about a statistic which seems staggering – that 30 to 40 percent of the food which is produced with the intent to have humans eat it is wasted instead before it is consumed. The average American throws out 209 to 254 pounds of edible food per year – well over a half a pound per day. For livestock feed, farmers get concerned about the losses when they exceed single digit percentage points. Those losses, which are virtually inevitable, occur during harvesting, transportation, and storage. The waste of human food, which has been substantiated in many ways, including by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, has many dire implications – economic, social, and environmental. It’s also a tremendous waste of natural resources such as water, land, seed, and fertilizer. Original Awareness I first became aware of this shocking statistic in 2008 when an article was published on a 10-year research project at the University of Arizona to track food waste. The lead researcher indicated that at least 40 percent of the food that was grown is wasted. At the time, he estimated annual average losses of $590 directly incurred by a family of four and a loss of $43 billion per year within households alone in the United States. Numerous subsequent published articles and online entries on this topic typically refer to a 30 to 40 percent loss on food that was grown. As recently as September of this year, a Consumer Reports article stated that Americans discarded an average of 52 percent of the fresh produce that they purchased along with 50 percent of seafood, 22 percent of meat, and 20 percent of milk. Publicity for the annual World Food Day, which was observed on Sunday, Oct. 16, pointed out that on any given day about 800 million humans are undernourished. Based on the current world population, that’s a bit over 10 percent compared to the 30 to 40 percent waste of food. Worldwide Implications Does the frequently documented waste of food bother anyone? It should, especially in light of the predictions by many organizations that food production around the world would nearly have to double by 2050 because of an increase of 2 billion in the world’s population from the 7 billion today. I don’t understand those mathematical calculations. Even if they are correct, a great reduction in the waste of food would translate into having little or no need to boost food production. The latest online information indicates that 1.3 billion tons of food worth $750 billion are wasted world-wide every year – enough to feed hundreds of millions of people. In the United States for 2014, the food waste estimate was 133 billion pounds worth $161.6 billion. Of this, 97 percent went to landfills while only 3 percent was composted. One estimate is that within the United States food waste has increased 50 percent per capita since 1974. Another calculation indicates that 28 percent of the agricultural acres in the world are being used to grow food that is wasted. A reduction of 20 percent, not 20 percentage points, from the most recently estimated 40 percent food waste in the United States would provide enough food for 25 million people per year at a time when one in six Americans is categorized as “food insecure.” Personal Experiences My first attention-getting experience with a waste of prepared food came on a day of KP (kitchen patrol or kitchen police) duty at an Air Force base in Texas. Although they had been refrigerated and were certainly still edible, dozens of pies were discarded that day because an expiration date had arrived. The only redeeming point about that incident was learning that an area hog farmer was picking up the discarded pies to feed his animals. I have never worked in a supermarket but they are definitely one source of food waste. I don’t know how willing the owner/operators would be to share numbers or volumes but it would be interesting to ask. Anyone who has any doubts about food waste stemming from supermarkets need only go to the bio-digester at the University of Wisconsin – Oshkosh. It incinerates supermarket, cafeteria, and restaurant food wastes to produce heat and electric power for buildings on the campus (about 10 percent of the university’s power usage) and city-owned facilities. It was the first anaerobic bio-digester of its type installed in the western hemisphere. I visited there five years ago – shortly after the bio-digester opened. It was amazing and disheartening to see the dumped truckloads of discarded vegetables and fruits that were obtained from supermarkets in the Fox Cities area and Oshkosh. The greatest food waste that I can plead guilty to is with small tomatoes. That happened with yellow and red ones this year and a few years ago. At the occasion about a decade ago, I invited a food pantry to have its clients pick as many tomatoes as they could use but I was turned down because of client confidentiality rules. Other Observations Food waste was a topic that John Oliver tackled on his HBO “Last Week Tonight” show within the past year. He examined it from many perspectives. Video on Oliver’s program showed how perfectly edible peaches were left behind in California fruit groves because of slight physical defects. He also interviewed supermarket managers, learning that consumers tend to reject any fresh produce not appearing to be perfect in its physical condition and that’s it’s much easier and less expensive for supermarkets to push discarded produce out the backdoor and toward a landfill rather than distributing it to food pantries. Consumer rejection of produce not passing a beauty test is being addressed at a few Walmart and Whole Foods outlets, according to a recent report in Time magazine. They’re offering odd-looking, misshaped, or “ugly” produce such as apples or potatoes at discount prices. Another major source of food waste is in school cafeterias. U.S. Department of Agriculture rules require that meals have a certain nutrient balance, including items that students should eat but unfortunately choose not to. Who’s to blame for that? Another inherent problem leading to food waste is a misunderstanding of the meaning of “use by” or “best by” dates stated on labels. This does not mean that the food is no longer safe by that date. Only “expiration date” labels should be honored. Taking Action One institution which has taken notice of food waste is St. Norbert College (SNC) in De Pere, where about 2,200 meals are served per day in a campus cafeteria. A recent article detailed what measures it has taken to cope with food waste and what the results have been. Since August of 2014, a portion of the cafeteria organic waste has gone to an area farmer to feed livestock while some of the remainder goes to the UW – Oshkosh bio-digester. Food waste was reduced by 44 percent during the first year of the SNC initiative, less than a full garbage bag of waste is headed to a landfill after each meal, and about $1,000 is saved per year on landfill tipping fees and emptying of the on-campus trash compactor. In addition, the dining service which operates the SNC cafeteria donates prepared food to a local food pantry for feeding its volunteers – not its clients. There’s a legal restriction on offering prepared food to food pantry clients because it is perishable. One of the online entries about food waste lists 27 ways on how to reduce it. Another one offers eight steps on how to do it. Where do you fit on the percentage scale on food waste? Are you below 10 percent, at the average or 30 to 40, or above 50 percent? How much money do you squander on wasted food?

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO, Associated Press Published: October 21, 2016, 7:54 PM A   A NEW YORK — Toy companies are working harder to think outside their usual box, offering more-inclusive items like dolls with disabilities, female superhero figures and characters with a range of skin tones. Many of the products breaking down the barriers started with smaller businesses, but big names like Mattel and Hasbro are getting into the game and offering lots more options this holiday season. What that means on the shelves is Barbies that have a greater variety of body types, eye colors and facial structures, a Lego mini-figure of a boy who uses a wheelchair, and an American Girl doll with accessories like a diabetes kit and arm crutches in addition to the hearing aids and service dogs it has offered before. Other items include coding toys, robots and circuit builder sets aimed at both girls and boys. Jennifer Weitzman, whose 5-year-old daughter Hannah has cochlear implants, has the American Girl doll with hearing aids and a Tinker Bell doll with a cochlear implant that Weitzman bought from a British site called ToyLikeMe.org. “She lit up when she was given them. She thinks it’s awesome that they have implants just like her,” said Weitzman, of Mount Kisco, N.Y. “For many kids, it helps them identify and makes them feel included.” The trend started a few years ago, pushed by parents who didn’t see enough diversity in the toy aisle and were turning to the internet or startups to find items. Increasingly, the inclusiveness in the toy aisle means dolls with disabilities. Toys R Us has carried an exclusive line since 2013 called Journey Girls, which includes a wheelchair and a crutch set. Its partnership with American Girl to carry the Truly Me collection starting this month will include dolls that also use crutches, diabetes kits and wheelchairs. While Lego has had larger figures before that use wheelchairs, the mini-figure introduced this year comes as part of the “Fun in the Park” set, mixed in with several figures that don’t. “The designers were thinking about what might you see in the park in the city,” said Lego spokesman Michael McNally. Lego mini-figures had been yellow so that children could imagine their own identity for the characters. “We’ve always been about helping kids find themselves,” McNally said. But in 2004, it introduced flesh tones when representing real-life personalities. Experts say it’s critical for children to play with toys that don’t perpetuate stereotypes about what’s considered beautiful. They say the toys children play with have lasting impressions on their careers and their confidence. “There’s been some good progress, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done,” said Elizabeth Sweet, a sociologist and lecturer at California State University in Sacramento, Calif. “Kids need to see themselves in the toys and objects they interact with.” For building toys, the company GoldieBlox, founded in 2012, was among the first to disrupt the pink aisle by offering construction sets aimed at girls. But it also realized it needed more racial diversity, and last fall introduced a black character called Ruby Rails and has since then added a Latina engineer called Valentina and other characters. Many experts have been closely watching the moves made by Mattel, particularly with its iconic Barbie, whose business has been rebounding amid a makeover after seeing its sales suffer. The nation’s largest toy maker launched the Barbie Fashionista collection last year that offered more skin tones, eye colors and facial structures. This year, it added three body types — curvy, petite and tall. It said those items have been doing well. Spokeswoman Michelle Chidoni says the company is also looking to add different body shapes to the Barbie career line and the Fairytale doll collection. Racial diversity important Racial diversity can also be key. American Girl, which is owned by Mattel, launched a doll this year whose story is that she is growing up in civil rights-era Detroit. Wal-Mart’s My Life As doll collection has expanded the number of skin shades available, and Hasbro is adding more skin tones to its Baby Alive doll for next year. Beyond introducing dolls and games that feature all kinds of characters, companies are starting to think differently about toys that have traditionally been aimed at boys or girls. The White House held a conference on gender stereotypes in media and the toys, drawing executives from major toy companies. Target Corp. phased out gender-based signage in the toy aisle last year. It also was for a time the exclusive seller of Mattel’s DC Super Hero Girls, including Wonder Woman and Batgirl, which were the first 6-inch action figures designed for girls. They join other female characters in the action figure aisle that include Black Widow and Star Wars heroine Rey, says Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of TTPM, an online toy review site. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is selling its first 18-inch boy doll this holiday season under the My Life As brand, and Hasbro plans to launch a boy doll under the Baby Alive brand next year. John Frascotti, president of Hasbro Brands, cited My Little Pony, which originally was aimed at girls, and Nerf, which was traditionally for boys. Hasbro found the brands attract both boys and girls, so three years ago, it launched Nerf Rebelle that was styled for girls. As for My Little Pony, it’s expanding into comic books, usually more a domain for boys. “We are focusing on storytelling and worrying less about gender,” he said.

NEW YORK — Toy companies are working harder to think outside their usual box, offering more-inclusive items like dolls with disabilities, female superhero figures and characters with a range of skin tones. Many of the products breaking down the barriers started with smaller businesses, but big names such as Mattel and Hasbro are getting into the game and offering lots more options this holiday season. What that means on the shelves is Barbies that have a greater variety of body types, eye colors and facial structures, a Lego mini-figure of a boy who uses a wheelchair, and an American Girl doll with accessories like a diabetes kit and arm crutches in addition to the hearing aids and service dogs it has offered before. Other items include coding toys, robots and circuit builder sets aimed at both girls and boys.

CLEVELAND, OH -- Day two of the North Coast Gran Prix of Cyclocross at Kirtland Park was mostly sunny and the winds off stormy Lake Erie died down, making it a perfect, muddy day for off road cyclocross racing. Saturday's 30 mph winds were hard on some riders, especially those from states with more gentle climates. "What the hell is this?" riders from Los Angeles and Oklahoma asked race director and 20 year cyclocross competitor Marshall Leininger. "This is the lake effect" he told them as they watched giant waves crash over two lanes of the westbound shoreway. The riders laughed, shaking their heads, and headed for their bikes. "It just makes it all the more fun," Leininger said. "We have the best numbers ever this year. Word is getting out about how fun this course is, and we keep getting complements. Some are 'hate complements,' like 'we hate what you did but we had so much fun.' He laughs. "You just go out and torture yourself and you enjoy it." On Sunday, the course is still appropriately mucky, and the sun starts to warm things up by the third race. Pro rider Jen Malik, 25 and a PhD student at The Ohio State University, watches as some young female riders fly past her. "Go Meagan, you look great!" she yells as Meagan Gehrke, 27, of Columbus heads toward a particularly steep and muddy hill. It's Malik's third cyclocross season. "I got into this for the people," Malik says, brown hair pulled back and tucked under a ball cap. "People are all cheering for each other. It's not as intense as road racing. It's like a family. I have my cross family, I see the same people every weekend. It is very social, very supportive. The race is just part of the fun." The women's Cat 4 race ends, and Gehrke places third. Alexa Steirwalt, 12, finishes first and her Lionheart Junior team mate, Rosalyn Willey, 15, places second. They are state champions. "These young kids are amazing," Leininger says. "Rosalyn just signed with the Women's OCX team. These kids get coached up and they are taken care of, they don't have to worry about anything but racing." Next up are 39 racers in the Men's Cat 3 competition. National cyclocross announcer David Towle sizes up the athletes. "Looks like we've got some young guns about to cause some trouble at the start. These youngsters are going to challenge the old guard, the seasoned pros. Fifteen year old Liam Hughes is one to look out for. We are going to have some fast, fast starts." The riders start their first lap, bunched in a pack before obstacles and muddy hillsides separate the cyclists. Anastasia Hannebrink of Willoughby climbs to the top of a hill to watch the men climb the embankment she tackled in an earlier race. "Come on, gentlemen," she yells. "Pain is only temporary. This is the biggest hill in Cleveland." She watches most men dismount and run their bikes up the hill. Some of the young riders grind their way up, still on their bikes. "These guys are beasts," she says as she watches the eventual winner, Lucas Stierwalt, 15, shred the hill for the second time. People are yelling and ringing cowbells. "I've done three races," Hannebrink says. "I'm on a Schwinn from 1996. I get laughed at because I have a kickstand. I usually just run most of the course with my bike. I figure I didn't die on the first two races, so I decided to come out again." She says if she didn't quit after the first race, she might be hooked. She says she threw some air into the tires of her mountain bike from sixth grade.  On the way to the race she hears a pop. "My rear tire blew out. I also forgot my helmet. So I ran into Walmart, bought a new helmet. When I got to the race, I went to the fix-it tent and $12 later I can actually ride. I started the race five minutes late. It's so cool that they let me do that." Hannebrink echoes the sentiments of many when she talks about what keeps her coming to the races. "It's not like a 5k where everyone is so cliquish," she says, watching riders head downhill. "Here everybody supports you and wants you to succeed." Here is a partial list of upcoming local races: November 06: Down by the River Cross, Todd Field, Willoughby November 13: Cross on the Range: Lake Farmpark, Kirtland November 27: Whiskey Cross, Wendy Park, Whiskey Island, Cleveland For more information, go to: neocx.wordpress.com  or  velogoat.com Metro Columnists Michael McIntyre's Tipoff Mark Naymik Phillip Morris The Weekday Front Page The Plain Dealer's front page for November 15, 2016 Updates posted Monday - Friday Eat, Drink & Play in the CLE What are the best restaurants, bars & things to do in NE Ohio?

Women in tech: Why the small victories matter 0 Share: Tech Industry by Erin Carson October 22, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @erincarson Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing aims to create a better culture in the industry for the next generation of female geeks. Photo by Brent Lewis/Getty Images If you're wondering where all the women in tech are, this week the easy answer was Houston, Texas -- at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. It's an annual conference hosted by the Anita Borg Institute, an organization focused on the advancement of women in technology. The event is named for Grace Hopper, a rear admiral in the US Navy who helped create the COBOL programming language, among other achievements. This year, 15,000 attendees, mostly women, with about 1,000 men thrown in, congregated for three days of speakers, workshops and as much branded swag as they could stuff in a tote bag. And, hopefully, some job opportunities. In the past, the event has gotten attention for attracting big names and, occasionally, trouble. Two years ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella incurred much ire for telling women they should trust the system instead of asking for raises. Last year, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki talked about sending her disgruntled daughter to an all-girls coding camp. This year, the word on everyone's lips is progress. In just one year, the conference has grown by about 3,000 attendees. Side chatter revolves around how refreshing it is to be around so many other women. And when a speaker like Intel CEO Brian Krzanich mentions something like men taking credit for women's ideas in meetings, the crowd chuckles. They know exactly what he's talking about. The way out of this problem is to not lose heart, a message the conference continually reinforces. "If we don't celebrate the wins, we lose sight of the bigger picture," said Reshma Saujani, founder of nonprofit education program Girls Who Code. "Celebration" might seem like an offbeat way to put it. A conference is a conference, after all, but considering the current climate in tech, women in the industry might need a positive boost more than ever. A report came out Thursday from Girls Who Code and consulting firm Accenture projecting that women's share of tech jobs in the US could fall, amounting to only one in five by 2025. Maybe it shouldn't come as a surprise. In 1984, 37 percent of computer science majors were women. That number steadily dropped and now stands at about 18 percent. As much as the industry is finally talking about the dearth of women in tech, no one is really considering that the situation could get worse. The report also found that the salary gap between men and women in the US widened even further, from $8,540 in 2011 to $12,661 in 2015. 'Sisterhood matters' The news is seldom good. Published diversity and inclusion reports show that tech companies struggle to get their technical workforces up to even 30 percent women. The obstacles multiply, and even the youngest attendees seem to know it. Discouragement is a bear. So the Grace Hopper conference tries to keep the good vibes flowing. "We know sisterhood matters in sparking and sustaining girls' interest in computing as they move through the pipeline," said Saujani, a Grace Hopper regular, who appeared on a panel last year with Chelsea Clinton, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook's director of global diversity, Maxine Williams. A few minutes before IBM CEO Ginni Rometty took the stage for her keynote speech on Wednesday, a college student named Alyssia Jovellanos accepted the Student of Vision ABIE Award from the Anita Borg Institute and talked to a packed arena about how important it is to have role models. Cisco sponsored a disco. The Microsoft brigade wore blindingly blue T-shirts. Attendees struck up conversations without reservation. A sophomore from the College of William and Mary in Virginia told me she'd made up her mind to get a master's degree -- partly because of the conversations she's had with people here, partly to make up for the fact she'll probably earn less because, you know, she's a woman. A technical conference Anita Borg, who passed away in 2003, and Anita Borg Institute CEO Telle Whitney started GHC in 1994, with a whopping 500 attendees. "There was a lot of teeth gnashing about the lack of women in the sciences," Whitney said of the early days of the conference. Over time, the conference has sought to balance the more on-the-nose sessions about being a woman in tech with technical sessions. So Grace Hopper was a place to get advice on how to deal with unconscious biases in the workplace or to attend a session on computer simulations for drug discovery, or data management or cybersecurity. Last year I wandered into a session on virtual-reality analytics. My liberal arts education and I slunk out after about four PowerPoint slides of algorithms. But think back to that stat on the percentage of women computer science majors out there. These sessions might be some of the only educational spaces these women will enter where they're not one of only a few women in the room. The future of women in tech GHC might be only once a year, but Whitney hopes the effects take hold beyond that. After all, the conversation around diversity in tech is one about culture change. There's a reason why speakers like Lyndsay Pearson, from video game maker Electronic Arts, preach topics like building inclusion into gaming. The bones of the industry have to be reset. At Grace Hopper, that reset starts with an expo floor packed with recruiters from companies looking to hire attendees. The booths are bright, the smiles are big, young women in skirts and flats walk around with resumes, trying to imagine themselves working anywhere from Bank of America to Airbnb -- and they have a fair shot at doing so. Even Walmart has a booth. Saujani is one of many who believes life will be better with the power of tech on women's side. "The idea that they can use technology to further their interests opens up so many more pathways for keeping girls engaged in the long run," she said. The conference sends a loud message that there are women in this industry and that they can, despite it all, find success. Sometimes that starts with a conversation at lunch, bonding over a slice of pizza, or by getting to ask a notable figure how she deals with imposter syndrome, the feeling that others will realize you're not good enough to be where you are. To a large degree, it's also about being able to stand in a room, do a 360-degree turn and see a few thousand other women in tech.

Some election officials think that could be a problem. Published October 21. 2016 8:50PM  Amber Phillips, The Washington Post Most states have no laws regarding guns in polling places, because for the most part, they haven't really needed to make them. The confluence of firearms and polling places isn't something America has been concerned about on a national scale - until now.  As we stumble into the home stretch of one of the most divisive presidential elections in recent history - complete with eyebrow-raising rhetoric on guns and voter fraud - many election officials across the country are, for very the first time, bracing for intimidation or even violence on Election Day. And there's not much they can really do about it. "We've never seen this level of concern, this far out from Election Day - poll workers in states across the country being trained to deal with guns," said Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman with the Michael Bloomberg-aligned gun control group, Everytown for Gun Safety. But other than training for how to respond in a mass shooting or studying up on what actions define voter intimidation, state laws about guns and voter intimidation are a patchwork of wildly varying regulations. Most election officials sort through a hodgepodge of laws about concealed weapons and open carry, and take into account whether the polling place is on private or public property, to figure out whether a gun-toting voter is allowed in. In fact, some state laws on guns could even be interpreted as counterproductive to voter safety. In Pennsylvania, for instance, voters can bring a handgun or rifle with them to vote - but law enforcement has to stay at least 100 feet from the polling booth. In South Carolina, you can't bring an open carry handgun into the polling booth, but you can bring an open carry rifle or other long gun inside. According to the nonprofit Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks state gun laws, there are six states that generally prohibit bringing guns in polling places (Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas). Another four ban concealed carry guns in polling places (Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina), but it gets complicated when you drill down into their open carry laws. The combination of gun-related election-day rhetoric and a somewhat confusing state Web of gun laws has some election officials worried - especially in swing states with open carry laws and a history of mass gun violence. In Virginia's Prince William County, where you can bring your gun into county government buildings, The Washington Post's Patricia Sullivan reports the electoral board is considering seeking a one-day ban on weapons at polling places on private property. In Colorado, poll workers in Denver and the suburb Aurora - the site of the 2012 "Dark Knight" mass shooting - are being trained on how to respond to a mass shooting. In New Hampshire, where guns have been an issue in the U.S. Senate campaign, election officials are letting people know that some of their fellow voters might legally carry a weapon into polling places - even into schools. And in Pennsylvania, where you can vote with a gun in tow in most locations, state election officials are underscoring their laws about voter intimidation. Intimidating voters is illegal in the United States, but intimidation can be hard to define. And it's certainly not a new problem. In an Election Day 2008 incident that has been a touchstone for conservatives in recent years, two New Black Panther Party members stood outside a Philadelphia polling location dressed in black military-style uniforms; some on the scene that day accused them of making intimidating remarks. But concerns about election safety and intimidation are playing out on a whole new scale this year. No presidential candidate in modern history has driven the conversation about guns and voting as far as Donald Trump has. He's suggested "Second Amendment people" may be the only check on Hillary Clinton's ability to appoint a Supreme Court nominee, he's boasted he could "stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody" without losing voters. Meanwhile, Trump has urged his supporters to stake out polling locations in "certain areas" to watch for fraud - while himself claiming the election is rigged. This new focus on guns in polling places is also playing out in the context of a battle about who can openly carry guns and where. In the past year or two, pro-gun activists and gun-control activists have clashed over whether there are (or should be) limits on carrying weapons in public in open carry states. Typically, an activist will bring an AR-15 into a Walmart or Target to demonstrate that he or she can, as gun control activists cry foul and try to put pressure on the company to take a stand against it. (Bloomberg's group successfully pressured Starbucks and Chipotle into asking their customers to leave their guns at home.) Every state and the District of Columbia allows the concealed carry of weapons in some form, though some states are far more restrictive about who is eligible than others. And in 42 states, you can carry your gun around openly - though most states have restrictions on where. We as a nation have yet to come to a consensus about the ubiquity of firearms in many arenas; our electoral process is one of them. As of right now, there are roughly two-and-a-half weeks left to try and find some common ground.   Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.
