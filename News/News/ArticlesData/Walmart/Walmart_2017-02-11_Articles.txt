Yet it popped up in a recent screen for companies poised to benefit from sweeping corporate tax changes proposed by the U.S. House of Representatives. (And Regeneron shares popped Thursday.) On the other hand, Deere (DE) is up 22% over that stretch, yet it screens as a company that could get pinched by the new tax plan. It’s early to speculate on precisely how corporate taxes will change. But Donald Trump is reportedly warming to a House plan...

By Leslie P. Norton Biography August 6, 2011 Murray Stahl, the chief investment officer of New York-based Horizon Kinetics, began his career as a utility analyst. In the early 1980s, Stahl, a value investor, recommended buying shares of out-of-favor General Public Utilities, then the owner of Three Mile Island, which in 1979 had been the site of the U.S.'s worst nuclear power accident. Investors who heeded his advice made big money. Thus began a career of independent thinking about the market and a wide-ranging interest in what makes successful people tick. He shares these views with his investors, and also with subscribers to Horizon publications such as The Spin-off Report and ETF Compendium. (For a taste, check the "Research Library" tab at www.horizonkinetics.com). Last week, Stahl talked with Barron's about exchange-traded funds, the importance of qualitative insights -- and of course, about stocks. Barron's: Why are exchange-traded funds so important to a stockpicker? Stahl: ETFs are affecting the market in bizarre ways. In order to talk about that, I have to first define a term: owner-operator. Owner-operators are equities where the management happens to be the largest shareholders. That is how they become the management. The wealth of the proprietors is tied into the company. If the shareholder isn't successful, the proprietor can't be financially successful. That is what an owner-operator is. Enlarge Image Close "If management gets their shares for free, I hardly think their interests are aligned" with those of other shareholders. —Murray Stahl Matthew Furhman for Barron's Jeremy Siegel in The Future for Investors studies the IPO market and rightly concludes that initial public offerings have a predictive tendency to produce unsatisfactory results in comparison to different indices. He gives you a table of IPOs that were very successful. It is a minority. Each and every one is owner-operated. Boards give managers shares. That's the crucial operative term, "give shares." Other shareholders had to buy their shares. If management gets their shares for free, I hardly think their interests are aligned. They have a variety of modalities for increasing their wealth, one of which happens to be the shares. I only have one favorable outcome; they have many. ETFs are largely constructed on a market-capitalization-weight, float-adjusted basis. It's never this obvious, but consider a company where management owns a lot of stock and is buying more. At the margin, the stock's weighting in the exchange-traded fund would be reduced. Why? Assuming everything else remains the same, the float is being reduced. Let's take the other extreme case, in which management has sold all their shares. From an ETF perspective, the float increased. Therefore, its weight in the index would more nearly approximate its market capitalization. The exchange-traded fund structure de facto does the opposite of what the insiders do. I find that rather intriguing. What are the ramifications? To begin with, owner-operated companies trade at very low valuations. Eventually, the market corrects that. A more major consequence is that if you examine the S&P 500 since 1957, and the exercise was to find the best stocks, you'd find Wal-Mart WMT -1.5344528083381586% Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Now let's perform the exercise of calculating the S&P as if those companies never existed and were never in it. I promise you that you would never buy the resulting rump S&P, which would probably have returned half of what it was historically. We looked at the 80 owner-operators in Japan and compared them to the three primary indexes: the MSCI Japan, the Topix and the Nikkei. The difference in return was significant per annum. The individual investor should understand that, historically, indexation provided the rates of return it did because of the presence of a given number of owner-operators. Are you saying that individuals shouldn't be in exchange-traded funds? No. Indexation is a very sound idea. I'm really saying that someone should design an ETF that incorporates consciously the owner-operator element. "How They Did It" is a fascinating section in your publications that profiles successful people. Whom did you find most useful? When I went to college, I was interested in economics because as a very naïve person I thought I would learn to make money from the masters. I was absolutely aghast when I learned most of the masters were broke. Karl Marx was destitute most of his life, and if Friedrich Engels hadn't provided financial assistance, who knows what would have happened? There's an apocryphal remark from Marx's wife: "If Karl Marx invested more time into making Das Kapital than writing Das Kapital, his family would have been better off." So I decided to read the lives of people who were financially successful. It is the most interesting part of the whole field of finance. Benjamin Franklin stands head and shoulders above everyone else. For example, during the time of the French and Indian Wars, the Assembly of Philadelphia felt the city might be attacked. But Philadelphia was a Quaker city, and the Quakers were uninterested in violence. Franklin asked if they were opposed to storing grain, because the granaries might be burned in an invasion. They said, "Of course not," and donated money for grain. He went and bought gunpowder on the premise that it's a grainy substance. He wanted to buy artillery from the governor of New York, who wouldn't sell. So Franklin invited him to dinner. He wrote, "After the first bottle of Madeira, I had my first cannon. After the second I had several more. Had I stayed, I could have had them all." Eugene Meyer had very useful insights. He bought 51% of Boston Consolidated, which owned the worst-managed copper mining properties in 1907 or 1908, for one reason: It controlled the upper half of a mountain in Utah and the Guggenheim family controlled the bottom half. They had the technology to extract copper from low-grade ores, which they wouldn't share with Consolidated. But you can't mine the bottom half of a mountain without having the cooperation of the people who own the top half, unless you're not worried about things like avalanches and cave-ins. That's not an asset you find on a balance sheet. Frequently, the qualitative dimension is more important than the quantitative. The insights of most of these people are completely qualitative, rarely properly digested by the market. You've written a lot about unsustainable profitability, but the companies in the S&P 500 are continuing to beat estimates. The stock prices clearly reflect unsustainability. Even the worldwide debt crisis plays a role in the unsustainability. Federal spending since 1933 has grown at 9.03% a year. Sooner or later, governments, to alleviate their distress, might raise taxes. That's another way of achieving lower profit margins. How does the market look to you? The stock market will produce very uninspiring results for many years to come. Part of it is the unsustainability of profit margins. Part of it is the debt crisis. In the S&P, a lot of companies already dominate their industries -- food, utilities, drugs. Companies might acquire competitors. But statistically, most acquisitions aren't well-thought-out. They could return cash to shareholders, but if the yield is 2%-3%, you only get that yield and if you buy back a stock at a P/E of, say, 14 to 15 times, invert that and you get a sevenish percent return. Uninspiring. I invite people to undertake this exercise: Take any stock you like, and instead of buying it, make believe you wrote a put option on it, which gives you the right to sell a security at a predefined price. So you sold a put option with a six-month expiration. What happens? You earn a premium. And let's make believe that the stock was completely unchanged for a year. You wrote a put option collecting a premium, the option expired worthless, and you wrote another premium for the remaining six months. Stahl's Picks Recent Company Ticker Price WisdomTree Investments WETF $6.86 CBOE Holdings CBOE 22.45 Beijing Capital Intl Airport 694.HK HK$3.57 ...And a Pan Carmike Cinemas CKED $6.19 Source: Bloomberg Those two premiums in the case of almost every stock is a double-digit number. Of course, it is never a steady-state world. But assuming it were, the premium of virtually any stock is double-digit—that's the return people want to get from the equity, but might not. Now if the stock price is unchanged, that is the rate of return. If the equity goes up in value, you earn that rate of return. If the equity goes down in value, your underlying position is marked down, but you have the cushion of the premium that you collected. If the premiums over the year totaled 12% or 14%, the stock has to decline by 12% or 14% for you to reach breakeven. Our Kinetics Multi-Disciplinary Fund [KMDNX] pursues this strategy. It is similar to equities in terms of its rate of return, but much less volatile. People are looking for that. It works great in an IRA account, in a foundation, anything tax-exempt. Even on a taxable basis, I dare say it will provide an acceptable rate of return. What do you think of emerging markets? They have been a disappointment over the 25 years I've been investing. I don't think they provide the rate of return that justifies the risk. A well-managed emerging- market fund probably returned 12-ish percent over 20 to 25 years. If you're a taxable individual living in the State of New York, if your net after-tax result were in the single digits, would you invest? Most people would decline. The maximum corporate profits are earned when there is little competition. Look at any emerging-market index and see how many companies populate any industry group, with more on the way. I suppose, compared with the uninspiring U.S. equity market, emerging markets look very good. But would I buy an emerging-markets index? No. But there might be splendid emerging-market companies that provide truly unique rates of return. In that case, investment is warranted. Let's talk about stocks. What do you like? I am a big investor in WisdomTree Investments WETF 1.0392609699769053% WisdomTree Investments Inc. U.S.: Nasdaq USD8.75 0.09 1.0392609699769053% /Date(1486764000334-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 2029587 AFTER HOURS USD8.8 0.05 0.5714285714285714% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 188796 P/E Ratio 43.75 Market Cap 1181873532.03201 Dividend Yield 3.657142857142857% Rev. per Employee 1239810 More quote details and news » WETF in Your Value Your Change Short position [WETF]. It's better to invest in the ETF company as a business than in exchange-traded funds themselves. WisdomTree is exploring interesting new opportunities, like emerging-currency and debt funds, short-term investments with higher yields and undervalued currencies. WisdomTree's earnings-weighted exchange-traded funds make more sense than the market-capitalization-weighted ETFs. When I bought it, the company traded for roughly 3% of assets under management. It now trades at 7%. I think it will be acquired in a couple of years by a large mutual-fund complex or bank or brokerage that would like to be in exchange-traded funds and wants a revenue stream. Individuals are very unlikely to return to traditional mutual-fund investing where you can exit the investment only after 4 p.m. There are only a handful of large ETF companies. WisdomTree is eighth on the list. The market cap is around $800 million. WisdomTree has minimal earnings. It has invested virtually all of its cash flow into growing the business. The company is now at $13.3 billion of assets, versus less than $4 billion a year ago. If the average fee is 55 basis points [hundredths of a percentage point], that's $70 million of fee income that could become $70 million of operating income on an existing platform. You are paying $800 million for $70 million of income with very high growth rates. An informed buyer might pay $14 or $15 a share. You also like CBOE Holdings CBOE -0.5887623192115704% CBOE Holdings Inc.

Why? CBOE just announced July volume up 13%. The operative thing is to look at the volume of the VIX [volatility] contract. The VIX is the company's most valuable asset, only about 2% of volume, but growing 334% a year. In the fullness of time, about three or four years from now, the vehicle of choice for hedging a portfolio will not be the S&P 500 futures contract; it will be the VIX because it's so much more volatile than the S&P. This is a very unique exchange. It has proprietary properties like the VIX and is using that to branch into other volatility trades like the gold VIX, a recent creation that ultimately will probably be successful as well. But that VIX contract is extremely valuable. It has first-mover advantage. I think it is worth in three to four years more than the whole CBOE. The company trades at 15 times earnings; that's not a bargain. The issue is that ultimately it will produce a great deal of earnings. Beijing Capital International Airports [694.Hong Kong] is like CBOE in that both have very little in the way of variable cost. If 10,000 more passengers come into the airport, if someone trades an extra 10,000 VIX contracts, the cost of operating doesn't go up. Prior to 2008, the airport was very profitable. Then it doubled in size and more than doubled operating expenses. Passenger traffic went up, so the airport was more or less breakeven. It has a high growth rate. They're at the stage where increased passenger throughput goes to the bottom line. They preannounced earnings that are vastly higher than forecasts. It trades at 20 times. To judge its future profitability, compare it to Australian-listed MAp Airports, which owns 30%-plus of the Brussels and Copenhagen airports and 74% of Sydney. Its proportion of the traffic is about 40 million passengers a year. Now the Beijing Airport gets more than 70 million passengers a year. MAp's fixed costs are much lower than Beijing's. MAp's airports earn $400 million a year. Beijing Airports earns something like $100 million, but once it achieves the proper economies of scale, it will earn much more than MAp. MAp has a market cap of roughly about $6 billion. And Beijing has a market cap of $2 billion. I think it's worth more than MAp. Anything you dislike? Carmike Cinemas [CKEC]. The average ticket price is increasing at a small rate each year, but attendance is declining 1% to 2% a year, and rents go up every year with a 3% escalator. We're at a point where given competition and other venues of entertainment, it's very hard to raise prices. Margins are razor thin. I think the profitability goes away in 24 months or less.

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Opinion Repeal ban on liquor sales in Florida grocery stores George Gilhooley f Doug McSchooler / AP George Gilhooley f George Gilhooley f (Doug McSchooler / AP) Nearly a century after Prohibition, Floridians are still living with antiquated alcohol laws. Over the past few years, the Florida Legislature has changed a few. We can now ship ourselves cases of wine, for example, and buy 64-ounce "growlers" of craft beer. This year comes a decision on whether to let grocery stores, drugstores and big box stores — like Wal-Mart and Target — sell liquor alongside beer and wine. The change is long overdue. It makes no sense that consumers can buy beer and wine in one store, but must walk outside and into a separate store to buy distilled spirits. Today's regulation protects liquor stores, but limits competition and poses a needless burden on consumers. By getting rid of this regulation, the Republicans who control Tallahassee can prove their free-market bona fides and rein in government's tendency to pick winners and losers in the marketplace. The current bill, sponsored by Senate President Pro Tempore Anitere Flores of Miami, would let any package store with a liquor license sell hard liquor inside its walls. Thirty states already allow this. This is not the first time this push has been mounted, but its chances appear better this year because the Legislature has so many new faces. The bill passed the Senate Regulated Industries Committee recently by a 9-1 vote, and now heads to the Rules Committee before a final floor vote. A companion House bill also has been filed. If this bill passes, a change will also be needed in the number of stores that can obtain a liquor license. It makes no sense for consumers to be able to buy liquor at one chain store but not at another because of the state's licensing quota. While there's nothing wrong with restricting liquor sales at gas-station convenience stores, if you're going to allow liquor sales in some Publix stores, Wal-Marts or Walgreens, they should be allowed in all. Flores told the Sun Sentinel Editorial Board another bill may be filed to address that issue. For now, she's focused on the bill to let stores sell liquor alongside beer and wine. "This law was around more than 80 years ago with a purpose," she said. "That purpose is long gone. It's not our job to stand in the way of 21st-century innovation, the American entrepreneurial spirit." The bill's opponents, including the Florida Independent Spirits Association, argue that allowing liquor sales in stores like Wal-Mart will lead to an increase in crime and underage drinking. "If you have spirits readily available inside a Target or a Wal-Mart, it invites underage kids," executive director Rory Eggers told us. "Not to mention the employees who work in those chains — they can hire anyone 16 and up." It's a familiar argument. When fighting the push to let people ship themselves a case of wine, opponents suggested kids might answer the door and drown in trouble. Let's remember that stores like Wal-Mart and Walgreens already sell beer and wine, and there's no evidence their teenage workers are stealing and imbibing. The bill says employees under 18 would not be able to handle liquor — the same regulation that already exists in liquor stores. Ron Ziff, long-time president of the California Beverage Retailers Association, told us such scare tactics have been used for years to prevent change. Since the repeal of Prohibition, California has let grocery stores sell liquor alongside beer and wine. "It's a facetious argument," Ziff said. "It's just something people make up to argue against it. Crime doesn't go alongside grocery stores just because they sell liquor." The Florida Independent Spirits Association's other argument — that will it hurt liquor stores — has some merit. But in California, liquor stores have responded by going upscale to serve a niche market, selling a wider variety of wines and liquors than can be offered in grocery stores with limited shelf space. Plus, they retain the convenience factor. If someone just wants to purchase a bottle of Scotch, a liquor store is a faster and easier option. And the bill would lift the prohibition on liquor stores selling grocery items, allowing room for reinvention. It's long past time to repeal this outdated law. Let stores sell beer, wine and liquor, too. Let's end Prohibition altogether. Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Orlando Sentinel Publix Super Markets Inc.

"You see this happening on TV, and happening to other people, but you never think about it happening to yourself," said Brenda Rivers, the woman who was detained. She was thrust into a social media firestorm after a Facebook Live video went viral. It shows her on the floor in handcuffs at the Homewood store. "Anybody can be violated, or abused. It can happen to anyone," said Rivers. During the December 1 incident, Rivers was detained after refusing to let police search her purse. Homewood police claimed they were investigating a theft. "I believe that is uncontested and will be agreed upon, that there was nothing in Mrs. Rivers purse that was allegedly stolen," said Attorney Brett Turnbull. Rivers was eventually let go without any charges, but not before being detained for roughly 30 minutes. "Forever! Forever! That's what it felt like," she said. The woman has sued the city and one of the officers involved for unreasonable search and seizure as well as excessive force. "Because of what I went through, because of what I suffered, mentally and physically," said Rivers. Rivers said she has a wrist and rib injury. Homewood police declined to comment, citing the pending lawsuit. Copyright 2017 WBRC. All rights reserved.

(AP) — Not so long ago, Everett Couto's twin passions were fast food and video games. McDonald's and "Call of Duty." Wendy's and "Grand Theft Auto." When the 22-year-old wasn't gaming, he was on Facebook. For someone with autism and a bipolar disorder, struggling with a mix of medications, the internet offered an escape that became an exile. This was his life. "Every day," Couto says. "Eight to 18 hours a day." Finally, his parents had enough. He had enough, too, but in a different way. A darker way. "I don't know," he says. "I broke down and kind of thought about ways to end it. "Commit suicide," he says. Tony and Ann Couto sent their son to Utah for Aspiro Wilderness Adventure Therapy two years ago. It was a financial sacrifice for middle-class parents. They called it his college. They told Everett the trip would be two weeks, but it was more like two months of outdoor living and learning. Hiking and healthy foods. Field trips and group sessions. No computers and, often, no electricity. "When he came back, he was cleansed," his mother says. "Like a clean slate." That's when he started running. Healthy lifestyle In a sweaty red T-shirt and shorts, Couto looks like any other jogger who just crossed the Ringling Causeway. Saucony sneakers. TomTom running watch. Bottled water. He speaks well. Great smile and eager handshake. "How are you doing?" It's easy to miss signs of his autism. There are moments of awkwardness and confusion. He turns toward people he knows. In Sarasota, Couto attended different public and private schools and special programs for students with special needs. He graduated from the Prew Academy when was 19. Couto still lives at home. He's not ready to go out on his own. He will always need help. He doesn't drive, so he rides his bike to various jobs. For a while, Couto unloaded trucks at Walmart. For a while, he waved a sign outside the Broken Egg restaurant. Now he works 10 to 20 hours a week at Publix. Some of his friends work there, too. Sometimes they hang out at Denny's. Couto still enjoys rap music, but he tries to stay off the computer. No video games. He does have an iPhone with Facebook Messenger. He has oatmeal for breakfast. He eats lots of chicken, beans and rice. His only fast food meals are healthy plates from Chicken Kitchen. "Lean meats and low added sugar," he says. "I try to stay below 9 grams of added sugar a day." 'This spectacular thing' Healthy talk from Couto is music to the ears of Amy Weinberger, a Sarasota educator who first met him when he was 6 years old. He attended Camp Arrow, her summer program for students who didn't fit into traditional camps. That was a long time ago. "It's pretty amazing how far he's come," she says. "All of a sudden, he's a runner. He just kind of took off." For years, Weinberger watched Couto struggle. He'd become agitated and disruptive. He'd yell, scream and slam doors. He ate poorly and didn't exercise. He lived through his computer. She thought the Aspiro Wilderness program would help him become more independent. She thought finding a sport would help him find balance in his life. Weinberger had no idea that Couto would go so far and so fast in this new direction. "This running, this spectacular thing, is a unique experience," she says. "He's been allowed to challenge himself." He liked finishing During his time in Utah, Couto got in shape. He lost at least 20 pounds. He did some running. Back in Sarasota, he kept going. "I pretty much did one pace," Couto says with a smile. "Full speed." When he got tired, he would stop. Then he would start again. His first 5K race was the 2016 Ringling Bridge Run. He stopped at least once, but then kept going. It felt great. "I liked finishing," he says. "And I liked thinking I was getting in better shape." This was a new feeling for him. A healthy sense of purpose. Goals, sacrifice and accomplishment. He finished sixth in his age group at the Bridge Run. His parents were thrilled. "My husband and I just looked at each other when he got that medal," Ann says. "Wow! And then you couldn't stop him from running." The only problem was that Couto kept getting hurt. He'd run until he injured his leg. Then he'd stop. Then he'd run until he reinjured his leg. A vicious circle. Someone suggested a running coach and that's how he met Holly Johnson. Half marathons Johnson, 56, runs a boutique public relations company. She spends her summers in Colorado. She also coaches local runners with the New Balance In Motion training program. She has credibility. Running 24 marathons will do that. She shares a mantra with her runners: "Race smart so you can finish strong." After Johnson met with Everett and his dad, he started training with her. Years of video gaming didn't help, but youth was on his side. "He's got a great gait, very light on his feet," Johnson says. "The biggest thing was to work on his flexibility, which was his Achilles' heel." When Couto wanted to try longer distances, she looked at the Sarasota race calendar. "We decided the Music Half would be a fun race," she says. "And the First Watch Half Marathon, almost six weeks later, would be a goal race." Pushing the pace Couto would like to finish his half marathons in two hours or maybe even one hour and 45 minutes. He doesn't listen to music when he runs, but thinks bands playing along the course might be inspiring. Like all runners, he strives to be mindful yet relaxed, pushing a pace without overdoing it. He knows when he's in his comfort zone. "It's kind of like a blank feeling," he says. "It's like, 'Hey, I just ran all this way and didn't even realize it.'" Couto isn't worried about crowds or noise at Sunday's race. He runs up and down the Ringling bridge all the time. He's done 13-mile practice runs. "I'm excited," he says. "Not nervous." ___ Information from: Sarasota (Fla.)

Although the magazine refers to the area as Fayetteville, the statistics and description are for the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers metropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Benton, Madison and Washington counties in Arkansas and McDonald County in Missouri. The metropolitan statistical area also includes Bentonville, home to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. "When you look at that thing, it's really for the metropolitan area, but I always like it when they highlight my city," Fayetteville Mayor Lioneld Jordan said. "This city is the southern anchor of that region. I get together with the mayors of the region and we all work together well." Jordan said Northwest Arkansas ranked high in quality of life, education, cultural arts and a "welcoming spirit." He also cited low unemployment and an environment that inspires entrepreneurs. In its emailed newsletter, the Walton Family Foundation cited the region's "cultural, recreational and economic assets" regarding the ranking. "The region's expanding green space, parks and trails, its first-class performing arts center and active local food movement all helped Northwest Arkansas stand out," according to the foundation, which is based in Bentonville. Steve Clark, president of the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce, said the magazine's rankings get people all over the country talking about Northwest Arkansas. "When you look at those rankings, one of the reasons we get up there at a pretty high rate is new jobs we are creating and the cost of living," he said. Clark said he doesn't believe growth will ruin Fayetteville's reputation as a funky place with its share of artists, musicians and bohemian folk. "Keep Fayetteville Funky" bumper stickers are common around town. Clark said the University of Arkansas helps Fayetteville stay funky. "Every 12 months, we bring 5,000 new faces into Fayetteville," Clark said. "Those 5,000 faces come from all parts of the nation and the world, so they bring some funky with them when they come." Clark cited the number of scooters in Fayetteville as evidence of continuing funkiness. "Economic development in the 21st century is about talent and sense of place," Clark said. "Every day, it gets easier for that talent to live anywhere in the world." According to the report released Tuesday, Northwest Arkansas ranked No. 5 on the list this year and No. 3 last year, when it was bested only by Denver at No. 1 and Austin at No. 2. Austin and Denver swapped spots on this year's list, with Austin at No. 1. San Jose, Calif., and Washington, D.C., leap-frogged Fayetteville this year, with San Jose jumping from No. 10 to No. 3 and Washington going from No. 8 in 2016 to No. 4. Little Rock ranked No. 38 in this year's list. Other nearby Southern cities included Jackson, Miss., at No. 91, Memphis at No. 93 and New Orleans at No. 95. To the west of Arkansas, Dallas ranked No. 15 and Tulsa came in at No. 59. Heading north, Kansas City, Mo., ranked No. 48 and St. Louis ranked No. 65. The nation's largest cities didn't fare so well. New York City was ranked No. 80, Los Angeles No. 88 and Chicago No. 83. Fayetteville ranked lower in desirability than New York City, Los Angeles or Chicago but higher in quality of life, value and net migration. In the of "job market" category, Northwest Arkansas was behind New York City but ahead of Los Angeles and Chicago. Fayetteville was starkly different from those cities when it came to real estate prices. In Northwest Arkansas, the average annual salary is $43,570 and the median home price is $182,508, according to U.S. News. In Los Angeles, the average annual salary is $51,766 and the median home price is $487,716. The unemployment rate in Northwest Arkansas is 2.9 percent, compared with 5.2 percent in Los Angeles, according to the U.S. News article. Coming in at No. 6 overall was Seattle, which prompted this headline on a post on the Seattle Times' Facebook page: "Fayetteville, Ark. beat out Seattle on a list of the best places to live in the U.S. Fayetteville? Arkansas? Really?" That post, and the attached article by Evan Bush, the Seattle Times enterprise producer, attracted 743 comments, mostly from Arkansans defending Fayetteville. "Before expressing snarky incredulity, you should actually visit Fayetteville and see for yourself why it actually beat out Seattle," wrote Bill Schreckhise, an associate professor of political science at the university in Fayetteville who has three degrees from Washington State University in Pullman. "We moved to Fayetteville from Seattle about 10 years ago," wrote Chris Foley, who now lives in Tulsa. "Seattle is certainly bigger and has all that you'd hope from a major city. Fayetteville is no slouch though. Quality of life? Seattle doesn't begin to compare. Get off the coast and stretch your legs a little. You'll obviously be surprised by what you'll find." Bush said he didn't write the headline on the Facebook post. "I wasn't involved with the Facebook posting," he said. "I think it was intended to be good-humored and good-natured, but I think people were a little rankled." Seattle ranked No. 7 last year, behind Fayetteville at No. 3. Seattle has an average annual salary of $59,060 and a median home price of $359,693, according to this year's ranking. According to U.S. News, it rains considerably more in Fayetteville than Seattle -- 47.9 inches per year vs. 37.5 inches. But it rains about 150 days out of the year in Seattle, compared to 100 in Fayetteville. The metropolitan areas included in the rankings were evaluated using data from sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI, the Department of Labor and U.S. News' own internal resources, according to the website, realestate.usnews.com. The data were categorized into the five indexes and then evaluated using a methodology determined by Americans' preferences, according to the website. The indexes and weight given to those indexes were: quality of life, 30 percent; value, 25 percent; job market, 20 percent; desirability, 15 percent, and net migration, 10 percent.

 'What the president says, I have money riding on': The ripple effects of Trump's import-tax plan Christopher Woody Feb. 8, 2017, 8:33 AM 4,141 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Fiat 124 Spider Elaborazione Abarth. William Fierman When Jerry Phillips bought his business in 2009, the imports that sustained his sales mostly came from Europe. As a dealer in parts for vintage Alfa Romeo and Fiat automobiles, most of the parts sold by Phillips' company in Fort Worth, Texas, were going into cars from Italy. Phillips found, however, the parts didn't necessarily have the same origins as the cars they were paired with. "I discovered when I purchased the business that all the parts that we were buying from Europe, lo and behold, they were sourcing from overseas themselves, from Asia, so we began to source from Asia as well," Phillips told Business Insider. "We import parts from around the world, and we ship parts out every day around the world," he said. "We buy from the EU. We buy from Turkey. We buy from South America. We buy from China. We buy from a couple of other Asian nations. We buy from around the world." Phillips' company, which employs only five people, is one of many American small businesses — that is, wholesale or retail trade firms with 250 or fewer employees — that relies heavily on imports. More than 95% of US importers are firms of that size, according to Census data cited by The Wall Street Journal. The Trump administration has floated a 20% tax on imports as one possible way to pay for the wall the president wants to build on the US-Mexico border, estimated to cost $12 billion to $15 billion. (Trump's embrace of the border adjustment tax would appear to be a reversal of his stance on it from earlier in January.) President Donald Trump meets with, from left, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, and GM CEO Mary Barra at the first meeting of his Strategic and Policy Forum on February 3, 2017. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images While Trump's team first mentioned the 20% tax in relation to Mexican imports, Republican leadership has said it aligned with their boarder tax-reform plans, specifically the implementation of a border adjustment tax that would apply to all countries. Such a tax would only apply to goods imported to and sold in the US, and companies would only be able to deduct their local costs. Revenue generated by the new tax scheme would supposedly fund a reduction in the corporate tax rate, from 35% to 20%. Such a tax would have pronounced effects on Texas, which has a trade surplus with Mexico and through which flows 33% of Mexico's imports to the US. "Texas' number one trading partner by far is Mexico, and imposing a 20% tax on Mexican imports to fund a border wall would hurt the Texas economy," Texas Association of Business President Chris Wallace said at the end of January. "This proposal could mean a loss of jobs and a hit to state tax revenues." "Mexico doesn't pay for the wall," Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told Bloomberg in late January. "American consumers who shop at places that import, like Wal-mart and Target, pay for the wall ..." David McNew/Getty Images "I can easily see that businesses like ours would need to raise prices anywhere from 20% to 30% to cover these changes in the rules," Phillips told Business Insider, saying his company had a major presence in what he admitted was a "teeny, tiny market." "And my customers are very price conscious," he added. "It would be very difficult for us to continue to sell at the volume we are with a 20% to 30% price increase." With customers less willing to buy his goods, Phillips said, businesses down the line, like repair shops, would in turn see less business and employ fewer people. Concerns about barriers to imports are not limited to Texas businesses or to imports from Mexico. While large retailers like Walmart have more leverage to negotiate deals or to shop around for suppliers, smaller US companies would be hamstrung, unable to maintain current prices while selling higher-priced imports and unable to afford domestically manufactured goods. Mike Segar/Reuters Richard Woldenberg, chief executive of Learning Resources, a Illinois-based company with about 150 workers selling plastic educational toys sourced mostly from China, told The Journal that even with a lower corporate tax rate, the border adjustment tax would drive his tax bill up by four or five times, which would require him to hike prices and then see sales shrink. Jennifer Arenson, whose business, Global Sourcing Connection, employs 26 people and supplies uniforms and promotional items to Fortune 1000 companies, told The Journal that for a company the size of hers, running its own manufacturing operation "absolutely is not a realistic option." Arguments in favor of the tax are that it would benefit firms that are exporters or those that don't import goods. Some small businesses may in fact become more competitive in this scenario. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that it would generate $1.1 trillion in revenue over 10 years, and, among other things, it would disincentivize offshoring of profits and jobs. Other advocates have said the dollar would rise in value, offsetting the impact of the tax on US businesses. If that adjustment doesn't come to fruition, companies big and small would be hit with higher prices for imports. "We keep our pricing stable, even when we, say, have to pay a little more for a product because of a fluctuation in the exchange rate that's not in our favor," Phillips said. "But, if we go to an import tax, that's going to be seen as a permanent change, not a fluctuation." "If it's permanent, we're going to move prices upward," he added. "There's just no question." David Ramos/Getty Images More broadly, the negative impact of a tax on imports may outstrip the benefits reaped. "From a macro perspective, from a broad tax perspective, the amount of revenue you're going to get is very low, the amount of distortions you're going to create is very high, the amount of trouble you're going to create for the US and the world economy is very large, and the distributional effects are not trivial," Adam Posen, a former policymaker at the Bank of England and the president of Peterson Institute for International Economics, said at a conference this month. The cost would be "actually very harmful," Posen added. Shoppers from Mexico and the US make their way down El Paso Street, November 10, 2006, in downtown El Paso, Texas. (AP Photo/Victor Calzada) The possible broader international blowback from such an import policy — disturbed relations with major trading partners like China and Mexico, potential action against US exporters by the World Trade Organization, and retaliatory tariffs — would redound on the US economy as well. Moreover, Phillips told Business Insider, with a global supply chain, good business relations are about more than just economics. "There are some parts I'll be buying from Turkey in the next couple of weeks, and it's a pretty big purchase for my small company," he said. "Turkey is a Muslim country, and we've instituted these travel restrictions ... on a number of Muslim countries, and the folks in Turkey may not be too happy about that." "I need to have a good rapport with my Turkish supplier. They need to trust me, and I need to trust them," Phillips added, chuckling. "What the president says I have money riding on."

In this June 19, 2016, file photo, Coastal Carolina pitcher Andrew Beckwith (41), who pitched a complete game, is surrounded by celebrating teammates following an NCAA men's College World Series baseball game against Florida in Omaha, Neb. Coming off its surprise national championship in its first appearance at the College World Series, Coastal Carolina enters 2017 with a mostly new lineup but the same high expectations. They return national wins leader Andrew Beckwith. (Nati Harnik / Associated Press) By Eric Olson Associated Press Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Related topics Fear the Frog: TCU pegged as college baseball’s team to beat 10 players to watch in college baseball in 2017 ANDREW BECKWITH, Coastal Carolina, Sr., RHP: Led nation in wins with 15-1 record and was Most Outstanding Player in College World Series. Moved from bullpen to starter’s role second half of season and finished with 1.85 ERA. At CWS had two complete games in three starts and 0.76 ERA. LUKEN BAKER, TCU, So., IF: Hit seven of team-leading 11 homers in postseason. The 6-foot-4, 265-pounder led Big 12 with .379 batting average, 94 hits, 59 runs and 62 RBIs. Was 3-1 with 1.70 ERA before injuring arm in April. Expected to be first baseman and designated hitter and won’t pitch this season. SETH BEER, Clemson, So., IF: Became first freshman to win the Dick Howser Trophy as national player of the year. First baseman also was Golden Spikes Award finalist. ACC player of the year batted .369 with 13 doubles, 18 homers, 70 RBIs and had a .700 slugging percentage. J.B. BUKAUSKAS, North Carolina, Jr., RHP: Went 7-2 with 3.10 ERA, including 6-2 with 2.45 ERA in 10 ACC starts. Ranked third in nation with 12.8 strikeouts per nine innings. Allowed one unearned run in 21 2/3 innings on U.S. college national team last summer. CARLOS CORTES, South Carolina, Fr., OF/DH: One of the top high school players in Florida (Oviedo) last season. The 5-7, 195-pounder is ambidextrous, throwing with right hand when playing infield and with left hand when playing outfield. COLTON EASTMAN, Cal State Fullerton, So., RHP: Big West freshman of the year heads a strong group of starters for Titans. Went 8-3 with 2.24 ERA and struck out a freshman school record-tying 100 in 100 2/3 innings. ALEX FAEDO, Florida, Jr. RHP: Went 13-3 with 3.18 ERA in 17 starts, including 7-1 in SEC play. His 133 strikeouts in 104 2/3 innings were most by a Florida pitcher in 18 years. Had five 10-plus strikeout games. JEREN KENDALL, Vanderbilt, Jr., OF: No. 1 college player, and No. 2 overall, on MLB.com’s list of top 50 draft prospects. Led team with .332 batting average, 63 runs and 59 RBIs. Tied school record with eight triples and hit career-high nine homers. NICK MADRIGAL, Oregon State, So., IF: Pac-12 freshman of the year. The 5-7, 161-pounder batted .333 with 11 doubles, five triples, one homer and 29 RBIs. Played second base in 2016 but goes into week of opener competing for SS job. BRENDAN McKAY, Louisville, Jr. IF /LHP: The first baseman-pitcher is two-time winner of John Olerud Two-Way Player of the Year. Lefty was 12-4 with 2.30 ERA and 128 strikeouts in 17 starts. Batted .333 with six home runs, 19 doubles and 41 RBIs. OMAHA, Neb. – Eight months later, Coastal Carolina’s surprise run to the national championship in its first College World Series appearance still resonates in eastern South Carolina. “It not only has changed our program, it’s changed our university,” coach Gary Gilmore said. “I’ve been here 21 years, and at no time have I seen groups of people so proud to wear our gear, put our sticker on their car. You go to Wal-Mart and there are 10 or 12 people walking around with our gear on where in the past it’s been all Clemson and South Carolina stuff.” All those new fans, along with the old ones, want to know what the Chanticleers will do for an encore. Coastal Carolina led the nation with 96 home runs last season, and players accounting for 79 of them are gone. Only three everyday players are back, but the weekend rotation returns, including CWS Most Outstanding Player Andrew Beckwith. So does star reliever Bobby Holmes. “The expectations are every bit equal to last year,” Gilmore said. “The way we have to go about it may be a little bit different as far as how we put our team together and what the team’s skill sets allow us to do. The goal is the same. It’s to get back to Omaha. The one thing I did find out is that if you get there, anything can happen.” Seth Lancaster, who missed the CWS after getting hurt in super regionals, moves from second base to third. He hit seven home runs, most of any returning player. “We’re not going to hit 108 home runs,” Gilmore said, “but I think we’ll hit more than people give us credit for.” The Chanticleers plan to be more aggressive on the bases. Billy Cooke is back after stealing a team-leading 27 bases. The Chanticleers finished with 112, and Gilmore said this team should be capable of 150. Beckwith (15-1, 1.85 ERA) led the nation in wins, threw two complete games in the CWS and was the winner in the title-clinching victory against Arizona. Alex Cunningham (10-4, 3.62) and Jason Bilous (3-1, 4.43) are the other weekend starters. Holmes (7-2, 4.20) is the bullpen ace. Newcomers Wood Myers at second base, Jordan Gore at shortstop and Cory Wood in left field will join the lineup. Myers played at a junior college last season after spending two years at North Carolina, Gore transferred from South Carolina and Wood was one of the top high school players in North Carolina last year. The Chanticleers will play their first season in the Sun Belt Conference after moving from the Big South. “We can’t come out and play passive and say, `Hey, we did this last year so it’s going to be given to us,’ “ Beckwith said. “Everyone is going to (target) us. I think the Sun Belt is a little bit better competition, and our guys need to embrace it.” Some things to know: New coaches There are 30 new head coaches in Division I. Most notable are David Pierce at Texas, Greg Goff at Alabama, Steve Bieser at Missouri, Nick Mingione at Kentucky, Travis Jewett at Tulane, Lane Burroughs at Louisiana Tech, Greg Lovelady at UCF and Mark Wasikowski at Purdue. Marquess’ finale Mark Marquess will retire after this season, his 41st at Stanford. He has 1,585 career wins, and his team is picked second behind Oregon State in the Pac-12. Marquess won national titles in 1987-88 and has led the Cardinal to the CWS 14 times, most recently in 2008. Active wins leader Mike Martin, entering his 38th season at Florida State, takes over for Augie Garrido as the active career wins leader. Martin has 1,898. Garrido had an all-time record of 1,975 in 48 seasons. He coached the past 20 at Texas before being reassigned as special assistant to the athletic director last May. More offense The 2016 team average of 0.61 home runs per game was highest since 2010, team scoring of 5.57 runs a game was highest since 2011 and the team batting average of .275 was highest since 2012. The national fielding percentage of .967 was the best since at least 1970.

Pleasant man, already in prison, charged with credit card theft Joe Napsha | Thursday, Feb. 9, 2017, 11:55 p.m. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. A Mt. Pleasant man already in the Fayette County Prison is charged with stealing a Hunker man's wallet and using his credit cards to rack up $540 in purchases at area stores, police said Thursday. Matthew G. Beers, 22, allegedly confessed to the Dec. 30 theft of the wallet and flintlock muzzle loader rifle and several other incidents, state police said. Beers allegedly used the victim's credit card to make purchases at the GetGo and Wal-Mart in East Huntingdon, and the Sheetz in Scottdale. Beers was charged before East Huntingdon District Judge Charles Moore with three counts of unauthorized use of an access device card, two counts of theft from a vehicle and single counts of receiving stolen property and possession of an access device counterfeit or altered. Beers also was arrested Jan. 3 by state police at Uniontown and accused of crashing two stolen vehicles and attempting to steal a third. One of the vehicles smashed into a house on Pleasant Valley Road in Bullskin Township. Beers, who allegedly stole one vehicle in Connellsville, was arrested at a nearby Sheetz store. Police say he had a stolen gun. Beers is in Fayette County Prison in lieu of $75,000 bond on numerous charges, including burglary, theft, receiving stolen property, illegal possession of firearms, flight to avoid apprehension, as well as possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia charges.

Arkansas will be the latest state where the e-commerce giant has relented after years of resisting effort to collect taxes in states where it doesn’t have a physical presence. Amazon spokeswoman Jill Kerr said the company will begin collecting the sales tax on March 1. The decision comes days after lawmakers advanced separate efforts to force Amazon to begin collecting sales taxes. A Senate-backed proposal would require Amazon and similar out-of-state companies to begin collecting sales taxes. A state House-backed measure would require Amazon and similar companies to tell Arkansas customers they owe the state sales tax and provide a list to finance officials of purchases made by state residents. The first sales taxes collected by Amazon will be paid to the state in April. State finance officials declined to comment on Amazon’s decision or the expected revenue from the move, citing a state law that bars them from commenting on the specific status of taxpayers. Republican state Sen. Jake Files, who proposed the Senate-backed bill, has estimated it could bring in between $32 million and $100 million a year. Files said his proposal is still needed to recover funds from other out-of-state companies. “I think it’s a good move for fairness, but it doesn’t complete the fairness circle,” Files said. Files’ measure is modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, where officials last month said Amazon agreed to begin collecting sales taxes. The state House bill is modeled after a Colorado law that the U.S. Supreme Court let stand last year. The proposals had the backing of Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, but faced opposition from conservative groups such as Americans for Tax Reform. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon has historically relied on another high court ruling that predates the era of online shopping. That 1992 decision bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don’t have a physical presence in the state. But the company has shifted recently, with Amazon this winter collecting sales taxes in at least 10 states where it hadn’t previously. Neighboring Oklahoma announced last week that Amazon would begin collecting sales taxes there starting next month. Amazon currently collects sales taxes in 38 states and the District of Columbia, according to the company’s website. Prior to Friday’s announcement, Amazon collected or was preparing to collect sales taxes in every state bordering Arkansas. The decision could raise hopes about Arkansas’ finances. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told several state agencies last week to prepare for possible budget cuts after finance officials said the state’s revenue was $57 million below forecast. Hutchinson, a Republican, repeated his desire Friday that any additional revenue from online sales to go toward further cutting Arkansas’ income tax. Hutchinson last month signed into law a measure cutting the state’s income tax by $50 million and forming a task force to recommend further cuts before the 2019 legislative session. “This strengthened revenue stream will allow us to continue to make progress in cutting the income tax rate, making Arkansas more competitive with our surrounding states, and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking Arkansans,” he said in a statement.

The struggling retail chain is looking for ways to cut costs, the company said Friday. Comments aAFont Size NEW YORK -- Sears Holdings Corp. announced Friday that it will take measures to cut costs by at least $1 billion a year, just weeks after it said it would close 150 stores. The company, which also owns Kmart, also said it was adding $140 million in liquidity by reworking its debt, giving the company more breathing room. The Hoffman Estates, Ill., retailer, which has been losing money for years, also said comparable-store sales during the Christmas shopping season weren't as bad as industry analysts had believed them to be. Shares of Sears Holding Corp., which are down 40 percent this year, soared 30 percent at Friday's opening bell. The shares rose $1.42, or 26 percent, to close Friday at $6.96. Sears announced last month the closing of 150 of its 1,500 stores. It did not announce new store closures Friday, but said it would "actively manage our real estate portfolio to identify additional opportunities." It may also sell two of its brands -- Kenmore appliances and DieHard car batteries -- after striking a deal last month to sell its popular tool brand Craftsman. Sears has been working to streamline its organization structure, but the company did not release any details about its new effort to cut costs. Sears had about 178,000 employees in the U.S. last year. From November to January, Sears expects sales to have fallen 10.3 percent at its stores. That's better than the drop of 13.1 percent that Wall Street had expected, according to FactSet. "We believe the actions outlined today will reduce our overall cash funding requirements and ensure that Sears Holdings becomes a more agile and competitive retailer with a clear path toward profitability," Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Edward Lampert said in a company release. Lampert, whose hedge fund has forwarded millions of dollars to keep Sears afloat, has long pledged to turn the company's fortunes around and that the retailer would find ways capitalize on its best-known brands, as well as its vast real estate holdings. Lampert, a billionaire hedge fund manager, combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. But the retail landscape has changed since then. While Amazon.com had been up and running for almost a decade at that time, the disruption in retail went into full force around the time of the recession a few years later. But Sears' troubles reach deeper than that, having to compete on appliance sales with Home Depot and to match the cut-rate prices at discount chains such as Wal-Mart. And old rivals have made it tougher. J.C. Penney reintroduced major appliances on to its floors more than 30 years after abandoning the sale of refrigerators and stoves. Moody's Investors Service cut Sears' credit rating deeper into junk territory last month, citing large operating losses and uncertainty about whether Sears can get back to break-even. As part of the turnaround effort, Sears will analyze data to improve its product selection. It also will focus on the most profitable items, the company said. Lampert's bid to retool Sears has hinged on a rewards program called Shop Your Way, which is designed to unify Sears stores and e-commerce stores. "We are initiating a fundamental restructuring of our operations," Lampert said in a statement. "We plan to reduce our corporate overhead, more closely integrate our Sears and Kmart operations and improve our merchandising, supply chain and inventory management."

News Journal Published 11:06 p.m. ET Feb. 10, 2017 | Updated 3 hours ago CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The alleged week-long killing spree of William "Billy" Boyette Jr. and Mary Craig Rice comes to an end in West Point, Georgia. Chemarryn Thornton/cthornton@pnj.com Mary Rice (Photo: Special to the News Journal) 820 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE PENSACOLA, Fla. — Mary Craig Rice texted family members and friends in the hours after a double homicide at a hotel in Milton, reassuring them she was OK and out of town. In truth, Rice was in the Pensacola area, where she was allegedly captured on video buying ammunition and other supplies authorities  claim were used while on an an eight-day killing spree with William Boyette. Authorities are still parsing out Rice's role in the slayings, but evidence is reportedly mounting that she was active participant rather than an innocent bystander. Family members filed a missing-person report with the Santa Rosa Sheriff's Office on Feb. 3, three days after Jacqueline Jeanette Moore and Alicia Ann Greer were killed in a double homicide in which Rice has since been charged as an accessory. Numerous friends contacted Rice’s mother and brother the day after the Jan. 31 killing at the Emerald Sands Inn fearing that Rice may have been one of the victims of that attack. Friends told the family Rice was with Boyette, and if she was not one of the victims, they suspected she was in danger. USA TODAY Suspect in murders of four women kills himself in Georgia USA TODAY Suspect in multistate killing spree returns to Florida jail Authorities released Rice's name on Feb. 4 as a missing person possibly in danger, but by Feb. 6, they were identifying her as a suspect in two slayings that followed. Sheriff’s office records show that Boyette had been living with Rice in the days prior to the first slayings. Boyette was involved at the same time with Greer and believed to also be sharing a home with her as well. Less than two weeks before Greer was killed, she was treated at a local hospital after she was brutally beaten by Boyette. After she was released, she returned home for a bit and eventually went to the Milton hotel. Police haven't detailed the nature of their relationship after the abuse. On Jan. 31, Greer and another woman were gunned down inside that Milton hotel, and Rice's whereabouts were unknown. The missing-person report states that family and friends were unable to contact Rice in the days prior to filing the report, which was unusual. Mary’s mother said the last text message she received from her daughter, dated Feb. 1 at 2:18 p.m., said she was OK and would return by Feb. 3. Rice’s mom continued to send text messages, according to the records, but they went unanswered.

The two men have not been publicly identified. Reports show that Boyette’s mother, whose name hasn't been released by sheriff’s office, had rented a black Ford Escape on Jan. 30, the day before her son is believed to have killed Greer and Moore, in one of the victims’ names. Sheriff’s office information officer Rich Aloy said no charges have been filed against the mother. The rented car was found in a parking lot Feb. 3, hours after the slaying of Peggy Broz in Lillian, Ala. Authorities say Boyette and Rice followed Broz home from her work in Escambia County to her Alabama home in the rented Ford before shooting Broz in the front yard and stealing her white Chrysler. Surveillance footage shows a woman getting out of the black Ford in a parking lot and into Broz's Chrysler on Feb. 3 , connecting the two vehicles to each other in the investigation.

Inside they found receipts from a Walmart in Crestview and a GNC receipt with the name of Mary Rice. Police viewed that Walmart’s surveillance footage and could see Rice buying ammunition, hand warmers and a sleeping bag two days prior. On Feb. 5, Escambia County officials saw the pair on game-camera footage in a wooded area near where kill Kayla Crocker, 28, was allegedly killed the next day. Crocker was shot in her Beulah home on Feb. 6. She was taken to hospital but died of her injuries Feb. 7. Crocker’s white Chevrolet Cobalt was stolen. That vehicle was eventually spotted by an anonymous caller in West Point, Ga., around 2:20 p.m. Tuesday. That caller had seen the vehicle at a nearby convenience store and recognized it from news stories as the one that Boyette and Rice were last known to be in possession of, according to records from the Troup County, Ga., Sheriff’s Office. That anonymous caller followed the pair to the West Point Motel, according to the report, and police surrounded the area soon after in a standoff. Rice surrendered, but Boyette shot himself inside the motel. Rice was transported to the Santa Rosa County Jail on Wednesday to face a charge of accessory after the fact to capital murder for her alleged role in the Milton double homicide. She was given a $750,000 bond Thursday afternoon but is still on a hold in Escambia County for her first-degree murder charge in Crocker’s death. Baldwin County, Ala., also has filed a capital murder charge against Rice in Broz’s killing. Rice is set for arraignment March 2, but has filed an arraignment waiver, which means a written not guilty plea will be entered on her behalf at that date.

Why do they feel that we are a second-rate city simply because we don’t have an NFL team to fawn over? Why isn’t it good enough that we are the most unique and dynamic metropolitan area in the country? Unlike other areas, our city is the tourist destination. “It’s Vegas, baby!” doesn’t translate to Orlando, New York or San Diego. In fact, the only city in the country that comes close is New Orleans. Why do we have to bend over backward for the NFL? It seems that they are the ones with the problem. Other cities have learned that the astronomical expense of public funding for the economic equivalent of a Walmart just doesn’t work long term. Also, why is it that no one is taking personal offense to the stance of the NFL when it comes to gaming? Why aren’t they demanding that, if needed, local ownership be allowed? Our local community people aren’t good enough to have any hint of ownership in a team in the NFL even though they operate in a legal, regulated, taxed and profitable business? What hypocrisy.

News Border & Baja California Tijuana councilman under spotlight in money laundering case Luis Torres, center, in San Diego Superior Court on Thursday with his attorney, Anthony Colombo, Jr. Ana Gomez/Frontera Tijuana councilman Luis Torres, seated at center, in San Diego Superior Court on Thursday with his attorney, Anthony Colombo, Jr. Tijuana councilman Luis Torres, seated at center, in San Diego Superior Court on Thursday with his attorney, Anthony Colombo, Jr. (Ana Gomez/Frontera) Sandra DibbleContact Reporter The case of a Tijuana city councilman facing money laundering charges in San Diego was back in court this past week — but with 12 defendants and more than 30,000 pages of evidence, resolution could be months away. Luis Torres Santillán, who has entered a not guilty plea, was one of eight suspects before San Diego Superior Court Judge Runston Maino during a brief downtown hearing on Thursday afternoon. The judge agreed to continue the hearing on March 22, allowing defense attorneys additional time to review the wiretap transcripts, financial records and other material filed by the prosecution. Well-connected and the member of a prominent Tijuana family, the 37-year-old businessman may not seem a likely suspect for money laundering. But following an investigation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations, Torres was arrested on Dec. 16, and charged with ten counts of money laundering by the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office. Torres, who is on leave from the Tijuana City Council, wore a business suit to court Thursday, in contrast with his two previous hearings, in December and early January, when he was still in custody and wearing an inmate’s uniform. As they have for all the audiences, family members of Torres and other defendants filled the rows of the courtroom. Since posting $300,000 bail last month, Torres has been free to cross the border, said his San Diego attorney, Anthony Colombo, Jr. “There’s been no restrictions placed on his business activities in the United States.” Torres is named in a complaint that is one of three linked money laundering cases in San Diego Superior Court with a total of 21 defendants. Early this month, three defendants in one of the two other cases entered guilty pleas and are set for sentencing on March 7, according to the District Attorney’s Office. John Dunn, the deputy district attorney who is prosecuting Torres’ case, said that Torres was a client of a Tijuana-based operation that laundered more than $10 million between October 2014 and July 2016. Torres’ co-defendants in the case include David Javier Espinoza, 48, and his wife, Claudia Ramírez, 47, described by Dunn as leaders of the organization that operated out of their family’s money exchange business in Tijuana, Centro Cambiario Olymar, S.A. de C.V.  “U.S.currency would be collected there, and then smuggled across the border,” Dunn said. After being deposited into U.S. bank accounts, the funds were “transferred almost immediately back down to Mexican banks.” Between July 2015 and July 2016, their organization made 18 deposits on behalf of Torres totaling about $675,000, Dunn said. Several of the suspects are connected through long-term friendships and family ties. One the defendants is the Espinozas’ 20-year-old son, David Alejandro. Another is a close family friend of the Espinoza’s, Karla Escalante, 47, and her 22-year-old son, Jorge Carlos Escalante. While four of the 12 suspects remain at large. All but one of the eight suspects taken into custody in December have posted bail, and all eight have entered not guilty pleas. Like Torres, several have dual U.S.-Mexican citizenship. “I do not believe from any of the evidence that I’ve reviewed that he’s engaged in any of the crimes that he’s accused of,” Torres’  San Diego attorney, Anthony Colombo, Jr., said following Thursday’s court hearing. Peter Blair, an attorney representing Karla Escalante, said his client was asked by the Espinozas to deposit funds on their behalf. “She thought it was a legitimate business-related situation and the Espinozas told her everything was fine,” said Blair. “We’ve seen nothing that would tie my client to any criminal activity whatsoever.” Torres joined the Tijuana City Council on Dec. 1 as part of a National Action Party group connected to Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastélum. He has for several years been general manager of Productos Diamond. Founded by Torres’ grandfather, the Tijuana company imports items such as beans, lentils, and rice from suppliers in the United States, Canada and China and distributes them in Mexico through customers that include the Calimax supermarket chain, Smart & Final, Walmart and other retail stores. Dunn, the prosecutor, has offered few details about his case, saying he is barred from talking about matters that have not been discussed in open court. But a court document filed on Torres’ behalf sheds some light on the case. According to the document, the District Attorney’s Office is alleging that that Torres opened a shell company in San Diego, Towers Trading and Transport, Inc., whose U.S. bank accounts were used to to launder funds “that were the proceeds of drug trafficking.”  Towers Trading and Transport was incorporated about a decade ago to facilitate payment of grain suppliers in the United States and Canada, as banking reforms in Mexico “made banking difficult for legitimate businesses in Mexico,” the defense documented states. Funds deposited into Towers Trading and Transport accounts were “legitimately earned from the sale of grains in  Mexico and then used to purchase more grain,” it says. According to Torres’ account of events, two years ago, “due to a strong dollar and weakened peso,” Torres’ Tijuana company, Productos Diamond, contracted with Centro Cambiario Olymar because it was “offering a much better exchange rate than the banks,” the defense document states. The agreement was that Productos Diamond would provide checks in pesos to the money exchange house “earned from the sale of grain in Mexico,” according to the defense. Centro Cambiario Olymar’s responsibility “was then to convert the pesos into dollars and legally import the dollars into the United States to be deposited into Towers Trading and Transport’s United States bank accounts,” the document states. David Javier Espinoza’s attorney, Roland Haddad, did not return phone calls seeking comment on the case.    sandra.dibble@sduniontribune.com @sandradibble   Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The San Diego Union-Tribune Trials and Arbitration US Politics Latest Most Popular Today's Paper Jobs Homes Cars Contact Us 60°

Roth: Florida taxes oranges? By: Jim Roth Guest Columnist February 10, 2017 0 Jim Roth If you were to read a headline that the state of Florida was looking to add a 25-percent tax to the price of oranges, you might scratch your head and wonder why they would intentionally hurt one of their largest industries. In Florida, agriculture is second only to tourism. Such was my reaction when Oklahoma state leaders unveiled an idea this past week to tax their way out of a recurring budget shortfall dilemma by proposing a new tax on Oklahoma’s wind energy, thereby raising the cost of every single Oklahoman’s monthly utility bill. Wind energy accounted for roughly 20 percent of the state’s total electricity last year, so you can do the math about an increase to 20 percent of your electricity fuel bill. The proposed $5 per megawatt-hour of wind power generation amounts to an approximate 25-percent increase to the cost of wind power, which is now being developed and sold in Oklahoma at around $20 per Mwh. It’s also interesting to note that only one other state in America has a tax on wind production and Wyoming, where coal is king, has a $1-per-megawatt-hour tax, a whole one-fifth of Oklahoma’s proposed new tax rate. Oklahoma has enormous energy blessings in the form of natural gas, wind and oil. Recently, the U.S. Energy Information Administration updated its state rankings and has Oklahoma third in the country in natural gas production and fifth in crude oil production. Oklahoma is now also ranked third in wind power with 6,645 megawatts of wind capacity as of the end of 2016, just surpassing California and now trailing only Texas (20,321 MWs) and Iowa (6,917 MWs). It’s true what Oscar Hammerstein wrote about Oklahoma in our fabled state song, “…where the wind comes sweeping down the plain, and the wavin’ wheat can sure smell sweet,” yet we probably aren’t “doin’ fine” if we are so desperate to tax one of our leading industries, 25 percent to just make budget. There’s a better way, if you think there is a necessity to push new taxes on electricity generation. There’s an Oklahoma way. Develop a tax approach that makes pollution more expensive, not Oklahoma’s clean energy. And this is an approach being pitched nationally by a large group of prominent, conservative Republicans, who believe it’s time to tax carbon, a real villain, rather than American energy itself. Former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Schultz, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, business leaders like Rob Walton, former chairman on Wal-Mart, and many others were in D.C. this month meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and other leaders to detail their blueprint for a $40-per-metric-ton tax on carbon dioxide pollution, with the price escalating over time. And yet the policy would actually protect low-income Americans from higher energy bills, unlike Oklahoma’s proposed wind electricity tax. Under Baker’s proposal, the projected $200 billion to $300 billion in annual revenue from the carbon tax would be distributed to households, by quarterly checks, from the Social Security Administration. It is estimated that families of four would receive about $2,000 a year in payments to them, not from them. And through it all America would be transitioning, even more quickly to a cleaner energy economy and leading the world. Oklahoma could lead also by a similar approach, rather than hobbling one of its leading industries, with large investments in the state, by targeting wind. We should target negative aspects of human behavior; such is the justification for increasing cigarette taxes, right? An Oklahoma pollution tax would make winners out of our state’s cleaner-burning natural gas and wind industries, would drive greater production and demand for both and would in turn reduce health care costs to families and businesses by reducing harmful pollutants in our air. We would send less hard-earned Oklahoma money to Wyoming for imported coal, where we are buying their schoolbooks instead of our own. We would in turn incentivize Oklahoma’s energy future by creating a growing market, not a shrinking one. “Florida taxes fattening fried potatoes” makes more sense to me than “Oklahoma taxes its own wind.” Jim Roth, a former Oklahoma corporation commissioner, is an attorney with Phillips Murrah P.C. in Oklahoma City, where his practice focuses on clean, green energy for Oklahoma.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next INDEPENDENCE, Mo - It’s business as usual at the Independence McDonald’s where one of its managers says he got pesticide poisoning and is concerned he may not be the only one. On Wednesday at 11 p.m. William Wayman showed up for his overnight shift as a manager at the McDonald’s on 23rd and Sterling. When Wayman walked in, he said he saw the manager before him set up three bug bombs. "I had seen him setting up the foggers and after he set up the foggers he just immediately walked out the door and left,” Wayman said. According to him, the bug bombs were placed by the ice cream machine, another by a trash can near the the entrance and a third by the men’s bathroom. "I ended up shutting the store down at 11:30 after I contacted poison control and a couple of other 24 hour restaurants to see you what they thought about the situation and they advised me that it's a health code violations and that I need to shut down immediately,” Wayman said. But by then it was too late for him. “I'd seen it in the air with me being up front where is that it's very burning my eyes and I started crying,” Wayman said. Wayman said he threw away cups, plastic ware, straws and napkins that were exposed to the bug bombs before reopening before breakfast. He went to the hospital where doctors told him he had pesticide poisoning. Wayman filed a complaint with the Independence Health Department. "Anytime we receive a complaint what we do is we start the case we go out to our inspector to look for any violations that they can observe we try to contact the complainant and try to get as much information as we can and follow up as appropriate,” Christina Heinen, the assistant health director for Independence, Missouri said.  41 Action News found this McDonald’s health inspection. Three were done in 2015  and one last year. None of them show a problem with pests. But Wayman said gnats are an issue. “Since I've been there they've had Ecolab out twice for our gnat problem and it seems not to of helped out at all so they took it upon themselves to buy foggers from Walmart or Dollar Tree or something and set them off themselves,” Wayman said.  In a statement from a McDonald's restaurant representative: "Our first and foremost concern is for the safety of our customers and employees. Upon awareness of this incident, we took immediate action. We are working closely with the employee and health department to address the situation and ensure that safety protocols are in place. We remain committed to serving the highest quality of food and maintaining our customer’s confidence and our employees who serve them. The restaurant was closed, no food was served and proper protocol for clean up was in place before opening."  Wayman said that wasn’t the case initially, which is why he posted this message on Facebook. “Just to make the community aware of exactly what kind of fast food establishment they're getting food from. That they're children are eating at the potential of customers. That I did serve in the 30 minutes that I did take orders. That they could have the poisoning themselves,” Wayman said.  41 Action News did ask the health department if any customers who visited the McDonald’s on Wednesday between 11 and 11:30 p.m. should be worried about any exposure but they refused to comment citing this is still an ongoing investigation.  Editor's Note: A previous version of this story attributed a statement to Trozzolo.

In this Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017, photo, a catch of fish is unloaded from a commercial fishing boat at Pier 38 in Honolulu. Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state laws for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who have been refused entry into the United States, The Associated Press has found. About 700 of these men are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. (AP Photo/Caleb Jones) HONOLULU – Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state law for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who were refused entry into the country, The Associated Press has found. About 700 of these men are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. They work without most basic labour protections just a few miles from Waikiki’s white sand beaches, catching premium tuna and swordfish sold at some of America’s most upscale grocery stores, hotels and restaurants. The AP found that under state law, these workers – who make up most of the crew in a fleet catching $110 million worth of seafood annually – may not be allowed to fish at all. A recent industry-sponsored assessment of crew members’ treatment and living conditions found no human trafficking, but raised concerns that workers could be vulnerable to exploitation and said they have little recourse about paying fees or incurring debt in order to hold their jobs. “There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay,” according to the report. In this unique fishing arrangement facilitated by both federal and state officials, Hawaii’s boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 to bring each crew member from impoverished Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations. The men aren’t allowed to arrive at Honolulu’s airport because they lack visas, so they are instead flown to other countries and put on U.S.-owned fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii. Before the men start working, they need a state commercial fishing license. In order to get it, Hawaii requires that they must be “lawfully admitted” to the U.S. Here’s the hitch: When they arrive, they are met at the dock by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who ban them from entering the country by stamping “refused” on their landing permits, which voids them. So instead of being “lawfully admitted,” they are now barred by law from setting foot on U.S. soil. “Try taking a check to your bank that says ‘void’ on it and telling them, ‘Oh, but they wrote the check to me,'” said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins, who advocates for the workers. Nonetheless, a written opinion by Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are “lawfully admitted.” U.S. Customs sees it differently. “NO. They cannot be admitted,” spokesman Frank Falcon wrote in an email, adding that the stamp means they can’t even enter the U.S. temporarily. In rare cases, including medical emergencies, Customs can parole the men to go ashore. Foreign crews on boats and aircraft, including cruise ship workers and flight attendants, fill out landing permits when they arrive in the U.S. Customs takes those applications and decides whether to allow each individual to temporarily enter the country. When landing permits are stamped refused, that serves as proof that authorities have been alerted that foreigners without visas are on arriving vessels or planes, and triggers an order for captains to detain them on board. Chin’s office did not respond to AP’s queries about the refusal stamp. However, Land and Natural Resources department spokesman Dan Dennison said in an email that the attorney general advised his agency to continue issuing fishing licenses to the foreign workers despite the fact that Customs says the men are not “lawfully admitted.” The Hawaii Longline Association, which represents boat owners, says the men are legally hired for legitimate work on the fleet’s 141 active vessels. And while the conditions and pay are often below U.S. standards, the jobs are typically better than the bleak opportunities the men have at home, mostly in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and the tiny Pacific island of Kiribati. Under federal law, U.S. citizens must make up 75 per cent of the crew on most American commercial fishing boats. An AP investigation last year revealed Hawaii’s fleet relies on a federal loophole allowing the foreign fishermen to work. In a hearing prompted by the AP report, Land and Natural Resources department administrator Bruce Anderson was asked why he issues commercial fishing licenses to foreign workers who can’t enter the state. He said the crewman’s landing permit “says in essence that the individual has the right to fish in U.S. waters but cannot step ashore.” He did not mention that all the permits were stamped “refused.” Democratic state Rep. Kaniela Ing, chairman of the Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs committee, has queried Chin and other state officials at length about why the men cannot leave their boats. Ing said state officials failed to disclose the refusal stamp to him when he asked to see the landing permits. “It always seemed paradoxical that the proof of lawful entry was a landing form, but the crew members weren’t allowed to land or leave the boat,” he said, after the AP told him about the stamp. “We just didn’t have the smoking gun evidence to point to why, and now we do.” Critics say the fishing licenses could be just one of several ways the state is breaking its own laws: – The lowest-paid fishermen have contracts promising $300 a month, well below the state’s wage minimums. The Labor Department says it doesn’t intervene because the workers fall under federal, not state, jurisdiction. But department head Linda Chu Takayama also said she’s awaiting further legal guidance. – Chin, the attorney general, said in his written opinion that employers in Hawaii typically cannot withhold wages, but some fishermen told the AP they are paid only after returning home when their one- or two-year contracts end. – Chin said telling consumers “that fish had been caught by local fishermen” may violate the state’s deceptive practice laws if misinformation likely affects their shopping choices. The Hawaii Seafood Council claims the catch is “produced by Hawaii’s hard-working fishermen.” Council Program Manager John Kaneko did not respond to the AP. Federal law also is in question: U.S. Customs requires captains to detain the men on board and hold their passports because they are banned from entering the country. That potentially goes against U.S. human-trafficking laws saying bosses who possess workers’ identification documents can face up to five years in prison. The foreign fishermen’s catch is sold everywhere from Costco to Sam’s Club and upscale restaurants across the U.S., including Trump International Hotel Waikiki. Whole Foods announced it would suspend buying seafood from the fleet after the AP’s initial report, while Costco says it is monitoring the situation. The Trump hotel and Wal-Mart, which owns Sam’s Club, did not provide an immediate response. The story also exposed dangerous, unsanitary conditions and at least two instances of human trafficking. It prompted new commitments from boat owners to protect the crew members’ welfare. After a follow-up briefing on Capitol Hill, several members of Congress expressed “grave concerns” about working conditions in a letter to the Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Hawaii Seafood Council’s survey of 207 fishermen identified a series of potential problems, particularly involving recruiting and payment of the foreign crew. Some fishermen had contracts requiring that part of their salaries or identification papers be withheld until they returned home. Others had signed agreements that said they had to pay for replacement workers if they broke their contracts, or faced $5,000 fines for absconding – equivalent to a year’s salary for some. However, the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains. All said they were being paid in cash, and none expressed concerns about forced labour or human trafficking. No one complained about access to food, but the report described one labour agent as saying that she had men on a boat who had not been paid for two months and that she bought groceries for fishermen at times when their boats ran out. The industry has implemented a new universal crew contract that requires owners to pay all recruiting fees and gives the fishermen their salaries within four days of landing. A draft Code of Conduct seeks to safeguard workers’ rights. But there are no wage minimums as initially promised by Hawaii Longline Association president Sean Martin. The Honolulu Fish Auction now does business only with boats whose workers have signed those agreements. Martin declined to be interviewed, but he and other industry leaders have condemned labour abuses. They have said the workers are happy to have the jobs and typically do not complain, with many renewing their contracts and even recruiting relatives. Still, little has changed, with foreign crews typically spending three weeks a month at sea, working up to 20 hours a day, usually for far less than American fishermen nationwide, who average $2,500 a month. Their situation has been widely accepted as legal. The AP investigation is part of an ongoing global look at labour abuses in the fishing industry, stretching from Southeast Asia to America’s own waters. In 2015, the AP reported on fishermen locked in a cage and others buried under fake names on the remote Indonesian island village of Benjina. Their catch was traced to the United States, leading to more than 2,000 slaves being freed. But thousands more remain trapped worldwide in a murky industry where work takes place far from shore and often without oversight. In Hawaii, most vessels dock at piers 17 and 38, which are guarded and patrolled, but some go as far as the West Coast. And, although technically not allowed, they do venture onto the piers briefly to socialize and use restrooms. Last year, Customs said six fishermen were deported after wandering away from their boats in Honolulu, some to visit friends on other vessels, others sneaking away for a drink. In 2010, two Indonesian fishermen who fled their boat in San Francisco alleging abuse were granted visas as victims of human trafficking and are now suing their former boat owner. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said agents checking out a number of leads related to possible human trafficking in the fleet have “identified instances where crew members were contending with less than ideal working conditions,” but found no situations meeting the legal threshold to bring criminal charges. Federal marine observers, who live with the men for weeks at a time at sea, said some fishermen have good working conditions while others are sometimes mistreated, not given proper health care, provided unclean drinking water and fed bait and rice. Many are forced to use buckets as toilets on board. Others in the community also have concerns. Uli Kozak, an Indonesian language professor at the University of Hawaii who has long exchanged home-cooked meals for fresh fish, said the workers sometimes ask for vegetables because of shortages on board. He said some captains have banned men from speaking their native language on boats. There’s “a lot of verbal abuse, even physical abuse, being slapped in the face,” Kozak said. “I have come across cases where people said, ‘If I had ever known that it would be as bad as this, I would have never taken that job.'” ___ Follow Martha Mendoza and Margie Mason on Twitter at @mendozamartha and @MargieMasonAP 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The victim, Danny Cannon, was released from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Denton on Wednesday afternoon with lingering injuries, including heavy bruising and severe blunt force trauma near his head, according to Aubrey police Lt. Bill Townsend. He said the men fled the scene about 5 a.m. Wednesday in Cannon’s white 2013 Chevy Equinox, with Texas license plate number CCY-1112. They initially forced their way into the home about 9 p.m. Tuesday in search of bank information and cash, Townsend said. They left with several items, including the suspect’s cellphone, credit card, jewelry and vehicle. “We took over 50 pieces of evidence for testing,” Townsend said. “We are currently working with several adjacent larger agencies in the [Dallas-Fort Worth] area and a federal agency who will be helping us with processing the evidence.” Townsend said Cannon first made contact with the suspects on Grindr, a mobile matchmaking application for gay men. The suspects had been using a fake account when they coordinated a “date” with Cannon, Townsend said. He did not know on Friday who made the initial contact. Three masked men arrived at the victim’s home in the 2000 block of Maxwell Court, forced their way inside and tied Cannon up in his room, Townsend said. The men also placed duct tape over Cannon’s eyes, he said. Police said the trio beat the man for hours as they rummaged through the house in search of cash. They asked Cannon for bank account information, and at one point struck him with a handgun, Townsend said. No shots were fired during the incident, he said. After the attackers took the victim’s vehicle and left the following morning, Cannon managed to untie himself and make his way to a neighbor’s house. Michael Schall, who lives next door, said he was watching TV when Cannon crossed his yard wearing only a jockstrap. “He ran across and went to a neighbor’s house and called the cops,” Schall said, later adding, “It’s scary that it happened right next door.” Townsend said police obtained security camera footage that shows the suspects using the victim’s credit card at a Wal-Mart in Little Elm. They also have video of the suspects operating an ATM in Aubrey shortly after leaving the house, he said. Law enforcement agencies in Plano and McKinney are looking into similar home-invasion incidents in their jurisdictions. In at least two incidents, a group of men reportedly contacted the victim on social media and attempted to steal bank account information and cash, Townsend said.

The man, identified as Brandon Limar Williams, of the 300 block of Poplar Avenue in Newport News, was taken to a local hospital, where he died less than an hour later. The tavern is a few blocks from Newport News Shipbuilding's North Gate — near where Huntington Avenue meets Warwick Boulevard — and is popular with shipyard workers, though Williams' family said he didn't work at the yard. .trb_ar_cont{margin:0 0 8px;color:#999;padding-top:4px}.trb_ar_cont:before{content:attr(data-ar-cont);font:italic 11px Arial,sans-serif;display:inline;margin:0 0 5px}.trb_ar_cont:after{font:8px trb_Icons;content:"\e606";margin-left:5px}@media print,(min-width:420px){.trb_ar_cont{display:none}} .trb_ar_cont{display:none!important} Leah Hilario, one of the tavern's co-owners, said both the victim and shooter were inside the restaurant before the incident.

Thurston said police don't yet know if Williams and the shooter knew each other. Police described the shooter as a black male wearing a black jacket/hooded shirt, jeans and black shoes, and who last seen running north on Warwick Boulevard. On Friday afternoon, police released a surveillance video showing a "person of interest" and a "vehicle of interest" — a gold colored car — passing through the tavern's parking lot. The man on the video — a bald, medium-framed black male with a beard, wearing a black jacket and hooded sweatshirt — is seen outside motioning another person toward the restaurant, then seen near the pool tables inside. .trb_ar_cont{margin:0 0 8px;color:#999;padding-top:4px}.trb_ar_cont:before{content:attr(data-ar-cont);font:italic 11px Arial,sans-serif;display:inline;margin:0 0 5px}.trb_ar_cont:after{font:8px trb_Icons;content:"\e606";margin-left:5px}@media print,(min-width:420px){.trb_ar_cont{display:none}} .trb_ar_cont{display:none!important} Video: Man found shot in car outside TJ's Sports Tavern A man was found shot in a car parked outside a tavern in South Newport News.

Maynard said. "Cameras aren't everywhere." As for whether police believe the man on the video footage was the shooter, Maynard would say only, "Everything we've put out so far is all we're putting out right now." Williams' stepfather, Ronnie Harrell, 47, was among many family members who gathered at the Poplar Avenue home on Friday afternoon. Harrell said that a woman who told him she was in the car with Williams at the time of the shooting called the family on Friday morning. She told them that Williams was sitting in the driver's side of the car, a 2012 Toyota Camry, when an armed man walked up and tried to rob them — leading to a quick series of events in which Williams was shot. Harrell said the case's lead detective also told him that robbery was the likely motive. When Thurston was asked to confirm that, he said, "Have we ruled out robbery as a possible motive? No, we have not. But the investigation is still ongoing." Harrell said he and Williams' mother were awakened at 3:30 a.m. Friday by a detective who told them their son was dead. "He was not a bad person whatsoever," Harrell said of his stepson. "He was a really cool kid. He worked every single day. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. ... I just wish he was here right here. This is heartbreaking. ... Why him?" Family members described Williams as a good listener, and said he was the father of three young children. He graduated from Menchville High School in 2009, having been a member of the school's football team. More recently, they said, he'd been working at a Wal-Mart distribution center in James City County, and was trained in heating and air conditioning work. "At this time of day, he'd be getting ready to go back to work," Harrell said Friday afternoon. One of Williams' uncles, Sylvester Williams, 52, said his nephew would sometimes help him out with local landscaping jobs. "Whenever he worked with me, I felt real close to him," he said. "He put his best into whatever I needed to have done. He put his best into it and made sure it was done right." Hilario, the tavern's co-owner, called the incident "a very shocking experience." "This is a family-owned business," she said. "Families bring their kids here to have dinner. It's very unexpected and just an isolated incident. ... We run a pretty tight ship here. We've never had any issues, and it was just a shock to all of us, honestly." Anyone with information that can help police is asked to call the Crime Line at 1-888-LOCK-U-UP.

Ford The Gazette More stories from George Feb 6, 2017 at 1:50 pm | Print View A new product from a Corridor start-up is attracting attention before it officially hits the market. The Repour Smart Stopper continuously removes oxygen from the air above the wine in a bottle and from the wine itself, keeping the beverage fresh weeks or months after the bottle has been first opened. Tom Lutz, who has a Ph.D. in chemistry and previously has worked in product development, came up with the idea for Repour several years ago. “I was lying on my couch one night thinking that I needed a problem to solve,” Lutz said. ”I don’t know if I had recently poured out half of a bottle of wine, but I started thinking about why wine goes bad after you open the bottle. “Oxygen helps give the wine its taste, but it also can destroy it once the wine is exposed to the air. By putting our FDA-approved oxygen absorbing material in the stopper, we can bring the level of oxygen in the air down below 0.05 percent and the dissolved oxygen in the wine to less than 0.03 parts per million.” Lutz said each Repour stopper will keep one bottle of wine fresh until the last glass. Repour has a seal that must be removed before inserting the stopper into the neck of the bottle. “The seal preserves the oxygen-absorbing qualities of the material,” Lutz said. Lutz said Repour has been rigorously tested, including the use of a third-party laboratory that verified the product’s claims. The testing confirmed that wine sealed with the Repour stopper measured dissolved oxygen in the wine to less than 0.03 ppm. Lutz also has handed out prototypes of Repour to wine experts such as vineyard owners, wine distributors, specialty shop wine owners, restaurateurs and hundreds of wine enthusiasts to validate internal tests. He assembled the stoppers in his garage from injection molded plastic parts fabricated by BeraTek Industries of Cedar Rapids. Jeff Quint, owner of Cedar Ridge Vineyards in Swisher, has been an expert tester for Repour. “Here at Cedar Ridge, we close on Sunday and reopen on Wednesdays,” Quint said. ”We have to pour hundreds of dollars of wine down the drain in between. “With Repour, we can replace the cork with the smart stopper when we leave on Sunday. When we return on Wednesday, the wine is as fresh as it is when we first opened them.” Quint’s confidence in the science and his own testing convinced him to provide a testimonial for a Kickstarter campaign in October 2016 to help support early production start-up costs. Curt Nelson, president and CEO of the Entrepreneurial Development Center in Cedar Rapids, said the successful Kickstarter campaign brought Repour to the attention of international specialty retailers. “Businesses like Harrods of London and Sharper Image catalog surf Kickstarter to find the next new product,” Nelson said. “When they started calling Tom, his ability to go real slow at first becomes a problem. They want to go fast at first.” Lutz said production tooling has been ordered, and final assembly and shipping may need to be handled by BeraTek and possibly another “co-packer” to meet anticipated demand. “Our plan is that we will be fully ready to go by March 1,” Lutz said. “We will offer Repour as a single, as well as in a four-pack or six-pack for the average consumer. We may also offer a larger multi-pack with over 100 pieces for bars and restaurants.” Lutz said Repour initially will be sold in wine shops and by similar retailers.
