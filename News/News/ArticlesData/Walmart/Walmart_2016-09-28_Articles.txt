Bloomberg Call it the Great Grocery-Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs by 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Albertsons recently advertised a deal you don't normally see on your finer cuts of meat: "buy 1 get 1 free" specials on "USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak." And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, New Jersey, you could pick up a dozen eggs at Wal-Mart. (OK, the price was actually $1.14.) A mile away, check out Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck -- 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago you would have paid, on average, three times that price. In a startling development, almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. It's the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 -- with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out; grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. Eggs and beef have have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn't only an American phenomenon: In England, Aldi recently offered its prized 8-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 -- a little more than the price of a pint of beer. "The severity of what we're seeing is completely unprecedented," said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years. "We've never seen deflation this sharp." Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston had fallen almost 5 percent over the past year. He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Wal-Mart in Secaucus, New Jersey, to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but has recently noticed the steals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of "Angus steak burgers" fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound.     ▲ Shoppers push carts through the grocery department at a Wal-Mart in Chicago on Nov. 25, 2015. (MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Daniel Acker) — Bloomberg Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Wal-Marts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. "Wherever I find the good deals -- that's where I'm at," Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. "It starts to border on irrational pricing," said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins." Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi's German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market -- famously derided as "Whole Paycheck" -- is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce. In recent years, Kroger -- the largest grocery store chain in the U.S., with nearly 2,800 stores -- cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company's stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don't even notice. "The other thing that's always hard is getting your message out, because it's fascinating - in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money," McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen's lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer's budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly.     ▲ A customer walks through the parking lot of a Whole Foods Market in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 1, 2016. (MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Luke Sharrett) Bloomberg At the same time, restaurant food can still be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin' Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, 63, a retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, New Jersey. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 -- one of the great food deals of recent memory. "That's a good price," she said, before moving on without buying a carton.   <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 블룸버그 다른기사 보기 이메일 기사 수정 :   2016-09-30 06:49   김동균 기자 웹출판 :   2016-09-30 06:57   관리자 입력.편집 :   2016-09-30 06:42   김동균 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 SKT, '루나S' 태권브이 에디션 한정판 1천대 판매 세종∼평택 국도 개통 세종시 중심에 조성되는 국립중앙수목원 이미지 농민들 '트랙터 몰고 청와대로' 제네시스 EQ900 '북미 올해의 차' 최종 후보 SKT, '루나S' 태권브이 에디션 한정판 1천대 판매 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

The project will be available exclusively at Walmart on Nov. 18. Strait Out of the Box: Part 2 will be made up of three discs, featuring a total of 56 tracks: 36 hit singles (including 26 No. 1s and his newest single, “Goin’ Goin’ Gone”), 18 album cuts and two brand-new tunes. A complete track listing has not been revealed, but all of the songs contained in the collection were curated by Strait himself, according to a press release, from music released between 1996 and 2016. Strait Out of the Box: Part 2 picks up where Strait Out of the Box, Strait’s 1995 box set, left off. That four-disc collection features music released by Strait between 1976 and 1995, and has, to date, sold more than 8 million copies, making it one of the best-selling musical box sets of all time. Strait’s newest single, “Goin’ Goin’ Gone,” comes from his most recent new album, Cold Beer Conversation, released in September of 2015, just days after Strait announced the project while sharing plans for his Las Vegas shows. The record is part of a five-album deal that he signed with longtime label MCA in 2013. Strait Out of the Box: Part 2 is available for pre-order via Walmart.com. Strait’s next concerts in Vegas are scheduled for Dec. 2 and Dec. 3, 2016. He will also be performing in Sin City on Feb. 17 and 18, 2017. Test Your George Strait Knowledge!

The most visible spurt of innovation comes in the dessert category, explained senior category director for Walmart's bakery operations Laura Rush in an interview. The world's largest retailer is fresh off an early September debut of five new desserts in concert with Grammy-winning artist Patti Labelle: berry cobbler, apple cobbler, peach cobbler, apple pecan cake and sweet potato loaf. More recently, it debuted French brioche sliced bread, and an enhanced crumb cake that has frosting and an apple pie that is 75% apples as opposed a mixture of apples and slurry. Rush pointed out that more than half of Walmart's bakery items are now prepared in store.

In the most recent quarter, the company shared earnings per share of $1.07, $0.05 higher than the analysts’ estimates. On the sales front, the company’s revenue came in at $120.90 billion, a surge of 0.6 percent year-over-year. On the other hand, Wal-Mart’s foremost competitor, Target, reported revenue of $16.17 billion, a drop of 7.2 percent year-over-year. Due to the recent developments, Oliver Chen, an analyst from Cowen, has changed his ratings for both Wal-Mart as well as Target. In the case of Wal-Mart, he upgraded his rating from market perform to outperform. On the contrary, he lowered his rating on Target from outperform to market perform. This downgrade doesn’t really seem surprising as Target has posted year over year revenue declines for three successive quarters, and the deficits are hastening. Comps sales are destructive, and Chen details that recent initiatives to fortify pharmacy and grocery are not resonating with shoppers. Chen also reported that Target is losing market share to Wal-Mart. As a matter of fact, if Target is mislaying share to Wal-Mart and other online retailers, it is likely a great thing that Wal-Mart is buying Jet.com to make its presence robust in the dot-com game. Image by MichaelGaida / Pixabay And this is the main reason why Chen changed his stance on the world’s largest retailer. Apart from this, a few days earlier, Wal-Mart started online grocery pickup in four stores in Minneapolis, with a fifth outlet to start two months later. The start of service in Minneapolis is prominent with the stores not far from the headquarters of Target. Furthermore, the company detailed that approximately 30,000 Wal-Mart items are adequate for online grocery pickup, and the minimum eligible amount per order is $30. In contrast, earlier this year, Target decided to place emphasis on its Instacart partnership in place of a store pickup service. Sales at Wal-Mart are much better than Target, as U.S comps have been positive for eight successive quarters, and the crowd is also increasing. Looking ahead, I expect this trend to continue. I think Wal-Mart is a much better buy than Target at this point in time. Given the growth trends, I expect Wal-Mart to continue outperforming its smaller rival, which is impressive given Wal-Mart’s huge size. Hence, I think investors should dump Target in favour of Wal-Mart. Published on Sep 30, 2016 By Akshansh Gandhi Copyrighted 2016. Content published with author's permission. Posted in ...

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Wal-Mart fire suspect faces mental health evaluation Thursday Sep 29, 2016 at 8:41 AM Sep 29, 2016 at 9:43 PM Brian Lee Telegram & Gazette Staff @BLeeTG DUDLEY - The lawyer for a Wal-Mart cashier who is accused of setting three fires, damaging most of the Sturbridge store’s inventory, said Thursday that his client reported hearing voices at the time of the alleged crime. Maiya A. Cruz, 20, of 261 Ashland Avenue, Southbridge, was ordered held until an Oct. 4 dangerousness hearing in Dudley District Court. Ms. Cruz will be evaluated by a court clinician, as called for in prosecutor Joseph A. Simmons’ motion, which was allowed by Judge Gerald A. Lemire. Ms. Cruz is charged with three counts each of burning building contents and malicious destruction of property valued at more than $250, and a count each of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. Defense lawyer Thomas W. Brosseau asked that Ms. Cruz be committed to a state hospital for an evaluation pursuant to a hearing to determine her competence to stand trial. Outside the court, some of Ms. Cruz’s family members and supporters were tearful. Those who spoke to reporters said that Ms. Cruz is a good person who needs help rather than incarceration for her mental issues. Her grandmother, Maria Brayman, said that Ms. Cruz should answer to the allegation, and she hoped her granddaughter could now get the help that she needs. Ms. Brayman said her granddaughter’s behavior had been escalating, but she did not say how it had been escalating. Dan Davis said that his son is in a relationship with Ms. Cruz and the couple live with him. Mr. Davis said Ms. Cruz had returned to working at Wal-Mart about three weeks ago after taking a leave of absence. Mr. Davis said the couple had been saving money to get their own place. He said the recent loss of a wallet, as the couple struggled to save money, might have pushed her over the edge. According to a police report by Sturbridge Officer Joseph Ballotte II, police decided to charge Ms. Cruz because she was observed on surveillance video in the immediate area of all three fires, and she had left the parking lot following evacuation of the store, and prior to the end of her shift. Officers were sent to Wal-Mart, 100 Charlton Road, just before 5:30 p.m. Tuesday. There was a reported fire in the jewelry area. Police said several men used a fire extinguisher to spray about 30 purses that were piled in an aisle. One of the men had been shopping and told police he became alarmed when he smelled something burning. He said he saw flames to the ceiling. As police spoke to the men, the store’s assistant manager said there were two other fires. There was a burned metal trash can by the women’s restroom in the rear of the store that had been put out. In the seasonal section, police said a burning piñata that was on a shelf had been moved and extinguished in the garden section. The store manager said the suspect used what appeared to be hand sanitizer, which is alcohol based, as an accelerant, police said. The Fire Department arrived a short time later and finished extinguishing the purses. They also “aired out” the building, which was filled with smoke and dust from the extinguishers. A view of surveillance video showed Ms. Cruz running from the purse section after the fire. While she ran, it was evident customers weren’t yet aware of the fire, the report said. The customers stared at Ms. Cruz as she passed. Police said footage showed that the suspect was a dark-skinned, slender woman who, throughout the episode, wore a red sweater and held a distinct black purse with a gold emblem. The sweater and purse were in Ms. Cruz’s work locker. Police said they looked inside the purse and found at least five cigarette lighters. After two Wal-Mart employees identified Ms. Cruz on the video footage, police went outside to speak to her, but another employee said Ms. Cruz had left the parking lot because she said she needed to use the bathroom at the nearby Stop & Shop. Police said they did not find Ms. Cruz in Stop & Shop, but they spoke to an employee of the grocery store who had spoken to someone who looked like Ms. Cruz and who had gone to the bathroom. The employee told police the woman had said there were three intentionally-set fires in Wal-Mart. They said she knew the exact location of each fire, and had compared them to recent fires that destroyed a brick building in Southbridge on Main Street and damaged an apartment building on Benefit Street. A Stop & Shop worker told police the Wal-Mart employee had been picked up in an older model Saturn. Southbridge police went to her home but no one was there. Officer Sean Paine said he called Ms. Cruz’s cell phone to tell her that Sturbridge police needed to speak to her about the store fires. But she told him she was in West Boylston and hung up. Her cell phone’s GPS indicated she was in Southbridge, police said. Officers eventually located a dark-colored Saturn in front of her mother’s home in Southbridge. But her mother Magaly Medina, refused to let officers inside, police said. She locked the doors and told investigators to get a warrant. Investigators said Ms. Cruz turned herself in to Auburn police around 9:15 p.m. Wednesday, following the daylong search. The store will have to be closed at least seven days to dispose of nearly everything inside the store, which was damaged by smoke and dust from fire extinguishers. Management told police the Sturbridge health department ordered the store to throw away all food. A Subway restaurant inside Wal-Mart was also ordered to destroy its food.  Police said it is impossible to estimate the amount of damage. Wal-Mart requested 24-hour police details until further notice to watch the store as it removes inventory and cleans the store. The state police Fire Marshal's office is assisting with the investigation.  About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Register/Subscribe Subscriber Services T&G E-Edition Worcester Living E-Edition NIE Business Matters Coupon Values FAQ Photo reprints (non-commercial use) Commercial photo licenses Advertising Advertising Contacts Propel Marketing - Digital Marketplace Media Kit Place an Ad Jobs Real Estate Pets Legal Notices News Contact Us Letters to the Editor Submit a Press Release Events Copyright/Terms of Use Marketing About Us Visions Contact Us The Item The Banner Reprints & Licensing Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

"Dick too big, might kill someone." By Diana Bruk Sep 29, 2016 Some bad news: that "I'd Rather Be Snorting Cocaine Off a Hooker's Ass" slogan T-shirt you wanted for your birthday is no longer available at Walmart. As first noted by Mashable, that and a whole slew of other offensive men's tees were available on Walmart's website, somewhat undermining the company's wholesome, family-friendly image. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Mashable reached out to Walmart, and the company responded by saying that the shirt "obviously has no business being on our site" and that they are "removing it ASAP." Too late, you'll have to spend your $19.95 elsewhere! "We apologize to anyone who was offended," a Walmart spokesperson added. It turns out the shirt wasn't sold directly by Walmart but by a third-party site called Hollywood Thread. When Walmart works with third-party retailers, the spokesperson explained to Mashable, it gives them a detailed list of policies for what they are allowed to sell. Once the item is uploaded onto the site, it goes through a filter that's supposed to flag down any banned words. Except that obviously didn't happen with a number of Hollywood Thread's products. Like these ones: Walmart Walmart There's also a "MASTER BAITER" fishing pun (get it?) and an "I <3 BREASTFEEDING" design, for when you're feeling particularly classy. The oversight is particularly noteworthy considering that Walmart famously banned a shirt in 1995 that featured a Dennis the Menace character saying, ""Someday a woman will be PRESIDENT!" Why? Because the concept went against the store's "values" at the time. NICK KAPUR/TWITTER I think that's what the kids call irony. Follow Diana on Twitter.

Troopers initially identified 32-year-old Pablo Jackson through video surveillance after he and 25-year-old Joshua L. Bryant used credit cards reported stolen from vehicles parked outside houses in the 1300 block of S. State St. and the 1700 block of Windswept Court at two area Walmarts, said Master Cpl. Gary Fournier, a spokesman with Delaware State Police. The men took items like cash and purses from the vehicles and started making purchases at the Cheswold Walmart and Camden Walmart totaling more than $3,400, Fournier said. Arrest warrants were written shortly after their identities were confirmed, he said. On Wednesday, a trooper and probation officer assigned to the State Police Kent County Governor’s Task Force were patrolling the area of South DuPont Highway and Lochmeath Way when they saw Jackson walking northbound on the southbound shoulder of U.S. 13, Fournier said. When they made a u-turn to stop Jackson, police watched him look into vehicles near the South Side Baptist Church, Fournier said. STORY: Woman who set deadly Wilmington blaze was angry, court documents show STORY: Few clues before killing of 3-year-old boy in Felton Jackson then took off running from the officers, dropping a backpack he was carrying along the way, he said. Police told him numerous times to stop, but he refused, Fournier added. The trooper was eventually able to stop him and arrest him, Fournier said. Inside his backpack, police found 24 bags of heroin, as well as drug paraphernalia, he said. Joshua Bryant  (Photo: DELAWARE STATE POLICE) Jackson was charged with resisting arrest, possession of a controlled substance (heroin), and two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia. He was also charged with 18 counts of identity theft, five counts of attempted identity theft, 18 counts of unauthorized use of a credit card, five counts of attempted unauthorized use of a credit card, two counts of theft under $1,500, 10 counts of theft by false pretense under $1,500, conspiracy and two counts of criminal trespass. He was taken to Sussex Correctional Institution near Georgetown on a total of $93,600 cash bail.  Bryant, of Cheswold, has not been located and is wanted for numerous counts of identity theft and other associated charges, as well as multiple court capiases. Anyone with information on his whereabouts should contact Detective A. Goode at (302) 698-8517. Tips may also be provided to Delaware Crime Stoppers at 1-800-TIP-3333, at delaware.crimestoppersweb.com or by texting to 274637 (CRIMES) using the keyword DSP.

It's something one store director touted at a recent grand re-opening of the Walmart Supercenter on Highway 40 in Kansas City. "We know that economically our dedication is to being a low price leader," Josh Williams, a Walmart store director said. Walmart's in-house security, or loss prevention officers, help keep prices low by watching out for shoplifting. However, 41 Action News discovered that stores in the metro often rely on local police departments instead of private security to keep stores safe.  "Typically when they call us, it's because there's been a shoplifter,” said Officer Debra Guieb with the Overland Park Police Department. "Occasionally there'll be some homeless people who go in and they don't want to leave.” Guieb starts many of her shifts driving thru the parking lot of the Walmart at 7701 Frontage Road right off I-35 near 75th Street. "A lot of times I’ll do reports in the parking lot, I think just being visible may help deter crime," Guieb said. Overland Park Police calls for service Create bar charts The Walmart on Guieb's beat is the number one business Overland Park police have been called out to -- with 923 calls since 2013. That's compared to all of Oak Park Mall -- with 870 calls since 2013. Target didn't make the list. As for the Walmart at 117th and Metcalf -- 641 calls, followed by the Walmart Supercenter at 157th and Metcalf with 584 calls. "There are career criminals that that's all they do is go to the store and steal them blind and they'll go to another store and they'll return it and get the money back for whatever they brought in depending on the policy," Guieb said. Just this year, a gunman shot a man at an Olathe Walmart and stolen credit cards were used at a Lenexa Walmart, plus multiple bomb threats have been called in. Last summer, a Roeland Park mom made headlines after she stole $300 worth of goods. Instead of arresting her, the officer paid for the items she stole. Figures from Roeland Park Police show officers responded to that store 344 times in 2015, down slightly from the 366 calls the year before. KCPD say a thief targeted the Walmart Supercenter on Highway 40 demanding money at gunpoint. According to the department, the store ranked 16th on the service call list with 123 calls. In 2014, there were 97 calls to the 40 Highway Walmart and the year before that, 91 calls. KCPD calls to Walmart at 11601 E. US Highway 40 Create column charts Earlier this month, a Good Samaritan shot and killed a man after the man allegedly attacked a mom with her baby in the parking lot of the Walmart on Maurer Road near Shawnee Mission Parkway.  Police used Walmart surveillance video to establish a timeline of events and just like in Overland Park, the store ranks first on the list for calls to Shawnee PD three years in a row. As of last month, cops have shown up to the Walmart 152 times so far this year.                 "When you have an area that draws in a lot of folks from a lot of different areas you're going to have police calls and that's why we're here," Major Dan Tennis, a spokesperson for the Shawnee Police Department said. Soon after the shooting, Walmart told us they planned to add private security to patrol the supercenter's parking lot. When we asked about the high number of calls their stores make to police they sent us a statement that reads in part: "The importance of this issue is recognized at the highest levels of the company and we are investing in people and technology to support our stores," Brian Nick, senior director of Walmart corporate communications wrote. Even cities like Augusta, Kansas and Tulsa, Oklahoma reported seeing police calls rise. A Joplin Walmart started a “Restorative Justice Program” to combat shoplifting and reduce the high volume of police officers responding to calls at the store. Despite the fact that there are constant runs to local Walmart stores, like in Shawnee, the police department doesn't believe it interferes with other calls. "When a business or resident or a citizen or somebody traveling through Shawnee needs help they call the police and we respond. We don't feel like we're at that Walmart an extraordinary amount of time compared to other places," Major Tennis said. Nick adds Walmart's current focus is to implement on more preventative measures designed to stop the crimes from being attempted at all. "I'd like to hope that if someone were to pull in there and saw a police officer sitting in the parking lot they'd think twice about committing a crime but unfortunately we don't have the resources to be there all the time or any of the other areas," Officer Guieb said. Walmart does tell us they have six stores in the Kansas City metro with off-duty police or private security 41 Action News obtained lists of the top 25 addresses officers respond to from police departments in Lee's Summit, Overland Park, Leawood, Shawnee, Olathe and KCPD.

Scott Bennett, who was appointed to the position in 2015 against Republican challenger Mike Madigan, a member of the Urbana City Council. Madigan and Bennett will appear at 7 p.m. Oct. 5 in a candidate forum sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Champaign County, the NAACP and The News-Gazette. It will be held at the Champaign City Council chambers, 102 N. Neil St., C. Scott Bennett Democrat, Champaign 1. What in your opinion is the primary problem with Illinois state government at this time and what, as one legislator out of 177, do you think you can do to help solve it? There is a division between both parties right now. During my short time in office, I have done my best to make decisions that are in the best interest of the 52nd District. I have shown my independence from party leadership with my vote against the unbalanced "Madigan budget" in May and have continued to fight against cuts to the University of Illinois, Parkland Community College and Danville Area Community College. I have taken pride in my ability to work with legislators on the other side of the aisle. I worked with Sen. Chapin Rose on protecting the Mahomet Aquifer and Rep. Tom Bennett on educating new parents on preventing SIDS. We need to put our political games aside and do what is best for our constituents and that is something I will continue to do. 2. Do you have an idea how the state's unfunded pension liability problem can be eased, or should the state merely continue to cover pension costs as it has in recent years? The underfunding problems have resulted from the state's past failures to meet its obligations. In the process, past decisions have allowed our pension liabilities to grow. During my time in the Senate, I have voted to pay all of our pension obligations and if I'm elected to represent the 52nd District this November, I will continue to do so. We didn't arrive at this predicament overnight and this problem can't be solved overnight. It is clear after the Illinois Supreme Court's decision on the 2013 pension reform that we cannot make unilateral decisions. Whatever decision we reach has to be with all parties at the table to find a compromise that is beneficial for existing retirees and Illinois' long-term financial prospects. 3. Faced with the need to raise taxes to help balance the budget and pay down the backlog of bills, what taxes would you be willing to impose and/or increase, and what taxes would you not want to impose and/or increase? We should not talk about raising taxes until we make sure we explore every possible alternative. We cannot afford to balance the budget on the backs of Illinois' families. We need to update our existing tax codes and reduce corporate loopholes for large businesses like Walmart. Walmart receives about $100 million yearly in tax breaks from Illinois, that means over the span of 10 years taxpayers are giving Walmart executives $1 billion to stay in Illinois. This is unnecessary. Corporate loopholes like this need to be explored and reformed before there is talk of instituting any type of tax on working families. I'm also against taxing retirement income. Our retirees have made life decisions based on a contract made with the state. People often forget that retirees such as our retired teachers do not receive Social Security. At a time in their lives that they cannot go back to work or alter their past financial decisions, it is unfair to tax their fixed income. 4. Are there any parts of Gov. Bruce Rauner's remaining Turnaround Agenda items (term limits; removing the ability of legislators to draw legislative districts; property tax relief including allowing local governments to opt out of prevailing wage and collective bargaining agreements) that you would be open to considering in 2017? I'm a strong supporter of term limits for legislative leadership. I'm a sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 3, 18, 19 and 21. We can't afford to have the state run by career politicians. I'm a firm believer that no one should make a career out of being a politician. I'm committed to passing this ethics reform to move our state forward and taking the power out of the hands of one or two legislative leaders who have been in power for long periods of time. This type of leadership fosters an environment of partisanship and division, instead of what is best for the people of the 52nd Senate District. I also signed the Independent Maps petition and support its goals. The success of the Independent Maps movement has shown the people do want a less partisan redistricting process and we need to do what our constituents want us to do. We need to have an open and transparent map process. Legislative maps shouldn't be drawn in secret backrooms but in an accessible and truthful manner. 5. Would you support the legalization (not just decriminalization) of marijuana in Illinois? I supported the decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana. Prosecuting these cases was not an efficient use of taxpayer money and the consequences of a young person having a permanent criminal record for small amounts of marijuana use can have negative life changing consequences. We need further medical and social research on the challenges and unintended consequences now encountered by the states that have already legalized small amounts of marijuana before the state legislature engages in the legalization debate. 6. Are there state programs, departments, institutions that you would like to eliminate or seriously downsize in order to save money? I'm in favor of eliminating the lieutenant governor's office (and was a sponsor of the measure). Illinois is one of the few states that still has this office. After the elimination of the lieutenant governor's office I would like to explore the consolidation of the Illinois comptroller and Illinois treasurer's office. Illinois has about 7,000 units of government and I'm open to exploring ways to consolidate and eliminate redundant forms of government to save money and increase government efficiency. However, I don't think the state government should be making decisions on how we run local governments. Any form of government that is eliminated or consolidated should be a decision in the hands of local taxpayers. The decision should be made by a voter referendum. 7. What kind of criminal justice reforms do you think the state needs to make to save money and reduce corrections costs? The focus needs to be on public safety, reducing the prison population can save Illinois money while still serving justice and deterring crime. Over-populated prisons can be expensive, unnecessarily punitive, and sometimes counter-productive against the greater goal of maintaining public safety. Nonviolent drug offenders can be diverted into mental health or drug rehab programs and kept from reoffending through electronic monitoring, home confinement and strict enforcement of probation requirements. Almost half of ex-offenders return to prison within three years. We need to provide more and better programs that help reintegrate released prisoners into their communities as well as better community programs that help stop individuals from initially turning to crime. We need to stop the revolving door. 8. Do you think the state's school funding formula needs to be rewritten? If so, what should be the goal and what should be done about unusually small school districts? Should consolidation be a necessary part of school funding reform? I would like to improve the way our state funds public education. This means reforming the 48th worst K-12 funding system in the country by requiring scarce state funds to be allocated in a new needs based formula. I was encouraged earlier this summer when Gov. Rauner created his own bipartisan school financing commission to build on the Senate's work last year. I do not support further consolidation of our local school districts by the state government. If there is any decision to consolidate our local school districts it should be made via voter referendum by taxpayers. 9. Should the state do anything to keep two Exelon nuclear power plants (at Clinton and Quad Cities) open, or is this strictly a private enterprise issue? Would you be willing to commit constituents to higher electric rates to keep the two plants open? Retaining and developing electricity and energy production in Illinois is an important economic goal, but the legislation as currently written would force consumers to pay higher utility costs without requiring Exelon to keep the Clinton Power Plant open and the people of the 52nd Senate District employed. 10. Would you back a constitutional amendment to shift from a flat income tax to a progressive income tax in Illinois? Why or why not? I support voters having the opportunity to decide if a graduated income tax makes sense. Mike Madigan Republican, Urbana 1. What in your opinion is the primary problem with Illinois state government at this time and what, as one legislator out of 177, do you think you can do to help solve it? Currently, state government is largely controlled by two people, Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton. The House and Senate Rules are set up to put power firmly in their hands. The legislative maps have been drawn to protect their majorities. Campaign finance laws were written to give them even greater power over their members. My opponent supports Speaker Madigan's and Senate President Cullerton's continued grip on power. As a State Senator I can and will make governmental reforms a priority. Hopefully my election, as well as the election of other Republican Representatives and Senators will bring greater balance to the General Assembly and force more compromise. I will sponsor legislation to reform government, starting with the Fair Maps initiative. Most importantly, I will try to bring a spirit of cooperation to the General Assembly. In my 16 years as a legislative staff member I was able to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and I will continue to do that as a state senator. With more balance and the willingness of members from both parties to work together, we can work toward meaningful reforms. 2. Do you have an idea how the state's unfunded pension liability problem can be eased, or should the state merely continue to cover pension costs as it has in recent years? First, we have to stop the bleeding. The first, small step would be to eliminate the General Assembly Retirement System for newly elected officials. I will not accept the General Assembly pension and I will fight to eliminate it for all new lawmakers. I will also fight to reduce benefits for current lawmakers going forward. Serving in the General Assembly was meant to be a part time public service. The pensions for these positions should reflect that reality. We then should establish a defined contribution system for most new state employees. I would make an exception for public safety employees. Unfortunately, we have a state government that constantly makes promises that they then break. Only with a defined contribution program can we eliminate politicians from the pension process and provide a retirement program that is fair to both state employees and taxpayers. Once we move new employees to a defined contribution program, we can amortize our remaining pension liability over the long term. While obligations would increase toward the beginning of that period, over time our pension obligations would be reduced. Pension benefits for those who have retired must be honored. For current employees, future pay raises should be contingent upon agreed-to limits on what part of those pay raises is used for the employee's pension calculation. 3. Faced with the need to raise taxes to help balance the budget and pay down the backlog of bills, what taxes would you be willing to impose and/or increase, and what taxes would you not want to impose and/or increase? The career political class in Springfield routinely touts new taxes as the first solution to our budget problems. That's unfortunate, as we are losing productive citizens and businesses each day to other more tax- and business-friendly states. Until we stop that trend, tax hikes will only make this problem worse. Our first priority for revenue must be creating a business environment that encourages creation of new jobs that generate additional tax revenue while reducing the costs of welfare, Medicaid, and other state services. For more than a decade now, Speaker Madigan and President Cullerton have resisted almost every reasonable effort to improve Illinois' business environment. If elected, I will help change that. Worker's compensation reform and a regulatory overhaul must happen quickly if we are to renew our state and return it to its former status as an economic engine for the country. Once business reforms have been established and their effects determined, I am willing to consider ways to broaden our tax base that do not put us at a competitive disadvantage with other states. 4. Are there any parts of Gov. Bruce Rauner's remaining Turnaround Agenda items (term limits; removing the ability of legislators to draw legislative districts; property tax relief including allowing local governments to opt out of prevailing wage and collective bargaining agreements) that you would be open to considering in 2017? I support those elements of the governor's agenda. Governmental reform through fair maps and term limits is critical. It will be incredibly difficult for us to move our state forward with the polarization that is the natural result of a single party holding on to power through the redistricting process and then allowing a single legislator, Speaker Michael Madigan, to put an iron grip on the legislative process. 80 percent of Illinois citizens want these reforms and it's long past time for the General Assembly to allow them to vote on them. I am the only candidate in this election who supports, and will fight for, these reforms. I support a property tax freeze, relief from many state mandates on local governments, and consolidation of the more than 7,000 local taxing districts. I doubt that Mayor Laurel Prussing and Governor Rauner would find much common ground on public policy. But on the issue of reforming the binding arbitration process they do agree. This is not a partisan issue or an anti-union issue. Rather, it's an issue of common sense and fairness that has bipartisan support. We also need to reform worker's compensation, a critical part of the governor's agenda. My own small business, Hickory River Smokehouse, is one of thousands in this state that is burdened by one of the highest worker's compensation rates in the country. While my brick and mortar restaurants won't be leaving, many businesses that can move are doing so and it's hurting our economy, costing us jobs, and reducing tax revenues. If a worker makes a workers' comp claim, it is only fair to the business that it was a "major contributing cause" of the injury, instead of the current "no fault" system. This and other reasonable reforms should be made to re-establish Illinois as a state that is fair to both workers and businesses on this issue. 5. Would you support the legalization (not just decriminalization) of marijuana in Illinois? I think decriminalization was a proper step to take. As this new legal framework moves forward it will be important to determine its impact on public safety and employment opportunities. Once we know the impact of the new law, we can consider modifications. 6. Are there state programs, departments, institutions that you would like to eliminate or seriously downsize in order to save money? First, we need to look at how to make the programs we most need, operate better. For example, the governor has begun to revamp our technology systems which are antiquated and inefficient. I support this effort. Coordinating and modernizing technology across state government will allow us to build a system that makes business and citizen interaction with their government much less burdensome. Many of our surrounding states, including Indiana, have done this already and they are reaping the benefits of it. We need to follow suit. Second, we have to make sure that the core functions of state government: education, transportation, public safety and caring for those who truly cannot care for themselves are funded properly. Everything after that needs to be reviewed for its necessity. That includes most programs created in the last decade. Under Govs. Blagojevich and Quinn, Illinois state government spent money that they didn't have and created new programs that we simply couldn't afford. Reversing those bad decisions should come first. 7. What kind of criminal justice reforms do you think the state needs to make to save money and reduce corrections costs? I support a reducing the sentences of nonviolent offenders. This can reduce prison populations without endangering people. More importantly, we need to reduce recidivism by having stronger rehabilitation and work programs for those in prison and better support when they leave prison. Of course, the most important factor in reducing recidivism is more job opportunities. Illinois has the highest unemployment rate in the country. That fact alone lends itself to higher recidivism. This is just one more area impacted by the lack of progress in Springfield on improving our business environment. 8. Do you think the state's school funding formula needs to be rewritten? If so, what should be the goal and what should be done about unusually small school districts? Should consolidation be a necessary part of school funding reform? The school funding formula needs to be modified and I generally support the current efforts to do that. I believe that Sen. Jason Barickman's proposal, SB 1403 is an excellent framework for reform. A number of proposals, including the one passed by the Senate fail to properly address our problems. First, they give more money to Chicago schools than is justified. Second, the funding reduction for Champaign schools in particular will likely increase property tax rates in Champaign and Savoy. Our goal should be to provide a quality education for every child in Illinois regardless of where they live and their income level. I grew up in a small school district and will forever be thankful for the wonderful teachers I had and how they prepared me for college and work. At the same time, my community in rural Champaign County came to understand that we could provide greater opportunities for our children through consolidation. The state needs to do more to encourage that, including capital construction considerations that often are a barrier to consolidation efforts. 9. Should the state do anything to keep two Exelon nuclear power plants (at Clinton and Quad Cities) open, or is this strictly a private enterprise issue? Would you be willing to commit constituents to higher electric rates to keep the two plants open? The state of Illinois has a role in the utility industry that includes protecting consumers from monopolies and helping to ensure the long term stability of energy production for homeowners and businesses. As a small businessman, I am very much aware of the cost of energy and the need to keep it as low as possible. Regarding the Clinton nuclear plant, I think it's important for Exelon to come to the General Assembly with a bill that addresses only the specific issues that impact their nuclear plants. The proposal currently being considered has other non-related elements in it that make it difficult to pass and perhaps would further increase costs to consumers. I would support a fair bill if it can be demonstrated that closing the plants would destabilize the power grids they serve, and if it has only very nominal impact to consumers. 10. Would you back a constitutional amendment to shift from a flat income tax to a progressive income tax in Illinois? Why or why not? I do not support a progressive Illinois income tax. Currently, we have a progressive tax structure through the federal income tax. Adding another layer of taxation at the state level is just an invitation to drive people and their tax dollars and consumer spending out of the state. We should keep our flat tax as it is one of our only competitive tax elements. Sections (2):News, Local Topics (1):Politics and Government Tags (1):Election 2016 More Local What's In A Name?

By: Reuters | Mumbai | Published:September 29, 2016 4:44 pm A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in talks to buy a minority stake in India’s largest e-commerce firm Flipkart, two people familiar with the matter said, as the world’s biggest retailer aims to break into a fast growing but highly competitive online retail market. One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company’s overall valuation. Watch what else is making news A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc , which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year.

For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India. Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm, said it was natural for Wal-Mart to want to partner with Flipkart. “India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive,” he said. If a deal is agreed, Wal-Mart would join other foreign strategic investors in India’s online players. China’s Alibaba Group Holding, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp and Taiwan’s Foxconn last year led an investment of $500 million in Flipkart’s smaller rival Snapdeal. Alibaba is also the biggest shareholder in India’s One97 Communications, which operates payments services and an e-commerce market place under the PayTM trade name. The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. CUT-THROAT COMPETITION Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country. Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart. But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centres. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015. The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then. Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc , down from as much as $15 billion earlier this year. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China’s JD.com Inc, giving the U.S. firm a ringside seat in JD.com’s bitter rivalry with Alibaba Group.

Drones could be the next arms race as retailers unleash the potential of this growing technology. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Sep 29, 2016 at 6:30AM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the best example of a traditional retailer trying to revamp and revitalize its business via e-commerce. One major aspect of those efforts is delivery, getting goods to customers as quickly and cheaply as possible. Though Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) boasts an expansive network of fulfillment centers that put it within a 20-mile reach of 40% of the U.S. population, it is still dwarfed by Wal-Mart's store footprint. In this segment from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Motley Fool analysts Vincent Shen and Sarah Priestley discuss the advantages this footprint gives Wal-Mart and how effective drones could actually be reducing the cost of last-mile delivery. And all of this begs the question: How much are consumers really willing to pay for shipping? A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sept. 20, 2016. Vincent Shen: When you look at, what I consider to be one of the biggest examples, it's the biggest example of a traditional retailer, like Wal-Mart, it's obviously been focused a lot in terms of its e-commerce efforts. We've talked previously on this show about its Jet.com acquisition and other efforts. I think for the most recent quarter, it's been able to return to more robust levels of growth for its e-commerce efforts. And they are really pushing their shipping option. They have their Shipping Pass package, now, I think it's $50 per year, comparable to Amazon Prime. Something I thought was really interesting is, Piper Jaffray research analysts estimates that Amazon has successfully built out its network of fulfillment centers at this point to be within 20 miles of 44% of the U.S. population. Back in 2010, that penetration level was just 5%. On the other hand, we know that Wal-Mart has a ton of stores. What's their penetration level? Sarah Priestley: They have a store within five miles of 70% of the population. Shen: So, what do you see in terms of shipping, the drone opportunities, how do you see that playing out? Because Amazon, obviously, with about 44% penetration within 20 miles, that seems, potentially, in the future, as the technology develops, as the flight times improve, for them to be able to really deliver and expand what is right now a limited 40 markets for Prime now, essentially, your delivery within one or two hours. What do you think? Priestley: I think there's a lot of hurdles for them to overcome, not just regulatory. I think it's going to be a societal change, too. How much do you really need to get it within 30 minutes? And, obviously, price will affect that. But, as you said, Wal-Mart's distribution of retail locations is a huge advantage. I don't think people realize, when you talk about drones, the idea is that it will essentially be a single-package short delivery. Then, this opens up a whole secondary question over how cost-effective is this actually going to be? A lot of people have made the argument that this could be, in fact, cents per mile. The last mile of the delivery is where the opportunity is for retailers. I think the last mile adds 28% of the cost of delivery. So, if you just take this last mile and think about how much cost benefit there is going to be for a drone. And there are some analysts that are pegging this out to be ridiculously cheap, $0.88 for the final delivery. Some of them are pegging it to be $10 to $17 per delivery, depending on what you factor in. So, there's a whole host of issues. There's a whole timeline when we need to find out what the price point is for people; if they actually want this, how much they're willing to pay for it. Deloitte surveyed last year 4,000 shoppers around the holiday season, and a quarter of them were unwilling to pay for next-day delivery. You can see that expectations are rocket-high from consumers already from what they're expecting. Sarah Priestley has no position in any stocks mentioned.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Sturbridge police seek Wal-Mart worker who allegedly set store fires Wednesday Sep 28, 2016 at 12:36 PM Sep 29, 2016 at 8:54 AM Craig S. Semon Telegram & Gazette Staff @CraigSemon STURBRIDGE - A Wal-Mart employee was being sought Wednesday in connection with three fires set in the store Tuesday evening. Maiya Cruz of Southbridge is wanted by police. She is accused of setting fires in the store on Charlton Road (Route 20). She faces three counts of burning a building contents, three counts of destruction of property over $250, disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. A fire in the jewelry section of the store was reported at 5:25 p.m. Tuesday. When Sturbridge police and fire personnel arrived, they determined three fires had been set throughout the store. Each was extinguished by store employees and customers. Investigators studied surveillance tapes and soon narrowed the investigation to Ms. Cruz, according to the Sturbridge Police Department. She was seen fleeing the parking lot in her car, after which investigators called her cellphone. She hung up on them, police said. Wal-Mart expects to suffer a total loss of all its food stacked and displayed on the store floor as a result of the fires. Sturbridge interim Health Agent Jamie Terry said that all food that was exposed to smoke and chemical contamination must be removed from the sales floor. Wal-Mart management, the Sturbridge fire chief and town health officials made the decision to remove food from the floor. “Walmart has determined that it’s going to have a total loss at the store,” Ms. Terry said. “As far as the food products go, none of the food products will be remaining in the store.” Ms. Terry said air-exchange on the food-storage refrigerator units showed evidence of pulling in chemical materials from the fire extinguishers. “They have crews in there right now. They’ve been working since the Fire Department cleared them to be in the building,” Ms. Terry said. “And I believe they are going to be working around the clock to try to get reopened for their customers as quickly as possible.” Ms. Terry said the Subway sandwich shop located inside the department store also lost all of its food. In addition to significant smoke damage throughout the building, further contamination was found throughout the store, Ms. Terry said, from the release of the chemical fire extinguishers. “There was a fine mist from those chemical extinguishers throughout the establishment,” Ms. Terry said. Ms. Terry said some items may be resold to salvage for possible resale after cleaning and refurbishment, as long as those items are clearly marked as smoke/chemical damaged. Other items will need to be removed and permanently discarded without use, she said. Interim Fire Chief Paul D. Ford said crews were at the store for several hours to vent the building. No injuries were reported, he said. Members of the Southbridge, Brimfield, Spencer and Charlton fire departments helped ventilate the building and ensure it was safe for employees to enter. “Thankfully, the fires were very small,” Chief Ford said. “It is an active investigation. It certainly has been determined that it was set.”  "We're upset that someone would do something so reckless and dangerous in our store,” said Erica Jones, senior manager of corporate communications for Wal-Mart corporate headquarters, in an email Tuesday. "Thankfully, we were able to evacuate and no one was injured. We are grateful to the Fire Department for their quick response." Ms. Cruz’s whereabouts remains unknown. Officials are asking anyone with information to call Sturbridge police at (508) 347-2525 or the state fire marshal’s arson hotline at (800) 682-9229. The store remains closed.  About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Register/Subscribe Subscriber Services T&G E-Edition Worcester Living E-Edition NIE Business Matters Coupon Values FAQ Photo reprints (non-commercial use) Commercial photo licenses Advertising Advertising Contacts Propel Marketing - Digital Marketplace Media Kit Place an Ad Jobs Real Estate Pets Legal Notices News Contact Us Letters to the Editor Submit a Press Release Events Copyright/Terms of Use Marketing About Us Visions Contact Us The Item The Banner Reprints & Licensing Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc, which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year. Wal-Mart operates 21 wholesale stores in the South Asian country, but is discouraged from setting up its own bricks-and-mortar shops by rules that limit foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers to 51 percent and the cost of setting up shops in a country as large as India. For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India. "India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive. So the road ahead is either a Flipkart or an Amazon," said Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm. "Which is why it is natural for Wal-Mart to look at Flipkart as they cannot acquire Amazon." The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. Cut-throat competition Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country. Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart. But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centres. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and smaller rival Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015. The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then. Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc , down from as much as $15 billion earlier this year. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China's JD.com Inc, giving the U.S. firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc , which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year. Wal-Mart operates 21 wholesale stores in the South Asian country, but is discouraged from setting up its own bricks-and-mortar shops by rules that limit foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers to 51 percent and the cost of setting up shops in a country as large as India. For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India. Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm, said it was natural for Wal-Mart to want to partner with Flipkart. "India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive," he said. If a deal is agreed, Wal-Mart would join other foreign strategic investors in India's online players. China's Alibaba Group Holding, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp and Taiwan's Foxconn last year led an investment of $500 million in Flipkart's smaller rival Snapdeal. Alibaba is also the biggest shareholder in India's One97 Communications, which operates payments services and an e-commerce market place under the PayTM trade name. The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. CUT-THROAT COMPETITION Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country. Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart. But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centres. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015. The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then. Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc , down from as much as $15 billion earlier this year. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China's JD.com Inc, giving the U.S. firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Alibaba Group.

As Walmart talks to Flipkart, Amazon may invest $2 bn more in India Firstpost 29-09-2016 © Provided by Firstpost The war between the two US online and offline retail giants - Amazon and Walmart - is getting bigger and bigger by each passing day. This is becoming very much evident in terms of their rising fund commitment towards the potentially growing Indian market in a bid to outdo each other. Amazon, the Jeff Bezos-controlled US online retail giant, has said it will invest another $2 billion in its Indian arm as competition intensifies in the country's e-commerce sector, a BusinessLine report said. The fresh fund commitment is in addition to the $5 billion capital the company has already earmarked for the country. "We continue to look at India as a key growth region and are committed to invest aggressively with a long-term horizon, and transform the way India buys and sells," BusinessLine reported quoting Amazon India spokesperson. This comes a day after news reports said Walmart, the US-based and world's largest retail behemoth, is in advanced negotiations to invest $1 billion in India's largest online retailer Flipkart in return for a small stake in the latter. The crucial committments by the two US-based firms come ahead of the start of the festival sale offers by India's top online marketplace companies, including Amazon India. The top three ecommerce firms - Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal - have committed to spend heavily on advertising and marketing, besides promising big incentives to their top suppliers against discounts likely to be offered by them on several products during the upcoming festive sale offers. Amazon, which operates through Amazon.in in India, will flag off its 'Great Indian Festival' sale from 1 October, with total spend on its marketing and advertising likely to be more than two-three times of its rival Flipkart. The marketing and advertising budget of Amazon India is expected to be around Rs 125-130 crore. In order to woo customers, Flipkart said it will be spending Rs 30 crore on marketing and advertising of this year's Big Billion Day sale. In fact, the biggest spend for rebranding activities has come from Snapdeal, which said has invested Rs 200 crore on this exercise. Both, Flipkart and Snapdeal will host their sales between 2 and 6 October. Besides these three players, other marketplace entities such as Alibaba-backed Paytm and Shopclues, too, will be holding their big-bang festival season sales alongside their large peers in the first couple of weeks of next month in order to cash in on the growing enthusiasm of online buyers in recent years. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch Report pegged Flipkart as the leader with over 43 percent market share. It forecast that in 2019, Flipkart would be able to retain the share to 44 percent, with Amazon gaining to 37 percent and Snapdeal's share falling to just 9 percent. In 2015, Amazon has 21 percent market share and Snapdeal 14 percent. According to a report by Kotak Institutional equities, Indian e-tailing market could reach $28 billion by 2019-20, registering a compounded annual growth rate of 45 percent over the next four years. Despite the strong growth estimates, gross merchandise value in the June quarter dropped 7 percent to $13 billion as against 21 percent rise to $11.5 billion in the same quarter last year.

This is becoming very much evident in terms of their rising fund commitment towards the potentially growing Indian market in a bid to outdo each other. Amazon, the Jeff Bezos-controlled US online retail giant, has said it will invest another $2 billion in its Indian arm as competition intensifies in the country's e-commerce sector, a BusinessLine report said.

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint Taipei: That hoped-for Snapdeal Flipkart merger may be some time. Back in July, I discussed how the two Indian e-commerce companies, both burning through cash, should team up to take on Amazon, especially given the US giant’s far deeper pockets. Enter Wal-Mart with a $1 billion can of kerosene to pour on the fire. The world’s largest retailer is in advanced discussions to take a minority stake in Flipkart, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. It’s hard not to view that development as bad news for India’s e-commerce war of attrition. Sure it looks great for Flipkart—who wouldn’t want cash from a rich and powerful benefactor? Yet, that money would take total funds raised by Amazon India, Flipkart and Snapdeal beyond $10 billion, according to data from CB Insights and public statements by Amazon. Also Read: Flipkart, Wal-Mart in talks for $1 billion investment For Wal-Mart, the deal makes total sense. It’s a brilliant move for a company that’s struggled to catch Amazon in the US online shopping market, forcing it to acquire Jet.com for $3 billion. Buying into India this early in the country’s development would give Wal-Mart a far better shot at tackling Amazon there than it’s managed in America. There’s a precedent for unprofitable competitors to consolidate despite having plenty of cash. One of the best examples is Didi Chuxing, formed last year after China’s two top ride-hailing companies merged. That deal will go down as one of the most successful in history, paving the way for Apple to buy in and for Uber to be defeated. Also Read: Wal-Mart India evaluating ‘food-only’ retail model The problem is, large wads of cash also tend to make even sane people go a little crazy, and India’s e-commerce players were already charting high on that crazy scale. Nothing tightens the belt like a little hunger in the belly. With this fresh injection of funds, the incentive for Flipkart to come to the negotiating table with Snapdeal is diminished. It’s possible Wal-Mart is asking Flipkart to explore merger options as part of the US company’s investment, in which case this deal would be great. But given Alibaba’s earlier investment in Snapdeal, each now has a large foreign e-commerce firm behind them. Against that backdrop, it’s hard to imagine Wal-Mart won’t be ready to pony up more money when Flipkart next holds out its hand. And that’s likely to incentivize Alibaba to continue writing checks for Snapdeal. The question is whether Wal-Mart wants the role of father figure, or sugar daddy.

cheap drugs to most markets, including the U.S. But community activists,

     The SGX Nifty Futures were at 8,795.50, up 0.4 pct from its previous
close.

appetite improved after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
agreement to curb oil output lifted crude prices.

(Photo: Steve Perez / The Detroit News)Buy Photo Call it the Great Grocery-Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Not long ago, Albertsons advertised a deal you don’t normally see on your finer cuts of meat: “buy 1 get 1 free” specials on “USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak.” And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, New Jersey, you could pick up a dozen eggs at Wal-Mart. OK, the price was actually $1.14. A mile away, check out Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck — 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago, you would have paid, on average, three times that price. In a startling development, almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. It’s the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 — with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out; grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. Eggs and beef have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn’t only an American phenomenon: In England, Aldi recently offered its prized 8-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 — a little more than the price of a pint of beer. “The severity of what we’re seeing is completely unprecedented,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years. “We’ve never seen deflation this sharp.” Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston, had fallen almost 5 percent over the past year. He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Wal-Mart in Secaucus, New Jersey, to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but has recently noticed the steals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of “Angus steak burgers” fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound. Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Wal-Marts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. “Wherever I find the good deals — that’s where I’m at,” Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. “It starts to border on irrational pricing,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins.” Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com Inc. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi’s German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market Inc. — famously derided as “Whole Paycheck” — is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce. In recent years, Kroger Co. — the largest grocery store chain in the U.S., with nearly 2,800 stores — cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company’s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don’t even notice. “The other thing that’s always hard is getting your message out, because it’s fascinating in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money,” McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen’s lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer’s budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly. At the same time, restaurant food can still be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, a 63-year-old retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, New Jersey. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 — one of the great food deals of recent memory. “That’s a good price,” she said, before moving on without buying a carton. 11 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2dEAGid TOP VIDEOS Mary Barra, Michiganian of the Year 2:39 GM opens new Company Store at Renaissance Center 1:54 Pistons owner Tom Gores discusses possible move downtown 5:50 Tom Izzo on Dan Gilbert's $15 Million gift to MSU 2:14 ZF TRW automotive demonstrates self-driving technology 1:57 Building Mars spaceship parts in Metro Detroit 1:38 Tour the Detroit riverfront's industrial heart 2:27 Hamtramck’s Bon Bon Bon crafts artisan chocolates 3:55 Tomorrow's doctors have fun at the Little Medical School 0:39 New housing, retail development in New Center breaks ground 2:48

Walmart may invest $1 billion in Flipkart to battle Amazon The Financial Express 28-09-2016 FE Online Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is in advanced discussions to invest as much as $1 billion into Flipkart. According to Bloomberg, Walmart would take a minority stake in Flipkart, final terms of the deal have not been worked out and negotiations are still underway, a person familiar with the matter said. According to a research firm CB insights, Flipkart's most recent valuation was $16 billion. The deal would help the two companies battle Amazon.com. Last week Flipkart crossed the 100-million registered users mark, becoming the first e-commerce company in the country to hit the milestone. The Bengaluru-based company has doubled its user base over the last year and added 25 million users in the past six months alone. © image One of the most valued start-ups in the country, Flipkart has Tiger Global, Accel Partners, Morgan Stanley and T Rowe among its investors. The company has raised over $3 billion in funding so far and has acquired companies like Myntra, PhonePe, and LetsBuy. It has also invested in start-ups like Cube26, NestAway, and BlackBuck. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch Report pegged Flipkart as the leader with over 43 per cent market share. It forecast that by 2019, Flipkart would increase its share to 44 percent. On the other hand, Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. The company had entered into an equal joint venture with Sunil Bharti Mittal's Bharti Enterprises. However, in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. Walmart operates 21 Best Price wholesale offline stores in nine states in India.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 28, 2016 at 2:21PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is flush with cash thanks to a portfolio reboot that's involved selling off a few valuable brands, including Duracell batteries and Coty beauty products. Yet weak operating trends have produced two consecutive years of disappointing dividend raises for income investors. The consumer products giant boosted its payout by 3% last year and by just 1% in 2016. So today I'm looking at Target (NYSE:TGT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ): Three stocks that investors might prefer over P&G right now. Here's how the dividends stack up against each other. Dividend comparison Metric Procter & Gamble Target Coca-Cola Johnson & Johnson Yield 3% 3.5% 3% 2.7% Last raise 1% 7% 6% 7% Payout ratio 76% 44% 77% 57% Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Capital IQ data. Last raise is the most recent percent change in the dividend. Target for the yield Target's stock is out of favor right now in part due to a slowdown in the retailing industry. Yet the company has stumbled enough to separate itself from peers -- and not in a good way. Customer traffic dropped last quarter, even as Wal-Mart's rose. And Target's comparable-store sales are negative at the same time that grocery competitor Kroger has pushed its growth streak past 50 straight quarters. Investors have punished the stock for those missteps: Target is now valued at less than 13 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 15 for both Kroger and Wal-Mart. Investors who believe the retailer will recover from this recent slump, as it has many times in its near 50-year history, might be enticed by that discount -- especially considering that Target boasts a market-beating 3.5% dividend yield, a low payout ratio, and a strong track record for recent dividend increases. Coca-Cola for the profits Like P&G, Coca-Cola is making a major structural change that it hopes will produce a leaner, more profitable, and faster-growing enterprise. Rather than sell off parts of its portfolio, though, the beverage giant is refranchising a large portion of its bottlers. Coke is aiming to produce a turnaround in the disappointing operating trends that drove volume growth of just 1% through the first two quarters of 2016. CEO Muhtar Kent and his team have identified several levers that the company can pull to achieve that goal, including focusing on emerging markets like China and India while investing heavily in non-soda brands like waters and juices. Its hefty dividend, meanwhile, should continue climbing at a steady pace as the refranchising initiative boosts profitability. Johnson & Johnson for innovation Johnson & Johnson may not pay as meaty a yield as P&G right now (2.7% vs. 3%), but that's partly because the stock is up so sharply. Shares have more than doubled over the last five years including dividend reinvestments, compared to a market-lagging 71% rise for P&G. JNJ Total Return Price data by YCharts. Its dividend growth rate is impressive, too: J&J's payout has improved at a 7% compound annual rate over the last five years and by nearly 9% over the past decade. Yet one of the best reasons to like J&J over Procter & Gamble is that, while both companies admit that innovation is critical to their entire business model, only one has demonstrated consistent success at it. Johnson & Johnson dedicates $9 billion to research and development each year and investors see the fruits of that spending: Roughly 25% of sales last year came from products that J&J introduced in just the past five years. In contrast, P&G hasn't launched a new $1 billion product in over a decade. Procter & Gamble pays one of the most dependable dividends on the market, raising it for 60 consecutive years. As impressive as that streak is, however, the latest hike was for less than $0.01 per share. Income investors have plenty of options for stronger dividend growth than that.

 Walmart might invest a billion dollars into one of Amazon's biggest rivals Avery Hartmans Sep. 28, 2016, 9:32 AM 5,388 facebook linkedin twitter email print Joe Raedle/Getty Images Walmart is fighting back against Amazon's e-commerce dominance — and it's enlisting help from the startup world to do it.  The retail giant is reportedly in talks to invest up to $1 billion in Flipkart, India's largest online retailer, according to a new report from Bloomberg's Saritha Rai. Flipkart, which is valued around $15 billion , sells everything ranging from electronics to apparel to housewares online. In January, the company was rumored to be planning an IPO, but by March, investors had lowered their valuations of the company. This isn't the first time Walmart has spent billions to gain market share online. Less than two months ago, the company spent $3 billion to buy Jet.com, a New Jersey-based e-commerce startup that had positioned itself as a rival to Amazon. The deal was meant to help boost Walmart's online business, which has struggled to gain much traction against Amazon, the leader in online retail. Walmart has generated about $14 billion in annual e-commerce sales, compared with Amazon's $99 billion in annual revenue. Now, the investment in Flipkart could go a long way toward helping both companies gain a foothold against Amazon. An investment from Walmart would not only go a long way toward helping Flipkart fight Amazon in India, but would help Walmart fight Amazon on its home turf. Flipkart is facing mounting competition in India from Amazon. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in June that the company plans to invest another $3 billion in the country, adding to the $2 billion investment the company made in 2014.

Police arrested John Bean, the 46-year-old principal of Highcrest Elementary School, on Saturday and Supt. Michael Emmett said he has been placed on administrative leave during the ongoing investigation.  New York Boy Who Offered Home to Refugee Meets President Obama Police responded to the Wal-Mart on Flatbush Avenue just after 1 p.m. on Saturday and store staff members said Bean was following children in the store and “attempting to surreptitiously photograph them,” especially when they were not with their parents, the incident report says.  One witness said the children were girls between 6 and 8 years old and Wal-Mart staff members said Bean, who has three children of his own, was holding a small toy and using it to hide his iPhone.  The police officer who responded to the scene asked Bean what he was doing and he responded that he was shopping, but he did not have a shopping cart, according to police. When the officer asked Bean if he’d been taking photos and following children, Bean diverted his eyes, tried to walk away as police said they were detaining him and he tried to resist arrest, according to the incident report. Volkswagen to Shed 30,000 Jobs to Cut Costs After Scandal The report says Bean never asked what was happening, but asked if he was under arrest and said he did not do anything.  During questioning, police asked Bean to unlock his phone so they could clear things up, but Bean refused, according to police. Authorities seized the SIM card and send the phone to a lab to check what's on it. Kanye West at Concert: 'I Would Have Voted for Trump' Police also reviewed surveillance from the store and said it appeared Bean was looking more at the aisles and people than the store merchandise. The principal was charged with interfering with an officer for resisting arrest and second-degree breach of peace, according to police.  UpdatedMissing Congressman's Son Found Safe Police said they immediately notified the Wethersfield Police Chief, as well as security for the Wethersfield Board of Education when they started to investigate and the board of education took immediate action. "I placed John Bean on administrative leave, effective September 26, 2016," Emmett said of the arrest. "It would not be appropriate for me to comment regarding the circumstances leading to Mr. Bean’s arrest, as the matter remains under investigation."

Some do try to escape on foot, as happened last week at the Kearny Walmart, but this particular suspect took a shopping cart along with him. Needless to say, he did not get far. Shortly after 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 20, Officer Michael Alvarez responded to the report of the man heading west on Harrison Ave., pushing a Walmart cart full of stolen merchandise. Cart and suspect were spotted at Harrison and Sanford Aves., just a couple of blocks from the store. When Alvarez ordered him to stop, police said he abandoned the cart and began to run. A foot pursuit ensued and ended with the man reportedly seeking refuge underneath a parked car. (Note to the flight-prone: This is not an intelligent move.) By then, backup had arrived, and Brian Blozen, 41, of Bloomfield, was taken into custody on charges of shoplifting and resisting arrest. Police said the cart contained $728 worth of assorted stolen goods. The cart itself was also listed as a purloined item. (Note to otherwise law-abiding shoppers: If you take a cart off store property, you are technically a shoplifter.)  ••• Other recent reports from the Kearny police blotter included the following: Sept. 16 Officer Jordenson Jean was on radar enforcement detail on Harrison Ave. at the N.J. Turnpike at 4 p.m. when the driver of a 2011 Jaguar stopped — reportedly in the middle of the right lane, thereby blocking traffic — to ask him for directions to Newark Airport. Police said Jean “quickly realized that the man was already flying” and during questioning he admitted to having had a few vodkas prior to driving up from Washington, D.C. Following field sobriety tests, and an Alcotest at headquarters, Paul Freed, 71, of Fort Lee, was charged with DUI, careless driving and delaying traffic. Sept. 17 At 5 a.m., Officers Dominic Dominguez and Dave Bush responded to a male-female dispute in the area of Town Hall Park. While they were attempting to gain information from the disputants, the male party — Julian Quiroz, 24, of Elizabeth — reportedly became uncooperative and tried to walk away. At that point, police said, Jonathan Fair, 39, of New Providence, confronted Quiroz and accused him of having assaulted the female. A fistfight ensued. The officers ordered the men to cease and desist, and when these commands were ignored, tried to separate the combatants. Ultimately, police said, OC spray had to be used to subdue the duo, both of whom were charged with simple assault and resisting arrest. ••• Shortly after 10 a.m., Officer John Donovan responded to a report from a concerned citizen who had just witnessed the theft of a package from a residence on the 200 block of Forest St. The culprits fled in a silver Toyota, which was soon spotted and stopped by Officer Alan Stickno at Forest and Quincy Ave. Police said the witness identified the occupants, who admitted to taking the package after seeing it being dropped off by a FedEx truck. “The truck had no sooner pulled away than the theft occurred,” a police spokesman noted. Both the wheelman, Dominic Yorke, 24, of Newark, and his companion, James Bradford, 24, of Newark, were charged with conspiracy and receiving stolen property. Bradford, who reportedly was the one who actually grabbed the package, was also charged with theft. And what was the prized merchandise?  Denims. ••• Officer Derek Hemphill responded to an 8:30 p.m. alert from Kmart that a man had attempted to steal condoms from the store and, when confronted, fled on foot. Police said that, while Kmart did not have an off-duty KPD officer working security, both nearby ShopRite and B.J.’s did, and those officers —  P.O. Esteban Gonzalez at B.J.’s, and Sgt. Michael Gonzalez at ShopRite — heard Hemphill’s BOLO and the suspect was nabbed in the B.J.’s lot following a foot pursuit. Police said the man identified himself as Tjon White, but a search incident to arrest produced some paperwork from the Irvington PD indicating that might not be his real name. Hemphill contacted Irvington and a photo of the suspect proved he was actually Troy Johnson, 48, of Newark, police said. A records check showed he also had a $250 warrant for a prior shoplifting arrest in Kearny. Johnson ended up in the Hudson County Jail on a new charge of shoplifting ($123 worth of condoms), resisting arrest and hindering apprehension. Kearny Municipal Court Judge Thomas D. McKeon added another $5,000 to the $250 bail. Sept. 19 Officer Hemphill was on patrol  at 5 p.m. when his computer alerted him that the owner of a 1993 Toyota on the 500 block of Forest St. had a suspended license and three motor vehicle warrants — two from Newark, $350 each; one from Florence, N.J., $380.  Jesus Battista, 20, of Newark, was charged on those and with the license offense, misuse of license plates and operating an unregistered and uninsured vehicle. The other jurisdictions were notified. ••• Shortly after 10 p.m., Officer Esteban Gonzalez pulled over an Illinois-registered Toyota for disregarding a red light at Kearny and Midland Aves. Driver Evgeny Maximkin, 30, of Kearny, received a summons for that offense and was also arrested — on a $448 MV warrant out of Rutherford, which was notified that he was in custody. Sept. 20 Officers Rich Poplaski and Tom Floyd executed an arrest warrant at 4:30 p.m. at a residence on the 100 block of Hoyt St., where they reportedly found the suspect — an alleged bail-jumper wanted by the Middlesex  County Court — hiding in a closet. Police said Clark Yanez, 27, of Kearny, was also found to have no-bail robbery warrant from the Hudson County Sheriff’s Office and was sent to the Hudson County Jail. Sept. 21 Officers Michael Gontarczuk and Sean Podolski, on patrol in South Kearny at 9 p.m., stopped a 1999 Audi with heavily tinted windows and a “decrepit” temporary plate — its expiration date obscured — travelling east on the Belleville Pike.  Police said driver Lordwins Barthelemy, 29, of West Orange, had a suspended license and, in plain view in the car, the officers saw a partially smoked marijuana cigar. A search incident to arrest reportedly produced a plastic bag of suspected pot, and a warrant check revealed two: $750, Union Township, driving while suspended; $500, Belleville, traffic violation. Barthelemy was charged in Kearny with: possession of pot and paraphernalia; driving while in possession of a CDS; having fictitious registration, and operating an unregistered and uninsured vehicle, along with the suspended-license and tinted-windows violations.  McKeon added $2,500 to his bail.  Sept. 22 Officer Hemphill was investigating a 1 a.m. noise complaint on the 100 block of Forest St. when he saw Kevin Demauro, 23, of Kearny, park a 2014 Ford and then stumble out of the vehicle. When the officer asked him if he was okay (he could have had pneumonia, right?),  Demauro had trouble talking and was observed clenching a small bag that appeared to contain pills, police said. Following FSTs, he was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, possession of Xanax and drug paraphernalia and possession of a CDS in a MV. ••• At 12:30 p.m., a Vice detective, reportedly aware that its driver — Glenn Yakabofski, 44, of Kearny — was in possession of a CDS, stopped a 2002 Toyota at Devon St and Garfield Ave. When Yakabofski got out, he allegedly attempted to discard a glass vial of suspected cocaine under the car. Advised that he was under arrest, he shoved the detective, refused to be cuffed and had to be taken to the ground, at which point he tried to discard a second vial, police said. Patrol units arrived as backup, and Yakabofski was arrested for possession of coke and paraphernalia, possession of a CDS in a MV, aggravated assault on a police officer and resisting arrest. Kearny EMS was summoned to HQ to attend to cuts and scrapes the suspect sustained in the struggle.

Local Submit Event Search « Hero: Townville Firefighter Jamie Brock Stops School Shooter | Main | Rising Pension Costs Hurt State, Employees » Wednesday Sep282016 Report: 50 of Americans Check Amazon When Shopping Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 9:52AM More than half of U.S. online consumers begin their product searches on Amazon.com's website or mobile app, a survey found. That means that heading into the busy holiday season, the company is advancing its lead over major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and search engines as the starting point for online shopping. Fifty-five percent of those surveyed go to Amazon first when searching for products, an increase from 44 percent a year earlier, according to a Labor Day weekend poll of 2,000 people released by the Internet marketing firm BloomReach Inc. The second annual survey showed search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, and retailers losing ground to Amazon. Search engines were the starting point for 28 percent of those surveyed, declining from 34 percent a year earlier. Specific retailers were the starting point for 16 percent, down from 21 percent. "Amazon has become the reference point for shoppers," said Jason Seeba, head of marketing for BloomReach. "Shoppers will go to Amazon first to find a product and check prices." The survey results are bad news for Wal-Mart and other retailers trying to make headway against Amazon in online shopping. E-commerce sales are expected to increase 13 percent to $385 billion this year, according to eMarketer. Wal-Mart last month agreed to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion, its biggest attempt yet to catch up. Amazon Prime, the Seattle-based company's $99-a-year subscription that includes delivery discounts, video and music streaming and online photo storage, has been key to overshadowing competitors in the minds of consumers, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Blackledge estimates Amazon had 49 million prime members in August and subscription growth is accelerating. Amazon has added free same-day delivery and two-hour delivery to Prime subscriptions, as well as food delivery in many cities, increasing the value of membership. "Amazon keeps adding layers and is innovating at a faster pace than everyone, especially with Prime," Blackledge said. "Prime members have the Amazon app on the front screen of their smartphones. That definitely hurts Wal-Mart." Alphabet Inc., owner of the Google search engine, can withstand the pressure from Amazon because its advertising revenue is diversified, including video ads on streaming site YouTube, said Ali Mogharabi, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service. "This trend has been taking place for the past four or five years and it has still not hurt Google search," he said.

One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation. He added Wal-Mart and Flipkart were also contemplating a collaboration that would see them leverage each other's expertise in retail and supply chains in India. Both sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon, which has been expanding rapidly in the South Asian country's retail market and is now Flipkart's biggest competitor. Wal-Mart only operates wholesale stores in India. "With Amazon slowly taking a lead over the Indian players, all these unicorns including Flipkart and Snapdeal are out there in the market to raise funds," the source said. "Companies like Wal-Mart would be more long-term investors, but there aren't too many like them to write such big cheques." Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc . The company was valued at as much as $15 billion earlier this year, but cut-throat competition, reduced private funding, and elusive profitability is putting pressure on e-commerce players in India. Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. Flipkart and smaller rival Snapdeal have been looking to raise fresh capital to compete with deep-pocketed Amazon in an industry that relies on steep discounts on products and heavy spending on marketing, technology and delivery networks to lure customers. India's Economic Times newspaper, which first reported the talks on Tuesday, said a meeting between the two sides was scheduled for this week. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China's JD.com, giving the U.S. firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd .

(Reuters/Kevork Djansezian) Share Written by Suneera Tandon September 28, 2016 Quartz india The world’s largest retailer might make a big play for India’s $22-billion (pdf) e-commerce market. Walmart is in preliminary talks to invest up to $1 billion in India’s largest online retailer, Flipkart, in exchange for a minority stake in the Bengaluru-based e-commerce company, according to several media reports published on Sept. 28. The two companies have held early talks and may be meeting sometime this week to take the discussion forward, The Economic Times newspaper reported quoting unidentified sources. “As a policy, we don’t comment on speculative reports,” a Walmart India spokesperson said. A Flipkart spokesperson also refused to comment on what she labelled as “rumours.” The investment could come at the perfect time for the Indian company as it struggles to raise fresh funding at its desired valuation, even as several investors have devalued it. The deal could also help Flipkart in its battle against the Indian arm of American e-commerce giant Amazon. While Flipkart grapples with poor investor sentiment, Amazon has been making big bets on India. In June 2016, the American online giant announced an additional investment of $3 billion (Rs20,000 crore) in India, taking the company’s total monetary commitment to the country to $5 billion—far more than the total funds raised by Flipkart (around $3.2 billion) and homegrown rival, Snapdeal (around $1.7 billion). For Walmart, which has been in the Indian market for over a decade, this potential deal may finally provide the push needed to grow beyond the brick-and-mortar business, helping it expand its network in India’s online retail market, much like it did in China with JD.com. Since it entered India in 2007, Walmart has been struggling with strict government regulations that have hindered its growth in the country’s $600-billion retail market. India does not allow 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in supermarket chains. The American retailer first partnered with Bharti Retail to open Best Price Modern wholesale stores (that allow small businesses and shops to buy in bulk, 100% FDI is allowed in such a business) in India. In 2013, the partnership fell through following differences between the two companies. What’s more, the partnership battled corruption allegations as Walmart’s top employees were accused of bribing officials to get stores opened. Since then, Walmart has been on a solo journey in India, cleaning up its act and awaiting government policies that would make it easier to invest fully in front-end supermarket stores. Meanwhile, it has remained in the wholesale business, running 21 such stores across India. In 2014, it decided to grow its wholesale business online, linking its in-store inventory to its websites. Now, a partnership with Flipkart can potentially propel it into an entirely different orbit. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Home Industry Companies Walmart may invest $1 billion in Flipkart to battle Amazon Walmart may invest $1 billion in Flipkart to battle Amazon Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is in advanced discussions to invest as much as $1 billion into Flipkart. By: FE Online | Updated: September 28, 2016 5:39 PM Last week Flipkart crossed the 100-million registered users mark, becoming the first e-commerce company in the country to hit the milestone. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is in advanced discussions to invest as much as $1 billion into Flipkart. According to Bloomberg, Walmart would take a minority stake in Flipkart, final terms of the deal have not been worked out and negotiations are still underway, a person familiar with the matter said. According to a research firm CB insights, Flipkart’s most recent valuation was $16 billion. The deal would help the two companies battle Amazon.com. Last week Flipkart crossed the 100-million registered users mark, becoming the first e-commerce company in the country to hit the milestone. The Bengaluru-based company has doubled its user base over the last year and added 25 million users in the past six months alone. One of the most valued start-ups in the country, Flipkart has Tiger Global, Accel Partners, Morgan Stanley and T Rowe among its investors. The company has raised over $3 billion in funding so far and has acquired companies like Myntra, PhonePe, and LetsBuy. It has also invested in start-ups like Cube26, NestAway, and BlackBuck. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch Report pegged Flipkart as the leader with over 43 per cent market share. It forecast that by 2019, Flipkart would increase its share to 44 percent. On the other hand, Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. The company had entered into an equal joint venture with Sunil Bharti, Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises. However, in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. Walmart operates 21 Best Price wholesale offline stores in nine states in India. Please Wait while comments are loading...

It happened at the store in Mcdonough, Georgia just south of Atlanta. A family requested the police-themed cake for an officer’s retirement party. The Walmart workers apparently thought the request was racist and refused to make it. A friend of the officer’s family posted the story online and it caused quite a stir. Even the city’s police chief had something to say about it. “Officers go out and put their lives on the line for people, regardless of color, creed, sex, or national origin. It doesn’t matter to us.” Walmart has since issued this statement: “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We’ve reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies.” The manager of the store reached out to the officer’s family and offered to make the cake, but another store had already taken care of it. Walmart then donated some things for the retirement party along with a gift card. Take Our Poll ❯❯ Click the Icon below to share this post...

Photo by Wes Woods II/Los Angeles Daily News By Wes Woods, Los Angeles Daily News Posted: 09/29/16, 8:27 AM PDT | Updated: on 09/29/2016 # Comments The pursuit ended near Walmart in Panorama City, according to media reports. (Image via Google Earth) A police pursuit ended with a stolen Toyota Prius crashing in Panorama City Thursday and the driver being taken into custody, authorities said. The chase started at 7:30 a.m. and ended about an hour later, said Officer Liliana Preciado of the Los Angeles Police Department. At various points, the pursuit snaked onto the 5 and 118 freeways as well as surface streets in Arleta, Van Nuys and Panorama City. The chase began in the San Fernando Valley after police officers spotted a black Toyota Prius driving erratically. They ran the vehicle’s license plates and determined the car was stolen, said Sgt. Greg Bruce of the LAPD. As officers followed the Prius, the driver sped away and let a female passenger out of the car, Bruce said. At one point, the driver hit another vehicle at an intersection, NBC Los Angeles reported as its news helicopter followed the pursuit from the air. A Los Angeles police cruiser then rammed the side of the Prius. But the man behind the wheel kept going. He drove onto the sidewalk and almost hit a couple of pedestrians before crashing into a planter near a tree at Willis Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard in Panorama City, according to police. The man was “uncooperative” and “combative,” and officers used a Taser to subdue him, Bruce said. Witnesses watched as the arrest unfolded. John Yoo, 37, was with friends across the street from the accident location in Panorama City and said he came outside after hearing helicopters. “I saw him in custody,” Yoo said of the man. He said the intersection of Willis and Roscoe has accidents nearly once a week, so “it’s always something.” Near the crash site, a woman was treated for a medical emergency unrelated to the chase, Bruce said. During the pursuit, the woman was standing in the grass next to the sidewalk, and was protected by the large planter and jumped back. A second woman was on the sidewalk with a stroller and baby when the pursuit ended. The woman and child were able to escape unharmed, Bruce said.

General Electric, where my mother worked for almost 18 years, helped put five siblings through school, food on the table, clothes on our backs, and provided a pension for my mother who is now in her 70s. It gave access to health resources for a sister with cancer, allowed brothers to thrive, and a single mother to be triumphant in economic hard times. Now GE is gone and Walmart has a proposal to clean up whatever is underneath the slabs of concrete that have been empty for many years. Let's do some fact-checking: — Waterstone will invest $14 million to rehabilitate the site with a DEP-mandated stormwater system. — Major upgrades are promised, adding trees and landscaping, and a light at the Tyler/Dalton/Woodlawn intersection. — Total investment is approximately $31 million, all of it private sector money, not Pittsfield tax dollars. — Walmart is already here and is part of the "Cop On Top" fundraiser that in 2014 raised $52,000 for the Special Olympics. Since it arrived in 2010 it has amassed more than $400,000 for the Special Olympics. — Approximately $500,000 in property tax revenue will be generated annually for the city — Approximately 350 construction jobs over two years will be provided in addition to 85-100 new full- and part-time jobs for a total of 300 jobs. — There will be easy access to comparable pricing on food, clothing, eye care, prescriptions, and automotive needs. But, what really makes me a believer in this center is the fact that Al Maiorino from Public Strategy Group Inc. stopped by my house to see me, look across the vast space, and ask what my concerns were and what ideas could I give to him to utilize and help make the center right for Tyler Street business. That in essence told me that Walmart, Woodlawn Crossing, and Public Strategy Group want what's best for my neighborhood, the place I call home, and the place I want to see grow and provide a prosperous future for us all and the next generation.

Walmart Worker Accused Of Setting Multiple Fires Inside The Same Store Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Worker Accused Of Setting Multiple Fires Inside The Same Store Image courtesy of Great Beyond September 29, 2016 1:23 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk bad consumers crime fire firestarter retail walmart Things got a bit heated at a Walmart in Massachusetts recently, after a employee allegedly set three fires inside the store. Police responded to the store around 5:25 p.m. on Tuesday after a report of a fire in the store’s jewelry section, MassLive.com reports. When they arrived they found it wasn’t just the one fire — there were three set throughout the store. “All three fires had been extinguished by Walmart staff and several customers who used the fire extinguishers that were located throughout the store,” police said, adding that no one was injured. After officials determined that the fires had been deliberately set, the suspect seen on a surveillance video was identified as an employee. She had been seen fleeing the scene in a car, police said, so investigators called her to ask her to come back to the store. She hung up on them, but turned herself in the next day and was arrested. She’s now facing three counts of burning a building’s contents, three counts of destruction of property over $250, and one count each of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. The store had to close to deal with smoke and fire damage.

(MGI) &amp; Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 14, 2016 Posted on September 29, 2016 by Bronstein, Gewirtz and Grossman, LLC in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / September 29, 2016 / Bronstein, Gewirtz &amp; Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a securities class action has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on behalf of those who purchased shares of MoneyGram International Inc. (“MoneyGram” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: MGI) pursuant and/or traceable to the secondary public offering completed on or around April 2, 2014 (the “Offering”). This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The Complaint alleges that MoneyGram allegedly made false and misleading statements and omissions regarding Walmart’s possible entry into the money transfer business and the likely effect it would have on the Company. On April 17, 2014, two weeks after the Offering, Walmart publicized that it was initiating its own money transfer service on April 24, 2014. Following this news, MoneyGram’s stock dropped close to 30%. No Class has yet been certified in the above action.

The original incidents occurred during the nighttime hours between Thursday September 22, 2016 and Saturday September 24, 2016 when two separate vehicles were broken into located in the 1300 block of South State Street and the 1700 block of Windswept Court.  The suspects, who were later identified as Pablo Jackson, 32 (Homeless), and Joshua L. Bryant, 25 of Cheswold, removed items such as cash and purses from the vehicles.  The two then began making credit card purchases from the Cheswold Walmart as well as the Camden Walmart totaling more than $3,400.00.  Detectives were able to identify the two suspects through store surveillance and Theft and Identity Theft warrants were obtained for their arrest. On Wednesday September 28, 2016, a trooper and probation officer assigned to the State Police Kent County Governor’s Task Force (GTF) were actively patrolling the area of South DuPont Highway (US13) and Lochmeath Way, when they observed Pablo Jackson walking northbound on the southbound shoulder of US13.  As the task force members made a U-turn in an attempt to make contact with Jackson, he was observed looking into vehicles near the South Side Baptist Church (4904 South DuPont Highway).  When the trooper and probation officer began to exit the patrol vehicle in the driveway, in which Jackson was walking out, he turned and began running away from the two and discarded the backpack he was carrying.  The trooper gave numerous commands for Jackson to stop, but he continued to flee until the trooper caught him and took him into custody without further incident.  A search of Jackson’s backpack revealed 24 bags of heroin (0.36 grams) along with drug paraphernalia. Joshua Bryant Pablo Jackson was transported back to Troop 3 where he was charged with Resisting Arrest, Possession of a Controlled Substance (Heroin), and two counts of Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.  He was also charged with 18 counts of Identity Theft, five counts of Attempted Identity Theft, 18 counts of Unauthorized Use of a Credit Card, five counts of Attempted Unauthorized Use of a Credit Card, two counts of Theft Under $1500, 10 counts of Theft by False Pretense Under $1500, Conspiracy 2nd, and two counts of Criminal Trespass 3rd.  He was arraigned at JP2 and committed to Sussex Correctional Institution on a total of $93,600 cash bond. Joshua Bryant has yet to be located and is wanted for numerous counts of ID Theft and other associated charges, as well as multiple court capiases.  If anyone has any information on his whereabouts, they are asked to contact Detective A. Goode at 302-698-8517. Information may also be provided by calling Delaware Crime Stoppers at 1-800-TIP-3333, via the internet at www.delaware.crimestoppersweb.com, or by sending an anonymous tip by text to 274637 (CRIMES) using the keyword “DSP.”   TAGS identity theft joshua bryant Pablo Jackson Wanted SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleFire Prevention Week Set for Oct. 9 – 15 Next articleHere Comes Oyster Season in Maryland Randi Miller http://www.wgmd.com Randi has been called the most recognized voice in Washington DC, having been the voice of the Metrorail system since winning the honor in 2006 over 1,258 competitors across the country.

The nearly 152,000-square-foot store, located at 1750 Nottingham Way, will house a full line of groceries as well as other merchandise and a full pharmacy. "Everyone has been working so hard to make sure our store is ready to meet our community's needs," store manager A.J. Riaz said. "We hope that once our customers see... what's to come, they'll be as excited as we are." This will be the fourth Walmart in Mercer County and the second in Hamilton. Walmart opens hiring center "Many factors go into the decision to choose a location for a new Walmart store, but the main consideration is meeting the needs of our customers," Phillip Keene, a Walmart spokesperson, said. "We look for areas where we can offer customers a greater selection of merchandise, convenience and affordability than they had before. "We have a great customer base in the area, and we are looking to provide them with even more convenient shopping options," Keene said. With new business comes new employment opportunities as well. Keene says that this supercenter — like almost all others — will employ approximately 300 full- and part-time associates.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:35 PM, September 28, 2016 Updated: 6:20 PM, September 29, 2016 MUMBAI/HONG KONG - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in talks to buy a minority stake in India's largest e-commerce firm Flipkart, two people familiar with the matter said, as the world's biggest retailer aims to break into a fast growing but highly competitive online retail market. One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc, which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year. Wal-Mart operates 21 wholesale stores in the South Asian country, but is discouraged from setting up its own bricks-and-mortar shops by rules that limit foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers to 51 percent and the cost of setting up shops in a country as large as India. For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India. Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm, said it was natural for Wal-Mart to want to partner with Flipkart. "India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive," he said. If a deal is agreed, Wal-Mart would join other foreign strategic investors in India's online players. China's Alibaba Group Holding, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp and Taiwan's Foxconn last year led an investment of $500 million in Flipkart's smaller rival Snapdeal. Alibaba is also the biggest shareholder in India's One97 Communications, which operates payments services and an e-commerce market place under the PayTM trade name. The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. CUT-THROAT COMPETITION Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country. Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart. But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centers. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015. The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then. Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc, down from as much as $15 billion earlier this year. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China's JD.com Inc, giving the U.S. firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Alibaba Group.

One of the sources said the US retailer was looking to invest between US$750mil (RM3bil) and US$1bil (RM4.1bil) in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the company's overall valuation. He added Wal-Mart and Flipkart were also contemplating a collaboration that would see them leverage each other's expertise in retail and supply chains in India. Both sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against US rival Amazon, which has been expanding rapidly in the South Asian country's retail market and is now Flipkart's biggest competitor. Wal-Mart only operates wholesale stores in India. "With Amazon slowly taking a lead over the Indian players, all these unicorns including Flipkart and Snapdeal are out there in the market to raise funds," the source said. "Companies like Wal-Mart would be more long-term investors, but there aren't too many like them to write such big cheques." Flipkart has been valued at about US$11.5bil (RM47.2bil), local media reported last month, citing a US regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc. The company was valued at as much as US$15bil (RM61.7bil) earlier this year, but cut-throat competition, reduced private funding, and elusive profitability is putting pressure on e-commerce players in India. Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. Flipkart and smaller rival Snapdeal have been looking to raise fresh capital to compete with deep-pocketed Amazon in an industry that relies on steep discounts on products and heavy spending on marketing, technology and delivery networks to lure customers. The Economic Times newspaper, which first reported the talks on Tuesday, said a meeting between the two sides was scheduled for this week. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5% stake in China's JD.com, giving the US firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Facebook buys facial recognition tech startup Huawei eyes Africa with Nova Merkel says old must learn from tech-savvy young in digital age Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Beware!

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 29 September 2016 Wal-Mart in talks to invest up to US$1bil in Flipkart BANGALURU: Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in advanced discussions to invest as much as US$1bil in India’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt, as the two companies battle Amazon.com Inc in e-commerce, according to a person familiar with the matter. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, would take a minority stake in Flipkart under the proposed agreement, the person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Final terms of the deal have not been worked out and negotiations are still under way, the person said. Flipkart’s most recent valuation was about US$16bil, according to research firm CB Insights. Flipkart is the largest online retailer in India, but its lead has been under assault as Amazon steps up investments in the country. Chief executive officer Jeff Bezos said in June he planned to spend a further US$3bil in India to gain customers in the fast-growing market. A deal with Wal-Mart would give Flipkart additional capital to fight back and more expertise in battling the e-commerce pioneer. “If the deal goes through, the competitive intensity between Flipkart and Amazon will shoot up,” said Gautam Chhaochharia, the Mumbai-based head of India research at UBS AG. The deal has potential benefits for Wal-Mart too. Beyond any eventual financial return on its investment, Wal-Mart would gain exposure to India’s expanding e-commerce market and have the opportunity to challenge Amazon on more equal footing than the US. A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart said she could not immediately provide comment. A Flipkart spokesman said, “It is our policy not to comment on rumours or speculations.” India is the next big potential retail prize after the US and China, where foreign players have made little progress against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. India’s online market will expand at an average of 45% annually in the next four years and reach US$28bil by 2020, according to estimates from Kotak Institutional Equities. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had earlier established a retail joint venture in India with Bharti Group, which runs the country’s largest telecommunications operator Bharti Airtel. But the business failed to take off and Wal-Mart eventually sold its stake to its partner. If a Flipkart deal materialises, Wal-Mart would be able to support its new ally with money and its decades of retail experience. “With its main competitor Amazon getting very aggressive, Flipkart needs a solid partner to bolster its operations with not just capital but also branding, logistics, sourcing and other retail experience, they won’t be able to pull it off with small partners,” said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive officer of the Gurgaon-based retail consultancy Third Eyesight.

Schneiderman to implement new quality control measures for its herbal supplements sold nationwide. The announcement made Wednesday comes more than a year after the attorney general ordered Walmart, Walgreens, Target and GNC stores to pull store-brand herbal supplements off their shelves after DNA tests showed few or none of the listed herbs in the products. The findings included NBTY-manufactured supplements sold at Walgreens and Walmart. Most Popular Korean firm leaves Stony Brook, Start-Up NY Mortgage rates jump after Trump election LI vitamin maker NBTY changes its name Chili's manager takes away vet's free meal Zwanger-Pesiri to pay $8M in plea deal Under the agreement, NBTY will phase in DNA bar coding on herbal ingredients within two years and invest no less than $250,000 in herbal authenticity genetic research. The agreement also requires NBTY to implement annual testing to detect allergens, such as peanuts, milk, soy, eggs, and wheat. And it requires ingredient makers to submit to third-party certification and double on-site audits of major suppliers. The attorney general’s office did not find evidence that NBTY failed to comply with FDA requirements or industry standards, NBTY general counsel Stratis Philippis said in a statement. “While it is NBTY’s position that DNA testing of herbal dietary supplements is an emerging science in developmental stages, NBTY and the [attorney general] have a shared commitment to promote the development of the most accurate, reliable standards and testing methods,” Philippis said. “We hope this will help create reliable DNA testing that could be an additional tool for authenticity testing of herbal raw materials for our entire industry.” “When consumers take an herbal supplement, they should be able to do so confident that the plant on the label is the plant in the bottle,” Schneiderman said in a statement. “Consumers can only have that confidence if the companies that sell herbal supplements employ the best and most reliable testing measures for combating fraud and ruling out dangerous allergens.” advertisement | advertise on newsday NBTY’s brands include Sundown Natural, Nature’s Bounty, Pure Protein, Osteo Bi-Flex, and Ester-C.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe Did Your Customers Get Tattoos of Your Logo? These Did. KFC | Youtube Rose Leadem Online Editorial Assistant Would you get inked for your favorite brand? You’d be surprised how many people actually answer “yes.” For many people, having a brand’s logo tattooed on them is an embodiment of the impact that company has made on their lives. For others, these logo tattoos are just for “fun.” Check out these 10 companies who have inspired customers to get inked. 1 / 8 Tough Mudder | Twitter Tough Mudder It’s not uncommon for a diehard Tough Mudder competitor -- or even just a fan -- to get inked with the logo. Tough Mudder encourages it. After someone gets the logo tattooed, he or she is instructed to submit a copy of the receipt so they can be awarded free entry to the next Tough Mudder competition. 2 / 8 Anytime Fitness | Twitter Anytime Fitness Much like Tough Mudder, 24-hour fitness franchise Anytime Fitness encourages and reimburses customers who brand their bodies with the “running man” logo. But to Anytime Fitness and its brand evangelists, the tattoo is more than just a logo -- it’s a symbol of their “Anytime Story,” a time when they overcame an obstacle or reached a goal. Since May of this year, more than 3,000 people got Anytime Fitness tattoos. 3 / 8 Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images Apple Even though Apple is one of the most popular brands ever, it’s still surprising to see how many people take their loyalty a step further. One loyal fan says he got his Apple tattoo in honor of his wife -- because they shared the same anniversary date as Apple's founding. The Virgin Mary and her sacred Apple tattoo by Sweety Follow @sweetytattoo to see more of… https://t.co/2MbJxDNq3x pic.twitter.com/UIosMgUKCW— NYHC Tattoo (@NYHCtattoo) September 11, 2016 Others -- well -- they must simply love Apple, getting tattoos ranging from the company’s early rainbow-filled logo to MacBook power buttons. Check some out here. 4 / 8 Bloomberg | Getty Images Wal-Mart Apparently, Wal-Mart has a few diehard fans too. The “Save Money. Live Better.” motto must have really spoken to these customers -- at least enough to convince them that a tattoo was in order. If Trump's brand was the sum of all his voters it'd be this Wal Mart tattoo. pic.twitter.com/EeAkCK8Xbx— Kenny Ellsworth (@kenny_ellsworth) June 15, 2016 5 / 8 Stian Ytterdahl | Facebook McDonald’s These people must really be lovin’ it. From golden arches to happy meals -- McDonald’s fans get pretty crafty with their tattoos.   One fan’s “artistic” endeavors even circulated the news. Norwegian teenager Stian Ytterdah got his McDonald’s receipt tattooed on his right arm as a “joke” with his friends. But a week later, he got the same receipt tattooed on his left arm, reports ABC News. 6 / 8 Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Since its bubbly beginnings in 1886, the refreshing beverage brand took the world by storm. It hasn’t lost momentum since. A number of people get the long-lived Coca-cola logo tattooed on their bodies -- but to many it’s more than just a “logo,” it’s a fashion statement. Check out some "refreshing" Cola tattoos here. 7 / 8 KFC | Youtube KFC That “Finger Lickin’ Goodness” is irresistible to some customers, so much so that they decided to get it stamped on their bodies forever. One superfan even agreed to get a KFC Double Down sandwich tattooed on his leg for a commercial. Referred to by KFC as the “Ultimate KFC Double Down Fan,” the unnamed man reminisces about the first time he tried the sandwich while on the first date with his girlfriend. “I guess that’s how it all started,” he says in the video. 8 / 8 John Hawkins via Wordpress Wordpress For Jeff Matson, Wordpress is more than just a web platform: “Wordpress is a way of life,” he states on his blog. Matson says that Wordpress changed his life and taught him that he can do, create and be anything. Wordpress won’t live on forever, Matson says, which is why he got something to remind him of it. Matson’s not the only one who feels this way about Wordpress either. Check out Wordpress’ fan art page for a list of other customers who got the “W” logo inked on their bodies.

So Mwirotsi took action. She drove to Walmart and bought each of them one. As it turned out, the woman and her family were refugees who had been in the United States less than three months. “She had to find a job to pay back her ticket fare, she couldn’t speak or write any English, and she was being kicked out of her place,” Mwirotsi said. “So I set out to help her find a job, and since then, I’ve focused on helping refugee families relocate better.” Mwirotsi started collecting anything that might help ease a family’s transition—from clothes and towels to toiletries and furniture—but quickly realized the children of these families needed something more. The majority of the African children she knew were typically grouped together with African-American children, which Mwirotsi says created a big problem. “They’re not the same thing, and each group has different issues,” she said. “For Africans, English is usually a second language, they are from below-poverty homes with high illiteracy rates and there are usually no high school or college graduates within the home. “The result is that many African kids don’t feel comfortable or fit in at school or after-school programs.” Without direction or a sense of belonging, and because of an often complex set of issues at home, Mwirotsi noticed many refugee children were getting into trouble. So in 2010, she called Freedom for Youth Ministries in Des Moines and asked if she could use their space to start an African dance class for the kids on Saturdays. More than 20 showed up to the first classes and Freedom for Youth adopted it as part of its weekly programming. Mwirotsi saw swift improvements in attitude and behavior from kids who attended, which naturally made her want to do even more. Then she met Pastor John Kline of Zion Lutheran Church and learned that his church was providing ESL [English as a second language] classes, food and clothing to hundreds of refugee kids and their families across Iowa. Each Wednesday evening, the church hosted 200-300 children, offering dinner and activities. Seeing what other members of the community were doing, Mwirotsi—who has always been passionate about education and technology—thought long and hard about how else she could help. “I wanted to help intelligent kids who happened to be refugees by providing opportunities and keeping them in school,” she said. “I wanted to empower them and give them knowledge so that they could create change around them. To me, the model for these kids was: ‘Okay, you came from Africa and a refugee camp. Your opportunities here are a blessing. How can you take advantage of them?’” Her solution for empowerment? Coding. Mwirotsi was already helping her young daughter use Khan Academy, a nonprofit educational website, for coding lessons. She had friends and colleagues focused on technology use in Kenya, and she had recently been inspired by a TEDxVienna talk about SMS-based solutions for smartphones in Africa. Additionally, she knew that some of the best-paying careers were in the STEM fields. Mwirotsi realized that learning coding skills now could open doors for the kids she worked with down the road. The initial problem At first, Mwirotsi had no funding to get a coding class or program like the one she envisioned off the ground. True to her nature, she didn’t let that stop her. “When I have passion for something, I figure out a way to do it,” she said. Late last year, Mwirotsi reached out to local colleges and universities to see if any of them could help. She put together a proposal for the program she had decided to call “Pi 515: Pursuit of Innovation“—515 representing the area code of Des Moines, the home base of many of the refugees she knows—and circulated it to everyone she knew. Initially, Mwirotsi aimed to reach 20 middle and high school refugee students. The goal was to support them as they learned to write computer code for an app or website that would help alleviate hunger or address some unmet community need. In addition, the program also would provide adult mentoring and college prep. A week before Pi 515‘s first class in early April, Mwirotsi panicked. “We didn’t have a teacher yet,” she explained. “We couldn’t pay for one either. I knew the important thing was to get started, though, and we could just focus on the basics at the beginning.” So Mwirotsi continued preparing for the class. Then during a conversation with Matthew Brown—a fellow church-goer at Zion—she happened to mention the new program was in need of a volunteer teacher. Much to Mwirotsi’s surprise, Brown responded that he taught computer science and immediately offered to instruct the class for free. Releasing the burdens of the past, looking to the future Students learn to code through Pi 515, a program for refugee children living in Des Moines.  So far, 35 students are enrolled in Pi 515, but Mwirotsi continues to receive calls from additional parents wanting to sign their kids up. The classes—offered twice a month on Saturday mornings—focus on coding for the first half then bring in community mentors and leaders to speak about relevant topics, such as how to dress for work and what goes into starting a business, for the second half. Mwirotsi eventually hopes to offer classes more frequently and to expand lessons to include even more areas like computer repair. Currently the biggest challenge she faces is cost. As a free program, Pi 515 incurs a lot of hidden expenses that must somehow be covered. “Transportation is coming out of my own pocket, but we can’t afford not to do it…We have to step up,” Mwirotsi said. She also makes sure each child gets something to eat during their classes. “So often, they come and they haven’t had breakfast and maybe they won’t get lunch, and then are they focused? No. So I figure out a way to provide something.” She wanted to hold classes at Creative Visions in Des Moines, but the space wasn’t big enough and there weren’t enough computers. Right now, classes are held at different locations around the city. But for the program to grow to Mwirotsi’s dream size of about 100 students, it’ll need a new home base. She’s still working to secure partnerships with and support from Des Moines University, Grandview University and Des Moines Public Schools. And going forward, Mwirotsi hopes more local mentors and instructors will step up to share their knowledge with her classes. In the meantime, Mwirotsi gives all she can to the kids of Pi 515, utilizing every ounce of support she can gather here in Iowa. She recently brought six high school students—including two brothers who want to be engineers and a young woman interested in becoming a doctor—to the Iowa Youth Institute at the World Food Prize, where they learned how to make biodiesel and dissect corn as well as watched student presentations and spoke with professors about scholarships. One of the students, a 10th-grader named Olive, has already finished all her high school required math courses as well as two advanced math classes. Her plan was to simply to finish high school, but after attending the Institute, she felt inspired to take pre-calculus and consider applying to colleges. “I’m just trying to get them to dream bigger and be inspired to contribute to their world,” Mwirotsi said. “They have to release the burdens of the past and look to the future.” For more information about how to support Pi 515, contact Nancy Mwirotsi. -siliconprairienews.com/ Tweet Filed under Diaspora News, Habari za Nyumbani · Tagged with Comments are closed.

EMBED </>More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://abc13.com/video/embed/?pid=1530237" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> A man claims he was denied an Uber ride because of his service dog. (KTRK) KTRK Wednesday, September 28, 2016 NASHVILLE, TN (KTRK) -- An Uber driver has been suspended after allegations that the driver denied an MTSU student a ride after arriving to pick him up, finding out he was blind, and not allowing his guide dog inside of her car. Thomas Jones, who has retinitis pigmentosa, said he takes Uber all the time due to his inability to see well enough to drive. On Sunday, Jones took an Uber to Walmart to get groceries and dog food for his guide dog, Blake, but when he ordered an Uber to leave Walmart, the Uber driver allegedly told Jones that the dog could not ride in the car unless it was in a cage. "Usually when they pull up, I just open the door and he gets in and I get in behind him," Jones said of his dog Blake, during normal Uber rides. Jones said the Uber driver at Walmart ended up canceling his trip and driving away, leaving him stranded with no ride. Jones called police who arrived on scene, and he filed a police report before the officers drove him home. Representatives from Uber said drivers have to review and agree to guidelines before giving rides. One of those guidelines is that service animals should always be allowed in Uber cars. Uber is currently looking into the incident in Murfreesboro with Jones, and if they find that the Uber driver did indeed deny a ride to Jones based on the fact that he had a service dog, then they will revoke the driver's ability to drive for Uber.

Walmart May Invest $1B In Flipkart To Fight Amazon Overseas Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart May Invest $1B In Flipkart To Fight Amazon Overseas September 28, 2016 12:21 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler gaining on Amazon walmart jet.com Flipkart investment retail online retail e-commerce amazon Walmart’s apparent plan to become more like Amazon wasn’t realized when the company launched its $50/year Prime-rival Shipping Pass or after the company snatched up e-commerce site Jet.com for $3.3 billion. But not one to give up, the big box retailer is now reportedly in talks to invest more than $1 billion in fellow Amazon competitor Flipkart.  If the hefty investment becomes a reality, Walmart would become a minority stakeholder in India-based Flipkart, Bloomberg reports, citing the all-powerful “person familiar with the matter.” Flipkart, which is the largest online retailer in India, would gain additional capital to stave off Amazon’s growing presence in the country. Analysts tell Bloomberg that if the deal goes through, the competitive intensity between Flipkart and Amazon would increase significantly. “With its main competitor Amazon getting very aggressive, Flipkart needs a solid partner to bolster its operations with not just capital but also branding, logistics, sourcing and other retail experience, they won’t be able to pull it off with small partners,” Devangshu Dutta, chief executive officer for retail consultancy Third Eyesight, tells Bloomberg. The deal could also prove helpful for Walmart, which stands to increase its exposure in India. Spokespeople for both Walmart and Flipkart did not provide comment on the possible deal.

A 25-year-old Florida man is behind bars after police found him asleep Friday morning in a Walmart parking lot behind the wheel of a stolen truck. Robert Hardister told police he’d borrowed the 1998 black Ford F-150 from a friend to move furniture to his new apartment. He’d paid the friend $20, he said. >> Read more Floridoh! stories  >> Read more trending stories  He parked in the Walmart parking lot to get some sleep before a construction gig later that day. Hardister said he didn’t know the truck was stolen, but police still charged him with vehicle theft. He has pleaded guilty to multiple theft charges and spent time in jail for them in the last few years, court records show. Hardister is being held in the Palm Beach County jail on a $4,500 bond, according to court records. Hardister’s distinctive mug shot shows his face nearly covered in tattoos. If photos from previous bookings in the Palm Beach County Jail are an indication, Hardister appears to have gotten most of the facial ink since Feb. 15, 2013, when he was arrested by Tequesta police for an out of town warrant. In that mugshot, Hardister sports only a tear drop under his right eye and a tattoo on the right side of his neck. Eleven months later when arrested by Palm Beach County Sheriff’s deputies on a fraud charge, Hardister had added a tattoo to the left side of his neck. Hardister’s mugshot on Feb. 17, 2013, after an arrest on several charges including burglary shows added artwork including a star under his right eye and lettering on his neck, left cheek and chin. By the time Hardister was arrested in July for a probation violation, his face was almost entirely tatted up, leaving only a small area on the right side of his face without ink. Hardister did not show any new markings on his face following his arrest Friday by Jupiter police for alleged vehicle theft. But his hair — brown in previous mugshots — had been bleached blonde.

Bakery workers told the woman the cake was “racist,” to which she wasn’t quite sure how to respond. “I was so shocked,” the woman, who did not want to share her name, said. “I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” The bakery manager ended up making the cake, and the retail giant said in a statement, “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We’re glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right.” It’s unclear if the workers will face any disciplinary action. [ Fox News ] Filed Under: Gun Bazaar, Police mate556 That is fine. Personally, I would rather have someone upfront tell me that they aren’t going to make me some type of food, because of who I am or what I do, than have that same person do something to what I am going to eat. Have them fired, that is a given. But really, what are the numbers of people that do this in comparison to the numbers that don’t, but have the same opinion and intend to mess with your food. I have never understood why American cops eat out in uniform. Edeco Yeah, lucky they didn’t get a special ingredient. I’m not surprised by cops eating out in uniform… they’re a little myopic about their image, and the places that will give them freebies or fawn over them are, you know, some evidence to believe they’re getting clean food, if one wants to believe and not think too hard about it.

Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, would take a minority stake in Flipkart under the proposed agreement, the person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Final terms of the deal have not been worked out and negotiations are still underway, the person said. Flipkart's most recent valuation was about $16 billion (roughly Rs. 1,06,356 crores), according to research firm CB Insights. Flipkart is the largest online retailer in India, but its lead has been under assault as Amazon steps up investments in the country. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said in June he plans to spend another $3 billion in India to gain customers in the fast-growing market. A deal with Wal-Mart would give Flipkart additional capital to fight back and more expertise in battling the e-commerce pioneer. "If the deal goes through, the competitive intensity between Flipkart and Amazon will shoot up," said Gautam Chhaochharia, the Mumbai-based head of India research at UBS AG.The deal has potential benefits for Wal-Mart too. Beyond any eventual financial return on its investment, Wal-Mart would gain exposure to India's expanding e-commerce market and have the opportunity to challenge Amazon on more equal footing than the US. A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart said she could not immediately provide comment. A Flipkart spokesman said, "It is our policy not to comment on rumors or speculations." India is the next big potential retail prize after the US and China, where foreign players have made little progress against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. India's online market will expand at an average of 45 percent annually in the next four years and reach $28 billion by 2020, according to estimates from Kotak Institutional Equities. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had earlier established a retail joint venture in India with Bharti Group, which runs the country's largest telecommunications operator Bharti Airtel. But the business failed to take off and Wal-Mart eventually sold its stake to its partner. If a Flipkart deal materializes, Wal-Mart would be able to support its new ally with money and its decades of retail experience. "With its main competitor Amazon getting very aggressive, Flipkart needs a solid partner to bolster its operations with not just capital but also branding, logistics, sourcing and other retail experience, they won't be able to pull it off with small partners," said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive officer of the Gurgaon-based retail consultancy Third Eyesight. Amazon has been gaining group with major investments in infrastructure and partnership. The company has committed a total of $5 billion to the India market, including the latest pledge from Bezos. "They know how to work against competitor Wal-Mart, they will know what to expect," Chhaochharia said. Wal-Mart has been renewing its efforts to battle Amazon online. In August, Wal-Mart agreed to buy Jet.com Inc. for about $3.3 billion and put founder Marc Lore in charge of the combined company's online operations. A Wal-Mart-Flipkart tie up may prompt moves from other competitors in the India market. Alibaba has been funding Snapdeal.com, the third-largest competitor in Indian e-commerce, and has long considered the country a prime expansion opportunity as it seeks to generate half its revenue from outside China. But if Amazon and Wal-Mart both stepping up their investments, Alibaba may have to consider doing the same, either with Snapdeal or on its own. In Alibaba's most recent post-earnings conference call, Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told analysts that India was a prized market where his company has investment in Snapdeal as well as an online payments service and mobile browser. "We're very well strategically positioned in these emerging markets, and that's the start of our international activity," he said at the time. © 2016 Bloomberg L.P.

Commission Votes To Move Forward With Lawsuit Against Walmart Posted: Tuesday, September 27, 2016 8:32 PM EDT Updated: Tuesday, October 4, 2016 8:32 PM EDT By Blayke Roznowski, Reporter BioEmail Connect Biography BlaykeRoznowski@9and10news.com Follow @BlaykeTVNews Leaders in an Upper Peninsula community unanimously decided to sue Walmart. The vote was made during the Chippewa County commission meeting Tuesday night in Sault Ste. Marie. The county has an issue with a state policy called dark store taxes. Big box stores like Walmart can use a loophole so they pay less in property tax. They do this by arguing their purpose-built stores are too big for other businesses, reducing their value. Commissioners say the loophole has cost the county hundreds of thousands of dollars that would've gone to things like police services. The county is still figuring out how much money they can put toward the lawsuit. They hope to have final approval by next week.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Authorities have 'person of interest' in fire at Wal-Mart in Sturbridge Tuesday Sep 27, 2016 at 8:47 PM Sep 28, 2016 at 2:51 PM Steven H. Foskett Jr. Telegram & Gazette Staff @SteveFoskettTG STURBRIDGE - Firefighters and the state fire marshal's office are investigating a fire Tuesday at Wal-Mart at 100 Charlton Road.  Authorities said the fire was determined to have been set, with the investigation moving from an "origin and cause phase" to a criminal phase. No arrests have been made, although investigators have a "person of interest," Fire Lt. Earl J. Dessert said Wednesday morning. The store remained closed Wednesday morning. The building was evacuated and nobody was hurt in the fire. An investigator was there Tuesday to try to determine the cause and origin of the fire with local police and fire investigators, the fire marshal's office said.  According to the Fire Department, around 5:25 p.m., dispatchers received calls from Wal-Mart reporting a fire in the building. A second alarm was struck that brought in more personnel and mutual aid from Southbridge, Charlton, Spencer and Brimfield. The fire was out when police arrived; the incident remained under investigation, the Fire Department said.  The Auburn Fire Department reported on social media that equipment was being brought in from other towns to clear smoke from the building Tuesday night. Erica Jones, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said it was unclear Tuesday night when the store would reopen. She said the store provided security footage to police, and indicated in a statement that the fire was caused by someone in the store.  "We're upset that someone would do something so reckless and dangerous in our store," she said in an emailed statement. "Thankfully, we were able to evacuate and no one is injured. We are grateful to the fire department for their quick response."   Interim Fire Chief Paul D. Ford said Wednesday morning that much work needs to be done before the store can open. “Whenever there is an incident like that, the health department is brought in,” Chief Ford said. “For the most part, all food products have to go and the dry chem creates a lot of mess.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Register/Subscribe Subscriber Services T&G E-Edition Worcester Living E-Edition NIE Business Matters Coupon Values FAQ Photo reprints (non-commercial use) Commercial photo licenses Advertising Advertising Contacts Propel Marketing - Digital Marketplace Media Kit Place an Ad Jobs Real Estate Pets Legal Notices News Contact Us Letters to the Editor Submit a Press Release Events Copyright/Terms of Use Marketing About Us Visions Contact Us The Item The Banner Reprints & Licensing Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Kate Taylor Jul 16th 2016 9:30AM Whether you've eaten the lobster substitute at Red Lobster, or bought less-than-100% Parmesan cheese from Walmart, the fake food industry probably impacts your life. And, most likely, you didn't even notice it. Larry Olmsted, author of 'Real Food/Fake Food', published an article in Eater on Thursday outlining some of the most common deceptions in the food service industry. Here are three food that raise some of the biggest questions for the expert, as described in the article. 1. Kobe beef The supplies of Kobe beef are so low that, according to Olmsted, more than 99% of supposed "Kobe beef" sold in the US is simply a lie. Since Kobe beef costs more than $20 an ounce, if you're purchasing something that isn't absurdly expensive that is supposedly made of Kobe beef, you're probably being scammed. 2. Red snapper According to an expert involved in DNA species testing, 94% of the time you order fish labeled red snapper, it is actually a different fish. Olmsted says that New York sushi restaurant Sushi Nakazawa refuses to serve red snapper because the risk of fraud from suppliers is too high. A rule of thumb: if the fish is expensive and you haven't seen it displayed whole, there's a good chance it's an imitation. And, even then, it's hard to differentiate between wild-caught and farmed fish. 3. Truffles Real truffles are trendy, prized, and extremely rare. If it's not shaved in front of you, your truffle is likely simply a chemical combination — especially if it's marketed as "truffle oil."

Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Bengaluru/New York: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is in advanced discussions to invest as much as $1 billion into India’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt. Ltd, as the two companies battle Amazon.com Inc. in e-commerce, according to a person familiar with the matter. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, would take a minority stake in Flipkart, the person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Final terms of the deal have not been worked out and negotiations are still underway, the person said. Flipkart’s most recent valuation was $16 billion, according to research firm CB Insights. Flipkart is the largest online retailer in India, but its lead has been under assault as Amazon steps up its investments in the country. Chief executive officer Jeff Bezos said in June that he plans to spend another $3 billion in the country to gain customers in the fast-growing market. Also read: Has Flipkart lost No 1 slot to Amazon? The deal could benefit both Wal-Mart and Flipkart. The Indian retailer would get access to much-needed capital as funding becomes more difficult to obtain in the country, while Wal-Mart would gain exposure to India’s expanding e-commerce market and challenge Amazon on more equal footing than in the US. Flipkart declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart said she could not immediately provide comment. After the US and China, India is the next big online retail market and both Amazon and Wal-Mart have been pursuing the opportunity. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart earlier had a retail joint venture in India with Bharti Group, which runs the country’s largest telecommunications operator Bharti Airtel. But the venture failed to take off and Wal-Mart eventually sold its stake to its partner. The rate of growth in traditional retail has been modest. But Kotak Institutional Equities recently estimated that online retail will average 45% annual growth rates in the next four years and touch $28 billion by 2020.

Gambone / Hesperia Star Hair’s the thing. When it comes to wigs and other supplies designed to keep your mane looking beautiful, no store in the area carries a wider selection than Hair Emporium in Victorville, according to its owner Omar Lago. For the past 25 years, Omar and his wife Paula’s business has been supplying top-quality products at reasonable prices, as well as personalized service to area residents. “Our very first shop was called Earrings & Things and we were next to Sally’s Beauty Supply in the Von’s shopping center on Bear Valley Road,” said Lago, a native of Los Angeles. “Customers from Sally’s would come into the shop and request that we carry wigs and hair extensions. “Paula and I started looking into it and started bringing those products into our store. Before long, we realized we needed a larger space.” Lago and Paula went on to open Hair Emporium in the same shopping center that housed the old Wal-Mart store on Bear Valley Road and Balsam Avenue. Lago admits that when the chain’s store closed three years ago, he and his wife experienced a decline in sales. “The closure of Wal-Mart definitely affected us,” said Lago. “But we found a spot that’s far bigger and better.” Hair Emporium is now located in the Bear Valley Plaza Shopping Center at 12475 Mariposa Road. According to Lago, the space is significantly larger than the former location and much more accessible. “This new store is big and spacious and our customers just love coming in here,” said Lago. “And you can see us from the freeway, which makes us much easier to find.” Along with wigs and extensions, Hair Emporium sells a variety of other products and accessories, such as makeup, shampoos and conditioners, fashion scarves, jewelry, barrettes and scrunchies. In addition, it offers a selection of hair adornments for youngsters. “We are very well established and work with 20 different distributors,” said Lago. “Customers are amazed when they come in for the first time and see all that we have to offer.” Lago said Hair Emporium will be expanding again in the near future by adding a salon inside the store. It will offer everything from wig fittings to haircuts to hair extension applications. “We’re very excited about the salon and hope to make an announcement soon about the date we will officially open,” Lago said. Hair Emporium is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday. The store offers a 5 percent discount for seniors, as well as a 10 percent discount for military personnel, cosmetologists and chemotherapy patients.

Today, the whole gaggle of them are pretty much gone, but because Nature tends to abhor a vacuum, they’ve left the field clear to economists. There are those who insist that economics is a science. But whereas actual scientists all agree about such things as the existence of gravity, the distance to the moon and such laws as the one that holds that things in motion tend to remain in motion, economists can’t agree about anything. Back in the late 1980s or early 90s, a woman was divorcing an economist. In the settlement, she made sure it contained a codicil granting her half the money if within the coming decade, her ex-husband was to win the Nobel Prize in Economics. Eight years later, he copped the Prize and she got her $500,000. While it was he who went to Stockholm and got to give a speech, I would argue that his ex-wife should have copped the honor. Although I can’t claim to be a professional economist, I think that President Trump could do worse than to give me a cabinet position and put me in charge of recharging the economy, a job I am far better-equipped to handle than Hillary’s choice, Bill Clinton. That’s because I have a sure-fire solution. I call it shampoo economics because I can’t claim full credit for it and wish to acknowledge the role that the shampoo industry played in my coming up with the brainstorm. My sole contribution was in recognizing the huge effect those few words on every bottle of shampoo could have on our economy: “Shampoo. Rinse. Repeat.” It’s that “Repeat” that caught my attention. Imagine the audacity of it. You use a product specifically created to wash your hair, and once you’ve done the job, you’re told to do it all over again! Think of the effect it could have on our economy if we brought that policy to bear in every area of commerce. Buy a loaf of bread…and now buy a second loaf. Buy a 64-inch TV…and now buy another. Buy a new Chevy…and now go out and buy a second. Think of the economic boom if every farmer, every fast food outlet, every manufacturer, was compelled to double the supply of goods to meet the demands of an insatiable public. Whereas Trump talks about an annual 4% economic growth, the Prelutsky plan promises 8%, but the sky’s the limit because if the economy shows the slightest downward curve, we simply change to a three-peat plan. That is why I insist that my plan is Head & Shoulders above all the others. Frankly, I’m surprised that people like John Maynard Keynes, John Kenneth Galbraith and even Alan Greenspan, academics who weren’t also writing three or four articles a week, writing books and movie scripts, never thought of it. But perhaps they were so involved with that single job, it never even occurred to them to think outside the box or to read the instructions on the shampoo bottle. Actually, it’s rather ironic that it took a bald guy to beat them at their own game. If a cop, even a black one, didn’t occasionally shoot a black criminal, I wonder what black mobs would find to riot about. In a way, I suppose the riots are simply an example of a different economic theory in action. I mean, when one black man shoots another black man, as has happened over 500 times in Chicago thus far in 2016, it merely provides Obama, Mrs. Clinton, Loretta Lynch and their stooges in Congress and the media, an excuse to once again try to nullify the Second Amendment. But if that first black man happens to be wearing a police uniform, it results in an entire neighborhood being outfitted with new Nikes. After all, nothing says social justice quite as much as looting a Walmart’s. The notion that the so-called black community only wants jobs is proven a hoax once you realize that the black unemployment rate when George Bush left office stood at 12%, whereas today it’s 17%. Nevertheless, blacks gave Obama 97% of their votes and a similar percentage are anxiously awaiting the opportunity to do the same for Hillary Clinton. A reader recently wrote to reminisce about William F. Buckley’s TV show, “Firing Line.” Although I admired Buckley’s work on behalf of conservatism, I never thought he was at his best on the tube. For one thing, he was so dedicated to displaying his pedantry that he would never stoop to using a couple of six-letter words if he could possibly wedge in one with 12 letters. I found his debates with uberliberal Gore Vidal especially excruciating. Vidal always came across as an uberfruitcake while Buckley, a mad gleam in his eye, would inevitably lean forward, looking like Snoopy portraying a vulture, while tapping his pencil incessantly against his front teeth. At times, it seemed as if he were channeling Lionel Hampton playing “Flight of the Bumble Bee” on his xylophone. In discussing words and phrases now out of favor, another reader voiced confidence they would never disappear from the scene, but I disagreed. I wrote: “One can hope, but none of the kids are using them these days, although they are far more likely to have been exposed to ‘hunky dory,’ ‘swell,’ ‘knee-high to a grasshopper,’ ‘jumping Jehoshaphat’ and ‘pshaw!’ than their kids or grandkids will be. "Besides, they are addicted to communicating 140 characters at a time and using Ur, 4 and LOL, in place of actual words. Yet another generation of jibbering idiots. Is it any wonder they lined up behind a pinheaded Pied Piper named Bernie Sanders? I wonder if they even know what slang is, let alone use it. "I hate to be the very personification of a cliché — the old codger who sees America going to the dogs — but thanks to a fifth-rate education system, a 10th rate media and demographics that are destroying the character of the nation — I see little reason to feel hopeful for our beloved nation’s future. Regards, Burt” Oh, and did I forget to mention that at Brown and Cornell, they will now be dispensing feminine hygiene products in what in a bygone age were known as men’s rooms? It is one small step for mankind, but one giant leap for lunacy. The CEO of Wells Fargo, John Stumpf, under whose stewardship the company created two million phony accounts that led to 5,000 employees being canned, told a congressional committee that he is taking full responsibility for the crime. By which he means he is not resigning or giving back the enormous bonus he received for all those fictitious new accounts. Although I can sympathize with a guy having to go through life with a name ending in “pf,” that’s still no excuse for him not to spend the next two million years in the slammer. Gloria Steinem, who used to be an attractive young bubblehead and is now, decades later, a bubblehead with wrinkles, has recently declared: “Forced childbirth is the single biggest cause of global warming.” In case you’re confused as to cause and effect, she went on to say: “I’m glad the Pope spoke out about global warming, but does he know he’s causing it?” My interpretation of her theory is that if we didn’t have so many people, we wouldn’t have to expend so much energy in feeding, clothing and housing, them. As you may have noticed, whenever liberals complain that not enough blacks or Hispanics have influential, high-paying jobs, they never offer to sacrifice their own, and when, like Ms. Steinem, they complain about over-population, they never offer to kill themselves in order to make room for someone else. My own response is to say: “Don’t tell us Gloria, tell your pals Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. They’re still blaming coal.” Meanwhile, down in Florida, perennial candidate Charlie Crist got the kind of laughs I can only dream about when he said, “I believe Hillary Clinton is steady, I believe she is strong …and” (wait for it!) “I believe she is honest.” It brought down the house. Damn those amateurs! A quote Brit Hume shared on his Fox broadcast and attributed to someone named Larry Hardiman, but which I suspect has been around for quite a while, made me chuckle: “The word ‘politics’ is derived from the word ‘poli” meaning many and the word 'ticks,’ meaning blood-sucking parasites.“ Finally, I keep hearing that Hillary Clinton is out-spending Donald Trump by a margin of 5-1, in some states by 10-1, when it comes to TV advertising. So why am I getting email from him and his kids six or seven times a day dunning me for campaign contributions?

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP photo) By Mercury News Readers PUBLISHED: September 30, 2016 at 2:45 pm | UPDATED: October 4, 2016 at 10:15 am Thank you to the editors of The Mercury News for endorsing Yes on Prop 56 and exposing the deception in the Big Tobacco ads against the measure (Editorial, Sept. 29). The tobacco industry ads are now also even more outdated, thanks to the action of Gov. Jerry Brown signing Assemblyman Chris Holden’s AB 1696. This new law takes effect in January of 2017 and makes tobacco cessation services a defined benefit for Medi-Cal patients, who smoke cigarettes at a much higher rate than the general population.  The revenue from Prop 56 will improve timely patient access to both Medicaid providers and these new tobacco cessation and counseling services across California, and thereby reduce the deadly harm from tobacco products in our state. John Maa Secretary, San Francisco Medical Society   ‘Phantom’ performance was transcendent I attended Wednesday’s performance of Broadway San Jose’s “The Phantom of the Opera” with a bit of trepidation given Karen D’Souza’s review.  I needn’t have worried; my daughter and I were completely blown away by the performances, the orchestra, and especially the amazing engineering of the set design.  The whole thing was frankly transcendent.  Who would have thought of using rubber glass for the exploding chandelier?  I even brought a few bits home as a memento.  Hurry and see it. Donna Hobbs Boulder Creek Part-time workers issue requires federal action The strategy of employing people for half time by large employers such as Wal-Mart and fast food companies has been going on for years. From a profit perspective, these companies are simply doing right by their stockholders. I have also seen local school districts and governments employ this strategy. This is a national problem and should be addressed through our tax system, not in a county/state patchwork manner. The real issue here is that mega-employers are using this tactic to transfer health care costs to taxpayers. When these part time employees, many of whom have multiple part time jobs become ill, they use Medicare, paid for by taxpayers. The simplest solution: Require all employers who use part time workers to pay a pro-rata share of employee health care cost into an Obamacare type fund. If a person has multiple part time jobs and is working 40-plus hours, they will have full access to health care benefits. Anne Arjani Los Altos Hills Vote ‘no’ on Cupertino’s Measure C In a remarkable ruling by the Santa Clara County Superior Court, a judge ruled Cupertino’s Measure C ballot arguments contained three false and misleading statements. This decision marks a step toward protecting the integrity of ballot arguments, and I am very happy justice was served. Voters have the right to know the truth of the initiative on which they are expected to vote. Now many Measure C proponents are crying foul, claiming they were “innocent civilians” preyed upon by “money hungry developers.” Don’t be fooled. This was a ploy by politically motivated individuals who were caught trying to mislead the public and are now playing the blame game. The truth of the matter is that Measure C proponents are running a misleading, no growth measure, suing the city, attempting to recall the mayor, campaigning against the school districts and running for city council to further their causes. We must put a stop to their games. Vote no on Measure C in November. Ram Gopal Cupertino Elect Tseng to Los Gatos-Saratoga school board I would like to go on record as endorsing Katherine Tseng for re-election to the Los Gatos-Saratoga High School District Board of Trustees.  Katherine brings excellent credentials to this position as an actuary with extensive experience in analysis and risk management, not to mention her strong commitment to community engagement.  I have known Katherine for almost 16 years and have had the pleasure of working closely with her at the Argonaut Elementary School PTA, Redwood Middle School PTA, Saratoga High School PTSO and Saratoga High School Sports Boosters.  I truly admire Katherine for her selfless volunteer work on behalf of the students and families in our community.  Our students have benefited from Katherine’s commitment to academic excellence as well as her commitment to their emotional well-being.  Katherine exemplifies honesty, fairness and thoughtfulness.  Please join me in supporting her for re-election to the LGSUHSD Board of Trustees. Diane Clement Los Gatos Multiple polls show Trump won debate Your staff news report on the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton debate (Page 1A, Sept. 27) cited that the CNN poll declaring Clinton as the clear debate winner. But you would expect that from CNN.  When listening to various radio reports on the debate results, CNN was the only poll declaring Clinton the victor. Other polls from USA Today, Drudge Report, CNBC, Breitbart, Time, ABC and who knows how many others had Donald Trump as the apparent winner. So it appears that the majority of polls are for Trump on this first debate. Once again the Mercury News persists in being deficient in objectivity and accuracy in their reportage. Tony Favero Half Moon Bay Trump’s position on taxes is frightening So, Donald Trump actually bragged at the debate about how smart he is to not have paid his taxes, huh? Well, I guess that makes the rest of us a bunch of idiots. Personally, I know my tax dollars make a difference to many, and I can live with that. I live in this country, live in California, and use many resources with gratitude. I’ve had friends who have come from countries where there were few of the wonderful resources we usually take for granted. I learned a long time ago the money has to come from somewhere, so I pay my fair share of taxes as most responsible citizens do. Trump’s attitude of entitlement should scare many more than it apparently does. That is frightening in itself when you think he may be elected to lead our country.

Slideshow 15 Views from the Robot Frontier NASA, DARPA discuss research horizons Rick Merritt 9/29/2016 07:19 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — Robots aren’t taking over the planet yet, but they are getting traction on and beyond the factory floor in everything from warehouses to delivery services and Mars. That was the takeaway from the RoboBusiness conference here where it was said Amazon alone now operates as many as 20,000 of its Kiva robots for moving stuff in its warehouses. I ran into WalMart logistics managers there seriously kicking tires on an AI-powered robot, too. Here are a few fascinating factoids I heard: The sex robot industry is already valued at $100 million The exoskeleton market is valued at $500 million Korea already uses robots as prison guards The first suit against a robot was recently filed in San Francisco. (It ran over a toddler’s leg.) More than 1.4 million new industrial robots will be installed in factories around the world by 2019, bringing the total installed base to 2.6 million units, according to a report from the International Federation of Robotics. China is now the leading market for industrial robots, installing 68,600 units last year. The European Union is the second largest market, followed by Korea, Japan and the U.S., it said. Talks at the RoboBusiness event from representatives of NASA and DARPA provided interesting insights on research in service robots and drones. Engineers have until October 7 to sign up for a NASA challenge to write software for a humanoid robot that could someday assist astronauts on the moon and Mars. NASA is preparing its Valkyrie aka R5 robot to assist a future trip to Mars. The six-foot, 300-pound bot is expected to arrive before humans to set up and maintain a habitat for astronauts. The R5 needs to work autonomously carrying out high-level commands given the round trip communications latency of up to 45 minutes between Earth and Mars. Four R5 units are in the hands of researchers — three at universities and one at NASA — but they need help with the grand challenge of figuring out how to program them to carry out tasks on their own. “Everyone using them is finding bugs in the software and upgrades we need, so we are really still in the infancy stage and our groups are not getting to do as much advanced research as they like right now,” said Kimberly Hambuchen, a robotics engineer at the Johnson Space Center. So NASA has started a challenge for anyone who can deliver the smart software R5 needs. Registration closes October 7 for the challenge, which will be held in June. A variety of cash prizes going up to $125,000 plus an optional bonus will be awarded to finalists. The top four teams will get a chance to work directly with researchers and run their programs on an R5. “The possibility of doing some work on Valkyrie is a pretty cool prize in itself,” said Hambuchen. Back on Planet Earth, program manager Daniel Patt gave a rundown of some of the robotics programs DARPA is running for drones. For example, his Gremlins program aims to create small drones that can fly thousands of miles at high speeds and be launched from and return to a carrier plane in flight. The agency is now building a vehicle for its Tern program that can stay airborne for long periods at high altitudes and land vertically on an aircraft carrier at sea. “A ship can turn 40 degrees quite quickly, so it’s a major challenge for a drone to see where the ship’s landing surface is,” Patt said.

Argentina shows interest to strengthen trade, economic ties with Pakistan: LCCI 18-Nov-16   LAHORE: Argentin ... Fakes are everywhere. The flash of an 'LV' logo on New York's busy Canal Street, or a pile of lookalike Chanel bags at Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, hardly warrants a raised eyebrow these days. But counterfeiting continues to plague the luxury sector, costing European clothing and accessories companies an estimated ...26.3 billion - about 10 percent of their sales, every year and doing damage to the reputation of their brands to boot. Those of us who've ever been duped into buying a replica Hermès scarf at a second-hand store, or a knockoff Marc Jacobs bag on Ebay, have felt the pain of counterfeiting all too well. Brands have long turned to trade associations and law enforcement agencies in costly efforts to shut down those making and selling knockoffs, but recently, they've also begun to seek out more technologically driven solutions. Moncler announced that beginning with its spring/summer 2016 collection, all of its products will contain small radio frequency identification (RFID) chips, each containing a unique ID that will allow users to scan and authenticate their goods via their smartphones or through the code.moncler.com website. Employing the same technology that allows Apple Pay users to swipe their phones at cash registers in lieu of pulling out their credit cards, it will make it far easier for customers to identify if the $1,200, Moncler-branded down coat they've just bought is a fake - no online guide necessary. Moncler isn't the only Italian-based luxury brand to use microchips in the battle against counterfeiting. Beginning with its pre-fall 2014 collection, Salvatore Ferragamo began embedding RFID chips into the left soles of its women's shoes to allow the company to verify their authenticity. It has since added the tags to products in other categories, including women's bags and luggage and men's shoes and small leather goods. RFID chips are not new, even in the retail sphere. Major merchants including Walmart and the UK's Marks & Spencer chain have for years been working with their suppliers to attach RFID tags to products in order to help with inventory tracking and management, allowing those retailers to quickly assess where products are in the supply chain; how many they have in stock at a given warehouse, store or even specific clothing rack; and replenish accordingly. Brands like the accessibly priced German women's clothier Gerry Weber, which added RFID chips to its care tags in 2011, have seen double-digit sales increases almost immediately after integrating the technology, simply because they are able to restock their products more accurately and efficiently, says Steven Owen, executive vice president of sales and marketing at NXP Semiconductors, which makes Gerry Weber's tags. Other companies have used it to fight theft, using the unique serial numbers in the RFID chips to prevent people from returning unregistered products to stores, or to target suppliers illegally producing excess stock and selling them on the open market. So why are luxury brands getting involved now? Owen says that, though there's been a clear business case for years, companies have been slow to adopt the technology, in part because building a system that identifies and tracks a company's entire catalogue requires a considerable investment, costing a couple of million dollars for a small to medium-sized company to start. The proposition has also become more attractive as the quality and sophistication of these systems has improved, and as the size and price of chips have gone down. It costs Gerry Weber, for example, nine cents to tag each of the approximately 30 million garments it produces each year. As with any new technology, particularly of the tracking variety privacy concerns abound. Gerry Weber deactivates its chips at point-of-sale, but for Moncler and Ferragamo, that would defeat the purpose. In Europe, where data privacy laws are more strict, you have to tell the client if you're providing such a product with an RFID chip and serial number, says Owen. Indeed, Burberry discloses its uses of RFID on its website. There are some US state laws prohibiting, for example, the surreptitious scanning of RFID chips in ID cards, but nothing requiring that a retailer disclose chips are embedded in the products they sell. It's not hard to imagine a day in which everything, from our razors to the dollar bills in our wallets, are embedded with microchips. And the technology will only get more sophisticated over time. Last year, for example, researchers at Nottingham Trent University in the UK unveiled a prototype for embedding RFID chips into yarns. Three months ago, they launched a company, Advanced E-Textiles Ltd, to bring it to market.  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

Herkimer Police have been getting calls from concerned citizens about seeing people wearing clown masks in public. They responded on Tuesday and Wednesday to calls of such sightings near Wal Mart and on nearby Smith Street. They found nothing, but Captain Crimm says that simply walking around in public wearing a clown mask isn't a crime.   People are likely concerned because of reports elsewhere in the nation of people wearing clown masks, trying to lure or chase children, one, as close as Syracuse this morning.  Lauri Noga was sitting around a bonfire at her Sylvan Beach camp around midnight last Wednesday, when she and her friends heard a noise.   "We heard a horn...like a bike horn... and we looked down and there's a clown walking slowly down the pier toward us," said Noga.   The 'clown' wasn't the traditional, happy, pleasant-looking clown, but rather, a menacing one, with fake blood dripping from its mouth and, "haha," scrawled in red on its forehead. "He talked and he said that he was promoting we believe to be the Sylvan Beach Amusement Park thing. We don't know if it's true or not....it's a weeknight at midnight, and it's September 21st. Not like it's October. Halloween," said Noga. A Facebook page for the event says it's not happening this year. Our calls to confirm this were not returned.  Coco Clare is a professional clown, who delights both adults and children, alike. But she's sad that people are using an age-old, joyous figure to promote fear.    "Yes, I'm in public. I go places like this. I go to Wal Mart, I stop at the pharmacy. I get gas. Don't shoot me," says Clare, adding that the people doing that aren't clowns, but rather, bullies, wearing masks. Clare has been alarmed by misdirected public sentiment in social media.  "I see people writing on Facebook, 'I'm going to shoot now, ask questions later. I'm like, 'really???'"   Utica Police say no calls reporting 'clown sightings' yet.

He was cited for inappropriately riding a car, and his father Matt says "clown hunters" are now telling the family to watch themselves. (Courtesy photo) Print Email Steve Novak | For lehighvalleylive.com By Steve Novak | For lehighvalleylive.com The Warren Reporter Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 29, 2016 at 5:01 PM, updated September 29, 2016 at 5:19 PM comments "I know I should have known better," Matt Fuller admitted. "But with our favorite holiday coming up — Halloween — we decided, hey, let's have some fun." That was the start of a joke poking fun at the area's recent creepy clown sightings. But the punchline was not funny for the Fullers.  Pohatcong Township police said a boy in a clown costume rode on the hood of a hearse Sept. 27, 2016, outside the Super Wal-Mart in Pohatcong Plaza II in the township. (Submitted photo)  Matt and his 18-year-old son, Sean — who dressed up as a clown and rode on the family's hearse around a Pohatcong Township parking lot — were followed home and Sean is to be cited by police. Now, supposed "clown hunters" are telling the family to watch themselves, Matt Fuller said. "It's a joke that has gone overboard," said the 42-year-old from Alpha. "Not by us but by people pushing it, these so-called clown hunters." Police have cautioned against people pursuing anyone dressed as a clown after a series of reports in which creepy jesters supposedly chased children. There were two reports within 12 hours last week in Easton, four in two days this week in Phillipsburg and another in Wilson Borough. What was thought to be the latest sighting happened about 9 p.m. Tuesday outside the Super Wal-Mart in Pohatcong Plaza II, along Route 22. It was Sean Fuller, his father said. Sean Fuller, 18, and his father Matt, 42, with the family's hearse, named Lucie. (Courtesy photo)  Sean had gone to Spirit Halloween off 22 in a clown costume, where there were laughs and pictures taken, Matt Fuller said. They drove around with the hearse — a car named Lucie that Matt said is a good conversation piece — outside Wal-Mart and Quaker Steak & Lube, he said. Fuller said Sean waved at some people and some took pictures. Pohatcong police said no shoppers interacted with the clown and that there was no reason for concern. "Next thing you know, police were called," Matt Fuller said. "One person decided they were going to follow us home." Upon returning home, Matt Fuller said, an officer scolded them. Another car that had followed them started up the driveway but drove off when the officer turned on his emergency lights, Fuller said. Police said a citation will be issued for riding on inappropriate parts of the car. Fuller said the family will accept it. 9 things to know about the clown hysteria He also said that while he was aware of clown sightings, he only learned that night that there were local reports of clowns chasing children. He said it wasn't them. "I would never harm a child nor put anyone's child in danger," he said. Pohatcong Mayor James Kern, in the police's announcement of the citation, praised the department for its work and said suspicious clowns will be not be tolerated. "This odd phenomena is happening all over the country," he said. "Hopefully, those considering these type of actions will now think otherwise."

Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley gave official approval to the construction of a solar farm in New Albany, following a public hearing on the matter Wednesday. The $3.7 million facility will be constructed by SR New Albany LLC and interconnect with Northeast Mississippi Electric Power Association. “This case has been referred to our office to hold a hearing for public comment, even though the companies filing are not public utilities as the law defines them, because they don’t sell directly to public users,” Presley told those present at the hearing. The facility will be located on 30 acres of farmland just beside Diversity Vuteq and east of the Wal-Mart Distribution Center.  It will contain approximately 6,600 solar panels, which will generate two megawatts of electricity, enough to supply power to 250 homes. According to Keith Hayward, CEO and Manager of Northeast Mississippi Electric Power Association, the property is in a slight designated flood plane, referred to as brown earth, which is enough to make it unsuitable to build another factory, but just right for the solar farm. After asking for public comment or questions and receiving none from those present, Presley said he approved the project, pending all plans and permits be submitted. “This is an exciting venture for Northeast Mississippi,” Presley said.  “We are up to almost 50 megawatts of solar power across the state, with this being our fifth solar farm in Mississippi.  One of my goals when I came into office was to increase the amount of solar energy supplied by our state, because the sun is a free resource.  This project will help to stabilize prices and keep energy costs low for the consumer.” Construction on the project is expected to begin by the end of the year.

Skip to content The Elm The Student Newspaper of Washington College since 1930 Primary Menu Home News Opinion Columns Letters Sports Lifestyle Student Life Advertising Archives Meet the Press “Where Are You From?”: An Asian-American student questions the question by The Elm September 29, 2016 Filed under: Lifestyle By Christine Rhee Elm Staff Writer I always fear being asked, “Where are you from?” What does it mean, anyway? If it’s where I was born, then easy: New Jersey. Technically, I’ve lived there for the majority of my life: twelve out of twenty years. Sixty percent. That’s the place one would expect that I would identify with, right? It’s not. I hardly identify with New Jersey other than some diluted, fond memories of growing up. If it’s where I currently live, then it’s Korea—South, I must clarify. I’m updated in Korea, so to speak. If I answer straight away with Korea, then assumptions are quickly made. “You’re so good at English!” and, “You don’t have an accent. I never would have guessed you came from Korea,” quickly follow. It’s a bit exhaustive to explain, “Born and raised in New Jersey for twelve years, moved to California for three, then Korea for five,” and to give myself such a detailed introduction to people who don’t seem to deeply care dulls the conversation. I’m not narcissistic, but with a lot of moving around, it’s hard to answer a question like “Where are you from?” in a short phrase. Other than repeatedly struggling with how to answer a seemingly harmless question, there have been a couple of stressful moments, like setting up a bank account and going all the way to Delaware (a trek that would never be imagined in tiny Korea) just for a phone number and Walmart. Or, not knowing the area and realizing that my version of being American is outdated. Or, realising that any decent restaurant with a diversity in menu is quite a drive out. For one without a license to drive or a car, it can be hard to repeatedly eat the same type of food over and over again. Always. Fried. Food. Baked or grilled chicken. French Fries. Pizza. Is there really no variety? Even when our school tries, the flavour is never tantamount to true Asian food, including Korean food. Korea just has a special taste to it that I miss. What can I say? I’m Korean. Beyond missing Korea (and California and New Jersey), I feel a strange mix of being both at home and being a complete foreigner. It’s not a new feeling, and I’ve learned to deal with it. I take bits of home with me and create my own home. Here, I’ve made great friends, almost like a little family. We vibe well. There are interesting conversations, good humour, kind hearts. A community. It’s important to remember finding a good community is much harder than one would think, and it really goes with you throughout the years. I have grown attached. I love the atmosphere. The weather, upon coming here, was absolutely perfect. Even Goldilocks would have liked it. I woke in the mornings enjoying the walk to class and soaking in the beauty that is the nature on campus. After studying late into the night, I would walk back to the dorm and look up—in pure admiration and awe—and relax. The very start to the very end is enjoyable. Upon coming home, I am grateful for my well-matched, welcoming roommate and suitemates. All in all,  I’m enjoying my time here. Sure, I miss the Korean fried chicken and ddeukbokki, but there’s so many opportunities here at WC— a chance to explore my interests and, heck, join Model United Nations (MUN) and go to Columbia University’s crisis conference (CMUNNY). So, forget where I’m from. Where do I live? I live in Corsica, Washinton College.

Some of the popsicles offered at Urban Pops. × 2 of 2 Expand Kamy and Riba Adeli. Prev Next Kamy Adeli has made chocolate potato chip ice pops, pickle ice pops, even ranch dressing ice pops — and he’s looking to try more. The owner of Hoover’s only ice pop shop has made more than 100 different flavors since he and his wife, Riba, opened Urban Pops in January 2015.  “I sleep at night and wake up in the morning and have a recipe in my head,” he said.  Though it’s Kamy Adeli’s creativity behind flavors such as strawberry cheesecake, banana pudding, cucumber chili and cranberry pomegranate, he said he gets a fair amount of his ideas directly from his customers.   “A lot of times I listen to people,” Kamy Adeli said. “I always make what they want.” The ranch dressing, pickle and chocolate potato chip pops were all customer requests. And while he is willing to try anything once, Kamy Adeli said his ventures are often hit or miss. The ranch pop tanked, but much to his surprise the pickle pops sold out within a few days.  Overall, Kamy Adeli has gained a lot from listening — he opened Urban Pops after insistent pushing from his 26-year-old daughter Sara. Kamy Adeli, a former restaurant manager and conference center owner, said he was not convinced until his daughter took him to an ice pop shop in New York City.  There, in the dead of winter, people were lining up to get pops. “That’s what gave me the clue that I need to open one in Birmingham,” he said.  After owning Arthur’s Conference Center off Valleydale Road in Pelham for 17 years, Kamy Adeli and his wife were ready for something new. They sold the business and eventually decided to take their daughter’s advice and open an ice pop shop. They named, decorated and branded the business according to her specifications as well.  “She said, ‘Dad, you need to do rustic,’ and I didn’t know what rustic meant, but she told me exactly what to do,” Kamy Adeli said.  Urban Pops, on the end of the Walmart Super Center strip mall on John Hawkins Parkway, more than accomplishes the “rustic” goal. Along with its exposed brick wall, marble floating counter top, dark wood tables and Birmingham memorabilia, the restaurant also features an entire wall striped in reclaimed wood Kamy Adeli put up himself.  In the shop, Kamy Adeli makes pops in batches of 80. He said he makes hundreds each day, but to keep the pops fresh, they have a shelf life of only two or three days. At any given time, there are more than 30 pop flavors on hand at Urban Pops.  In addition to crowd favorites such as cookies and cream and coffee and fruity flavors such as strawberry and watermelon, the Adelis bring an ethnic flair to their business with Asian flavors from India, Pakistan and their home country of Iran.  Kulfi, a traditional Indian ice cream made with pistachio and cardamom, is served as an ice pop in varieties including mango, apricot and coconut. The couple also make rosewater Rooh Afza pops from Pakistan and an Iranian flavored pop called Akbar Mashti that is laden with pistachio, saffron, rosewater and cream.  Though the couple is resigned to keeping their business a “small mom-and-pop operation,” having just one brick-and-mortar store isn’t keeping them from spreading their pops all throughout the Birmingham area. Between their six carts, three concession trailers and a mobile van, Urban Pops are popping up everywhere.  They’re at the West Homewood Farmer’s Market on Tuesdays, the Lake Cyrus Market on Thursdays and at the Ross Bridge Market on Fridays. Urban Pops also frequently has a cart at Children’s of Alabama hospital’s Food Truck Fridays and at Pepper Place on Saturdays.  This is all in addition their slew of wedding, birthday and corporate catering events and their newest development: Urban Pop freezer chests. Urban Pops are sold at the Galleria Chevron in Hoover, Highland Shell in Birmingham, Ross Bridge Exxon in Hoover, Coosa Mart Exxon in Valleydale and at Shell stations in Homewood, Vestavia and Cahaba Heights.  To keep up with all their new business, the Adelis have enlisted the help of their other daughter Lawden, who handles external Urban Pops sales including catering, events and freezer chest and cart distribution. This way, Kamy and Riba Adeli can focus on doing what they like best: interacting with their customers.  “Eighty percent of my customers are repeat customers,” Kamy Adeli said. “I don’t want to get too big; that way you lose that personal touch.” Riba Adeli, in fact, has built up quite the reputation around town.  “Sometimes I go to Walmart or go to do errands and people are like ‘Oh, hello; you’re the Urban Pops lady,’” she said.  Tags business Urban Pops pops by TARA MASSOULEH September 29, 2016 7:01 PM View Past Issues Upcoming Events Tween Scene: Pokemon Nov 18, 2016 4:00 PM Hoover Public Library Stained Glass Christmas Tree Ornament with Kennen Spivey Nov 18, 2016 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM Artists on the Bluff Stained Glass Christmas Tree Ornament with Kennen Spivey Nov 18, 2016 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM Artists on the Bluff Ornament Workshop with Lana Hobbs Nov 18, 2016 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM Artists on the Bluff After Hours @ the Plaza: Game Nite Nov 18, 2016 7:00 PM - 8:00 PM Hoover Public Library USATF Regional Junior Olympics XC Meet Nov 19, 2016 12:00 AM Veteran’s Park Deon Cole Nov 18, 2016 - Nov 19, 2016 Stardome Comedy Club Members Only Guided Bird Walk Nov 19, 2016 8:00 AM Aldridge Gardens Holiday Market Nov 19, 2016 9:00 AM - 3:00 PM Hoover First United Methodist Church Write Club Nov 19, 2016 10:30 AM Hoover Public Library Submit Yours News Weather People Celebrations Schools Elementary/Intermediate Schools Middle Schools High Schools Private Schools Sports Businesses Restaurants 2015 Women of Hoover 2016 Women of Hoover Opinion Mayor's Minute Kari Kampakis Rick Watson Editor's Perspective Events Videos About Us Our Staff Advertise News and Awards Restaurants 2015 Women of Hoover 2016 Women of Hoover About Us Advertise Hoover Sun LLC Built with Metro Publisher™

Arnold, the British director of Fish Tank and Red Road, prepared for her first American movie with an extensive cross-country road trip. Along the way, she looked for the young people she wanted to cast in her film, finding them at beach parties and hanging out in parking lots. Arnold had read a 2007 New York Times article about mag crews — traveling groups of young people selling magazine subscriptions, often for predatory companies keeping them indentured under brutal conditions. She wanted to make a film about a mag crew, but she wanted the performances to be authentic and natural. So she effectively built her own crew out of young people she found while traveling. Then she loaded them into a van and took them on a 12,000-mile road trip, encouraging them to bond and interact naturally while she shot the film around them. American Honey only features a few professional actors — Riley Keough (Mad Max: Fury Road, Magic Mike) as Krystal, the mercenary head of the mag crew, and Shia LaBeouf as Jake, her top seller and trainer. But the real revelation is first-time actor Sasha Lane as Star, a runaway who falls for Jake the first time she sees him, and joins his crew’s cross-country ramble to get closer to him. I recently talked to Arnold about her casting and shooting methods, and the night she rescued a drunk kid from the police. Why did you decide to use non-professional actors for this film? Why was it important to you to find them in their own scenes and parties around the country? I do a lot of my films this way, using people who haven't acted before. But on this one, it seemed even more important somehow to represent the kind of people that join mag crews. Seeing those authentic faces felt really important to me. So from the beginning, I wanted to use real people whose faces summed up that life. I'm always trying to do things as authentically as I can, as much as possible. Doing a real road trip and taking everybody together felt like a way of having a real experience, as opposed to pretending to have an experience. I always wanted, literally from the beginning, for the cast and crew to go on a trip together. There wasn't this usual thing where you might do a couple of weeks filming in one place, and then fly to the next, and somebody will fly in for two days, and fly back out again. I wanted us all to have a real experience. So the crew and all the cast met at the beginning, and we went on the whole trip. We traveled and stayed in the same motel, and had a real experience together. We lived together, we were making the film together, so it was a proper adventure. I think doing that meant that the film has more of a realistic feel. How firm was the script when you started? Are there parts of the movie that you just discovered on the road? "Everyone thinks, 'Oh, is it a documentary, is it a drama?'" There was a script. Everyone thinks, "Oh, is it a documentary, is it a drama?" There was a script, but what I do a lot is, when I learn things, when I cast people, I go back and revisit the script, and I might change it according to what I've learned. I think maybe that's what people are reading. It seems quiet, like it's off-the-cuff. Some of it is improvised. Like the scenes in the van where we're actually traveling, we would film everybody. When we moved locations, as we drove out to the next state, for the next place where we were going to stay, even though that wasn't in the script, we'd film inside the van. So some of those scenes in the van when we're traveling are just what was happening, just us hanging out. I'd give them some notes. With Sasha, who is playing her character, I would definitely give her notes, because I wanted her to be at a certain stage of her journey for each scene. For her, that was quite hard, because they're all partying all the time, and she wanted to party, but I wouldn't let her. That was particularly tough on her, because I always wanted her to be kind of thoughtful or sad, or thinking about Jake. Everyone else is always singing and dancing, and she wanted to join in with them, but I had to sometimes stop her doing that. (A24) What else did you do to help her build that character? I cast quite close to what I'm looking for, so I'm not wanting anyone to be necessarily different from who they are. But at the same time, they're saying my words which I've written, and they're wearing clothes I've given them, and they're standing in locations and taking part in scenes that are nothing to do with who they are as real people. I put them in my situations, then I don't really ask or want them to add much more. Star is a bit more country than Sasha. Sasha is more worldly and had more education and is a bit more urban than Star. And she dresses differently. All I asked was that she dress a bit more country, and not say certain words. And then off we go, really. What kind of cameras did you use? We were gonna shoot on film and video. Robbie Ryan is a fantastic DP, and he's a huge fan of film. So am I. We actually did some testing in London — we have a picture from London of all the 10 different cameras we were going to test. We've got everything from a tiny little camera up to the 35mm cameras. Robbie knows what all the cameras were, but when we were looking at footage, I didn't want to know which cameras went with which shots. I wanted to pick what I thought was right for the film without knowing what the camera was. And without a doubt, what came in completely at the top was 35mm. It gives such a great surface. We didn't have any of the cast at that point, so we just filmed a lad we knew. And the 35mm gave him such presence. I can't really explain it any more than that. More than just, without a doubt, I wanted that. The one after that I like the most is the Alexa, which is what we ended up shooting most of the movie on. When we started off, we were going to do a mix of both, because we couldn't afford just film. We started at the beginning. I had an idea that maybe all Star's close-ups were on film, and the rest of it wasn't, so she'd really feel present in the scene, visually. But then when we got going, it was so challenging. Digital was just much easier — we were getting more out of being able to keep rolling on the digital camera and not having to stop to change [film cartridges]. I would never say there's a downside to using film, but working with non-actors, it's probably easier just to keep rolling. One of the more insightful reviews I've read of the film says people don't really process youth when they're young, so movies like this are more for older people who want to remember an experience they weren't conscious of at the time. Does that idea speak to you at all? I can see that. When we're young, we're dealing with so much. I think that's life. Maybe when you're older and you're looking back at being young, you can see it more clearly. When you're young, you're still going forward, and you don't quite know who you are, and you're not reflecting so much as just being in it. Certainly when I was the age of the people in my film, I would just kind of barge through life, not really reflecting much on anything. Just living in the moment. (A24) How did you end up with the 4:3 aspect ratio? It's an artistic decision. I've done my last three films with the same ratio. It's a ratio I much love. My films are usually about one person and their experiences of the world. So I'm mainly following them around, filming them quite closely. And it's a very beautiful frame for one person. It frames them with a huge amount of respect. It gives them kind of honors, the human in that frame. I was very attracted to it when I first started making films, but I wasn't able to articulate it and understand why I was doing it until later. But now I understand, that respect is what it's about. Shia LaBeouf is intense about method acting, and his recent road-trip art project seems highly compatible with what you did with your own filming road trip. How did his process work with what you did on this film? He fitted in the way I wanted to work just so smoothly. I met him early on and I talked about the way I wanted to work, and he was really, really, enthusiastic about that. He really liked all the things I was saying. I think maybe we're quite similar in the things we care about in that way. We did have a good working relationship. I mean, he had to come into a group of people that were real people, and that must be quite challenging for someone who's done lots of acting, because you know he had to try to be quite real, just to not stand out from all these people who are just themselves. And he did that, which I think is pretty remarkable. Do you have any particularly memorable stories from the period where you were just going to beach parties and Walmart parking lots, looking for people for the film? It was always eventful. I suppose the time I remember the most is being on Panama City Beach during Spring Break, because it was so lively. My absolute favorite thing was to sit in the Walmart car lot on the beach at Panama City, and just watch all the kids come buy stuff and head out to the beach again, or sit in their cars and play music. It was just the liveliest play. I felt like it was such the place to be, there was no better place to be in the whole of Florida than that Walmart car lot. And they're dancing and twerking, amazing kind of twerking going on. [laughs] Fantastic dancing. I could sit there all week and just watch everybody. We were driving around looking for people, and we found so many people in distress, because they were drunk, lying on the road. We ended up as a bit of a rescue service, because we picked people up on the road and took them back to their hotels. That happened quite a few times, because there's an awful lot of drinking going on at Spring Break. We stopped a guy from getting arrested. He was just such a sweet man, but he was completely drunk, running around 7-Eleven. They wouldn't let him in, and the police came and were going to arrest him. We said, "We'll just take them home, he's just pissed." And they said, "What's he pissed at? What's he pissed about? Why is he pissed? What's he been doing?" It took me a while to realize that pissed in America means angry, while in England it just means you're drunk. But we got him home. I remember a lot of drama in Spring Break in Florida. And where else? We were in West Virginia a lot, wandering state fairs, I remember being in Upstate New York, staying at Motel 6, having breakfast in Denny's, then looking for people in state fairs. (A24) What were you looking for? What would cause you to single somebody out? That's such a hard thing to define. I feel like I really know what it is, but I don't know how to articulate it. I went out with a bunch of mag-crew kids and I hung out with them, so I felt like I had an idea of the kinds of kids that would join a mag crew. The one thing I really came away with, seeing the mag-crew kids, was vulnerability. A lot of attitude, and underneath it all, a lot of vulnerability. Before we started casting, I printed lots of pictures from the internet of the kinds of kids I wanted to cast, and I would give them to the casting directors. They're really talented people, and they were very good at that. So we were looking for certain ages, certain things about people's characters. Mainly, we were looking for Star. Star was the hardest to find. You've said that when you were first exploring America, you discovered American poverty, and it shocked you. Did you feel a compulsion to put it in the film? What inspired you about it? I'm not so sure it was an inspiration. People have asked me, "Was it a surprise?" And I think that was one of my surprises, was the extent of poverty in some of the places I went to. But I'm not so sure I would say it was an inspiration. I don't think I represented in the film half of what I saw. I steered away from some of it, actually. If I put in the film some of the things I saw, it would have been a much bleaker film. The characters come from difficult places, but I didn't really show them. Muskogee, Oklahoma is one of the poorest towns in America, so I'm told. That's where we started. And it's a fantastically beautiful town, surrounded by amazing countryside. And we had the best time with all the people we met there. I actually just wanted to live there. It was an amazing place. I've actually fantasized about living in Muskogee. I just loved it. But some of the things I saw, with people in poverty, the film doesn't go anywhere near it. If I had, people's eyes would open even wider. The reaction to the film would be completely different. You often talk in interviews about how important it is to make films from the heart, to pursue whatever you feel passionate about. How would you describe what you're passionate about these days? With American Honey, the thing I started with, and that I cared about — even in the middle of making it, I sort of forgot, until the end. But it was there anyway. When I discovered mag-crew culture, the world of it, the one thing I was interested in was kids coming from all these broken families, kids who haven't had great starts in life. Running away to join these crews, they would find kind of a surrogate family. You know, a messy one, but a step up from the ones they've left behind. That was what I was passionate about, was them finding their way somehow. It's a small step, but it's a step toward something, a step that gave them something. That was where I started, and that drove the whole thing. The interesting part was, that happened when we made the film. The cast and crew did make a family. American Honey opens September 30 in select cities, with a wide rollout throughout October. More from The Verge Sand's End Facebook won’t call itself a media company.

After introductions, I asked him to tell me a little bit about his show, Superstore—the show about which I was interviewing him. “No,” Feldman deadpans. “Next question.” And so I worry in putting this interview into text, his words just transcribed on the page might fail to communicate exactly how funny Feldman is in person. For all of the actors one interviews doing who are doing network-mandated promotions, it’s rare you get the chance to talk to someone who manages to come across as both charming and genuine. Chances are, you recognize Ben Feldman from his arc on Mad Men, for which he was nominated for an Emmy. Feldman portrayed copywriter Michael Ginsberg who was eventually driven to madness (and to cut off his own nipple) by the presence of an IBM computer in the next room. From there, his television resume became even more impressive: a guest spot on The Mindy Project as one of Mindy Lahiriri’s rare love interests that last longer than a week, a role as a douchey lawyer on Silicon Valley, and starring in the short-lived NBC television romcom A to Z alongside The-Mother-That-He-Eventually-Met Cristin Milioti. But it seems, for now, Feldman has found a home: as the slightly pretentious, but still loveable Jonah working at a Walmart analog “Cloud 9” on Superstore, with America Ferrera, where the actor’s deadpan sense of humor and experience on a TV set come through every week. Shot on location at 42 Lispenard, Sabrina Salitel and Kirsten Jordan/Douglas Elliman; Grooming by Shay Garcia Sasha Maslov for Observer OBSERVER: So really, tell me about Superstore. Feldman: The show is really exciting and it’s like the greatest thing that’s happened to any of us. The cast is a really, insanely cool group of people. I just get to go to work and be surrounded by at least seven people who are way funnier than I am every single day, so it’s like a dream job. You’ve been on a lot of shows—is this one different? I have, but there’s something about this cast. Every single cast has a couple bad eggs, or that person that everyone is making fun of or doesn’t like. And unless it’s me, I haven’t found that in this cast yet. It’s all just cool, great people. Who was it on Mad Man? Oooh, I can’t answer that question. Jon Hamm? No—I love Jon Hamm. But Mad Men I also joined five years in, so it had already become high school by the time I got there. There were enough secret, sub-textual feuds going on in Mad Men. Shot on location at 42 Lispenard, Sabrina Saltiel and Kirsten Jordan/Douglas Elliman; Grooming by Shay Garcia Sasha Maslov for Observer You also got to guest star on The Mindy Project. Mindy was fun. Other than Superstore, it was the other time I played an elitist obnoxious idiot. Actually, they’re now our neighbors too. We shoot Superstore—our “Cloud 9” is literally as far away as I am from the other side of this room. So we see a bunch of them a lot. Actually ran in to Mindy two nights ago. Mindy made me play that on the ukulele. I was just talking to her about that—or, my wife was just complaining to her about that. Complaining? That was so charming! You didn’t have to live with me learning the ukulele. I don’t play the ukulele—nobody does. I had to learn that song and it took a while. Also “Teenage Dream” is not a ukulele-friendly song. So I had friends who were in a band who were over at our house, and I had them help arrange it so it sounded like something you’d hear in Hawaii at a resort. And in the process I also learned that “Over the Rainbow.” But at least now you can play the ukulele. I can’t! I don’t remember any of it. Just yesterday I was on the Harry Connick, Jr. show and they told me beforehand, “Harry wants you to play the ukulele,” and I had to say, I can’t. I’ll make a fool of myself. It’s like algebra: there’s no use for it in my life and so my brain has dumped it. Shot on location at 42 Lispenard, Sabrina Saltiel and Kirsten Jordan/Douglas Elliman; Grooming by Shay Garcia Sasha Maslov for Observer How quick did you guys get into a rhythm on the Superstore set? It’s so nice. Usually I feel like I have to lie about these things to people like you but I’m not lying! It was immediate. It was the pilot. We were like a cast that had been together for eight seasons at that point. There’s a weird synergy where everybody gels. It’s rare; it almost never happens I think, where it’s so unanimously cool, but it was for us right away. You’ve also been in a few pilots that didn’t work out. When you’re on a set, how soon do you know whether it’s going to work? I am a huge pessimist and I think that’s just the east coast Jew in me. I assume that the worst will happen. So I’m never optimistic. What’s funny is the rest of this cast is overly optimistic so like when we began this series, I was always the one going like, “Alright guys, let’s relax. Don’t buy an apartment just yet; let’s wait and see what the numbers are.” You spend every day creating a community and a family with a bunch of people, and then strangers decide if you get to see them again. It’s a strange situation. For instance, A to Z, which was the last NBC show I was on, was inevitably was A to M—that’s when we got cancelled. So did you two end up together? When it ended— we were still together, I think? We were having our issues, but we were never not going to end up together I think. This is the pessimist, and the negative in me, but I think it would have been an interesting dynamic to see us break up at the end of that first season and inevitably see us get together over the course of the series, but the second season would have been really cool to watch if we went off on our own and tried to date. But that was a group of people—I mean, I talk to Cristin [Milioti] all the time, she’s one of my best friends, and we share some of the crew on Superstore that we had then, but it’s a family, a community. You get used to each other and then all of a sudden it’s done. And it’s a really weird thing. But we felt it coming. We weren’t surprised. On that show at least. Do you like to watch your own shows? Yeah, I have to because now they force us to live-tweet it. Live-tweeting is so important to networks now. I think almost every episode last year, the entire cast watched together. Or the majority, at least. I don’t freak out watching myself; a lot of actors hate watching themselves and never will. It doesn’t bother me. I’m either happy about something, bummed about something but it’s already done so there’s nothing I can do about it, or I learn from it and can correct it. Shot on location at 42 Lispenard, Sabrina Saltiel and Kirsten Jordan/Douglas Elliman; Grooming by Shay Garcia Sasha Maslov for Observer Did you ever work in retail? The closes thing I ever did was I worked in Baskin Robbins when I was 14 but I got fired because I was a 14-year-old working at Baskin Robbins and I gave all of the ice cream away. Other than that, I’ve been a waiter before I was living off acting. Oh! Early on, you were in the second best Hilary Duff movie. The Perfect Man, yeah. Wait, what’s the first best. The one where she wanted to be a singer? With a British love interest— you can’t beat that. [Note: It’s Raise Your Voice. I saw it in theaters] It was around the same time. She sort of did all of those around the same time. That and the movie with Chad Michael Murray. Shot on location at 42 Lispenard, Sabrina Saltiel and Kirsten Jordan/Douglas Elliman; Grooming by Shay Garcia Sasha Maslov for Observer A Cinderella Story! I’m realizing now you might actually be in the third best… People love that movie. Yeah, I did that—god, a long time ago. 2003, or 2004. That was the big break that my agents thought was going to turn me into a big star that I then was not. But I had graduated Ithica, but I had moved to New York and did a play on Broadway—they made The Graduate into a play. I understudied Jason Biggs. I played small parts and understudied Biggs as the Hoffman part. And also Josh Radnor I understudied. Just three super Jew-y people. I’m allowed to say that, by the way. What’s funny is Jason is not Jewish. How I came into that was I was in college and I came in to audition because Jason was going to do a Woody Allen film, the Jewiest thing anyone could do, and it was to take over for Jason, and I auditioned a whole bunch of times and eventually did not get it—I lost out to Josh. And then when I moved to New York, they were like, “Hey, the understudy is leaving, he plays all of these other ridiculous parts. Come in and do that.” And now you and Josh both fell in love with Cristin Milioti. Yes. Exactly. Cristin and I shot the pilot, and then [the finale of How I Met Your Mother] aired, and then we started A to Z. She wouldn’t tell me how it ended. She lied to me actually! She was like, “It’s going to be this big thing,” and I was like, “Do you die?” and she’s like, “No, that’s ridiculous. I’m not going to tell you what happens, but no, that’s stupid.” And then she did! And it was like, you fucking lied to me! I think she had to do that though. I know, but that’s breaking a code. I understand if I walked up to her on the street, or even if I saw her at a party and I was just another actor, but we were love interest co-leads on our own show together. She can’t lie about that. But she needed to lie, because not saying anything would have given it away. She should have just said, “Yes. I die. Don’t tell anyone, Ben: the guy who I work with, new best friend.” “Superstore” is all-new on NBC, Thursdays 8/7c  Observer About Newsletters Advertise Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP

What do you see? It’s probably someone white, wearing pearls or boat shoes and a polo shirt. Are you resorting to a stereotype? Maybe, but research actually backs up every preconception running through your brain. Guardian US asked YouGov to poll young Republicans and Democrats on the brands they love. Republicans cited Tory Burch, Ralph Lauren, and Brooks Brothers as their favorites. They’re also big fans of Walmart, especially their in-house brand Faded Glory (yes, that joke writes itself.) On the other end, young Democrats were more likely to spend their money at H&M, American Apparel, Uniqlo, and Hot Topic. They were also into the controversial #mycalvins campaign, which wasn’t exactly beloved by conservatives. None of this is really a surprise. Young Democrats want to be perceived as flexible, adaptive, and wise to the latest trends. Young Republicans are more traditional, so they gravitate toward labels that repeatedly reference classic, stereotypical American imagery. So does this mean that all Republicans look alike? Guardian US talked Matt McCarrick, the campaign chairperson for the New York State Young Republicans. He had this to say about their perceived uniform style: “If you look at any of our photos, everyone kind of looks the same, it doesn’t matter if you’re African American or if you’re from the Orient or Asia,” said Matt McCarrick, 30, campaign chairman for the New York State Young Republicans. “Our pictures kind of speak for themselves.” Oh good! They have African-Americans and people from the Orient in their group photos. So glad the Republicans are finally embracing diversity.

Pictured are solar panels. (MLive file photo) Print Email Emily Lawler | elawler@mlive.com By Emily Lawler | elawler@mlive.com MLive.com on September 29, 2016 at 12:11 PM, updated September 29, 2016 at 12:12 PM comments LANSING, MI -- When it comes to deciding how to overhaul the state's energy policy, the Michigan legislature isn't suffering from a lack of input. According to an analysis from the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, at least 145 registered lobbyists have either submitted position statements to committees about proposed energy reforms or are registered as working for key players. That means the lobbyists outnumber the 144 state legislators -- a number which is typically 148 but has been lowered due to two resignations and two deaths. After the Nov. 8 general election, three of those vacancies will be filled. The 145 lobbyists MCFN counted are from all sides of the issue, including utilities and environmental groups. Some of the lobbyists who have weighed in came from companies like Walmart and U.S. Steel. Lobbyists from groups like Sierra Club and Michigan League of Conservation Voters have also weighed in. "In terms of the number of lobbyists working on a piece of legislation, this is the biggest that we've seen in the past few years," said MCFN Executive Director Craig Mauger. He noted the issue was a broad one that impacted everybody with a utility bill. But with so many organizations and lobbyists involved, he questioned whether the legislature was hearing their constituents too. "What's concerning is the question of whether the public is getting the chance to have the same influence over the bills that these groups who have lobbyists are," Mauger said. Mary McGraw of Rockford submitted testimony to the Senate Energy and Technology Committee as it considered the Senate Bills 437 and 438. She owns a small business and has solar panels on her home. She's part of the nonprofit Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association, which doesn't lobby. She's been reaching out to lawmakers to educate them about solar energy. Some have given her a call or considered her information. Others have had aides have conversations with her. So she's gotten some traction, but still worries lawmakers are listening more to the groups with PACs or lobbyists. "These packages really seem very one-sided towards utility interests. And they're forgetting about us little people out here who are the ones who support utilities," McGraw said. And she does think citizens could do more to make their voices heard -- like going to their representative's coffee hours, or attending meetings -- but says as a businessperson or worker it's hard to get to things in the middle of the day. She hopes lawmakers are listening to all of their constituents on this issue and not just 145 lobbyists. Utility companies are advocating for the legislation, and have a large number of lobbyists among their ranks. DTE Energy currently has 24 lobbyists, according to information provided by a spokesman. But not all of them are in Lansing interacting with lawmakers on a daily basis. "To assure that we are fully transparent, we take a highly conservative approach when registering company representatives as lobbying agents," the company said in a statement. "We register a number of individuals who do not routinely engage lobbying activity, including executives and technical experts who may meet with lawmakers on a very limited basis. We also register individuals who may interact with legislators in their districts on constituent concerns or other issues that come up from time to time." Consumers Energy also takes a conservative approach and registers many of its employees, said spokesman Brian Wheeler. According to the Secretary of State's lobbying database, Consumers has 15 lobbyist agents. But when it comes down to it, Wheeler said, there are only two people working as full-time lobbyists. "Consumers Energy is a registered lobbyist and has had two full-time lobbyist agents working in state governmental affairs. The company also retains multi-client lobbyists for strategic counsel on various state issues," Wheeler said. Both companies note that they use shareholder, and not ratepayer, dollars for lobbying activities. The energy legislation everybody is weighing in on is actually two sets of bills -- one in the House and one in the Senate. Both address issues like energy deregulation and renewable energy goals. Each version has passed out of committee but is awaiting action from a full chamber. The legislature is currently on a fall break, but the Senate returns for a week in October and both chambers are back after the Nov. 8 election.

First that parenting dilemma. These photos raising a big question. If you think someone is going too far disciplining a child in public should you intervene? The mom who took these photos did and Mara schiavocampo has her story. Good morning, Mara. Reporter: Good morning. That woman didn't just take picture, she put them on social media and her post went viral with tens of thousands of comments and shares. She says that girl was crying and begging her father to stop and when he wouldn't, she stepped in to force him. Erika Burch was shopping at her local Walmart in Texas when she saw this, a father appearing to pull his daughter's hair while he pushed the grocery cart. I said, you need to let her hair go now and he told me I needed to mind my own business. And I said right now that little girl is my business and you're going to let her hair go. Reporter: After confronting the dad and alerting authorities, the mother of four posted this photo to Facebook. Shared more than 242,000 times with at least 24,000 comments and over 42,000 likes. I received over 900 private messages in my Facebook. Reporter: So many comments calling Erika a hero saying bless you for helping a child and glad you confronted him but others writing, she needs to mind her own business. I don't care what they think. I know it's wrong and I don't regret doing it. Reporter: Ultimately the child was allowed to leave the store with her father and now the local police department has filed this report for possible injury to a child. Child protective services joining the investigation. Telling ABC news that while investigations are confidential, it is typical that cps will meet with the family including all the children in the home and determine if the family could benefit from services such as parenting classes or counseling. As for Erika Burch she said she would step in again. I'm not the president. I was just me, you know, somebody shopping in the grocery store. It's not okay to pull a child by the hair of their head. I don't care what they've done. Very powerful pictures. Burch says of the almost 900 private messages she received most were congratulating her for stepping in. As for that investigation, part of the reason officials say they let the girl go home with her father is because she didn't have any visible injuries. Robin. Martha, thank you. Joining us Ericka souter and Dr. Richard Besser. Thank you. Let's get into this. All right. Now, there is a distinct line and a difference between discipline and abuse. Ericka, do you think this woman did the right thing. I do think she did the right thing. You are allowed to discipline your child. So if you see something happening I'd ask yourself does it seem like this child is being injured or assaulted? That should be a barometer. But there are risks associated with that. Now, the parent who's doing the hitting could turn their rage toward you so you kind of have to be prepared for the situation kind of turning into something bigger. Rich, do you think it's okay to intervene. As a pediatrician the rules for me are different. I'm required by law if I think a child is being harmed to step in and report it. For the public there's no legal requirement but I think there's a moral requirement. He or she saw something going on in public that was wrong. This child was being emotionally abused in public and so she stepped in. That was a brave thing to do but when you do that, you know, you want to speak up. You want to try to de-escalate so understand you're dealing with a parent who's frustrated and so using a calm voice is important but if you think the child is actually being harmed and that doesn't work dialing 911 is appropriate. We heard in Mara's report a lot weighed in on this and it's about 50/50, maybe slightly in favor of the woman who stepped in but there were some that said something like this, Ericka. He was not beating -- referring to the father, he was not beating her or verbally abusing, Erika Burch needs to mind her own business. A lot of comments like that, as well. Is there like a social taboo if it's not your child not to step in. Seen a lot of cases on the other end where a parent lets their kids playout side in a yard and some neighbor or pass er passer-by calls the police and saying they're any flecked. There is a moral barometer that you really -- can you live with the fact that if you see something terrible happening to a child and you walk away, is that going to stay with you. Then you think about, you know, this is the way parents acting in public how are they dealing with that child at home so you have to decide on your own how to react. Speaking about doing it in public, the child has -- what is a ramification for a child that's being dealt like that publicly. Yeah, I mean when you think about child abuse, there's the physical abuse that, you know, everyone understands what that is but there's also emotional abuse and shaming and humiliating in public is a form of emotional abuse. Long-term those children are going to have trust issues. Here you have the person that they look to for security who's shaming them in public. Long-term that's not a good thing and hopefully child services will give them the tools they need. We don't have much time. The top tip you could give to parents dealing with this. Stay calm. It's very hard to do but if you need to take ten seconds to count backwards and not react aggressively with anger, with violence, that's incredibly important and don't be afraid to ask for help. Every parent around you has gone through it and all been pushed to the brink. Can I just say you are glowing. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Thank you. Yes. You got that glow. Thank you both very much. Dr. Besser will be taking your questions on Twitter. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

More secure chip credit cards starting to catch on locally Kelly Tyko , kelly.tyko@tcpalm.com 8:06 a.m. EDT September 29, 2016 Publix stores recently started accepting chip cards. (Photo: KELLY TYKO, TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS) 22 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE We’re finally starting to use our chip credit and debit cards as intended. The practice of dipping or inserting chip cards instead of swiping was supposed to become the new normal last October but it’s just now catching on. Oct. 1, 2015, was the deadline imposed by banks and credit card companies for stores to have the technology to read the new cards and also marked a liability shift. Since then, businesses not using new terminals have been on the hook for fraudulent transactions instead of the credit card companies. It’s a shift that affects shoppers in two main ways: more secure credit cards and longer waits at the checkout line. The United States is one of the last countries to migrate to chip credit cards, which also are called EMV cards, named for the companies behind the technology: Europay, MasterCard and Visa. The cards have been used in Europe and other countries for more than a decade. Nationally, 33 percent or two million merchants have activated their chip readers, according to a MasterCard news release that noted 88 percent of MasterCard U.S. consumer credit cards now have chips. Statewide, 70 percent of members of the Florida Retail Federation are EMV-compliant, said spokesman James Miller. “There was a significant delay earlier this year for adoption because the manufacturers weren’t able to produce enough terminals to keep up with the demand,” Miller said in an email. Locally, the majority of big retailers have made the switch including Macy’s, Target, Walmart, CVS and Walgreens. Publix completed the process of activating the chip readers at all of its Treasure Coast and South Florida stores on Sept. 22, Publix spokeswoman Nicole Krauss said in an email, adding that readers should be activated at all Publix stores by mid-October. This October, banks are liable for fraudulent ATM transactions made with MasterCard credit and debit cards if the machines are not updated. In October 2017, all ATMs and gas stations will face the same liabilities if they don't update. LONG WAITS It might only take a few extra seconds but sometimes waiting for a credit card payment to be processed feels like an eternity. It takes longer, five to 15 seconds on average, because of the many steps in the process. First the chip creates a one-time code, then the terminal sends it to the bank, which then matches the code to an identical one-time code and finally sends it back to the terminal. The extra time adds up. A recent report from Boston-based payment tech firm Cayan estimated businesses will experience 116 million hours of additional checkout time this year. Consumers who use their cards four times a day will spend five and a half hours per year waiting for chip card transactions, Cayan’s report found. In my experience what appears to take the longest is when shoppers accidentally continue to swipe their cards. MORE SECURE? While chip cards are accepted at retailers that don’t have the readers, these transactions don’t carry the extra protection. One reason chip cards are considered more secure is they are more difficult to duplicate than cards with just a magnetic strip. However, the cards would be much more secure if a PIN or personal identification number was required, which would make it more difficult to counterfeit. According to the Federal Reserve, when chips and PINs are combined, transactions are roughly 700 times more secure than older payment methods. But unlike the credit cards issued in Canada, Europe and other industrialized countries, most U.S. consumers are being issued "chip-and-signature" cards rather than "chip-and-PIN" cards. Credit card officials have said it’s so we don’t have to remember another number. There are some exceptions. In April, Discover CEO David Nelms announced the company would begin to migrate to chip-and-PIN. Target already requires PINs with its credit and debit cards and the federal government is requiring new and existing government credit cards be chip-and-PIN cards. Hopefully lawsuits filed against credit card companies could lead to more security. In May, Walmart sued Visa for requiring it to accept signatures instead of PINs as a form of verification for chip-based debit cards. Home Depot sued Visa and MasterCard in June in an attempt to get the companies to require PINs. I think more security would give shoppers the patience to deal with longer checkout lines.

I got a phone call from my repair shop giving me an update on my truck and they told me something that made me feel all warm and fuzzy. The magic words were: “Don’t worry, Mark, it’s all taken care of under your warranty.” After the last couple of months, that was music to my ears. Between the two trucks I’ve had work done on: the air-conditioning, a new heater core, a pair of radius arms, starter motors, AHI modules (whatever they are), an ongoing problem with the engine brake that will hopefully be solved by the warranty job and the usual preventive maintenance and servicing requirements, every one of which had me digging deep into my retiring on a Caribbean island and drinking rum for the rest of my life fund. Last month I wrote about the difficulty in deciding whether to keep my current trucks or trade them in. That conundrum was no longer keeping me awake at night as I had decided to sell them both and become a greeter at Walmart. I looked into it and unfortunately I don’t have enough qualifications for that, so I’m stuck with the trucks for now. If I could’ve made a snap decision I would’ve sold them both and bought older trucks that I could fix myself with a hammer and a 9/16th-inch wrench. At the time, that appealed to me as I was sick of all the niggles and even more annoyed at the constant swiping of my debit card. However, I wasn’t in a position to do that and I’m glad of that. An older truck may not have so much technology to go wrong, but because they lack that technology they are also less efficient and unless you have a real lemon, the increased efficiency of the new trucks will put more money in the bank. Plus, an older truck is a lot less comfortable than a newer truck. They’re louder and ride harder and after almost 30 years behind the wheel, I think I deserve a few creature comforts. I also don’t want to be slipping on coveralls and fiddling with trucks when I’m not driving them. Even though I enjoy turning wrenches, I don’t want to have to do so on a regular basis and that is exactly what an older truck needs. Instead of AHI modules, it will be alternators, compressors, wiper motors, steering and suspension components and stuff like that. These things all wear out and although they’re not as technical and complicated as modules, they still put the truck off the road and they will still keep my retiring on a Caribbean island and drinking rum fund from growing. So I’m back to sleepless nights again, except I’m not. I still don’t know which direction I’m going to take with my business, but I do know that it will be a decision that is made for me. It’s quite simple, really, and all about the numbers. If trading up to a new truck is going to get me closer to that bottle of rum, then that’s what I’m going to do. If keeping my current trucks will get me on that beach sooner, then that’s the decision I will make and there’s always the possibility of doing both. The way it’s been going lately, the trucks I have now will be like new as I replace one part at a time…salute. *** A fourth generation trucker and trucking journalist, Mark Lee uses his 25 years of transcontinental trucking in Europe, Asia, North Africa and now North America to provide an alternative view of life on the road.

It’s the drink that gets them going, the first hit of flavor in their day. It’s the steaming (or iced) cup that sets the tone for what’s to follow. And at a time when tastes have evolved past watery, gets-the-job-done brews into the bold, the origin-specific, and the fair trade certified, it had better be good. With so many interesting coffee roasters out there, including many who have set up shop in just the past few years, selecting the best one in each state was quite difficult. We researched our picks carefully, with an eye for detail that honors the studious methods of coffee innovators across the country. 1. ALABAMA // MAMA MOCHA’S COFFEE EMPORIUM & ROASTERS Location: Auburn, Alabama Take it from the caffeinated college crowd, who’ve left one rapturous review after another for this roaster and café: Mama Mocha’s makes the best coffee around. Owner Sarah Barnett Gill and her team get extra credit for blends that are both well crafted and highly eclectic, like Dawn of the Dead, a house roast with an extra caffeine jolt, and the whiskey-infused Black Moonshine. 2. ALASKA // KALADI BROTHERS COFFEE Location: Anchorage, Alaska In coffee-obsessed Alaska, Kaladi Brothers stays ahead of the curve with stringent quality standards and a splash of ingenuity. The company, which operates 13 cafes and began in 1986 as a roadside stand, selects only organic, shade-grown beans, then air roasts them—a process that many prefer for its clean, uniform flavor. With more than a million pounds of beans roasted each year, Kaladi offers plenty of fuel for those long, cold winters. 3. ARIZONA // CARTEL COFFEE LAB Location: Tempe, Arizona Cartel Coffee Lab via Facebook Cartel’s methods are no secret: Just stop by their Tempe warehouse for a tour, or browse their website for ratios and other nitty gritty details. Transparency aside, Cartel’s sophisticated roasting process isn’t easily duplicated. The same goes for its direct sourcing program and stringent barista training, which suffers no slouches. Taken together, Cartel’s process has helped the roaster and café become one of Arizona’s premier coffee destinations. 4. ARKANSAS // ONYX COFFEE LAB Location: Fayetteville, Arkansas A region best known for big companies like Wal-Mart and Tyson might not seem like the ideal place to roast small-batch coffee by hand. But Onyx has found an enthusiastic audience in Fayetteville, who come for their daily cup and for special events like roasting classes and an annual barista throw-down. Onyx prizes unique tasting notes like "mulled wine" and "brouléed grapefruit." And true to its name, it's a laboratory for experimental roasts, like micro-lot Ethiopian varietals and beans roasted with lactic acid. 5. CALIFORNIA // FOUR BARREL COFFEE Location: San Francisco, California Robert Raines via Flickr // CC BY 2.0 What does it take to be the best roaster in hip, caffeinated California? Start with a sourcing team that spends most months on the road seeking out the best beans from Africa, South America, and beyond. Then, using a vintage German roaster, turn out light, flavorful coffee that draws long lines of customers all hours of the day. In addition to mind-blowing coffee, Four Barrel offers classes like a "Water Quality Seminar" aimed at making you a better at-home brewer. 6. COLORADO // BOXCAR COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Boulder, Colorado The Rocky Mountain state has seen a boom in coffee roasters over the past few years. But Boxcar has a secret weapon: a refurbished 1929 Gothot Ideal Rapid roaster from Germany. The nearly century-old workhorse turns out beans that have garnered many a loyal patron in Boulder and throughout the country. To bring out the full flavor in every cup, Boxcar employs a special boiling method in its two cafes that utilizes custom-made flasks. It’s old school meets new school, with very flavorful results. 7. CONNECTICUT // J. RENÉ Location: West Hartford, Connecticut Proprietor José René Martínez Onofre thinks he might have actually tasted his first cup of coffee before he learned to walk. That early love affair led him to open his first shop in West Hartford in 2012, an "artisanal coffee gathering place" that’s as much a social hub as a java shop. Martínez is fanatical about bean sourcing and brewing techniques—French Press as well as Chemex pour-overs—which is probably why he’s earned rave reviews since he first unlocked his doors. 8. DELAWARE // NOTTING HILL COFFEE Location: Lewes, Delaware Notting Hill owner Amy Felker keeps her coffee roaster in the front window of her café in Lewes, but it’s not much of a distraction: she roasts most of her annual 40,000 pounds of coffee at night. Felker’s obsession with coffee is all-encompassing: she deals in flavored beans, often derided by coffee purists, and has found that some self-mixed concoctions wind up being her biggest sellers. (One tastes like a certain nautical-themed breakfast cereal.) The blends are also available via mail-order. 9. FLORIDA // PANTHER COFFEE Location: Miami, Florida Jimmy Baikovicius via Flickr // CC BY-SA 2.0 Panther’s reputation for an excellent cup has done more than expand their Miami-area footprint: their coffee is known all over the country. Locals can walk into their storefronts and get information sheets about growers; beans are available online. Not bad for a business that started serving cold brews out of a food truck. 10. GEORGIA // COOL BEANS COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Marietta, Georgia A "Best of Atlanta" winner in 2015, Cool Beans tackles more than 40 different varieties of coffee in a roaster they’ve dubbed Big Red. And if you can't make it in to sip your selection on their outdoor patio, the roasts are also offered via their web store. 11. HAWAII // BIG ISLAND COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Mountain View, Hawaii Big Island Coffee Roasters via Facebook As the only state that grows coffee in commercial quantities, Hawaii might be home to some of the freshest beans in the U.S. Big Island doesn’t have a retail front, but its distinctive artisanal beans are sold all over the territory and they've picked up virtually every award out there—the USDA even honored them with a grant for their continuing efforts to improve local coffee quality. If you ask nicely, they might even give you a farm tour. 12. IDAHO // DOMA COFFEE Location: Post Falls, Idaho Staunchly supportive of fair trade, the coffee buyers at DOMA go through considerable hoops—and expense—to support smaller, organic farmers. DOMA never skirts corners, shipping their coffees in recycled bags, utilizing a roaster that uses 80 percent less gas to operate, and making sure every cup served is as environmentally responsible as possible. 13. ILLINOIS // INTELLIGENTSIA Location: Chicago, Illinois In business for over 20 years, Intelligentsia has spread all over Chicago owing to demand for their specialty craft coffees. The key to their success: standing side-by-side with growers to develop and select their preferred beans. 14. INDIANA // BEE COFFEE Location: Indianapolis, Indiana Indianapolis Monthly named Bee Coffee Roasters one of the best indie coffee roasters in the city, thanks partly to their self-imposed limitations. The company uses only a five-pound roaster for beans, which means small and frequent batches of ultra-fresh coffee with a different flavor every time. Bee also likes to spend time on aesthetics: co-owner Andy Gilman spearheads a "League of Lattes" milk art competition in the city. 15. IOWA // SIDECAR COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Cedar Falls, Iowa Home-roasting began as a hobby for Jed Vander Zanden, but after he and his wife moved to Cedar Falls, Vander Zanden decided to launch his own business. He opened Sidecar in 2012, and java aficionados are welcome to swing by the downtown location on Washington Street to watch as he roasts small batches of specialty, direct-trade coffee beans from around the world. You can buy them at food co-ops, markets, and coffee shops around Iowa, or online. 16. KANSAS // PT’S COFFEE ROASTING CO. Location: Topeka, Kansas PT's Coffee Roasting Co. via Facebook Photojournalist Jeff Taylor, and his roommate, fast food chain manager Fred Polzin, founded PT’s (P for Polzin, T for Taylor) in 1993 after Taylor tried—and failed—to find a local outlet that brewed an amazing cup of coffee. Taylor eventually convinced Polzin to give roasting a try, and in 1997, PT’s reestablished itself as a roasting operation, and began sourcing beans from skilled artisan farmers around the world. Nearly 80 percent of their coffee is acquired through direct trade, meaning the company buys beans straight from the growers, cutting out the middlemen. In 2009, Roast magazine named PT’s their "Macro Roaster of the Year," and you can now find the company’s product across the Midwest and in select East Coast coffee shops. 17. KENTUCKY // SUNERGOS COFFEE Location: Louisville, Kentucky Louisville is famous for being the home of the Kentucky Derby—but it’s also becoming known as one of the South’s go-to coffee destinations. Sunergos Coffee (which gets its name from the Greek word meaning "working together") is a local coffee franchise and micro-roastery that sources sustainably harvested, responsibly farmed beans. Swing by the Woodlawn Avenue outpost, and you might even catch the roasters in action: their 1500-foot micro-roastery is at the back of the store, and is clearly visible through a glass wall separating the production facilities from the café area. And though Sunergos is still largely a regional operation, it has a national reputation: In 2014, it won the "America's Best Espresso" competition at Coffee Fest, an annual trade event for tea and coffee enthusiasts. 18. LOUISIANA // RÊVE COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Lafayette, Louisiana Deep in the heart of Cajun Country, you’ll find Rêve Coffee Roasters—a coffee shop/micro-roastery in Lafayette that was founded by two Louisiana natives, Nathanael Johnson and Christopher Pickle. Recently, they moved the business to a much larger location on Jefferson Street, which allows them to serve meals and use the bar space so employees can roast beans directly on site. Rêve operates a wholesale business, and sells its beans to local cafes, restaurants, and grocery stores. Many of the bean varieties come from Royal Coffee New York, but Rêve is also establishing direct trade operations with farms in Guatemala and El Salvador. 19. MAINE // TANDEM COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Portland, Maine Facebook In 2012, husband-and-wife team Will and Kathleen Pratt opened Tandem Coffee Roasters—a combination coffee shop and micro-roastery—in Portland's East Bayside neighborhood. Two years later, the duo converted an old gas station in Portland's West End into a second outpost—this time, a bakery and coffee shop. Tandem sources its beans from all over the world, and on Fridays patrons can visit the company’s East Bay location to enjoy free tasting sessions and watch the roasting process. And if you love coffee and music, you can sign up for Tandem’s "coffee and vinyl club," a partnership with online record sellers KMA in which subscribers receive both a new record and a different bag of Tandem’s beans each month. 20. MARYLAND // CEREMONY COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Annapolis, Maryland Ceremony Coffee Roasters sources coffee beans from four continents and imports them to their flagship location—a storefront/roastery in Annapolis (other locations are in Baltimore and D.C.). Java lovers who visit the franchise’s West Street location can enjoy a seasonal coffee menu, and at the building’s back they can watch the roasters in action (or, if interested, partake in a specialty brewing class). 21. MASSACHUSETTS // BARISMO COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Greater Boston Area Barisimo is small, yet flourishing—and more importantly, it’s ready to innovate. Founded in 2008, the roastery operates three Barismo cafés in the greater Boston area (Barisimo 171, a shop at the roastery’s original location in Arlington, operates a lab-style coffeebar). Barisimo sources direct trade beans from around the globe, but the roastery is equally known for its creative approach toward coffee: They recently developed a patent-pending cold-brew injector to make nitrogenated cold brew kegs. 22. MICHIGAN // MADCAP COFFEE COMPANY Location: Grand Rapids, Michigan Madcap Coffee via Facebook Madcap Coffee Company co-founders Trevor Corlett and Ryan Knapp—who launched their business in 2008—source their beans directly from farms or cooperatives around the world.  After sampling thousands of coffees, they select 15 to 20 to roast and sell. With that kind of attention to detail, it’s no surprise that their product is carried in select coffee shops around the country, from San Antonio to New York. Customers can sip on Madcap Coffee in two of the roastery’s specialty coffee shops in Grand Rapids (one of them is located adjacent to the micro-roastery, and lets customers watch the roasting process). East Coasters can also enjoy the brew: Madcap Coffee recently opened up a satellite office and training center in Washington, D.C. 23. MINNESOTA // PARADISE COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Ramsey, Minnesota If the word "artisanal" appeals to you, Paradise is the way to go. Since 2002, founder R. Miguel Meza and his team have been hand-selecting and micro-roasting the very best blends from growers in Hawaii, Costa Rica, and Ethiopia. Looking for a new morning roast? Check out Paradise’s chocolaty Blue Sky Breakfast blend, which scored 91 out of 100 in Coffee Review. 24. MISSISSIPPI // BEANFRUIT COFFEE COMPANY Location: Jackson, Mississippi BeanFruit proudly focuses on single-origin coffees and educating consumers about the beans in their cup. "We want our customers to be aware of what beverage they are drinking, where it came from, and how it affects coffee farmers around the world," says founder Paul Bonds. Try BeanFruit’s Kenya Nyeri Chinga Peaberry for a bright, complex roast with notes of melon and nectarine. 25. MISSOURI // ODDLY CORRECT Location: Kansas City, Missouri Oddly Correct via Facebook The self-described "coffee zealots" at Oddly Correct are on a mission "to freak out your morning cup." If that sounds like something you’d enjoy, head over to their website or check out the café on Main Street for a cup of Space Monkey Seasonal Espresso, which boasts a creamy body, raw-sugar sweetness, and tropical fruitiness. 26. MONTANA // BLACK COFFEE ROASTING CO. Location: Missoula, Montana If you like your coffee dark and your products green, head over to Black Coffee Roasting Co. in Missoula. The company and café’s blends are all sustainable, craft roasted, and 100 percent organic. They’re also delicious. For an indulgent sip, try the rich-bodied variety called The Hunt, which promises hints of baker’s chocolate, strawberry, honey, and graham cracker. 27. NEBRASKA // BEANSMITH COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Omaha, Nebraska Seasonal sourcing isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of coffee, but the heartland-based Beansmith Coffee Roasters have built a business around finding the freshest, most vibrant beans for every cup. For new autumnal flavors, pop into the Old Market Café on Harney Street in Omaha and try the smoky, clove-flavored Phoenix blend. 28. NEVADA // HUB COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Reno, Nevada Hub Coffee Roasters via Facebook Hub Coffee Roasters were founded on two ideals: coffee and community. (Don’t think coffee is an ideal? Just talk to them.) The company now has an online shop and three Reno locations and has recently begun sourcing its own beans from South America. A good pick: the Peruvian Nuevo Trujillo roast, with notes of plum and dried fruit. 29. NEW HAMPSHIRE // FLIGHT COFFEE CO. Location: Bedford and Dover, New Hampshire Flight Coffee Co. founder Claudia Barrett began with a dream and a passion for fresh, farm-to-pot coffee. Today she’s the leader of a small army of obsessive coffee roasters who regularly take classes to keep up with the latest science, techniques, and trends. Visit the roasting lab and tasting room in Bedford or treat the coffee connoisseur in your life to a monthly bean subscription. 30. NEW JERSEY // MODCUP COFFEE Location: Jersey City, New Jersey Modcup Coffee via Facebook Founded by Justin Hicks and Travas Clifton in 2013, Modcup prides itself on serving up the freshest roasts, and sells all of its coffee within 18 days of its roast date. In addition to Modcup’s Jersey City coffee shop and roastery, the company built a unique mobile roastery inside a restored 1969 Citroen H-Van, which was once used to deliver fresh bread in France. The truck now splits its time between serving fresh coffee outside the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Jersey City and making appearances at parties and fairs in the Tri-State area. 31. NEW MEXICO // MICHAEL THOMAS COFFEE Location: Albuquerque, New Mexico For over a decade, local coffee roaster Michael Thomas and his two daughters have created unique blends and single origin roasts for customers at their Albuquerque shops. Thomas and his team experiment with every new batch of beans they order to find the perfect roast profile for each. In recent years, Thomas has opened an online store as well. In addition to roasting their own beans, the two Michael Thomas Coffee shops in Albuquerque also host regular coffee classes, teaching coffee lovers about coffee history, and how to make different coffee varieties. 32. NEW YORK // GIMME! COFFEE Location: Ithaca, Trumansburg, and New York City, New York Winner of Roast magazine’s 2013 "Macro Roaster of the Year" award, Gimme! Coffee has come a long way since it was first founded in a charmingly cramped cafe in Ithaca back in 2000. Nowadays, the coffee roaster has seven locations in Ithaca, Trumansburg, and New York City, and supplies its beans to shops and markets across the country. The company prides itself on creating flavorful, high-quality blends and on its sustainable, ethical practices which include a composting program and partnerships with their coffee growers. 33. NORTH CAROLINA // COUNTER CULTURE Location: Durham, North Carolina counterculturecoffee via Flickr // CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Counter Culture is based in Durham, but sells its beans on its website, and wholesale to coffee shops around the United States. The North Carolina roaster believes in sustainable practices, embraces fully transparent business practices, and, of course, makes some truly delicious coffees. Unlike some specialty roasters, Counter Culture encourages its customers to make their versatile beans using any brewing method they want. They also offer free weekly coffee tastings and brewing classes at regional training centers in Durham and 10 other cities around the United States. 34. NORTH DAKOTA // TWENTY BELOW Location: Fargo, North Dakota You can find Twenty Below’s single origin roasts and blends online, served up at coffee shops throughout North Dakota, and at their Fargo coffee bar and roastery. The coffee roaster works with small farms and cooperatives to acquire beans that can’t be found at larger coffee chains, and reviewers on Yelp have called their roasts "delicious," "complex," and "unique." 35. OHIO // CRIMSON CUP COFFEE & TEA Location: Columbus, Ohio Crimson Cup Coffee & Tea may supply coffee to stores around the country, but it still roasts its beans carefully in small batches. Each shipment of 150-pound bags of coffee arrives at the Crimson Cup headquarters in Columbus, where a master roaster oversees the roast profile of each bean variety. The company, which won Roast magazine’s 2016 "Macro Roaster of the Year" award also hosts coffee tastings and roasting lessons at its Innovation Lab in Columbus.  36. OKLAHOMA // ELEMENTAL COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Elemental Coffee Roasters via Facebook Elemental Coffee Roasters in Oklahoma City is obsessed with serving up "elemental" coffee flavors. It puts an emphasis on retaining the natural flavors of its beans, and refuses to intentionally tamper with or add to its flavor. "You might say our coffee has a mind of its own," the Elemental website explains. "It tastes this way one day, but it may taste completely different the next." Elemental Coffee Roasters sells its coffees online and at its Oklahoma City location. 37. OREGON // STUMPTOWN COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Portland, Oregon Portland has a sea of high-quality coffee outfits, but Stumptown remains a favorite both locally and in cafes across the country. One of the pioneers of the third-wave coffee movement, Stumptown won Roast magazine's Roaster of the Year competition back in 2006. The coffee-focused Sprudge.com calls the company’s Portland headquarters, which opened in 2012, "an absolute sight to behold." The company hosts daily free tastings there, with $15 behind-the-scenes roastery tours and classes also available. If you do take a tour or an intro to coffee class, you get to take home your own bag of freshly roasted beans. 38. PENNSYLVANIA // SQUARE ONE COFFEE Location: Lancaster, Pennsylvania Square One Coffee is a family-owned roasting company that has accumulated some serious accolades. The roastery has won a Good Food Award in the coffee category three years running, and one of its baristas won 10th place at the U.S. Barista Championships in 2015. Stop by the Lancaster café and sip a brewed-to-order cup in the backyard garden, or head to the roasting facility across town to take a class alongside the cafe’s own up-and-coming talent, led by instructors certified by the Barista Guild of America and the Specialty Coffee Association of America. (There are also two locations to enjoy in Philly.) 39. RHODE ISLAND // VANUATU COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Providence, Rhode Island Vanuatu Coffee Roasters via Facebook Single-origin obsessives, pay attention. The beauty of Vanuatu Coffee Roasters lies in its absolute dedication to the South Pacific island nation that gives the roastery its name. Co-founder Jimmy Lappin traveled to the Republic of Vanuatu in 2009 as a tourist, and was so taken with the local coffee that he and his sister, Martha Soderlund, teamed up with a local cooperative to source beans exclusively from farmers on the island of Tanna. No need for milk here; Lappin boasts that Vanuatu coffee lacks any trace of bitterness. 40. SOUTH CAROLINA // COASTAL COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Summerville, South Carolina Coastal Coffee Roasters, located outside Charleston, sources beans from around the world, then roasts them to perfection in small batches. The downtown Summerville café is host to a rotating calendar of events, including yoga, open mic nights, and local music—and they serve up a decent sandwich to go with that perfect cup. 41. SOUTH DAKOTA // PURE BEAN ROASTERS Location: Rapid City, South Dakota Pure Bean Roasters was started out of a garage in 2013, and the owners only opened up a café this year, continuing to roast their beans at co-owner Mark Royalty’s home long after the company began shipping nationwide. Pure Bean only sells organic, fair trade beans that are air-roasted in small batches, rather than in the high-capacity drums that most commercial coffee roasters use. Instead of being stirred in a hot drum, the beans float on a bed of hot air, ensuring consistency in the roast. The result is a smooth, low-acid cup of coffee. 42. TENNESSEE // VIENNA COFFEE COMPANY Location: Maryville, Tennessee Don’t head to Nashville for the state’s best coffee. Take a trip to the Vienna Coffee Company outside of Knoxville. The small-batch roaster has everything from single-origin and estate coffees to certified shade-grown, bird-friendly, Rainforest Alliance-approved, and fair-trade beans. If you aren’t in the area to come by for a free tasting, you can always sign up for their mail-order coffee club. 43. TEXAS // BROWN COFFEE COMPANY Location: San Antonio, Texas Brown Coffee Company via Facebook Brown Coffee is one of San Antonio’s most well-established craft coffee outfits, and even other cafe proprietors admit that owner Aaron Blanco is “the most coffee-knowledgeable person in Texas." In 2015, Food Network star Alton Brown called the drink he got from Brown Coffee "the best cup of coffee I’ve ever had in my life." Beyond the delicious drinks, the PourLab hosts classes for a range of skill levels, from novices looking for basic tips to enthusiasts wanting to learn how to identify the type of soil coffee was grown in just from tasting the brew. 44. UTAH // MILLCREEK COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Salt Lake City, Utah Over two decades ago, the aptly named Brewster family founded Millcreek Coffee Roasters in a small building with one 12-kilogram roaster. Today they’re a major presence in the Salt Lake City coffee scene with a café, a wholesale store, and an outpost in the city’s airport. Coffee lovers who don’t have time to pick up their beans in person can shop for them online. Millcreek also offers “Roaster’s Choice” coffee subscriptions that are delivered each month by the pound. 45. VERMONT // VERMONT COFFEE COMPANY Location: Middlebury, Vermont The folks at Vermont Coffee Company know that good coffee starts with a quality product. That’s why all their beans are carefully selected and slow-roasted to order in small batches. They also know that the coffee experience doesn’t have to end when a customer finishes their cup. They write on their website: “Coffee is a social stimulus that brings people together to share ideas and stories, and when people come together, a community is formed and friends are made.” The company proved their commitment to this concept when they opened a community theater in the neighborhood. If you can’t make it to the Vermont Coffee Company Playhouse or their on-site café, you can find their coffee in establishments along the East Coast. 46. VIRGINIA // CERVANTES COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Springfield, Virginia Cervantes Coffee via Facebook Cervantes's single origin coffee is sold in over 40 retail stores in Virginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. Java enthusiasts who live near their north Virginia headquarters can swing by for tours or coffee "cupping" (think wine tasting) events every second Friday of the month. The entire coffee warehouse is also available to rent out for private affairs. 47. WASHINGTON // DILLANOS COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Sumner, Washington In a state as obsessed with coffee as Washington, Dillanos Coffee Roasters has managed to rise to the top. They’ve been recognized as best in the region multiple times, and in 2011 Roast magazine named them the best macro coffee roaster in North America. With dozens of coffees of varying roasts and sources available to purchase, they offer something for every type of coffee connoisseur. 48. WEST VIRGINIA // BLACK DOG COFFEE Location: Shenandoah Junction, West Virginia Black Dog’s café in Shenandoah Junction offers coffee and a show. Patrons can come to see one of America’s oldest operating coffee roasters in action—a vintage 1931 Jabez Burns & Sons model named Plutonius. The business also hosts community events like yoga classes, drum circles, and taco Tuesdays. Even without the entertainment factor, a taste of their single origin, micro-roasted coffee is worth a trip (or at least an online order). 49. WISCONSIN // KICKAPOO COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Milwaukee, Wisconsin Kickapoo Coffee via Facebook Beer isn’t the only brew in Wisconsin that deserves attention. The team behind Kickapoo Coffee Roasters has been roasting high-quality, full-flavored coffee in Milwaukee since 2005. Once a month, they open up their tasting room for the public to sample offerings, tour the roastery, and ask any coffee-related questions they may have. 50. WYOMING // JACKSON HOLE COFFEE ROASTERS Location: Jackson, Wyoming Jackson Hole Coffee Roasters brings a European commitment to coffee to Western Wyoming. Owners Stefan and Lubomira got their start in the coffee business as baristas. They took over Jackson Hole Coffee Roasters after moving to the U.S. from Slovakia, and today they sell their coffee wholesale to restaurants, coffee bars, and specialty stores and serve it fresh at their café.

It has its largest office in downtown Elgin, and smaller ones in Chicago and West Chicago.   Elena Ferrarin Follow @ElenaFerrarin     The Latino Treatment Center is likely to be the third human services nonprofit slated to get an emergency loan from the city of Elgin to help it deal with the consequences of the state's fiscal crisis. City council members voted unanimously at their committee of the whole meeting Wednesday to approve the $50,000 loan to the agency, which provides bilingual, outpatient substance abuse treatment to mostly court-mandated Spanish-speaking clients. "It's been a really tough year," agency executive director Adriana Trino said. Even with the legislature's stopgap spending plan through December, the Latino Treatment Center has not received any state payments for the current fiscal year and is owed $65,000, Trino said. The agency is down to five staff members after laying off about half its employees, she said, and it is dipping into reserves and using a line of credit to pay for salaries. "Instead of shopping at Wal-Mart for supplies, we are going to the Dollar store," Trino said. "Everything we could do, we've done." About 75 percent of the center's 275 clients are from Elgin. The emergency loan program is, ultimately, all about helping residents, Mayor David Kaptain said. "That's what a city is supposed to do. We have to protect the people within our community." The agency has smaller offices in Chicago and West Chicago, one of which likely would close if the financial situation doesn't improve by year's end, Trino said. The agency's budget for the 2016-17 fiscal year is about $342,000, mostly in state contracts including a new $80,000 contract with the Department of Children and Family Services, Trino said. "We are excited about that and it's great on paper, but it doesn't mean anything with the state," she said. Elgin's emergency loan program has $200,000 remaining. The Association for Individual Development got a $200,000 loan in January, followed by Ecker Center for Mental Health with a $175,000 loan in March. Ecker made its first payment; AID hasn't made any payments yet, Elgin senior management analyst Laura Valdez-Wilson said. The loans are to be repaid after the state passes a budget or within 18 months. "The state has made some payments, so we are working individually with each agency," she said. Councilwoman Tish Powell called for legislators to take action. "These are real people that are being affected by the state's lacking of having a budget." Get articles sent to your inbox.

A weeks-long funding fight was wrapped up in hours Wednesday and just like that, Congress is gone until after the election. The deets: “The legislation, which had White House backing, would fund the federal government through Dec. 9, provide $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus and send $500 million to Louisiana and other states facing natural disasters,” report my intrepid Hill colleagues Rachael Bade, Seung Min Kim and Ben Weyl. The House also passed a water infrastructure bill authorizing $170 million in Flint aid, a key to Wednesday’s rapid wrap up. WHAT’S NEXT FOR PAUL RYAN? House Speaker Paul Ryan’s meteoric rise has its downsides too—people are always speculating about what’s next when he’s just trying to tout his ambitious policy agenda. Another go at speaker? A presidential run, perhaps? Jake and Rachael take a look at the road ahead: “Ryan’s allies say he won’t be held hostage. Some of them say he’d be better off politically not running for speaker, with all the day-to-day trench warfare involved. But for now, Ryan isn’t going anywhere.” “But the speaker’s allies have become keenly aware of his precarious political future, the daunting challenge of governing under a President Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump … All while weighing the possibility of his own bid for president, which Ryan did not rule out in a speech on Wednesday.” GOP: NO CUBA AMBASSADOR FOR OBAMA – Senate Republicans have long made clear that if President Barack Obama tried to nominate an ambassador to Cuba, they wouldn’t move to confirm the nominee. Well, Obama did – by nominating the U.S.’s current top diplomat, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, to the post – and GOP senators aren’t changing their mind. “This is not something that we’re gonna deal with this year, OK? It’s just not,” Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, whose panel would take up the ambassador nomination, told Huddle. Corker speculated that the White House put forward the nomination to “change the subject” from another big foreign policy issue on the Hill this week: the congressional override of Obama’s veto of legislation allowing 9/11 families to sue foreign governments for terrorism committed on U.S. soil. Late in the game, man: Even Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a big Republican backer of the Obama administration’s policy to normalize relations with Cuba, noted: “It’s kind of late in the game.” Still, he stressed the need for the United States to have a Senate-confirmed ambassador to the communist-led nation. “You can have your disagreements with the president on the policy, but Americans traveling and doing business with Cuba deserve to have full representation,” Flake told Huddle. “Nobody’s questioning this guy’s qualifications. DeLaurentis is a skilled diplomat and he’s not an Obama bundler.” WELCOME TO FRID—ERR—THURSDAY, Sept. 29. You’re reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. This rain is bummin’ us out but we’re glad the threat of working this weekend is off the table. #ThanksCongress TODAY IN CONGRESS— The Senate convenes at 10 a.m. but there will be no votes. The House is gone. AROUND THE HILL— Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer hold a press conference at 10:30 a.m. in S-325. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi holds her weekly press conference at 10:45 a.m. in HVC Studio A. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell holds a press conference at 11 a.m. in S-325. House Speaker Paul Ryan holds his weekly press conference at 11:30 a.m. in HVC Studio A. Sens. Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey, Jeff Merkley, Ed Markey and Mazie Hirono hold a press conference on TPP in S-325 at 12 p.m. Paparazzi watch: The legendary Patti LaBelle will be on Capitol Hill today touting her new line of desserts during an invite-only reception and tasting hosted by Walmart. Bres could hardly contain his excitement when he heard the news. OFF THE HILL— Speaker Ryan will participate in the Washington Ideas Forum starting at 9:05 a.m. Tune in: http://theatln.tc/2dG1kaN THE OTHER HOUSE SPEAKER— House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan is arguably the second most powerful House Republican, but can he transcend being more than just the leader of the 40-odd rebels who are a thorn in leadership’s side? Rachael traveled to Ohio for the Jordan deep dive. Jordan’s power “seems to have reached a tipping point,” she writes. “An increasing number of Jordan’s Republican House colleagues are fed up with his tactics. In the case of the impeachment hearing, it gave him and his allies another cathartic moment to rake [IRS Commissioner John] Koskinen over the coals, but the exercise mostly just angered other Republicans.” Damn the torpedoes: “Jordan stands by the group’s damn-the-torpedoes approach, on impeachment and plenty of other matters (and there have been plenty) … ‘We have to win on something,’ he said during an interview in his central Ohio district, frustration bubbling in his voice. ‘It’s like a football team that’s 0 and 9. The last week of the season, you’re not playing for the state playoffs; you’re playing to win the game and set the tone for the future.’” CONGRESS NEEDLES OBAMA ONE LAST TIME—Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to override the veto of a bill allowing 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. That, coupled with the bitter finger-pointing from the White House and frustrated lawmakers that followed was “a fitting coda to the dysfunctional relationship between the Obama White House and Capitol Hill,” reports Seung Min. Where ya at? “Notably, many influential lawmakers shared the White House’s concerns about the legislation …But instead of siding with the administration, Congress ended up blaming the White House for being MIA in the fight.” DOES TED CRUZ ENJOY THE SENATE LIFE? “When he’s not being pulled back into the presidential race, [Sen. Ted] Cruz appears to be doing his day job with a little less confrontation than he is normally credited with by his colleagues,” Paul Kane writes for the Washington Post. “The senator disagrees with the assessment that he’s any different now than when he provoked a government shutdown in 2013 over Obamacare. …But some Republican colleagues — clearly not all, but some — have detected a slight change in tone, at least for now.” THE BOEHNER BIRTHDAY SONG LIVES ON— Former House Speaker John Boehner would probably be proud that his infamous birthday song is living on long after his retirement. Senate Republican freshmen, many of them former House members, got together to sing “happy birthday” to fellow freshman (and former House lawmaker) Bill Cassidy in the Capitol rotunda. Watch the video: http://bit.ly/2daKRbW GOP ADVICE TO TRUMP: LEAVE LEWINSKY OUT OF IT— Senate Republicans had some advice for Donald Trump this week: Stay away from Bill Clinton’s history of sex scandals when criticizing Hillary, Burgess reports. It’s just not worth it, they say. But is it fair game? “‘I’d prefer that didn’t happen,’ said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). ‘I can’t say it’s out of bounds because she’s put up with it over and over.’" On the flip side, if Trump did dredge up the past, Clinton backers say it “would allow them to bring up Trump’s own infidelities and crass talk about women and sex over more than two decades, a contrast the party believes would hurt Trump far more than it would hurt Clinton. ‘He's got a problem not just with women but with people who care about women,’ said Sen.

As a mother, her primary concern was making sure he received the best care available, leading to the greatest recovery possible. Before the procedure, she asked her son’s care team if a multimodal analgesic (MMA) approach could be used during and after surgery. She knew MMA therapy would mean her son would receive multiple types of pain medications to treat different pain pathways in his body, which could reduce the amount of opioids he would receive. Fortunately, Brock’s surgery was successful. His care team did an excellent job of helping him manage his pain with MMA therapy, and stay on track for his recovery following surgery.

Tribe called vest: deconstructing the uniform of the young Republican Do people dress according to their politics? YouGov found millennial Democrats are more interested in fashion and are more diverse dressers than Republicans While millennial Republicans go for classics, millennial Democrats are more likely to buy contemporary clothing brands. Illustration: Joanna Gniady Arwa Mahdawi Thursday 29 September 2016 07.00 EDT Last modified on Friday 18 November 2016 10.07 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close With only 20% of millennials identifying with the GOP, being a young Republican has never been quite so unfashionable. But following fashion has never really trended with those leaning right. Pearls, blazers and super-straight hair for the young ladies; sweater vests, chinos and helmet hair for the gentlemen. You could call it GOPcore: a fashion-backward uniform of uniformity. 'I don’t like this election': will millennials, the biggest generation, turn out to vote? Read more But are these just stereotypes, or do young people really dress differently based on their political affiliation? We asked YouGov, a global research company, to look into whether the statistics support the stereotypes. And we found that they do. While both young Democrats (YDs) and young Republicans (YRs) channel their politics into their wardrobes to some extent, Republican values make a far more obvious sartorial statement. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Young Trump supporters at Liberty University in Virginia. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images YouGov analyzed survey responses collected from a panel of more than 200,000 Americans and found that millennials who identify as Democrats are more interested in fashion and are more diverse in their dress sense than their Republican counterparts. They also spend more money on clothes and have bought more categories of clothing recently than millennial Republicans. Further, YDs are more likely to say they “follow the latest trends and fashion” while YRs are more likely to say they “tend to stick to classic items that are timeless rather than go for whatever is ‘in-fashion’”. So, what timeless classics are hanging in conservative closets? According to the data it’s an unsurprising cast, including Brooks Brothers, LL Bean, Clarks, Ralph Lauren, Tory Burch and Hermès. They’re also more likely to buy from budget labels such as Wet Seal and Walmart-brand Faded Glory. In another parallel with the GOP, Wet Seal has been struggling to stay relevant with the young lately, closing almost two-thirds of its stores last year. As for Faded Glory: insert your own joke here. Brands most often purchased by young Democrats and young Republicans While millennial Republicans go for classics, millennial Democrats are more likely to buy contemporary clothing brands such as American Apparel, H&M, Uniqlo and Vans, as well as more alternative labels such as Hot Topic. They’re also more likely to buy Calvin Klein, whose recent super-sexualized #mycalvins campaign had a lot of people clutching their pearls. If you’re reading the Guardian, odds are you’re wearing one of those labels right now. What does all this mean? Commenting over email, Ted Marzilli, CEO of BrandIndex at YouGov, said: “People’s core values are often reflected in the brands that they wear. For example, Uniqlo is known for being collaborative and relaxed – classic but a little edgy. Brooks Brothers by contrast is more traditional and appeals to those who associate themselves with upper-middle-class America and American heritage.” What first-time voters think of the 2016 election – in pictures Read more Dr Anna Akbari, founder of Sociology of Style, says it’s not really surprising that people dress according to their politics. “The way we dress is the fastest, easiest, most frequently presented outlet for people to understand who we are [and] how to treat us,” she said over the phone. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump at the US Open. Photograph: Team GT/GC Images “I think both political persuasions have a tribalistic quality, but it’s easier to spot Republican values in action,” Akbari added. “If you think about how traditionalism would manifest itself sartorially, it’s not surprising that it’s in something that’s preppy, that doesn’t change that much, and that isn’t that open to personal expression. It might be easier to spot Republican tribalism because the Democratic one allows more for more diversity.” What do millennial Republicans think about all this? I asked a few (12 to be exact – a mixture of friends of friends and members of Young Republican groups), and the majority seemed happy to agree that they dressed in a more formal, preppy and uniform way than peers of other political persuasions. “If you look at any of our photos, everyone kind of looks the same, it doesn’t matter if you’re African American or if you’re from the Orient or Asia,” said Matt McCarrick, 30, campaign chairman for the New York State Young Republicans. “Our pictures kind of speak for themselves.” I guess if the classically tailored shoe fits … If you look at any of our photos everyone kind of looks the same Matt McCarrick So, are YRs consciously, um, Orienting their clothes to their values? “I think we try to buy more American than foreign,” McCarrick says. And indeed, except for Hermès and Clarks, all the clothing brands they over-index against are American and strongly brand themselves as such – Under Armour has a Country Pride collection, for example. While YRs may like to wear their patriotism on their sleeves, their conservative dress sense isn’t necessarily a straightforward reflection of Republican conservative values. Indeed, Maria Gershuni, 21, deputy chairwoman of the New York Federation of Republicans, is keen to stress that when it comes to many social values, millennial Republicans aren’t much different from young Democrats. “Young Republicans are really pro-LGBTQ rights, for example.” 'How do we support a racist?' Young Republicans grapple with 2016 election Read more Instead of being the embodiment of conservative views, Gershuni believes that “the way we dress is a stability thing”. A way to “give yourself authority and be taken more seriously”. She explains this is particularly helpful at a time when a majority of young people skew left, meaning young Republicans can feel like a minority. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Polo golf shirts by Ralph Lauren at the New York Golf Center. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo There does, indeed, seem to be a strong feeling among millennial conservatives that they are outnumbered and often misunderstood. Karin Agness, founder of the Network of enlightened Women, is trying to change that with #ShesConservative, a social media campaign that aims to shatter stereotypes about young Republicans. The campaign video features sad music as conservative young women, dressed in pearls and blazers, say solemnly and seemingly unironically to the camera, “this is what a conservative looks like”. Unfortunately I’m not sure the video will have quite the rebranding effort that’s intended. Indeed, you almost expect to see “brought to you by Tory Burch, Ralph Lauren and LL Bean” in the closing credits. Methodology: YouGov analyzed a database of over 200,000 Americans to identify clothing brands that significantly over-indexed with either millennial Republicans or millennial Democrats. This was based on data showing apparel brands people reported they were more likely to buy as well as apparel brands people had actually bought in the past three months.

Wiese is the largest shareholder in budget store Shoprite as well as lower-end furniture, apparel and household goods retailer Steinhoff. Bringing the two together would allow him to add groceries to his sprawling discount empire. The merger, if it happens, would also pull together Wiese's retail assets under one roof following Steinhoff's nearly $6bn (R81.81bn) acquisition in 2014 of the magnate's budget clothing retailer Pepkor and create a global retail giant worth at least R400bn. "People will speculate about that," he told Reuters in a rare interview on Tuesday at his modest offices overlooking factories in the dusty northern Cape Town industrial suburb of Parow. "People know that I am 75 years old, and I fortunately have a son who is in business with me, but as a family we are continually looking at consolidating our business interests. So, it would be, in a way, a natural development." Since Steinhoff's Pepkor acquisition, some analysts have wondered if Wiese, along with Shoprite's chief executive Whitey Basson and Steinhoff's Markus Jooste were working on a tie-up. Wiese, who describes himself as a "realist, pragmatist", started Pepkor in the 1960s, in Upington on the southern edges of the Kalahari desert, after spotting an opportunity to bring cheaper clothes to the poor. He then transformed budget chain Shoprite from a six-store company in the 1970s to one with hundreds of stores across Africa, from South Africa to the Democratic Republic Congo, dwarfing rivals including Wal-Mart's South African unit Massmart. His discount strategy, which also now includes investments in clothes retailer New Look, has catapulted him to the cover of Forbes magazine as one of Africa's richest businessmen. "Why is it so successful? ...The people who earn a lot of money are a small portion and then at the base is where your mass market is, where people have limited disposable income and we're aiming at that market," he said. Wiese studied law in Stellenbosch, a close-knit town dominated by Afrikaans-speaking whites, but lives in Clifton, an area of Cape Town overlooking the Atlantic Ocean with some of South Africa's most expensive properties. He owns a high-end vineyard near Stellenbosch, an area dotted with executive golf clubs, but said he "finds playing golf boring." New Look Wiese is also a top shareholder and board member in South African investment heavyweight Brait, which last year bought gym chain Virgin Active, a relative outlier in his business model as it targets middle-class consumers. More in line with the low-cost theme, was Brait's purchase of no-frills retailer New Look. Wiese said Brait's "most obvious" growth trajectory was through its existing businesses that also include UK supermarket chain Iceland Foods and South African staples foods maker Premier. "There is plenty of scope (to grow). It's got a strong management team and the biggest scope lies within the existing businesses. New Look for instance, our clothing retail operation in the UK, has identified China as a major growth area," he said. Wiese said New Look was looking to open 500 stores within three years in China, where it already runs 90 outlets. "China is an enormous market," Wiese said, describing the New Look's store expansion plan as a "drop in the ocean" given the size of the Chinese population. Virgin Active, which has taken top spot market in Italy and its biggest chain is located in South Africa, has identified Asia-Pacific as the next growth market thanks to a growing population of health-conscious consumers, he said. Wiese was optimistic for the outlook for Europe despite gloomy economic forecasts but was cautious about the idea of snapping up cheaper assets in Britain following its June vote to leave the European Union. "Undoubtedly it does offer opportunities but there are greater risks because none of us know how it (Brexit) is going to play out," he said. "There are studies that show that by 2040, Britain will have a bigger economy than Germany and a population of over 80 million people, that's a market you can't ignore." Political damage In South Africa, several businessmen, including the outspoken chief executive of gold miner Sibanye has called for President Jacob Zuma to resign after a series of scandals. Wiese said as a businessmen rather than a politician, he would like to stay out of politics. However, he said that the country's leadership was hurting Africa's most industrialised economy, which is expected to grow below 1% this year. "It is clear to a blind man that today the top leadership in the government is seen as a problem. It is not helping our economy. That is a fact of life," he said. But Wiese also dismissed suggestions by some analysts that he was looking to preserve his wealth by moving assets abroad during the political turbulence that has also drawn in Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. On the contrary, he said he expected business to continue to expand, including its interests in South Africa, with Virgin Active for example having its head office in London but earning more than 60% of its EBITDA, or core profit, in South Africa. "There is no bias to disinvest - in fact the very opposite," he said.

By Ben Ames Comment Distribution center managers have long had a conflicted relationship with radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. Like a hotshot high school player drafted by the big leagues only to fade into relative obscurity, the technology has never quite lived up to its glittering promise. RFID burst onto the scene in 2003, swaggering into the stadium when Wal-Mart named the technology its starting pitcher in a bold effort to track items throughout its distribution network. But the technology failed to live up to its promise, largely because the high cost of RFID tags and readers put it out of reach of all but the biggest corporations. Demoted to the minors, RFID has been clawing its way back into the supply chain big leagues ever since, finding success in specialty applications such as tracking high-priced fashion apparel, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. Despite those wins, RFID continues to be dogged by the perception that tags and readers will remain too expensive for widespread use until they reach mass production. "That was the challenge when we first got into the industry almost 25 years ago, and it still exists today," said Ken Ehrman, CEO of I.D. Systems, a supplier of asset tracking solutions. "Tags are very expensive compared to bar codes, so there's a 'chicken and egg' problem; if the costs were lower, the volume would be there, but without the volume, you can't drive down the cost." Some say a solution to this existential dilemma has been under users' noses the whole time. Instead of waiting around for prices to drop to the point where the technology is cheap enough for item-level inventory tagging—a task at which bar codes already excel—warehouse and DC managers could use RFID to track much more valuable stuff—the supply chain assets (think lift trucks, tractor chassis, and handheld computers) that make a distribution center tick. TRACKING CRITICAL ASSETS In asset management, RFID may have finally found its niche where supply chain operations are concerned. Rather than simply tracking inventory, it can be put to higher uses, like serving as the enabling technology for sophisticated data collection initiatives. As for what types of assets DCs are tagging, that varies all over the map. While some operations tag assets like returnable containers that are routinely sent off site, others track items that are intended to remain inside a facility, like manufacturing tools or IT equipment. "One of the biggest problems is [warehouse workers] losing handhelds; they put it on a pallet and lose it when the pallet gets loaded and moves," said Tom O'Boyle, director of RFID at Barcoding Inc., a Baltimore-based company that specializes in software and hardware for bar coding, RFID, and wireless systems. As a case in point, O'Boyle cites the example of a customer that was losing 20 percent of its handheld bar-code scanners every year, running up a hefty replacement tab for the units, which cost $1,500 to $2,000 apiece. "And more important than the replacement cost is the ability to outfit the next shift," said O'Boyle. "They need the handhelds for picking, packing, and putaway." Balanced against those two costs, the customer easily justified its investment in RFID tags to track its assets. Another of Barcoding's customers turned to RFID to help it keep tabs on the tractors used to move heavy rolls of paper around a facility. "These are big pieces of equipment, but [the client] often couldn't find them in the 3 million-square-foot facility because certain workers would hide the vehicle by parking it behind other equipment," O'Boyle said. "That way, when [the driver] came back for his next shift, no one would have adjusted his seat, moved his mirrors, or changed his radio station." NEXT-GEN RFID Until recently, companies looking to track supply chain assets had just two choices when it came to RFID tags. The first option was the passive RFID tag, which is a relatively inexpensive item costing a dollar or two. The tag cost is only part of the story, however, since users also need an infrastructure of readers and software to gather the information encoded in the tags. That's because passive tags lack an internal power source and cannot transmit a signal. In order to collect the tags' data, users must scan them with a handheld reader within a 10-foot range or pass them through a fixed-read zone like a tollbooth portal. This Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon is part of Barcoding Inc.'s Active Asset Tracker Solution, which tracks items using the Internet of Things. Option two was the active RFID tag, which costs anywhere from $25 to $150. Active tags, which contain their own power supply, are capable of transmitting signals that can be read from as far as 50 to 100 feet away. Those signals can be detected by stationary readers with overlapping coverage areas, then triangulated to pin down the tag's location. Now, a third option is emerging that combines some of the best features of active and passive tags. Known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the technology was originally developed for smartphones, so the signal can be read by consumer devices that run on the iOS and Android operating systems. The standard was first deployed for "location-aware services," such as retail applications in which tags affixed to store shelves beam discount offers to the smartphones of passing shoppers. But BLE tags have since been ruggedized to meet industrial standards for shock, temperature, vibration, and battery life. And since they communicate on the common wireless standard used in consumer mobile devices, they require far less infrastructure investment than other tracking technologies do. BLE tags can communicate limited information, but their falling price will soon open up new opportunities in supply chain asset tracking, such as keeping track of specialized tools or even keys to equipment. "We're at the leading edge of that technology now, so they cost $15 or $20 or $25 each, but they are at the highest point," O'Boyle said. "My guess is that in three to five years, they will be under $10." E-COMMERCE DRIVES NEED FOR ASSET TRACKING Interest in RFID and BLE is particularly strong among retail industry distribution operations that are struggling to fill e-commerce orders within ever-tighter time windows. "Fulfillment centers were designed with an order turnaround time of X, and now they want to drive that to half of X," said Mark Wheeler, director of supply chain services at Zebra Technologies Corp., a supplier of tracking technology. Nickel-sized RFID tags made by Zebra Technologies Corp. are used to track NFL football players during games. For these types of facilities, asset tracking is mainly a matter of ensuring that workers can lay their hands on the warehouse tools and equipment they need in their daily operations—items that can be easily misplaced when a DC is running at full steam. A shortage of even the most basic totes, carts, or pallets can throw a wrench in the works of a fast-paced e-commerce fulfillment operation. With its low tag costs, passive RFID offers users a way to improve the tracking of those basic assets. "Asset management is one of the key applications," said Wheeler. "Users want to control their assets, keep track of where they are, and reduce shrink of assets and the inventory they're associated with." In contrast, active RFID is a better match for a facility that's looking to track moving assets both inside the facility and out in the yard. "This is great for classic warehouse applications where real-time location is a step up from the level of visibility you have with warehouse management systems (WMS), which only know the last location you scanned," Wheeler said. "When we really know the location of lift trucks and people, it can lead to improved safety, productivity, and workflow." SENSORS MAKE TAGS SMARTER In response to the growing interest in RFID-enabled asset tracking, some vendors are shifting their focus from ways of making tags cheaper to ways of making tags smarter. That is, they're manufacturing tags that are capable of determining much more about each asset than just its location. As part of that effort, RFID suppliers have begun outfitting their tags with sensors, software, microprocessors, and batteries. Loaded with extras, such an RFID tag could be the size of a TV remote and cost anywhere from $250 to more than $1,000, said I.D. Systems' Ehrman. But the tag's enhanced capabilities would more than offset the extra cost, he argues. "If a Wal-Mart truck is sitting there with a loaded trailer and the door is opened, we will notice," Ehrman said. "Or if it's been sitting at the DC for more than two hours, we could send a message to the manager that it is outside its operating parameters." Typically deployed on large assets like lift trucks, intermodal containers, trailers, chassis, and rental cars, these tags can bypass handheld readers, beaming data directly back to a central network via Wi-Fi, cellular network, or satellite signal. In line with the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, this method tracks asset data through a tag-to-system model instead of the standard tag-to-reader approach. Among other data, these long-range tags can collect information on odometer mileage, fleet usage, dwell time, and transit time for moving assets such as forklifts and chassis. By graphing the results and comparing the statistics with industry benchmarks, users can analyze the data with an eye toward eliminating extraneous vehicles, scheduling needed maintenance, and identifying savings opportunities. "The bottom line is, these [trucks and other assets] are carrying the inventory," Ehrman said. "And ultimately, the cost of tracking these assets will continue to go down, so we will go from tracking the highest of the high-value assets to lower- and lower-value assets." #Logistics #Automatic Data Capture #Software & Systems #RFID #Asset Management About the Author Ben Ames Senior Editor Ben Ames has spent 20 years as a journalist since starting out as a daily newspaper reporter in Pennsylvania in 1995.

(Photo: Andrew Burton, Getty Images) Herbal supplements marketed by one of the nation's top suppliers will soon undergo stricter screening to ensure they contain the products their labels promise consumers. NBTY, which sells ginseng, ginkgo biloba and nearly 22,000 other products under popular brands such as Solgar and Nature's Bounty, agreed to the testing in an agreement announced Wednesday by New York state's top law enforcement official. The company is the third to enact plans for screening that exceeds federal standards since a 2015 study commissioned by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman failed to confirm the presence of genetic material for many of the plants depicted on labels of many herbal supplements sold at GNC, Target, Walgreens and Walmart stores. Instead, the study showed the pills contained inexpensive fillers, such as powdered rice. The findings covered some NBTY-manufactured supplements sold at Walgreens and Target. Schneiderman's office demanded that the companies stop selling the products, and subsequently reached agreements with GNC and Nature's Way. "When consumers take an herbal supplement, they should be able to do so confident that the plant on the label is the plant in the bottle, and that every reasonable precaution was taken to ensure the product's authenticity and purity," Schneiderman said in a statement announcing the similar NBTY agreement. AMERICA&#039;S MARKETS 14 AGs seek herbal supplements industry review In a written response, NBTY General Counsel Stratis Philippis said, “We are pleased that through cooperation and mutual understanding we have reached an agreement with the New York Attorney General.” Philippis said that there was "no evidence" the company "deviated or failed to comply with FDA requirements or industry standards" and that "DNA testing of herbal dietary supplements is an emerging science." "We hope this will help create reliable DNA testing that could be an additional tool for authenticity testing of herbal raw materials for our entire industry going forward,” he said. The tougher safeguards will include: ► DNA barcoding, a scientific technique used to verity the identity and presence of plant species. NBTY agreed to start the testing on herbal supplements within two years.  ► An annual testing protocol to detect potential allergens, including peanuts, milk, soy, eggs and wheat, in finished herbal products. ► Doubling the number of on-site audits of the company's major ingredient suppliers. ► Investing at least $250,000 in herbal authenticity genetic research. Based in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., NBTY employs more than 11,000 associates worldwide and has manufacturing, packaging, warehouse, distribution and administration facilities across the United States and Canada. The company was acquired in 2010 by The Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms.

(WISH photo) INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) – A special investigative unit with IMPD tracked down several people suspected of robbing pharmacies across the city. It’s a crime that at one point last year was happening more often in Indianapolis than anywhere else in the country. The arrest involves four suspects and three robberies. Police said evidence from the different scenes helped detectives find a vehicle connected to them. The group was found inside of it. Sade Perkins, Simone Briscoe, Tryice Perkins, and Trayvona Stephens all face robbery charges. Most recently, police said they robbed a Walmart pharmacy on West 10th Street. They said surveillance footage and tactics by their covert robbery unit helped track them down. Police said the suspects also admitted to robbing two Marsh pharmacies along 86th Street on the north side. According to a police report, a victim said one of the suspects threatened to kill everyone in the store if she didn’t get the narcotics. “I think they targeted these specific locations because of the ease of access even with security you can typically get in these places and out because they’re so big and there’s so many people,” said Sgt. Kendale Adams, IMPD. Last year, I-TEAM 8 did an investigation on pharmacy robberies after learning Indianapolis was leading the country in that specific crime for 2015 through September. It found that the motivation behind many of the crimes was to sell the narcotics. It also found pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS began adopting special time-delayed safes. Those safes prevent pharmacists from being able to quickly access the drugs. In one attempted robbery case, it convinced the suspect to leave. IMPD wouldn’t disclose if the pharmacies in these cases had the time-delayed safes. However, they did have enough surveillance cameras to catch the suspects.

Picture: Mike Hutchings Cape Town - It would be a “natural development” for international retail group Steinhoff to take over Shoprite, Africa's biggest supermarket chain, South African tycoon Christo Wiese told Reuters, sending shares in the grocery group surging 4 percent. Wiese is the largest shareholder in both Shoprite and Steinhoff, a lower-end furniture, apparel and household goods retailer. Bringing the two together would allow him to add groceries to his sprawling discount empire. The merger, if it happens, would also pull together Wiese's retail assets under one roof following Steinhoff's nearly $6 billion acquisition in 2014 of Wiese's budget clothing retailer Pepkor and create a global giant worth at least R400 billion ($30 billion). “People will speculate about that,” he said in a rare interview on Tuesday at his modest offices overlooking factories in Cape Town’s industrial suburb of Parow. “People know that I am 75 years old, and I fortunately have a son who is in business with me, but as a family we are continually looking at consolidating our business interests. So, it would be, in a way, a natural development.” Since Steinhoff's Pepkor acquisition, some analysts have wondered if Wiese, along with Shoprite's chief executive Whitey Basson and Steinhoff's Markus Jooste were working on a tie-up. Although grocery retailing would be uncharted territory for Steinhoff, one fund manager said the company's propensity to run a decentralised business model would help it pull off any such deal. “It will be quite a big step given that the grocery sector is somewhat different to the rest of Steinhoff. However Wiese, Markus Jooste and Whitey Basson have great experience in their respective areas,” Lentus Asset Management's Nic Norman Smith said. “If anyone is going make it work, it's these three.” Shares in Shoprite, which have been little changed so far this year, jumped 4.3 percent shortly after Reuters reported Wiese's comments before extending gains to trade 4.6 percent higher at R196.69 as of 14h53 GMT. Johannesburg-listed shares in Steinhoff, which is also listed in Frankfurt, added at least 2 percent to gains notched up earlier on news that it would issue shares to fund deals. The stock was up 6.2 percent at R80.70. Wiese, who describes himself as a “realist, pragmatist”, started Pepkor in the 1960s, in Upington on the southern edges of the Kalahari desert, after spotting an opportunity to bring cheaper clothes to the poor. He then transformed Shoprite from a six-store company in the 1970s to one with hundreds of stores across Africa, from South Africa to the Democratic Republic of Congo, dwarfing rivals including Wal-Mart's South African unit Massmart. His discount strategy, which also now includes investments in clothes retailer New Look, has catapulted him to the cover of Forbes magazine as one of Africa's richest businessmen. “Why is it so successful? The people who earn a lot of money are a small portion and then at the base is where your mass market is, where people have limited disposable income and we're aiming at that market,” he said. Wiese studied law in Stellenbosch, but lives in Clifton, an area of Cape Town overlooking the Atlantic Ocean with some of South Africa's most expensive properties. He owns a high-end vineyard near Stellenbosch, an area dotted with executive golf clubs, but said he “finds playing golf boring”. New Look Wiese is also a top shareholder and board member in South African investment heavyweight Brait SE, which last year bought gym chain Virgin Active, a relative outlier in his business model as it targets middle-class consumers. More in line with the low-cost theme, was Brait's purchase of no-frills retailer New Look. Wiese said Brait's “most obvious” growth trajectory was through its existing businesses that also include UK supermarket chain Iceland Foods and South African staples foods maker Premier. “There is plenty of scope (to grow). It's got a strong management team and the biggest scope lies within the existing businesses. New Look for instance, our clothing retail operation in the UK, has identified China as a major growth area,” he said. Wiese said New Look was looking to open 500 stores within three years in China, where it already runs 90 outlets. “China is an enormous market,” Wiese said, describing the New Look's store expansion plan as a “drop in the ocean” given the size of the Chinese population. Virgin Active, which has taken top spot market in Italy and its biggest chain is located in South Africa, has identified Asia-Pacific as the next growth market thanks to a growing population of health-conscious consumers, he said. Wiese was optimistic for the outlook for Europe despite gloomy economic forecasts but was cautious about the idea of snapping up cheaper assets in Britain following its June vote to leave the European Union. “Undoubtedly it does offer opportunities but there are greater risks because none of us know how it (Brexit) is going to play out,” he said. “There are studies that show that by 2040, Britain will have a bigger economy than Germany and a population of over 80 million people, that's a market you can't ignore.” Political damage In South Africa, several businessmen, including the outspoken chief executive of gold miner Sibanye, have called for President Jacob Zuma to resign after a series of scandals. Wiese said as a businessmen rather than a politician, he would like to stay out of politics. However, he said that the country's leadership was hurting Africa's most industrialised economy, which is expected to grow below 1 percent this year. “The top leadership in the government is seen as a problem. It is not helping our economy. That is a fact of life,” he said. But Wiese also dismissed suggestions by some analysts that he was looking to preserve his wealth by moving assets abroad during the political turbulence that has also drawn in Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. On the contrary, he said he expected business to continue to expand, including its interests in South Africa, with Virgin Active for example having its head office in London but earning more than 60 percent of its EBITDA, or core profit, in South Africa. “There is no bias to disinvest - in fact the very opposite,” he said.

Wiese, who describes himself as a “realist, pragmatist”, started Pepkor in the 1960s, in Upington on the southern edges of the Kalahari desert, after spotting an opportunity to bring cheaper clothes to the poor. He then transformed Shoprite from a six-store company in the 1970s to one with hundreds of stores across Africa, from South Africa to the Democratic Republic of Congo, dwarfing rivals including Wal-Mart's South African unit Massmart. His discount strategy, which also now includes investments in clothes retailer New Look, has catapulted him to the cover of Forbes magazine as one of Africa's richest businessmen. “Why is it so successful? The people who earn a lot of money are a small portion and then at the base is where your mass market is, where people have limited disposable income and we're aiming at that market,” he said. Wiese studied law in Stellenbosch, but lives in Clifton, an area of Cape Town overlooking the Atlantic Ocean with some of South Africa's most expensive properties. He owns a high-end vineyard near Stellenbosch, an area dotted with executive golf clubs, but said he “finds playing golf boring”. New Look Wiese is also a top shareholder and board member in South African investment heavyweight Brait SE, which last year bought gym chain Virgin Active, a relative outlier in his business model as it targets middle-class consumers. More in line with the low-cost theme, was Brait's purchase of no-frills retailer New Look. Wiese said Brait's “most obvious” growth trajectory was through its existing businesses that also include UK supermarket chain Iceland Foods and South African staples foods maker Premier. “There is plenty of scope (to grow). It's got a strong management team and the biggest scope lies within the existing businesses. New Look for instance, our clothing retail operation in the UK, has identified China as a major growth area,” he said. Wiese said New Look was looking to open 500 stores within three years in China, where it already runs 90 outlets. “China is an enormous market,” Wiese said, describing the New Look's store expansion plan as a “drop in the ocean” given the size of the Chinese population. Virgin Active, which has taken top spot market in Italy and its biggest chain is located in South Africa, has identified Asia-Pacific as the next growth market thanks to a growing population of health-conscious consumers, he said. Wiese was optimistic for the outlook for Europe despite gloomy economic forecasts but was cautious about the idea of snapping up cheaper assets in Britain following its June vote to leave the European Union. “Undoubtedly it does offer opportunities but there are greater risks because none of us know how it (Brexit) is going to play out,” he said. “There are studies that show that by 2040, Britain will have a bigger economy than Germany and a population of over 80 million people, that's a market you can't ignore.” Political damage In South Africa, several businessmen, including the outspoken chief executive of gold miner Sibanye, have called for President Jacob Zuma to resign after a series of scandals. Wiese said as a businessmen rather than a politician, he would like to stay out of politics. However, he said that the country's leadership was hurting Africa's most industrialised economy, which is expected to grow below 1 percent this year. “The top leadership in the government is seen as a problem. It is not helping our economy. That is a fact of life,” he said. But Wiese also dismissed suggestions by some analysts that he was looking to preserve his wealth by moving assets abroad during the political turbulence that has also drawn in Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. On the contrary, he said he expected business to continue to expand, including its interests in South Africa, with Virgin Active for example having its head office in London but earning more than 60 percent of its EBITDA, or core profit, in South Africa. “There is no bias to disinvest - in fact the very opposite,” he said.

Trento $16.47 Jr. Ringer T-Shirt $20   Ten Things That Should Have Come Up During the Debate but Didn’t Posted on Sep 28, 2016 By Sonali Kolhatkar   Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton take the stage for the presidential debate at Hofstra University. (David Goldman / AP) It seems as though we dread elections in the United States. Over several past races, only 50 percent to 60 percent of eligible voters have cast their ballots. More and more Americans are tuning out of the electoral process. Monday night’s debate, the first matchup between the two major-party candidates, was a perfect showcase for explaining voter apathy. The confines of the debate were set by the Commission on Presidential Debates and had the potential to unleash a wide-ranging set of arguments on the issues of income inequality, race and policing, and national security. Instead, over the course of more than 90 minutes, we saw Donald Trump sputter lies and half-truths, interrupt, talk over and “mansplain” issues to Hillary Clinton. And we saw Clinton, the center-right candidate by most reasonable measures, appear by contrast to be the sane and liberal-leaning candidate—at least most of the time. Not only were the issues narrowed down to meaningless levels, they generally skewed politically rightward. Here are 10 big topics that got no mention during the debate. This is by no means an exhaustive list but simply an indicator of how issue-poor the first presidential debate was. Advertisement Square, Site wide 1. During the discussion on income inequality, no one mentioned how corporations and wealthy elites have created such a lopsided economy in favor of the rich that the entire project of capitalism can be questioned. A recent report by the U.K. organization Global Justice Now found that of the top richest 100 economic institutions worldwide, a majority—69 to be exact—are corporations. That means that Wal-Mart, the world’s richest corporation, on whose board Clinton once sat, is wealthier than the country of Spain. 2. No one bought up how poverty is affecting Americans, the residents of the world’s wealthiest of all economic entities. So dire are the straits of our most vulnerable citizens that a disturbing new report found that hungry American teenagers are often trading sex for food. This shameful effect can be traced to government policies of the kind that Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, pushed in the name of welfare reform. Whether on a global or domestic scale, such shocking indicators of the failures of capitalism were not considered worthy of discussion during the debate. 3. During one of Trump’s very few moderately sane moments in the debate, he raised legitimate concerns about free trade, calling Clinton out for her support of the 1994 North America Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. By most measures, NAFTA has been disastrous for both U.S. and Mexican workers and has driven much of the emigration from Mexico to the U.S. Trump also rightly called Clinton out on her initial support for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a much wider-ranging and highly secretive trade deal between the U.S. and a number of Pacific nations that has been denounced by labor and environmental groups. What Clinton failed to point out was Trump’s claim that economic growth is hampered by too much regulation—this idea runs counter to his opposition of NAFTA and TPP. The so-called “free trade” agreements are designed to free corporations from the burdens of environmental regulations, labor laws and similar things. Clearly, Trump, the billionaire businessman, has only attached himself to the anti-free-trade sentiment in order to win votes from working- and middle-class Americans. In the end, it became obvious that a billionaire debating a millionaire will hardly result in any substantive discussion of how global trade deals hurt ordinary people. 4. We have just caught one of the most high-profile U.S. banks, Wells Fargo, engaging in widespread criminal behavior, targeting millions of Americans with fraudulent bank accounts and credit cards. Wells Fargo has fired thousands of its low-level workers and taken no real responsibility, short of paying a paltry fine, for its shenanigans. CEO John Stumpf is so obscenely wealthy that as a penalty for overseeing the bank’s crimes, he will return $41 million in stocks. He will not, of course, face prison time. Nor will any top Wells Fargo executives. This major news story did not even get a mention during the debate because, after all, corporations are seen by politicians of both major parties as noble job creators, rather than the “blood-sucking vampire squids” that they often are. 5. During the discussion on race and policing, neither candidate mentioned these three little words: Black Lives Matter. Neither mentioned how so few police officers involved in so many killings of unarmed black Americans have been convicted, charged or even indicted. Instead, what we heard from both candidates is that “working with the police” is a major solution to curbing violent and unjustifiable killings by police. But our criminal justice system is already so biased in favor of police that black Americans live in constant fear of being pulled over precisely because, for far too long, we have indeed worked with the police, and only the police. 6. While the candidates had a welcomed debate over New York City’s now-illegal “stop-and-frisk” program, with Trump blatantly exposing his ignorance on the matter, what did not get mentioned was the ongoing practice of racial profiling nationwide. Racial profiling, at the heart of stop-and-frisk, is technically unconstitutional, but it persists throughout the country, deeply affecting the quality of life for people of color, especially African-Americans. Clinton’s mention of “implicit bias” came close to the issue but ultimately skirted it. 7. During the discussion of cybersecurity, which fixated on Russia’s espionage attempts, no mention was made of the National Security Agency’s unparalleled invasion of Americans’ privacy. As Edward Snowden’s revelations have shown, the U.S. has destroyed all semblance of the right to privacy in the name of cybersecurity. Halfhearted attempts at legislating curbs on mass surveillance have failed or stalled. 8. When discussing foreign policy (under the popular guise of “national security”), Trump made one brief mention of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that seemed to have little bearing on the conversation. Other than that, there was no mention of Israel or the recent approval of an unprecedented aid package to Israel—a veritable gift of U.S. taxpayer dollars—in an amount larger than any nation has ever been promised. The military aid, in the form of sophisticated weaponry, will be used against Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza. It is hardly surprising that the word “Palestinians” and “Palestine” did not feature at all during Monday night’s discourse. 9. While there was much focus on Islamic State, mostly in terms of who was responsible for its rise, no substantive discussion emerged on whether bombing Iraq and northern Syria will destroy Islamic State or cause it to proliferate. Discussion of President Obama’s expanded drone wars, which fuel much of Islamic State’s rage, also was absent. After all, drone strikes are at the forefront of our not-so-secret secret war. Both candidates also failed to mention that U.S. policies in the Middle East are driving the largest global refugee crisis in modern history. 10. Finally, there was no mention of the wars we have fueled in our own hemisphere, in countries whose refugees have arrived on our doorstep. Clinton’s role in Central America was easy fodder for Trump, but he stayed away from it because it would mean admitting that Central American children, whom Clinton has said she wanted to deport, are human beings driven by desperation to migrate northward through no fault of their own. Clinton’s role in the coup in Honduras that unleashed horrific violence in that country did not come up, even as she touted her credentials as secretary of state. Too many issues that are far too important remain invisible during our presidential election debates. It is no wonder that elections seem less and less relevant.

THOMAS KELSEY - FILE Related article » RULES FOR BREAKING THE WINDOW The vehicle doors must be locked. The rescuer should genuinely believe the animal is in imminent danger. The rescuer must call law enforcement or animal services department before breaking in. The rescuer has to stay in the same general location with the animal until help arrives. The rescuer can't use more force than is required to get the animal to safety. The rescuer has to immediately hand the animal over to a law enforcement or animal services official. On a sizzling day in June 2013, Riverside County Animal Services Officer Will Luna responded to a call about a dog stuck in a car at a Wal-Mart in Riverside. More than three years later, he remembers arriving to find the 3-month-old poodle mix well. "I think that day was one of the hottest days of the year," he said. "There were about three good Samaritans out there and one of them was trying to feed the dog water." Luna eventually managed to jimmy the door open and get the dog to safety. Good Samaritans who see an animal suffering inside a car soon won't have to wait for officers to save its life. A bill that Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Saturday, Sept. 24, and will take effect Jan. 1, frees anyone who breaks into a vehicle to save a suffering animal's life from legal action related to the damaged car. It’s called the “Right to Rescue” act and it was authored by Assemblyman Marc Steinorth, R-Rancho Cucamonga. It no doubt received support from First Dog Sutter and Deputy First Dog Colusa, Brown’s Corgi and Corgi mix pups. It's pretty uncommon for the Riverside County Department of Animal Services to hear about people needing to break car windows to save an animal, but spokesman John Welsh says the law will come in handy on those rare occasions. He cautioned folks against getting overzealous, though. "It really does require folks to take a deep breath, call the proper authorities and if the dog is really in need, then they can take action," he said. A 2005 study from San Francisco State University found the inside of a car with the windows rolled up can be 20 degrees hotter than the outdoor temperature. After an hour, it reaches about 43 degrees hotter. A dog's normal temperature is about 102, Welsh says. Luna said the puppy outside of Wal-Mart had reached 103.7 degrees. At 104, a dog can die. To break a window, a good Samaritan needs to genuinely think an animal is in danger. Welsh says seeing a dog panting isn't enough – dogs pant all the time. Indicators like a purple or deep red tongue and vomiting are signs of danger, said Steve Fries, Moreno Valley Animal Services division manager. Fries adds that the best practice is to not bring a pet with you to begin with, even if it's just a trip to a convenience store. "It’s just better to leave the pet home in their environment with access to water and shelter," he said.

Andreas Rentz/Getty Images Listen to this story 11 min 40 sec Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook British director Andrea Arnold wanted to use "real faces" in her film, "American Honey," so she scouted for talent at beaches, county fairs, and even Walmart parking lots across the country. She discovered Sasha Lane on a Florida beach during spring break, where Arnold says "she definitely stood out." Lane had never acted professionally before being cast in the lead role of "American Honey," which won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The film follows a teenager named Star who's taken in by group of young people that travel through Middle America selling magazines door to door. They're called a "magazine crew," or "mag crew" for short. The Frame's John Horn sat down with Arnold and the film’s star, Sasha Lane.    To hear the full conversation, click the play button at the top of the page. Interview Highlights On the road trip that helped inspire the film:  ARNOLD: I finished another film. Some of my last kind of responsibilities with it were at the Sundance Film Festival. I was leaving there and [that film] had been a really tough experience. It was in Utah and it had been really snowy and I’d been in lots of cinemas and then they were driving me to the airport on the Monday morning and the sun came out. And there were these amazing mountains. I was looking at the mountains and I felt really emotional and I thought, How is it that I’ve come all the way from London for two days and I haven’t actually seen those mountains properly? So I didn’t get on the plane. I got a car… I think that was the beginning of me starting to explore my relationship with America and think about my emotional connection to the material I wanted to explore. The "mag crew" in Andrea Arnold's "American Honey." (McCaul Lombardi, Riley Keough, Verronikah Ezell, Shia LaBeouf, Crystal B. Ice, Shawna Rae Moseley, Kenneth Kory Tucker, Raymond Coalson) Photo by Holly Horner, courtesy of A24 How Sasha Lane was discovered and cast: LANE: I was on the beach in Florida for spring break, in Panama City … with a couple of my friends. I remember walking and then all of a sudden Andrea and the casting director and her assistant ... my mind kind of blanks from there, I just know that they mentioned the movie. Yeah, they just had such a cute little energy about it. ARNOLD: I saw her and she stood out, and we went to talk to her. She definitely stood out. She’s very self-possessed and also sort of free. I can’t describe it really … When we spoke to her, that’s the kind of feeling I got from her. Sasha Lane as Star in Andrea Arnold's "American Honey." Photo courtesy of A24 On scouting in unusual places: ARNOLD: Walmart’s a great place to scout —  [the] parking lot and the store, because it’s one of the few places, especially in Middle America and in some of the smaller towns, where people go. Somebody described it to me as the new "village." He said, “I’ll go to pick up girls there because they don’t hang out anywhere else.”  "American Honey" opens on Sept. 30.   The best SoCal news in your inbox, daily.
