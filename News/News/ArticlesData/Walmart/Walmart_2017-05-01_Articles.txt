That requires the company to keep a close track of prices offered by every competitor, both online and offline. | TNN | May 2, 2017, 09.09 AM IST (Representative image) BENGALURU: As Walmart intensifies its battle with Amazon, its R&D centre in Bengaluru is providing some its crucial firepower. Several of its most important technology platforms — those that ensure its prices are the best, its customers' online carts carry items that can be efficiently delivered, and products are delivered from places at the lowest possible logistics cost — are being developed here. Walmart's CTO for US stores and e-commerce Jeremy King told TOI that one of the first technology teams that the company built here was to do the competitive analysis of prices. "They have been really successful. Now we are building the new-generation version of this. We have acquired a number of companies recently (Jet.com, Modcloth, Shoebuy, Moosejaw) all of which have added millions of new products. So we have to scale the system," he said. The $486-billion company's traditional promise has been that they offer the lowest price on any product. That requires the company to keep a close track of prices offered by every competitor, both online and offline. "Just collecting the data from all the competitors is itself a huge problem. Collecting that and matching with our prices is a huge machine learning problem. Some people might be selling it in packs of, say six, so we have to figure out what the price of one is. And do this across millions of items," King said. Online publication Recode wrote last month that Amazon has a similar algorithm one that works to match or beat prices from other websites and stores. It finds the lowest price per unit or per ounce for a particular product, even if it is a huge bulk-size pack, and applies it across the same type of product on Amazon. Over the past year, Walmart has stepped up efforts to counter the $136-billion Amazon. Last summer, it bought online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion. Since then it has made acquisitions of several smaller online players. In January, it announced a free two-day shipping to home and stores on more than two million items, provided the customer spends at least $35. Walmart established its Bengaluru centre five years ago, and it has already grown to 1,200 people, with 500 being added in just 2016. King said Walmart's sourcing engine is also built in India. "If I'm in California and I order an iPhone case and a glass, where should I ship it from? The iPhone case is in California, but the iPhone case and the glass are in Colorado. So should I ship those in one box? And if you have ten or fifty items in your basket, and there are trucks coming from such and such places, it's about as complex a machine learning project as you can get," King said.

Download QR-Code Paralign - Aligning Thoughts Developer: Paralign.me Price: Free+ Apps Walmart Grocery Android Police coverage: Walmart Grocery is a new Android app for all your food shopping needs Walmart Grocery is a new release for Android that simulates the experience of Walmart's Grocery website. Essentially, this is an app that allows you to order your groceries online. The catch is that you will need to drive to the store to pick your items up. So while this is worlds better than having to step foot inside of a Walmart, you will still need to put forth some effort to receive your stuff. This app also comes with the caveat that a Walmart employee will be picking and packing your meats and produce. A scary thought indeed. You can install Walmart Grocery today as a free title with no advertisements or in-app purchases. -- Let us do your grocery shopping. Get the same low prices as your Walmart store. Order from your device, then pick up your items and fresh produce. You can also pick up your groceries at a time you decide is more convenient. Use our check-in feature so your order will be ready and waiting when you arrive. See if we deliver to your door. Download the app and enter your ZIP Code to find out. Download QR-Code Walmart Grocery Developer: Walmart Price: Free HISTORY Vault A&E Television Networks Mobile just published their HISTORY Vault app for Android. It is a monthly subscription video service that streams history related shows and documentaries from the History channel. What is nice about this release is that it gives you a chance to watch shows that are focused on learning about history, instead of the reality shows that normally fill the channels on-air lineup. There is a free 7-day trial that you can sign up for through the app. Please keep in mind that HISTORY Vault will start to auto bill you at $4.99 a month after the 7-day free trial is over. While this is a free title with no advertisements, you will be unable to access its content until you sign up for the free trial. -- Unlock HISTORY Vault to explore the greatest stories in history including ancient civilizations, the World Wars, space exploration and everything in between. Start your 7-day free trial and then pay only $4.99 per month to watch commercial-free, full-length videos with no TV provider needed, through automatic renewals. New videos are added weekly. Topics range from ancient civilizations to the World Wars to space exploration…and everything in between. Here’s a peek at some of the featured Collections available in HISTORY Vault: Download QR-Code HISTORY Vault Developer: A&E Television Networks Mobile Price: Free+ Mobile Witness Mobile Witness is an interesting new app that allows you to record audio, video, and location data. This information can then be used as a record of proof for many different types of situations. You can even set the app to automatically upload its data to the cloud or even your own server. This way there is no worry of losing any of your recorded content, even if your device gets lost or destroyed. There are no advertisements to worry about with this release. Even better, the only in-app purchase included with Mobile Witness costs $2.49 and it is used solely for donation purposes. -- Mobile Witness is an application for collecting potential evidence through your mobile phone by continually recording and safely uploading location, audio, or video footage. Recordings will even continue whilst the screen is turned off. Normal recording applications are not suitable for evidence gathering tasks as they make sounds upon starting the recording and stop recording when the screen is turned off. Alternative upload strategies such as cloud backups fail in situations where the phone may be damaged as they will only upload completed recordings. Download QR-Code Mobile Witness Developer: Beanpod Price: Free+ Shadow Running Many popular running and exercise apps have become bloated. Even if the bloat is not bothersome to you, their high monthly subscription fees can also be an annoyance. Shadow Running offers an app that is a bit easier to use than its competition. You simply record your runs through GPS to then challenge yourself and your friends to complete the same run in less time. There are even audio cues during these excursions to alert you as to how much time you are leading by or running behind. Shadow Running is still currently in testing as an unreleased app, but you can pick it up today for free with no worry of in-app purchases or advertisements. -- Shadow Running is a GPS based, audio running App. Race against previous runs or compete with friends in daily challenges. Plug in your headphones and get audio updates on your progress as you run. The App shows you how far you are ahead or behind your previous runs. Create a group and race against your friends recorded runs with updates as you run. Plug in your headphones and get audio updates from the App while you're running. Compete against your friends in daily distance runs. Win trophies and climb the leader board.

Not only does it allow for plenty of recording options, but it also has a built-in audio and video editor. On top of that, it's compatible with iKlip stands and mounts. This way you have a plethora of recording tools at your disposal. iRig Recorder 3 is offered as a free application that does not contain any advertisements. However, there are in-app purchases included that range up to $7.99 per item. Luckily, all of the IAPs are used to extend the functionality of the app through new effects and editing tools. -- iRig Recorder 3 is a completely redesigned powerful, flexible and easy-to-use audio and video recording app for Android.

But don’t let iRig Recorder 3’s streamlined design fool you… iRig Recorder 3 is a full-fledged, professional audio and video recorder that lets you edit waveforms, apply creative and professional effects as well as share your recordings with the rest of the world. Download QR-Code iRig Recorder 3 Developer: IK Multimedia US, LLC Price: Free+ Wemogee Wemogee is a communication app built for sufferers of communicative disabilities. It allows for an easy and cheap way to communicate through emoji. Even though the design is well thought out, some issues currently make it difficult to use. The main sticking point is that the sign-up process is pretty confusing. While there are only a few fields to fill out, if you miss something as simple as adding a picture to your profile, you will be unable to register. This makes the process doubly complicated as there is also an issue with receiving your verification code. Hopefully, once the bugs are settled, the app will become useable but until then it is a bit of a mess trying to sign up for the service. On the plus side, Wemogee is completely free to install, and there are no advertisements or in-app purchases to worry about. -- This project was created in order to restore the possibility for aphasia sufferers to communicate easily and quickly with their friends and family. In fact, Samsung WemogeeTM performs a dual function: for chatting with people far away and communication support for face-to-face interactions. Through the translation of text to emoji and vice versa, the app allows the person affected with aphasia to communicate only through images. Samsung WemogeeTM is based on a library of more than 140 phrases: in collaboration with a team of speech therapists, a list of the most common phrases in informal chat was defined, relating to basic needs as well as to their emotions. These words were then translated into logical sequences of emojis. Download QR-Code Wemogee Developer: 3x1010 s.r.l.

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You BENGALURU: As Walmart intensifies its battle with Amazon, its R&D centre in Bengaluru is providing some its crucial firepower. Several of its most important technology platforms--those that ensure its prices are the best, its customers' online carts carry items that can be efficiently delivered, and products are delivered from places at the lowest possible logistics cost--are being developed here. Walmart's CTO for US stores and e-commerce Jeremy King told TOI that one of the first technology teams that the company built here was to do the competitive analysis of prices. “They have been really successful. Now we are building the new-generation version of this. We have acquired a number of companies recently (Jet.com, Modcloth, Shoebuy , Moosejaw), all of which have added millions of new products. So we have to scale the system,“ he said. The $486-billion company's traditional promise has been that they offer the lowest price on any product.That requires the company to keep a close track of prices offered by every competitor, both online and offline. “Just collecting the data from all the competitors is itself a huge problem. Collecting that and matching with our prices is a huge machine learning problem. Some people might be selling it in packs of, say six, so we have to figure out what the price of one is.And do this across millions of items,“ King said. Online publication Recode wrote last month that Amazon has a similar algorithm ­ one that works to match or beat prices from other websites and stores. It finds the lowest price per unit or per ounce for a particular product, even if it is a huge bulk-size pack, and applies it across the same type of product on Amazon. Over the past year, Walmart has stepped up efforts to counter the $136-billion Amazon. Last summer, it bought online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion. Since then it has made acquisitions of several smaller online players.In January , it announced a free two-day shipping to ho me and stores on more than two million items, provided the customer spends at least $35. Walmart established its Bengaluru centre five years ago, and it has already grown to 1,200 people, with 500 being added in just 2016. King said Walmart's sourcing engine is also built in India. “If I'm in California and I order an iPhone case and a glass, where should I ship it from? The iPhone case is in California, but the iPhone case and the glass are in Colorado. So should I ship those in one box? And if you have ten or fifty items in your basket, and there are trucks coming from such and such places, it's about as complex a machine learning project as you can get,“ King said.

Michele "Izzy" Galgana Associate Editor; New England Sign-In to Vote Tweet 0 Submit 2 Andre Ovredal's (Troll Hunter) excellent horror film, The Autopsy of Jane Doe, comes out tomorrow, May 2. Scream Factory is releasing the film, but they're doing things a little differently this time around; Wal-Mart has the exclusive right to sell the Blu-ray/DVD combo package until June 27, when it comes out everywhere else. (Seriously, Scream Factory doesn't even have a page for the film on their website, not even a "coming soon" placeholder page.)  The Autopsy of Jane Doe was a huge hit on the festival circuit, garnering plenty of awards. If you were lucky enough to see it with one of those audiences, you'll know why. Ovredal directs with a masterful hand, combining a mostly one-setting film with a sense of dread and claustrophobia that's rarely done so effectively. Jennifer Lynch's Chained comes to mind as another recent example. If we're going old school, I'd also say that The Autopsy of Jane Doe lives in the same house as Alien, with its dead serious, haunted house vibe.   In the story, father-son morticians played by Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch are about to lock up for the night when the sheriff (Michael McElhatton) wheels in a strange corpse. Found unearthed in the basement of a house -- that's also the location of a gruesome crime scene -- the deceased is an ethereally beautiful (Olwen Kelly) girl with not a mark on her. The only gripe I have with the film is that Hirsch's girlfriend (played by Ophelia Lovibond) is wasted. She's only in the film long enough to establish a relationship, disappear, and then come back during the bloody finale for no reason other than to die. It's a minor thing because it's a small role, but when you're female and you see characters of your gender onscreen whose only purpose is to further the emotions of the male lead, you see it ALL THE TIME and it becomes grating.   Anyway, my personal feelings there don't take away my enjoyment of the rest of the film. Before long, a series of creepy events unfold in tandem with the autopsy --- and its very strange findings. Blood spurts out when it's not supposed to, and the morticians find odd markings on inner flesh, a tooth wrapped in an ancient cloth, and oh, so much more. The bells. If you've seen the film, a chill might have just gone down your spine. If you haven't, you'll get to discover this extraordinary piece of filmmaking. I'll say no more, except that this device freaks a lot of people out, and it's effective as hell.  The disc itself -- I only viewed the Blu-ray, not the corresponding DVD that came with it -- is bare bones. A recent Canadian release offers Ovredal's new short film The Tunnel, which is also an award winner, along with a TIFF Midnight Madness q&a, and alternative cover art. The Scream Factory disc only offers trailers and TV spots, which is nothing like the distributor's usual full-on treatment of their titles, as they usually overflow with great bonus features. In short, the film is incredible, and it looks and sounds great here; however, the release left me wanting much more in the way of supplementary materials. Will The Autopsy of Jane Doe scare you senseless? Check out the trailer below.  Sign-In to Vote Tweet 0 Submit 2 Do you feel this content is inappropriate or infringes upon your rights?

Travis Long tlong@newsobserver.com 1 of 6 i By Thomasi McDonald tmcdonald@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story RALEIGH Martha Hernandez stood in front of the General Assembly building Monday near a sign listing bills pending in the House and Senate that she described as “anti-worker” and “anti-immigration.” Hernandez, a member of the Triangle Immigration Rights group Comite de Accion Popular, ripped the sign down, flung it to the ground and stepped on it. “These bills are on the floor like trash, because we won’t let them get approved,” Hernandez, of Raleigh, told a cheering group of about 100 people who had marched from Moore Square for a rally at the Legislative Building. Those who took part in the May Day rallies and protests in downtown Raleigh and Durham were in synchronicity with demonstrators across the United States who hit the streets Monday. The demonstrators focused much of their protests on behalf of immigrants affected by the policies of President Trump and North Carolina’s Republican-controlled General Assembly. “It’s important that the people in the General Assembly know that we are not approving the laws and bills that they are passing,” Hernandez said. “They are destroying families. They are hurting workers and people who have come here for a better life. The U.S. involvement in Latin America has caused many of us to be uprooted from our places.” May Day – also known as International Worker’s Day – has triggered worldwide demonstrations in past years around workers’ rights. Angela Williamson-Lopez, a labor organizer for Organization United for Respect, Walmart, or OUR Walmart, drove to the Triangle from Texas to speak at the Raleigh event. Williamson-Lopez said OUR Walmart represents “thousands” of the company’s employees and claimed the organization was able to get the retailer to raise its minimum wage to $10 an hour from $7.25. Now, she said, the fight has turned toward getting a better sick-leave plan for Walmart employees. “You get eight sick days a year,” she said. “On the ninth sick day, you’re fired.” “Parents ought to be able to take care of their child who may have the flu, but people are afraid to call in to work and won’t take their kids to the doctor because of fear of being fired,” she added. Raleigh’s May Day activities mirrored concerns shared by people across the country, particularly immigrants’ rights, LGBT awareness and police misconduct. Several participants held up a sign that proclaimed Black Lives Matter but also demanded a $15-an-hour minimum wage, union rights, the full repeal of House Bill 2, an end to Islamaphobia, the de-funding of local police departments and a dismantling of U.S. Immigrations Customs and Enforcement, the federal agency responsible for the arrest and detention of people who may be in the country illegally. One of the rally participants who helped to hold a sign aloft was Lamont Lilly, the 37-year-old native of Durham who ran for vice president of the United States with the Workers World Party and has worked with residents in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore. Lilly said he participated in the May Day protests for multiple reasons, but principally to address the exploitation of working people. “The working poor, the blue-collar folk and the exploitation of labor in this country,” he said. “The African captives who gave 300 years of slave labor and the immigrants who were overworked, underpaid and super-exploited. It’s about many things.” More than 30 grassroots organizations chipped in to organize the rally and march, which they called a “Mass Strike & Resistance on May Day, International Workers Day.” The events included a midday public forum on Islamaphobia hosted by the Ar-Razzaq Mosque in Durham, and late afternoon and early evening rallies scheduled at the site of Durham’s new police headquarters under construction, the Durham County jail and at city hall during a city council meeting. “Its funny,” Lilly said. “Mention May Day and people think that it represents the international workers. Here in America it’s associated with Labor Day, a cookout with hot dogs and hamburgers, but we haven’t had much justice to eat.” Thomasi McDonald: 919-829-4533, @thomcdonald Related content May Day demonstrators rally, march during International Workers Day Thousands of people in US rally for workers, against Trump Defiant rallies for worker rights mark May Day around world LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Wake County Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:41 May Day demonstrators rally, march during International Workers Day Pause 1:41 Chief Justice Martin pushes to raise the age for adult criminal prosecution to 18 6:31 Children pulled from overturned car in dramatic water rescue 1:00 Police chiefs, residents stress trust, cooperation in PSA video 2:12 Charlotte police defend officers after one put a gun to the head of an unarmed man 1:45 Grayson Allen says one game 'indefinite suspension' was Krzyzewski's decision 1:14 UNC’s Roy Williams says Grayson Allen scrutiny is ‘way blown out of proportion’ 2:00 Krzyzewski defends his handling of Grayson Allen 1:27 Coach K on Grayson Allen's trip: 'Unacceptable' 0:37 Emotional Grayson Allen talks about tripping Elon player Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 7 hours ago Former employee accuses Love Wins Community Engagement Center of mismanaging money 2:45 7 hours ago Former employee accuses Love Wins Community Engagement Center of mismanaging money 1:20 4 days ago Health club and NCSU work together to curtail pollution and flooding 2:18 9 days ago March for Science in Raleigh protests Trump policies View more video Wake County Let’s name schools after Holts, Campbells and other pioneers – Saunders Federal court rules against Hearts with Haiti and orphanage founder Raleigh, Charlotte among best cities for job seekers – but which ranked higher? ‘Talking Black’ documentary has really got people talking – Saunders Former employees accuse Raleigh group that helps the homeless of mismanaging money Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services Customer Service E-Edition Contact Us About Us Site Map Site Information Triangle.com ArtsNow FansTailgate Mom2Mom Trianglejobs Community News Legal Notices News in Education Newsletters Social, Mobile & More Mobile Options Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Careers at the N&O Advertising Advertise With Us About Our Ads Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping N&O Store N&O Photos Copyright Commenting Policy Report News Privacy Policy Terms of Use Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services Customer Service E-Edition Contact Us About Us Site Map Site Information Triangle.com ArtsNow FansTailgate Mom2Mom Trianglejobs Community News Legal Notices News in Education Newsletters Social, Mobile & More Mobile Options Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Careers at the N&O Advertising Advertise With Us About Our Ads Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping N&O Store N&O Photos More Copyright Commenting Policy Report News Privacy Policy Terms of Use

U.S. employers will spend more than $650 million on annual salaries for 10,000 jobs in AI this year, according to a study from career and hiring data firm Paysa. The 2-year-old firm touts itself as the only platform to use AI to deliver personalized job and salary recommendations. It was founded by Chris Bolte, Zachary Poley, Nikhil Raj and Patrick Harrington — all formerly of Walmart Labs and Walmart's engineering and product teams. The firm uses millions of data points like job openings, resumes, and compensation to determine the market value of individual skills. Once a worker creates a profile on the site, they can look at how their salary compares to others with the same job title and experience. Bolte, the CEO, said the platform also makes suggestions on which skills have the highest value for employers or can help them move into an adjacent field. For this study, Paysa looked at the market value of skills and education listed as requirements for each of these jobs and generated a projected salary. For this study, Paysa looked at the market value of skills and education listed as requirements for each of these jobs and generated a projected salary. Unsurprisingly, large companies account for 40% of open AI positions. The list includes tech stalwarts you’d expect to see like Amazon, Google[/f500link [f500link]Microsoft, Huawei and IBM. Paysa's report also found that 35% percent of the AI positions require a Ph.D and another 26% specify that candidates should have a master’s degree. Related TwitterTwitter Goes Bigger On Video With 16 New Streaming Partnerships Twitter Twitter Goes Bigger On Video With 16 New Streaming Partnerships “As you get higher into up into these positions that require really specific skills like neural networks and deep learning, where a Ph.D. is required or preferred, that’s when you start seeing schools having their top scientists and academics poached by private companies,” said Paysa CEO and co-founder Chris Bolte. But this isn’t just news for hardcore academics, he said. There’s so much demand that one in five of the listings doesn’t require a degree at all. Though Amazon is far and away making the biggest bet on AI talent, there were some surprises too. For example, Paysa’s top 20 list included mapping and IoT firm Here. The firm, owned by a consortium of German automakers, will spend an estimated $8.5 million to cover the annual salaries for the 50 AI jobs it’s looking to fill according to the study. Also among the 20 companies is Google, Alibaba, and Andreeson Horowitz-backed augmented reality wunderkind Magic Leap. If the name sounds familiar, it’s because this time last year Wired named it the world’s hottest startup. And more recently, a report from The Information (subscription required) revealed that it'll take longer than expected for the company to deliver on the technology it's been promoting. The report also mentioned that the Florida-based team has had trouble making its technology small enough to be wearable, putting it behind potential competitor Microsoft’s HoloLens. But it seems Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz hasn’t given up the ghost yet. The AI study counted 55 open AI-based job openings at Magic Leap, and estimates the average gig will pay over $135,000 per year. Another notable top 20 company: BAE Systems, which develops combat vehicles, ammunition, artillery systems, naval guns and missile launchers. If it fills all 52 of its open AI positions, Paysa estimates BAE would be investing an extra $8.3 million in machine learning talent each year. BAE recently showed off a prototype of an armed robotic combat vehicle, or ARCV, at the United States Army’s Global Force Symposium in Huntsville, Alabama. The ARCV is a tele-operated platform. It was designed to be operated remotely, either from another military vehicle or by a soldier on foot with a hand-held remote control. “He could either follow behind it like we drove it in here the other day, or he could be in a foxhole or … under cover and operate the vehicle on the battlefield,” James Miller, BAE’s director of business development for combat vehicles, told National Defense Magazine. For all the talk about automation replacing humans, recent examples have so far featured AI supplementing human capital. Online grocery shopping startup Boxed, which offers customers wholesale sizes and prices without membership fees, just showed how an automation system can be good news for its replaced human counterparts. Boxed retrained and promoted some 100 workers that were recently made obsolete by robots in its Union, N.J. fulfillment center. Many of them even got raises. "I will be the first to admit that it is not the smartest thing we’ve ever done when it comes to the balance sheet, but it’s what we do,” CEO Chieh Huang told Fortune. “Is it absolutely necessary to drive every last penny out of it at the cost of human livelihoods?” Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc.

Report Provides a Detailed Analysis of Walmart’s Operations and Outlook Great Neck, NY (PRWEB) May 01, 2017 Industry-leading retail financial and consulting firm Information Clearinghouse, Inc. (ICI), through its F&D Reports and Creditntell divisions, has released its Strategic Sales Insights Report on Walmart, which offers an intimate look at the Company’s operational and competitive status, including market position, real estate footprint and sales trends. Walmart is the largest U.S. retailer in terms of annual sales and one of the world’s most powerful public companies, best known for its big-box Supercenters that have served as the backbone for its expansion to more than 5,300 stores nationwide. More recently, Walmart’s sales growth has been restrained, as the Company has decelerated its historically rapid store development pace in the U.S. to focus on e-commerce. In efforts to remain competitive with Amazon and in response to evolving consumer preferences, Walmart recently announced a series of e-commerce acquisitions, while it moves to integrate online, social and mobile technology with its brick-and-mortar stores. The Company also continues to test convenience and other small formats, grocery pickup and delivery, and purchasing and pricing initiatives. In addition to an analysis of Walmart’s current operational metrics and its future growth and outlook, the report includes comparative market share across the Company’s top metro areas; historical and projected capital spending; a review of store operations, formats and products; and an analysis of its distribution operations. The report also offers access to ICI’s interactive Store Trends report, which provides visual competitive analyses as well as key real estate health metrics like store count, average sales per store, and sales per square foot. Commenting on the Strategic Sales Insights Report, ICI’s CEO Lawrence Sarf stated, “Although Walmart’s domestic Supercenter growth has slowed somewhat in recent years, the Company continues to tweak alternative formats and expand omnichannel initiatives, cementing its status as the U.S. retailer with the largest footprint and the longest shadow. Anyone selling to or competing against Walmart, as well as those engaged in developing commercial retail space, will find this new deep dive an absolute must-read.” Information Clearinghouse, Inc. (publisher of F&D Reports, Creditntell, & ARMS) is a leading retail credit consulting firm specializing in the analysis of public and private companies in numerous retail segments. The focus of its analysis is to deliver the key intelligence today’s busy credit executive needs to make a highly informed decision without sifting through pages of non-essential data.

Its Workers Say Otherwise. Workers want an environmentalist on the board, but the retail giant says its billionaire patriarch's charity work is enough. By Alexander C. Kaufman 210 Over the past decade, Walmart has attempted to transform its image from a big-box purveyor of bargain goods sold by low-paid workers to a vanguard of corporate environmentalism, with solar-paneled stores regularly feted by the Davos set. But for a retail behemoth whose business model still depends heavily on pollution, Walmart’s green policies are more akin to a face-lift than surgical reconstruction, according to workers and advocates calling on the company to add an environmentalist to its board of directors. “Walmart is really good with the PR stunts about how sustainable they are,” said Mary Pat Tifft, a 29-year employee at a Walmart in Kenosha, Wisconsin. “But I have grandchildren, and I’d like to leave them a healthy Earth and I’d like their children to have a healthy Earth, too.” Tifft, 62, is a member of OUR Walmart, the nonprofit workers’ group that advocates for higher pay and better corporate policies at the notoriously union-averse retailer. Over a year ago, the group purchased about 40 shares, putting it comfortably above the $2,000 baseline required for a shareholder to submit a resolution. Now, OUR Walmart has proposed putting an environmental expert on the board to ensure that the company’s lofty promises to shrink its carbon footprint and pollution output amount to more than just talk. But the Bentonville, Arkansas-based firm says that Rob Walton, patriarch of the company’s billionaire founding family, already provides environmental safeguards. Walton serves on the board of directors of Conservation International, a nonprofit to which the Walton Family Foundation has given millions in what critics call a years-long “greenwashing” campaign. He also holds the title of co-chair of the Arizona State University Global Institute of Sustainability, to which the family foundation gave $27.5 million in 2012. Rick Wilking / Reuters Rob Walton waits before the annual shareholders meeting for Walmart in Fayetteville, Arkansas, June 7, 2013. “Our Board currently has one member with significant expertise in environmental issues,” Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman, told HuffPost in an email. “Therefore, we believe that adopting the policy described in this shareholder proposal would unduly limit the ability of the [nominating and governance committee] and the Board to review and select potential nominees who, in their judgment, have the combination of experience, skills and characteristics that are best suited to oversee the company’s complex, global business operations and oversee the company and its management in achieving the company’s strategic priorities and evolving business objectives.” By 2025, Hargrove said, the company is on pace to achieve zero waste to landfill in four of its larger markets and reduce emissions by 18 percent. Plus, Walmart recently launched Project Gigaton, an initiative to provide companies in its supply chain with a toolkit for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. “Walmart is working with suppliers and committed to reduce emissions by one gigaton from the production and use of the products we sell between 2015 and 2030, equivalent to taking more than 211 million passenger vehicles off U.S. roads and highways for a year,” Hargrove said, noting that the effort was highlighted in a contributor post published last month on HuffPost by the corporate sustainability coalition We Mean Business. Walmart, for obvious reasons, decides to go with the measure that hides the fact that their own renewable energy projects have declined despite all the fanfare about putting solar on their rooftops. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance Yet as Walmart pushes ahead with the new program, the company’s U.S. operation has reduced its capacity for zero-emissions energy. In 2016, Walmart received just 2.4 percent of its electricity in the U.S. from its own renewable energy projects, down from 3.2 percent in 2013, according to a new analysis by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. That’s far below the 25 percent figure Walmart touts in its latest sustainability report. To assess the company’s true energy mix, ILSR ― a watchdog group that’s tracked the impact of big-box stores on communities since the 1990s ― reviewed data submitted by Walmart to the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project. “What we look at is what percentage of power is your own, from solar on rooftops of stores or renewable power that’s specifically purchased, so we’re not confusing changes to what’s on the grid overall with what Walmart has done itself to improve its power mix,” Stacy Mitchell, the ILSR’s co-director, told HuffPost. “Walmart, for obvious reasons, decides to go with the measure that hides the fact that their own renewable energy projects have declined despite all the fanfare about putting solar on their rooftops.” For all of Walmart’s efforts to polish its environmental record, some smudges remain. In May 2013, the company agreed to pay $82 million in fines to the Environmental Protection Agency after pleading guilty to illegally dumping hazardous waste in California and Missouri. In February, Walmart settled charges in the Bay Area that it falsely labeled plastic bags as biodegradable for nearly $1 million. The retailer, now the nation’s largest grocer by far, has made considerable strides in reducing food waste ― a slow-burning crisis in a country where 1 household in 7 lacks regular access to healthful meals, but where nearly 40 percent of all food goes uneaten. Most of that uneaten food ends up in landfills, where it rots and produces greenhouse gases, according to an analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council. Last year, Walmart donated 611 million pounds of food to charities and has repurposed more than 25,000 tractor-trailers’ worth of food as compost since 2009. But aside from a small experimental program, the company has refused to stock imperfect or blemished fruits and vegetables on its shelves, a move that food waste activists say would transform a broken industry that routinely sends misshapen but edible produce to the landfill. Walmart’s grocery aisles seem particularly prone to unsustainable business practices. The company recently came under fire for stocking canned tuna from suppliers such as Thai Union. The Thailand-based seafood giant owns the brand Chicken of the Sea and supplies Walmart’s Great Value brand. The company is notorious for using fish aggregating devices, which draw lots of fish to a small area, making them easy to catch. The devices, sometimes called “fish magnets,” severely hurt fish populations and trap other creatures, such as sea turtles and sharks, in waiting nets. The firm also uses so-called “long lines,” which can stretch up to 80 miles and bear thousands of hooks. “Though Thai Union is currently considering measures to clean up its supply chains, it’s thanks to pressure from activists and consumers ― not industry laggards like Walmart,” said John Hocevar, the oceans campaign director at Greenpeace, which spearheaded the effort against Thai Union. “If Walmart spent anywhere near as many resources taking action as it does delaying and greenwashing, our oceans would be healthier and the workers that supply its canned tuna would be earning a living wage.” Related...

By Nina Golgowski 520 An Arizona woman’s purchase has weighed on her conscience ever since she discovered a chilling note folded up inside, she says. Christel Wallace opened a zippered pouch in her new Walmart handbag in March and found a mysterious note written in Chinese, The Arizona Daily Star reported on Saturday. After her daughter-in-law helped her locate a translator, Wallace learned the note was a cry for help describing conditions at a prison in Guangxi, China. The unidentified person said prisoners work 14-hour days without breaks, endure beatings for unfinished work, and have medical treatment docked from their already-meager pay. “Being a prisoner in China is even worse than being a horse, cow, sheep, pig or dog in the U.S.,” reads the letter, translated by HuffPost. “My heart went into my stomach,” Wallace told the Daily Star. Being a prisoner in China is even worse than being a horse, cow, sheep, pig or dog in the U.S. Note discovered by Christel Wallace Wallace’s daughter-in-law, Laura Wallace, said the note opened her eyes to the lives of laborers who create such bargain buys. Wanting to help, she decided to spread the word about the note’s contents. “I don’t have the means or the access to help in any way. So I think this was my way of putting in my two cents,” she told local Tucson station KVOA. “I don’t want this to be an attack on any store ... That’s not the answer. This is happening at all kinds of places and people just probably don’t know.” A Walmart spokesperson, reached by HuffPost on Monday, encouraged Wallace to contact Walmart and share the note so the company could “verify the letter’s authenticity.” “We care that our products are sourced responsibly and transparently, and we take allegations like this seriously,” wrote Ragan Dickens, Walmart’s director of national media relations, in an email. “With the limited information we now have, it is difficult to verify the letter’s authenticity.” According to Walmart’s “standards for suppliers” posted online, laborers are prohibited from working excessive hours, being forced to work and working without pay. U.S. consumers have discovered similar pleas for help in Kmart and Saks Fifth Avenue products. In 2013, a former inmate of China’s Masanjia Labor Camp told The New York Times he’d written a note hidden inside Halloween decorations sold at an Oregon Kmart. The man, who asked only to be identified by his last name, Zhang, said he wrote 20 different letters during his two-year incarceration, hoping they’d eventually catch the attention of a human rights organization. Here is the full text of the note, translated by HuffPost: Inmates in the Yingshan Prison in Guangxi, China are working 14 hours daily with no break/rest at noon, continue working overtime until 12 midnight, and whoever doesn’t finish his work will be beaten. Their meals are without oil and salt. Every month, the boss pays the inmate 2000 yuan [about $290], any additional dishes will be finished by the police. If the inmates are sick and need medicine, the cost will be deducted from the salary.

Michele "Izzy" Galgana Associate Editor; New England Sign-In to Vote Tweet 0 Submit 2 Andre Ovredal's (Troll Hunter) excellent horror film, The Autopsy of Jane Doe, comes out tomorrow, May 2. Scream Factory is releasing the film, but they're doing things a little differently this time around; Wal-Mart has the exclusive right to sell the Blu-ray/DVD combo package until June 27, when it comes out everywhere else. (Seriously, Scream Factory doesn't even have a page for the film on their website, not even a "coming soon" placeholder page.)  The Autopsy of Jane Doe was a huge hit on the festival circuit, garnering plenty of awards. If you were lucky enough to see it with one of those audiences, you'll know why. Ovredal directs with a masterful hand, combining a mostly one-setting film with a sense of dread and claustrophobia that's rarely done so effectively. Jennifer Lynch's Chained comes to mind as another recent example. If we're going old school, I'd also say that The Autopsy of Jane Doe lives in the same house as Alien, with its dead serious, haunted house vibe.   In the story, father-son morticians played by Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch are about to lock up for the night when the sheriff (Michael McElhatton) wheels in a strange corpse. Found unearthed in the basement of a house -- that's also the location of a gruesome crime scene -- the deceased is an ethereally beautiful (Olwen Kelly) girl with not a mark on her. The only gripe I have with the film is that Hirsch's girlfriend (played by Ophelia Lovibond) is wasted. She's only in the film long enough to establish a relationship, disappear, and then come back during the bloody finale for no reason other than to die. It's a minor thing because it's a small role, but when you're female and you see characters of your gender onscreen whose only purpose is to further the emotions of the male lead, you see it ALL THE TIME and it becomes grating.   Anyway, my personal feelings there don't take away my enjoyment of the rest of the film. Before long, a series of creepy events unfold in tandem with the autopsy --- and its very strange findings. Blood spurts out when it's not supposed to, and the morticians find odd markings on inner flesh, a tooth wrapped in an ancient cloth, and oh, so much more. The bells. If you've seen the film, a chill might have just gone down your spine. If you haven't, you'll get to discover this extraordinary piece of filmmaking. I'll say no more, except that this device freaks a lot of people out, and it's effective as hell.  The disc itself -- I only viewed the Blu-ray, not the corresponding DVD that came with it -- is bare bones. A recent Canadian release offers Ovredal's new short film The Tunnel, which is also an award winner, along with a TIFF Midnight Madness q&a, and alternative cover art. The Scream Factory disc only offers trailers and TV spots, which is nothing like the distributor's usual full-on treatment of their titles, as they usually overflow with great bonus features. In short, the film is incredible, and it looks and sounds great here; however, the release left me wanting much more in the way of supplementary materials. Will The Autopsy of Jane Doe scare you senseless? Check out the trailer below.  Sign-In to Vote Tweet 0 Submit 2 Do you feel this content is inappropriate or infringes upon your rights?

Walmart trains personal shoppers to choose items for customers. It's part of the company's plans to offer the service nationwide. (Walmart) Print Email Charley Hannagan | channagan@syracuse.com By Charley Hannagan | channagan@syracuse.com The Post-Standard Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 01, 2017 at 12:29 PM comments Walmart this week is rolling out a service at select Upstate stores that allows customers to order groceries online and pick them up at the store curb. The service is launching Tuesday in three Albany area stores, according to the Albany Times Union. The Camillus store begins the service on Thursday. The service launches Tuesday at the North Tonawanda store and on Wednesday in the Macedon store. The service is free. The Upstate expansion into online grocery pickup is part of Walmart's plans to offer the service at stores nationwide.The company began offering the service in select markets in 2016. Here's how it works. Using either the Walmart app or going to the company's website at Walmart.com/grocery, customers choose from 30,000 items, pay for the order and set a time to pick it up. The minimum order is $30. Trained personal shoppers go through the aisles choosing produce, meat and other groceries to fill the order. The items are kept cool or frozen until the customer arrives. The customer arrives at the store, parks in a designated spot and calls a special phone number. Store associates then come out and load the order into the customer's car. Same-day pickup is available. Customers can also schedule grocery pickups up to three weeks in advance. Walmart executives say they expect the service will be used by parents with small children who may not have the time to trudge through a grocery store with toddlers in tow. Senior citizens or the disabled are also potential customers, they said. Walmart has long sold non-grocery items online and ordering groceries online for delivery or pickup is not a new concept. Walmart faces competition in the online grocery segment from Amazon and Google. Wegman's offers an online service for $5.95 per order at its Pittsford store and six stores in New Jersey.

Especially a lot more Target stores have been flagged to have the NES Classic in stock today.  Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in Stock Online Nintendo said that the NES Classic Edition would be only sold through April, but apparently the NES Classic is still getting restocked.  iStockNow issued in stock alerts for Walmart and Target stores across the Nation. We have cross referenced the iStockNow alerts with the BrickSeek. On BrickSeek stores are also showing the NES Classic units in stock at select stores.  Target and Walmart have been restocking the NES Classic since mid last week. New NES Classic stock is keeps arriving on the first of May.  Reseller prices for the NES Classic are still around $270 as arrival of new NES Classic stock is keeping prices in check. The lowest priced Nintendo NES Classic console sells for $275 plus shipping on amazon.com. A trip to your local Walmart store can mean a $200 saving or profit, depending on which side you are in the NES hunting game.  The reseller prices have been over $300 a week ago, right after the announcement that Nintendo stops making the NES Classic. Now prices came down quite a bit amidst the new NES Classic Edition stock. This will change as soon as all stores run dry of the Nintendo NES Classic. Some predict that the NES Classic could fetch $500 once the inventory is completely sold out. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On April 13, Nintendo announced to stop production of the NES Classic Edition. The last shipments of the NES Classic arrive through April. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest hack enables the NES Classic to store 2,500 games. The 80s retro console launched on November 11, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Nintendo has sold 1.5 million NES Classic Edition.

Good News Nation World Debunked Entertainment Sports Tech Science Connect with us Morning News USA Good News Nation World Debunked Entertainment Sports Tech Science After The Cronut, Walmart Introduces The Crotilla Share Tweet Christmas Shopping Online: Walmart Can Still Deliver These Gifts For Christmas Black Friday 2016 Date: Walmart Bargain Deals (Viral) Father Drags Girl By The Hair At Walmart, Police Says He Has Right To Do That Beheaded Donald Trump Shirt: Where It’s Being Sold Today Crotilla Facebook Food After The Cronut, Walmart Introduces The Crotilla By Jennifer Ong Published on May 1, 2017 Share Tweet Comment If you’ve long been over Dominique Ansel’s cronut, meet the crotilla. This new pastry is a cross between a buttery croissant and a flat tortilla. “The Crotilla is a hybrid bakery item exclusive to Walmart,” Walmart said in a recent blog post. And because of its form, the long-time food and grocery retailer believes that its crotilla creation can be used “for everything, from breakfast sandwiches to Indian food.” One of the people who worked on the creation of the crotilla was Walmart Bakery senior buyer Bradlee Underwood. According to Underwood, they saw a need to “create a mash-up of two products the customer already understands.” “Also, we know customers, especially millennial customers, are hungry for new food trends and cool ways to experience food, and we want to be a destination for that,” Underwood explained. The crotilla can be enjoyed as savory or sweet. According to Walmart, the crotilla makes for quite a versatile base. You can prepare several meals on it, whether you’re thinking about breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner or even a simple dessert. For starters, a breakfast crotilla can be filled with eggs, sausage and cheese. For something lighter, you can also fill it up with some, basil and tomatoes. And in case you want something sweet in the morning, you can also top your crotilla with some Nutella and sliced bananas. Meanwhile, you can also top your crotilla with chicken, cucumbers and tzatziki sauce for a nice and healthy lunch. You can also make a mini pizza with your toppings for choice. And if you want something heartier, you turn a couple of crotillas into a burger sandwich. For a snack, you can use the crotilla to prepare a nice mezze platter for dipping. And if you’re looking for something on the sweet side, you can also drizzle it with some honey, butter and powdered sugar. Meanwhile, for dessert, you can top with Nutella, fresh sliced strawberries and whipped cream. According to Walmart, one of the best things about the crotilla is that it’s always easy to work with. This is because it perfectly fits into a toaster, making it a convenient food to bring along anywhere, anytime. Grab some crotilla now and see what else you can do with this hybrid flatbread.

With the USDA reporting that one in eight Americans struggles with hunger, including more than 13 million children, food insecurity is an issue facing families in every county across the country. Spring is a particularly difficult time for families struggling with hunger because food banks across the country are also facing a time of year known as the “spring hunger gap,” when food supply is often at its lowest level. To help provide meals to people struggling with hunger, companies like Walmart have created unique campaigns like “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” that call on the public to take action and join in the fight against hunger. The campaign takes place every spring and encourages the millions of customers who shop at its stores each week to take action by supporting the Feeding America network of food banks and the more than 46 million Americans it serves throughout the country. “The campaign is an important part of Walmart’s commitment to helping families who struggle with hunger,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. “Together with our suppliers, customers and friends at Feeding America, we’re dedicated to making a positive difference in the lives of those who live and work in the communities we serve.” The “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign provides support to each of Feeding America’s 200 member food banks. The retailer’s commitment to fighting hunger can be seen through food bank programs across the country, such as those offered at the Philabundance food bank in Philadelphia and FeedMore in Central Virginia. The Philabundance Community Kitchen (PCK) is an adult culinary arts vocational training program that prepares low-income women and men to work in commercial kitchens. Beyond the practical results of launching more people into the workforce, Philabundance also helps provide meals to 90,000 people facing hunger in the Delaware Valley every week. FeedMore is Central Virginia’s core hunger-relief organization. Its Mobile Pantry program works to distribute a variety of healthy food items to underserved communities with limited access to grocery stores. The Mobile Pantry goes above and beyond to provide each household in need with about 35 pounds of perishable and non-perishable food items for each distribution. Getting involved to help fight hunger in your community may be easier than you think. Here’s what you can do: Volunteer. It doesn’t take a big time commitment to make an impact. Visit your local Feeding America food bank and ask about volunteer opportunities. Donate. If you can’t contribute time, donate food or money. Your local Feeding America food bank can always use help restocking its shelves. Spread the word. Get to know the facts about hunger and spread the word through your social media activities. The “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign relies heavily on social media to raise awareness of the issue and drive donations to Feeding America food banks across the country.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Wal-Mart Tries Its Hand at Stunt Food With the Crotilla It's exactly what you think it is (croissant plus tortilla), and the company hopes you will be intrigued. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Apr 27, 2017 at 9:40AM There was a time when during "sweeps" rating periods -- a time once crucial to setting ad rates -- television shows would "stunt cast" just to get attention. That might mean the regular cast inexplicably bumping into one of the stars of the day (hey, it's Mr. T!). or even whole stunt episodes built around the surviving Gilligan's Island cast, or some of the The Brady Bunch showing up. In general, catchphrases would be said, laugh tracks were turned up to 11, and viewers would be happily duped into watching. The restaurant world has borrowed that phenomenon for stunt food. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) recently did it with the Unicorn Frappuccino, and chains like Burger King and Taco Bell have made events out of mashing up their menu staples with various snack chips. Stunt food, however, has become common enough that just because a chain tries something wacky does not mean the American public will care. For every Unicorn Frappuccino-level hit, there are at least a handful of Jack in the Box Brunchfasts or Burger King Satisfries that simply do not work. Even Starbucks struggled to establish a viral sensation with a stunt food offer. The chain tried numerous times before its Unicorn Frappuccino became a hit with equally ridiculous frozen drinks offered for a short time that simply did not connect with customers. Now, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), a company that's hardly at the cutting edge of hip, has decided to take its own try at stunt food, launching what it calls the "Crotilla," which blends a croissant with a tortilla. The Crotilla is a cross between a croissant and a tortilla. Image source: Wal-Mart. What is Wal-Mart doing? The retailer is clearly trying to get attention with its new croissant/tortilla hybrid as it launched the product with a blog post headlined "Best Flatbread 4Evr: Meet the Crotilla, Your Bakery BFF." In the post, written by Wal-Mart Communications staff member Elizabeth Walker, the company says the bakery item "can be used for everything from breakfast sandwiches to Indian food." Wal-Mart clearly wants to push boundaries while staying familiar, which is not unlike what various Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM) chains have done with their stunt food. When Taco Bell makes a taco out of Doritos or Pizza Hut stuffs hot dogs in its crust, it's different and people take notice, but it's also easy-to-understand for consumers. "We wanted to invent something innovative and exclusive to Wal-Mart. We worked with our supplier, Aryzta, to create a mash-up of two products the customer already understands, the croissant and the tortilla, similar to the Cronut sensation a few years back," Wal-Mart senior buyer Bradlee Underwood told Walker. Crotillas will be baked in Wal-Mart's bakeries each day. Underwood made it very clear what the business goal of the product is. "We know customers, especially millennial customers, are hungry for new food trends and cool ways to experience food, and we want to be a destination for that," he said. Will this work? Wal-Mart is jumping on a trend and loudly announcing that that's what it's doing. If the Crotilla tastes good, people may buy it. It's possible that existing Wal-Mart customers will be intrigued by the mash-up bakery item, but it's unlikely this will become a sensation that lures in new shoppers. Still, this is not a bad idea for Wal-Mart, though it's a sort of clumsy execution. It's not particularly hip to have a marketing team brazenly try to attach your brand to whatever the young kids like now. But sometimes it takes a lot of swings to hit a home run. If Wal-Mart builds a reputation for coming up with fun, new stuff, perhaps eventually the elusive millennial audience will come try it.

Especially a lot more Target stores have been flagged to have the NES Classic in stock today.  Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 iStockNow issued in stock alerts for Walmart and Target stores across the Nation. We have cross referenced the iStockNow alerts with the BrickSeek. On BrickSeek stores are also showing the NES Classic units in stock at select stores. We also checked the flagged stores on walmart.com, but Walmart's inventory search does not show the NES inventory. Target and Walmart have been restocking the NES Classic since mid-week. New NES Classic stock is keeps arriving on the weekend. It all is likely over by Monday, May 1. Although we heard whispers that GameStop stores still expect NES Classic consoles to arrive next week. Reseller prices for the NES Classic keep dropping again due to the arrival of new NES Classic stock. The lowest priced Nintendo NES Classic console sells for $259.99 plus shipping on amazon.com. A trip to your local Walmart store can mean a $200 saving or profit, depending on which side you are in the NES hunting game.  The reseller prices have been over $300 a week ago, right after the announcement that Nintendo stops making the NES Classic. Now prices came down quite a bit amidst the new NES Classic Edition stock. This will change as soon as all stores run dry of the Nintendo NES Classic. Nintendo said that there are still new NES Classic consoles coming in April to retailers. Best Buy had a big NES Classic sale on Monday. The only other stores that offer the NES Classic this week are Amazon Prime Now and the Nintendo Flagship store in New York. Today could be the last day the Nintendo store is offering the NES Classic.  The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On April 13, Nintendo announced to stop production of the NES Classic Edition. The last shipments of the NES Classic arrive through April. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest hack enables the NES Classic to store 2,500 games. The 80s retro console launched on November 11, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Nintendo has sold 1.5 million NES Classic Edition. Nintendo ha not announced NES Classic sales numbers in the company's April 27 earnings call. Read the latest Nintendo NES Classic updates. This story may contain affiliate links.

(KFSN) KFSN By Corin Hoggard Monday, May 01, 2017 06:32PM FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- The deal is hard to beat. Smart & Final's five-gallon bucket of Tide laundry detergent sells for $24. Walmart's biggest box is about one-third the size for $13, so the bucket is quite a bargain - about a 40 percent discount. But a closer look suggests it may not be exactly what you think. "I thought about buying it, and then I did my research," shopper Alex Pike said. Pike found the bucket a couple months ago and thought it was a great deal, but she decided something looked unusual, so she gave it a closer look. Some of the writing is in Vietnamese. When we peeled back a sticker, we found out it's only supposed to be sold in Vietnam. Procter & Gamble produces Tide. And when people started asking about the big buckets on social media, the company said its products don't come in five-gallon buckets for retail sale. "Being a cloth diapering mother who goes through detergent like crazy, having a five-gallon bucket for real cheap was a good deal," Pike said. A spokeswoman told Action News they have two issues with the big buckets - one is the possibility of counterfeit sales. Police in LA arrested several people last year for buying and selling fake Tide in orange five-gallon buckets. The other is a Procter & Gamble product intended for professional use in Vietnam, but it's hitting store shelves here in the United States. The spokeswoman says "P&G does not sell or authorize anyone else to sell products in five-gallon buckets to the general public." A Smart & Final spokeswoman told us the company can assure customers the product is genuine. They say it "is legally imported for distribution in the United States and is safe to use." FoodMaxx sells the same buckets, and they also say they import the buckets from Vietnam. But Tide's makers say the product is meant to be used in Vietnam where the washing conditions are different than in the US, so the product may not be what American consumers are used to buying. So, we wanted to see how it compared to this typical Tide detergent. We asked the chemists at BSK Associates to find out whether the products are the same on a molecular level. We checked for phosphates, a powerful cleaning agent companies stopped using in the U.S. because of environmental concerns. EMBED More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://abc30.com/video/embed/?pid=1942479" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> Action News bought Tide in the five-gallon bucket and Tide in a smaller container and asked chemists to examine them down to a molecular level and see what they found. "This one also claims there's no Orthophosphate 38, so we're actually going to test the levels," Ian Huh with the lab said. And they checked for other possible differences as well. Procter & Gamble said they don't control the supply chain for the Vietnamese product, so the formula may be different and consumers like Pike may not get the results they usually get from Tide. Action News Anchor Corin Hoggard went to Smart & Final and bought Tide in the five-gallon bucket and Tide in a smaller container and asked the chemists to examine them down to a molecular level and see what they found. They started with a couple assumptions. "I wasn't sure if it was counterfeit or not, but if it was counterfeit I was anticipating there would be some kind of phosphate in it," Huh said. Manufacturers eliminated phosphates in American detergents more than 20 years ago because of environmental concerns, but the chemical compounds are not illegal in California, and they're considered a strong cleaning agent. But the spectrophotometer showed no phosphates in either product. In fact, it showed the bucket and the box both contained the same elements and compounds but in different amounts. "There was six times more surfactin in the five-gallon bucket," Huh explained. Surfactins are cleaning agents. In this case, the analysis showed a high amount of sulfates in the Vietnamese Tide. The chemists say the higher levels mean Tide from the bucket might have a different effect on your clothes than the domestic Tide. "It can result in potentially taking color out from your clothes," Huh said. The American Tide had more aluminum in it, which chemists say is often used as a water softener. So, with those results in mind, is the bucket a bargain to Alexandria Pike? "I would not go back and buy that bucket, knowing that it could dull your clothes because, in the long run, I'm not just washing my clothes," she said. "I'm washing clothes for three or four other people." The chemists, on the other hand, wanted what was left in the big bucket - but just for their whites.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Peter Whoriskey By Peter Whoriskey May 1 at 7:21 PM Follow @PeterWhoriskey (Jorge Ribas,McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) The High Plains dairy complex reflects the new scale of the U.S. organic industry: It is big. Stretching across miles of pastures and feedlots north of Greeley, Colo., the complex is home to more than 15,000 cows, making it more than 100 times the size of a typical organic herd. It is the main facility of Aurora Organic Dairy, a company that produces enough milk to supply the house brands of Walmart, Costco and other major retailers. “We take great pride in our commitment to organic, and in our ability to meet the rigorous criteria of the USDA organic regulations,” Aurora advertises. But a closer look at Aurora and other large operations highlights critical weaknesses in the unorthodox inspection system that the Agriculture Department uses to ensure that “organic” food is really organic. The U.S. organic market now counts more than $40 billion in annual sales and includes products imported from about 100 countries. To enforce the organic rules across this vast industry, the USDA allows farmers to hire and pay their own inspectors to certify them as “USDA Organic.” Industry defenders say enforcement is robust. But the problems at an entity such as Aurora suggest that even large, prominent players can fall short of standards without detection. With milk, the critical issue is grazing. Organic dairies are required to allow the cows to graze daily throughout the growing season — that is, the cows are supposed to be grass-fed, not confined to barns and feedlots. This method is considered more natural and alters the constituents of the cows’ milk in ways consumers deem beneficial. But during visits by The Washington Post to Aurora’s High Plains complex across eight days last year, signs of grazing were sparse, at best. Aurora said its animals were out on pasture day and night, but during most Post visits the number of cows seen on pasture numbered only in the hundreds. At no point was any more than 10 percent of the herd out. A high-resolution satellite photo taken in mid-July by Digital Globe, a space imagery vendor, shows a typical situation — only a few hundred on pasture. Bobby Prigel, owner of Prigel Family Creamery, leads cows to morning milking in 2015 in Glen Arm, Md. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) In response, Aurora spokeswoman Sonja Tuitele dismissed the Post visits as anomalies and “drive-bys.” “The requirements of the USDA National Organic Program allow for an extremely wide range of grazing practices that comply with the rule,” Tuitele said by email. The milk from Aurora also indicates that its cows may not graze as required by organic rules. Testing conducted for The Post by Virginia Tech scientists shows that on a key indicator of grass-feeding, the Aurora milk matched conventional milk, not organic. Tuitele dismissed the tests as “isolated.” Finally, The Post contacted the inspectors who visited Aurora’s High Plains dairy and certified it as “USDA Organic.” Did the inspectors have evidence that the Aurora cows met the grazing requirement? It turns out that they were poorly positioned to know. The inspectors conducted the annual audit well after grazing season — in November. That means that during the annual audit, inspectors would not have seen whether the cows were grazing as required, a breach of USDA inspection policy. “We would expect that inspectors are out there during the grazing season,” said Miles McEvoy, chief of the National Organic Program at the USDA. He said that the grazing requirement is “a critical compliance component of an organic livestock operation.” Tuitele said: “We take these assertions very seriously, as we are a 100% certified organic producer, and our organic practices are the cornerstone of our operations.” If organic farms violate organic rules, consumers are being misled and overcharged. In the case of milk, consumers pay extra — often double — when the carton says “USDA Organic,” in the belief they are getting something different. Organic dairy sales amounted to $6 billion last year in the United States. The failure to comply with organic standards also harms other farms, many of them small. Following the rules costs extra because grazing requires more land and because cows that dine on grass typically produce less milk. Whether an organic dairy is grazing its herd is relatively easy to see, especially if roads crisscross its pastures. It is more difficult, however, for outsiders to judge whether a dairy is following other organic rules — such as those regarding hormones and organic feed. Ten years ago, after a complaint from a consumer group, Aurora faced USDA allegations that it breached organic rules regarding grazing and other issues. The USDA charged that Aurora was in “willful violation” of organic standards, but a settlement agreement allowed it to continue to operate. There have been no charges since then. But some small organic dairy farmers say that the new, large organic dairies that have popped up in the West are violating standards. On visits across several days to seven large organic operations in Texas and New Mexico in 2015, a Post reporter saw similarly empty pastures. It was difficult to determine where their milk winds up on retail shelves, however, so no chemical tests were pursued. “About half of the organic milk sold in the U.S. is coming from very large factory farms that have no intention of living up to organic principles,” said Mark Kastel of the Cornucopia Institute, a Wisconsin-based nonprofit group representing thousands of organic farmers. “Thousands of small organic farmers across the United States depend on the USDA organic system working. Unfortunately, right now, it’s not working for small farmers or for consumers.” * * * (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) The “USDA Organic” seal that appears on food packaging — essentially a USDA guarantee of quality — was created by federal rules in 2000. Until then, convincing customers that a product was “organic” could be a murky proposition — everyone relied on informal definitions of organic and informal measures of trust. The “USDA Organic” seal changed that, standardizing concepts and setting rules. It has proved a boon: Organic food sales rose from about $6 billion annually in 2000 to $40 billion in 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association. The integrity of the new label, however, rested on an unusual system of inspections. Under organic rules, the USDA typically does not inspect farms. Instead, farmers hire their own inspectors from lists of private companies and other organizations licensed by the USDA. An inspector makes an annual visit, arranged days or weeks in advance. Only 5 percent of inspections are expected to be done unannounced. To keep the inspectors honest, the USDA reviews the records of each inspection outfit about every 2½ years. This inspection system saves the USDA money because it does not have to hire many inspectors. The compliance and enforcement team at the USDA National Organic Program has nine people — one for every $4 billion in sales. McEvoy acknowledged that having farmers choose their inspection companies is “fairly unique” within the USDA, but he noted that rising sales show that consumers “trust the organic label.” Others have doubts. Cornucopia publishes its own scorecard of organic dairies because, its officials say, the USDA has failed to weed out the bad. “Consumers look at that cartoon label on organic milk with a happy cow on green pasture with a red barn, but that’s not always the reality,” said Katherine Paul of the Organic Consumers Association. “What we’ve said all along is that organic milks are not created equal, and your results show that.” * * * Many dairies much smaller than Aurora have come to rely on the “USDA Organic” label, investing in the opportunity it represents. Several years ago, for example, Bobby Prigel, a fourth-generation dairyman with a 300-acre spread of rolling pastures and white plank fences in northern Maryland, made the switch. With milk prices declining and feed costs rising, Prigel figured he had to try something different. The herd had been in the barn area for decades, munching feed. One day he shooed them out to pasture. Here’s the funny thing, he said: His cows seemed confused. Though cows are natural grazers — like the wild aurochs they descended from — the grazing instincts of his cows had been dulled. Bobby Prigel rounds up cows in 2015 in Glen Arm, Md. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) “They didn’t really know how to graze at first — they didn’t know how to bend down and get grass with their tongues,” Prigel said during a break on his farm. Nor were they accustomed to walking much. Prigel, meanwhile, had to make economic adjustments. Producing milk according to the “USDA Organic” standard costs more. To begin with, organic cows cannot be given hormones to stimulate milk production. And any feed or pasture for the cows must be organic — that is, grown without most synthetic pesticides. Second, to be considered organic, cows must obtain a certain percentage of their diet from grazing. Prigel is a purist and feeds his herd entirely from the pasture, but most organic dairies supplement the pasture with corn, soybeans or other grains, even during the grazing season. The grazing requirement makes milk more costly to produce because it requires a certain amount of pasture land and because a grazing cow produces less milk than one eating a grain diet optimized for milk production. With grass-fed cows, “there’s just not nearly as much milk,” Prigel said. On the upside, a farmer can sell certified organic milk for almost double the price of conventional, and there are other benefits: The milk is measurably different, and according to the USDA, it improves cow health and reduces the environmental impacts of agriculture. Moreover, because grazing is natural cow behavior, some say it is more humane. “Cows aren’t supposed to stay inside and eat corn,” Prigel said. * * * The grazing season typically runs from spring until the first frost. To evaluate the Aurora operation, The Post visited the High Plains dairy complex eight days during that period — three in August, three in September and two in October. Roads crisscross the farm, allowing a view of the fields. The Post’s visits ranged from about 45 minutes to as long as 10 hours. In addition, in July, a satellite for Digital Globe snapped a high-resolution photo of the area. Each of those 10 days, only a very small portion of the 15,000-cow herd was seen on pastures. Many more were seen in feedlots. In response, Aurora officials said that during the grazing season the cows are on pasture both day and night. Maybe, they said, on those days, the cows were elsewhere, being milked or otherwise tended. However, The Post visited at different times of the day, sometimes twice in a day. Because the cows are milked in shifts, thousands of them should be out at any given time, other organic farmers said. Bobby Prigel at home in 2015. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) Aurora did say that it stopped its grazing season on Sept. 30, so it’s not surprising no cows were seen on the two days in October. Aurora officials said they did so after exceeding the minimum of 120 grazing days. But the USDA says organic cows should graze throughout the grazing season, and the first frost was not until Oct. 20 in that area, according to weather records. To see whether a lack of grazing was apparent in the milk, The Post turned to Virginia Tech dairy science professor Benjamin Corl, who analyzed eight milks, some organic, some not, and all bottled during grazing season. He performed the tests without knowing the brand names of the samples. Grass-fed cows tend to produce milk with elevated levels of two types of fat. One of the distinguishing fats is conjugated linoleic acid, or CLA, which some regard as the clearest indicator of grass feeding. The other is an Omega-3 fat known as alpha-linolenic acid. Both have been associated with health benefits in humans, although the amounts found in milk are relatively small. Another type of fat — linoleic acid, an Omega-6 fat — tends to be sparser in milks that are pasture-fed. The results: Prigel’s milk stood out for its grassy origins. It ranked at the top for CLA and was a distant last for linoleic acid. The milk from Snowville Creamery, another brand that boasts of pasture grazing, ranked second for CLA. “Those two milks stood out like sore thumbs,” Corl said. “You can tell those animals have been on grass.” At the other extreme were the conventional milks — from 365 and Lucerne. They ranked, as expected, at the bottom for the fats associated with grass feeding and at the top for the fat associated with conventional feeding. Large organic brands — Horizon and Organic Valley — ranked roughly in between the extremes for two of the three measures. As for Aurora’s milk, it was very close to conventional milk. On two of the three measures, CLA and linoleic acid, it was pretty much the same as conventional milk. On the third measure, alpha-linolenic acid, Aurora ranked slightly better than the conventional milks but below the other “USDA Organic” samples. The milk tested by The Post had been processed at Aurora’s Colorado processing plant, according to the number stamped on the bottle. More than 80 percent of the milk that Aurora sells is produced at its own farms; it also purchases milk from other dairies, according to the company. It was not the first time that Aurora milk tested poorly for signs of grass feeding. In 2008, the Milkweed, a dairy economics report, compared Aurora’s milk with other organic milks. Of 10 organic milks ranked for the fats associated with grass feeding, Aurora’s was last. “There has been an obvious failure by USDA to enforce the organic pasture standard,” Pete Hardin, editor and publisher of the Milkweed, said in a recent interview. A large organic operation in Texas, one of seven The Washington Post visited in Texas and New Mexico in 2015. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) * * * Tuitele, the Aurora spokeswoman, dismissed the milk tests and declined to comment in depth on them, saying that they were “isolated” and that there are “so many variables that are unknown.” She suggested that Aurora milk may have tested differently not because of a lack of grazing but because Colorado pastures may have different plants. But milks from the Rocky Mountain region and those from the Mid-Atlantic vary little, according to a 2013 study of organic milks published in PLOS One. Aurora’s inspectors also stood by Aurora’s milk. While most inspectors are private organizations, Aurora hired staff from the Colorado Department of Agriculture, which it pays about $13,000 annually. When asked about the Aurora inspection being done after grazing season, an official with the state agency initially suggested that other audits may have been conducted at High Plains last year. But Tuitele later wrote that the November visit was the only audit of its High Plains complex last year. Aurora and its inspectors have been under scrutiny before. About 10 years ago, the USDA launched an investigation into Aurora’s organic practices. In April 2007, the USDA said it had identified “willful violations” of organic rules by the dairy. Aurora had, among other things, for three years “failed to provide a total feed ration that included pasture.” The USDA proposed revoking Aurora’s organic status. It also proposed suspending the Colorado Department of Agriculture from certifying organic livestock “due to the nature and extent of these violations.” Four months later, though, the case was resolved. Aurora pledged to make improvements and was allowed to continue operating. It issued a news release saying that the USDA had “dismissed the complaints . . . following an extensive review” — a finding contrary to the view at the USDA, which issued a news release saying “the complaint was not dismissed.” It noted that the consent agreement called for Aurora to “make major changes.” For its part, the Colorado Department of Agriculture agreed “to make several changes in its operation,” including hiring more personnel and adding staff training, according to a USDA news release. Aurora also settled a related class-action lawsuit for $7.5 million in 2012 and said it did not admit wrongdoing. Since then, Aurora, already gargantuan, has continued to grow. In recent months it has been considering an expansion in Columbia, Mo., that may rely on milk from as many as 30,000 cows, according to local media coverage. The growth of mega-dairies that may fall short of organic standards and produce cheaper milk appears to be crushing many small dairies, some analysts said. “The mom and pop — the smaller traditional family dairies — who are following the pasture rules are seeing their prices erode,” said Hardin, the Milkweed editor. “It is creating a heck of a mess.” Will Costello in Greeley contributed to this report. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

Mike Haffner updates the media on the investigation into the stabbing death of Melinda Vasilije at a press conference at the Waterloo Regional Police Service headquarters in Cambridge on Monday. Ager Mohsin Hasan Police handout Police have released a photo of Ager Mohsin Hasan who they believe is connected to the death of Melinda Vasilije. Melinda Vasilije Submitted photo Melinda Vasilije was found dead in her apartment on Friday. Police say a suspect in her death is on the run. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Anam Latif WATERLOO REGION — Ager Mohsin Hasan was ordered to stay away from 22-year-old Melinda Vasilije after an incident in early April, police said on Monday. The 24-year-old Hamilton man faces a second-degree murder charge in connection with Vasilije's death in Kitchener on Friday. Police say he fled to the United States on Friday, hours after Vasilije was found dead. Hasan's last known whereabouts were in Erie County, Penn., on Friday morning where a man matching his description was seen switching licence plates in a Walmart parking lot. He has not been seen by law enforcement since, Waterloo Regional Police Insp. Mike Haffner said at a news conference Monday. "The information we have right now is he is somewhere in the United States," he added. Vasilije was stabbed multiple times and found inside her apartment at 38 Country Hill Dr. around 3 a.m. Friday morning. Police say Hasan was in contact with Vasilije that night. The two had been in a relationship for about a year, Haffner said. Hasan was ordered to not enter Waterloo Region and to not make contact with Vasilije after he was charged with an alleged break and enter and two alleged assaults at her Country Hill Drive apartment on April 3, Haffner said. In addition to the second-degree murder charge, Hasan has also been charged with three counts of breach of recognizance as part of a Canada-wide warrant. The latter charges stem from the "domestic-related incident" in early April, Haffner said, adding that Vasilije was not a victim to the alleged assaults. "There were a number of terms that Mr. Hasan was placed on, on his release. One of the terms was not to enter the Region of Waterloo and not to have any contact with Melinda Vasilije," Haffner said. Police believe Hasan is in the United States because a vehicle matching the description of Ager's 2016 black Honda HR-V was photographed crossing the U.S. border at the Peace Bridge just before 6 a.m. on Friday. Hasan's last known sighting by police was at a Walmart parking lot in Erie County just after 10 a.m. that same day. In video footage, a man was seen removing a Pennsylvania state licence plate from a parked vehicle with the number EZV1654 and a police medallion attached to it, according to Pennsylvania State Police. The man was then seen attaching the stolen licence plate to a black Honda HR-V. Police are now looking for a black Honda HR-V with two possible licence plates. The other one is an Ontario plate marked BPKT509. Waterloo Regional Police said it is working with U.S. law enforcement agencies, border services as well as the Department Homeland Security to locate Hasan. The local major crimes unit also continues to investigate. Back in Canada, Waterloo Regional Police ask anyone who knows Hasan to get in touch with them. They also ask that if anyone is in contact with Hasan, to ask him to turn himself in. As police continue to look for Hasan south of the border, his mother in Hamilton is worried. Sozan Jamil said she has been beside herself since she heard of Vasilije's death. "I consider her just like my daughter," she said in an interview on Monday. She said she has not heard from her son since Friday. "I've sent him many, many messages," she said, adding that Hasan has not returned her phone calls or emails. "I'm afraid of what he will do. I wish I knew where he is." Haffner said both families have been very co-operative with the investigation. He said there was some contact between Hasan and his family through text messages but that no one has heard from him since Saturday. Vasilije was an aspiring hairstylist. According to a friend and mentor, she had recently moved into the apartment at 38 Country Hill Dr. Her neighbours described her as a sweet girl who always said "hi" in the hallway. A gofundme.com fundraiser cropped up online over the weekend to raise money for Vasilije's funeral. A visitation will be held for Vasilije at the Westmount Memorial Celebration Centre from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Tuesday. The funeral will take place on Wednesday. Anyone with information about Hasan or his whereabouts is asked to call Waterloo Regional Police at 519-653-7700 ext. 8666. alatif@therecord.com , Twitter: @LatifRecord Anam Latif is a reporter with the Waterloo Region Record. | Latest News Local Manhunt continues for Hamilton man wanted in connection with Kitchener woman’s death Snapshot Local Fire plan focuses on technology, search for efficiencies Snapshot Local Willibald distillery in Ayr creates a buzz Snapshot Local Waterloo Region home buyers pushed to the brink Snapshot PHOTOS AND VIDEOS View All Photos View All Videos News St. Patrick's Day on Ezra Avenue News Shooting ArtsEntertainment PHOTOS: Grammy Awards red carpet Video Re-Enactment Video The Hot List: Top 10 cottage rental locations in Ontario Sponsored content Most Read SEE MORE Waterloo Region home buyers pushed to the brink Hamilton man faces second-degree murder charges in Kitchener woman’s death Widow fights feds over CPP benefits denial Locally-owned horse in Kentucky Derby Two-vehicle crash in Kitchener sends occupants to hospital In Your Neighbourhood Today Why Bolt and Nut Supply?

Lidl plans to open the first of its U.S. stores in May, and the retailer did its homework well ahead of time so that it can be successful in the U.S. Much of that success will depend on the products it sells to help drive customer loyalty. “I’ve spoken with several recently that are working on propositions for Lidl. Retailers have reason for concern, not just because Lidl is going all-in (not just testing the market), but also because the combination of Aldi and Lidl is a small format, ‘one-two’ punch,” Spieckerman told Talk Business & Politics. Clint Lazenby, founder of #OnShelf, said there are many similarities between Aldi and Lidl but comparing them and thinking a single strategy will work would be a mistake as there are some key differences that could benefit suppliers. He said Lidl will have a mix of branded and private label items, while Aldi is mostly private label. He said both chains focus on “relentless sourcing practices, have a best in class supply chain management and low store operational costs along with superior lean overhead carry.” “This represents a lot of upside for companies who can offer the right value by changing their product sizing and cost structures to hit key price points. In many cases, these costs can be offset by the way these companies go to market which extends the low cost model to the manufacturer’s. I have no idea how this will play out, but it will be interesting how other retailers choose to partner with their manufactures or they decide to take a more adversarial position with them,” Lazenby said. Mike Paglia, director of retail insights for Kantar Retail, recently spoke about the Lidl threat in Bentonville. He said price wars with Lidl don’t work. He warned suppliers not to play the price discount game with its top tier brands. He said think about smaller packages or perhaps slightly altered formulas that could be sold into Lidl without disrupting the brand loyalty it might have built at Wal-Mart at a higher or value-by-quantity pricing strategy. Paglia said Lidl’s strategy is having the right products, promoting them at the right price and place. Given the stores in the U.S. are considerably larger than in Europe, Lidl will be carrying more items and that means opportunities for suppliers selling everything from dish soap to workout apparel. Paglia said the supplier relationship with Lidl is quite different as this retailer is known to rotate the stock it carries over time so there will likely be some seasonal selling opportunities from general merchandise suppliers. Paglia said Lidl’s private brand strategy is also tiered into three price categories, budget, standard and premium. He said this will be a big part of the brand suppliers’ competition on the shelf. He said Lidl has nine categories where it plans to offer deeper assortments in wine, ethnic foods, produce, meat and fish, bakery, fresh and frozen as well as checkout-impulse items. Suppliers with products in these categories could see opportunities to sell items into the various tiers. He said early on Lidl plans to sell more name brands in hopes of driving some shopper loyalty, but he warned suppliers that very few brands can remain on the shelf year after year without some interruption given the rotating product strategy used by Lidl. Spieckerman said the potential combined scale of Lidl and Aldi will put U.S. dollar, drug, grocery and discount retailers on notice. Lazenby agreed the threat is real for retailers because nobody has been able to really break their success model. He said Lidl and Aldi have a clear strategy on the shopper they serve and focus on the right assortment at the right price for essentially staple products in a given household with a few treasure hunt items along the way. “The threat isn’t just price-based but also the powerful convenience proposition and potential loyalty factor. Aldi has built up quite a loyal following in the U.S. and that loyalty has translated to Aldi’s private brands (much as it has for Aldi’s Trader Joes concept). Lidl has the potential to achieve similar gains once awareness takes hold. Walmart’s best defense is to continue to roll out Neighborhood Market locations and ensure that its click and collect business is seamless and connected to all of its physical locations. Lidl is testing click and collect in Europe and will no doubt parlay any successes to its state-side stores. That is the potential game-changer,” Spieckerman said. Lazenby said one strategy to compete might be leveraging a private brand assortment designed and priced to go head-to-head on the core business segments the consumer is judging for value, and then use the rest of the purchase to drive the overall basket economics they are looking for. “It seems to me the value prop to the consumer is the key driver combined with the smaller box that keeps you on your shopping mission is what makes it a winner. This is powered from the same productivity loop we often hear Walmart discuss,” he added. Paglia agreed that Lidl has been watched Aldi’s success in the U.S. and that’s how it’s determining where stores will be located. He said the new stores will be in the mid-Atlantic states as far north as New Jersey and as far south as Georgia, with Texas also in focus. Within the next year Paglia said Lidl will have 100 stores in the U.S. strategically located where Aldi is performing well. Paglia adds that Lidl’s track record for entering new markets is also pretty impressive at 28:1. A few tips Paglia shared with suppliers about fending off the threat include: • Suppliers will need to force Wal-Mart to think about price cuts strategically looking price elasticity overtime. • Suppliers will need to use their own data to help Walmart discern where and how deep to rollback prices • Suppliers will have to collaborate across their retail teams to ensure their top premium brand products are not sold too cheap at Lidl • Suppliers need to help Wal-Mart build baskets looking for new and unique occasions to promote products.

CHINA GROWTH Walmart International announced 40 more stores coming to the Guangdong Province of China over the next five years. Scott Price, COO of Walmart International, made the announcement at the U.S. Investment Cooperation Conference in the burgeoning nation of nearly 1.4 billion consumers. Price said Walmart will continue to grow its presence in China. He said the Guangdong Province also is the site of the retailer’s China Home Office operations and an important region for the company. Since 1996 Wal-Mart has grown to more than 400 stores in China, with 92 of those in the Guangdong Province. There are eight new stores planned for the region this year. Price said the retailer will also improve its logistics system and build a cold-chain logistics distribution center in Guangdong. Walmart International CEO David Cheesewright has said China is one of the retailer’s largest global growth opportunities, which is why store expansion is planned for not only Walmart locations but also Sam’s Clubs. CHEROKEE LAWSUIT Wal-Mart Stores was a party in a lawsuit filed by the Cherokee Nation last week in Tahlequah, Okla., which is the headquarters for the nation. The suit was filed April 25 in tribal court, but the defendants which include Wal-Mart, Walgreen’s, CVS and drug maker McKesson are expected to move the case to federal court. The Cherokee Nation said it sued distributors and retailers of opioid medications on because the companies have contributed to “an epidemic of prescription opioid abuse” within the tribe and have not done enough to prevent tribal members from acquiring illegally prescribed opioid painkillers. The lawsuit also alleges the companies have pursued profits instead of trying to reduce opioid-related addition that has taken the lives of hundreds of Cherokee citizens and cost the tribe hundreds of millions of dollars in health care costs. The suit claims nearly one-third of the prescription painkillers distributed in Oklahoma went to the Cherokee Nation which includes 14 counties in Northeastern part of the state. Wal-Mart did not respond to a request for comment on this litigation. CVS, a codefendant in the case, said it has policies, procedures and tools to ensure pharmacists properly exercise their responsibility to determine whether a controlled substance prescription was issued for a legitimate medical purpose before filling it. TRANSFER FEE SAVINGS Wal-Mart said Wednesday (April 24) it is lowering fees on wire transfers for customers. The discounts amount to 50 cents on cash transfers up to $50, and $1.50 in savings for wire transfers up to $1,000. The top fee for transfers over $1,000 is capped at $16, down $2. It’s been three years since Wal-Mart began offering its store-to-store wire transfers competing with Western Union. These financial services are mostly used by unbanked customers which total about 9 million households. The company estimates it’s saving $500 million for customers who otherwise would pay up to $160 for wire transfers. Kristy Ward, vice president of Walmart Services, said expanding services helps makes a trip to Walmart stores more efficient for customers. “We feel the value of saving time is almost becoming as important as saving money,” she said. “We never have enough time to make sure time spent shopping in stores is time well spent. If we can make it faster and simpler for the user, that’s a win for us, because we can start to lower our operating costs and for the customer.” Comments comments Previous post Sales tax revenue dips in April for Northwest Arkansas cities, up overall year-to-date Next post Little Rock Outlet Mall to offer Tesla charging stations Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Laura Andress Recruiting ‘outside the box’ Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Observations, drug money, ‘far away eyes,’ and gum and trinkets Barbara Taylor Delegation can boost enterprise value Brian Kratkiewicz The future of advertising Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Observations, corporate pieholes, and the ultimate halftime show Latest Popular Governor kicks off special session, asks lawmakers for healthcare reforms, reserve fund 5 hours ago Evacuations underway in Success and in eastern Pocahontas as historic floodwaters loom 5 hours ago Broker, City Director Keith Lau launches plan for new development in downtown Fort Smith  6 hours ago The Supply Side: Wal-Mart suppliers could see new opportunities with Lidl 8 hours ago Little Rock Outlet Mall to offer Tesla charging stations 9 hours ago Broker, City Director Keith Lau launches plan for new development in downtown Fort Smith  2,066 views For banker Johnny Allison, there’s nothing like a little Cuban credit, opportunity and hospitality 2,021 views Southwestern Energy plans to double drilling in Moorefield Shale in north-central Arkansas 1,694 views Weldon, Williams & Lick to expand in deal with Florida ticket company 976 views Winery owner makes plunge into Arkansas’ burgeoning cheese industry 783 views Talk Business & Politics is a news website that covers business, politics and culture in Arkansas.

Hall joked that the selection reminded her of “my hippie days,” while Huser explained she was there because she’d “been born almost a vegetarian.” Both said they were happy to have the store in the Alamo Heights neighborhood — the company’s second location here — and agreed they’d be back. That these two women of different generations agreed that the store offered the kind of clean and green foods they are trying to eat more of says a lot about how the San Antonio grocery scene continues to evolve and how organic food has moved into the mainstream. As people become more watchful about what they put in their bodies and how diet affects health, more supermarkets are expanding their healthy offerings. The situation in San Antonio reflects the rest of the country where sales of organic foods exceeded $35 billion in 2014 — 5 percent of total U.S. food sales — according to the Organic Trade Association. And 51 percent of Americans reported buying more organics in 2015 than in 2014. No surprise, then, that most of the nation’s largest retailers have publicly committed to offering more of these products to their customers. In 2013, Target launched a line of organic, GMO-Free food called Simply Balanced. The next year, Walmart introduced its Wild Oats label. Then last year Costco became the country’s top organic-food retailer with $4 billion in annual sales, compared to $3.6 billion for Austin-based Whole Foods Market, according to TheStreet.com. Costco highlights its organic offerings with green signage and often displays organics right next to conventionally raised produce for easy comparison. As organics become ever more mainstream and these large chains duke it out for market share, prices continue to go down and consumers are paying ever less for organics. Three pounds of organic bananas at the Schertz Costco store recently cost $1.99, versus $1.39 for the nonorganic. Two pounds of green beans were priced at $5.99 and $4.99, respectively. And 5.5 pounds of Gala apples went for $9.99 and $6.99. San Antonio chef Elizabeth Johnson said she often finds organics cost less at her local Costco than from her traditional food purveyors. “With things like organic quinoa, basmati rice, dates, cashew pieces, you’d be hard-pressed to find better prices than at Costco,” said Johnson, owner of Pharm Table, which specializes in organic, plant-based cuisine. A Costco representative declined to comment for this article. “The competition is good for consumers because supermarkets are no longer able to charge such a large premium on foods perceived as being clean, green and natural,” said Rupesh D. Parikh, a senior analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. “Overall, the market should continue to grow robustly, but we’ll see see that growth spread out more widely among a larger number of players.” While a 2015 Consumer Reports survey found that organic foods were an average of 47 percent more expensive than their conventional counterparts, the difference shrank 8 percent between 2011 and 2015, according to the Organic Trade Association. H-E-B introduced its organics line in March, 2014. A month later, Walmart took one of the first national shots across the organics bow when it introduced its Wild Oats brand with prices that were, on average, 25 percent cheaper than national organics brands. Even Whole Foods, which charges a premium for its healthy offerings — earning it the derisive nickname “Whole Paycheck” — is having to change its approach as customers migrate to lower-priced competitors. Whole Foods previously announced it would be closing nine stores during the first quarter of this year. More recently it was rumored to be a takeover target of Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons, which once had 20 local stores here, but left the San Antonio market in 2002. In an effort to attract more price-sensitive consumers, particularly millennials, Whole Foods is launching an offshoot brand called 365 by Whole Foods Market that will feature “a modern, streamlined design, innovative technology and a curated selection,” said co-CEO of the company Walter Robb in an interview on NPR’s Morning Edition. Prices there tend to be 15 percent to 20 percent lower than in the parent stores, according to Supermarket News. There are now four 365 by Whole Foods stores open and 20-plus more on the way, but the company currently has no plans to open any in the San Antonio area, said spokeswoman Rachel Malish. The demand for organic foods is so great that at times it has strained supplies. To help guarantee they’ll have enough produce, for example, retailers such as Costco and Whole Foods have reportedly offered loans directly to growers to help make the three-year transition from traditional to organic farming easier. While San Antonio may have been slow to latch onto the trend, we’re catching up fast, according to observers. H-E-B, the city’s dominant grocery player, has been in the natural food space since the 1990s. “We’ve always provided our customers with fresh, healthy food,” H-E-B spokeswoman Julie Bedingfield said. “But now we’re calling it out more, being more aggressive in telling our story.” In addition to selling its own private-label organics, the company last year rolled out Select Ingredients, a line of almost 400 products made without synthetic ingredients, including Red 40 and Yellow 5 artificial colors, bleached flour, partially hydrogenated oils and preservatives such as BHT, BHA and EDTA. More recently, it began pilot testing Wellness Centers in H-E-B Plus! stores where customers can watch healthy cooking demonstrations — breakfast migas recently — get copies of the recipes and buy the ingredients all in one centralized location. There are currently Wellness Centers in H-E-B Plus! stores at Interstate 35 and FM 3009 and at Bandera Road and Loop 1604. “As one of the largest retail distributors of health and wellness products, we see this almost as the right thing to do,” said Bedingfield. “We saw this (move to health and wellness) coming two decades ago and we don’t see it going away.” But San Antonio has had organic stores for almost 40 years. Bexar County judge Nelson Wolff opened Sun Harvest, generally considered the city’s first health food supermarket, in 1979. “Nobody came into the San Antonio market for years after we opened,” he said of the chain he sold in 1999. “Then folks like Whole Foods and Trader Joes showed that people were willing to pay more for food that’s good for them.” The influx of new organic/natural stores to the area could be a sign of the city’s rising income, but chef Johnson says it also reflects new people moving here. “I’m seeing more San Antonians who are educated and have traveled and people who’ve moved here from elsewhere who are more interested in eating better,” said Johnson of Pharm Table, “That’s made it easier for these chains to justify coming here.” Whole Foods Market, the first grocer to be certified by the federal National Organic Program, entered the San Antonio market in 1993 near Wurzbach Road and Interstate 10 before moving to the Alamo Quarry Market in 1997. The second store, in the Vineyard Shopping Center on Blanco Road and Loop 1604, opened in 2012. The chain sees San Antonio as a market for healthy food that’s equal to any other in Texas. “You’ve got amazing farmers markets and a very impressive, expanding restaurant scene,” said Kelly Landrieu, a local forager for Whole Foods Market’s Southwest Region. (Her title means she’s responsible for finding new, locally made products for the store to carry.) The city’s growing food culture is one reason Natural Grocers opened its first store here on NW Military Highway in 2016, according to Clinthorne. “You folks have an undeserved reputation for not wanting to eat anything but chicken fried steak. And that’s simply not true,” he said. In addition to selling only organic produce, Natural Grocers recently enhanced its vendor standards. Egg-laying hens, for example, must have access to shaded, outdoor yards where they can take socialize, perch and take dust baths to keep themselves clean and parasite-free. Dairy farms are required require to graze milk cows on managed pastures for a minimum of 120 days. “We gave our vendors plenty of time to adapt to these new requirements,” Clinthorne said. “But even so we had to drop a number of them because they couldn’t or wouldn’t meet the deadline.” As demand for this kind of food continues to grow, these vendors may be forced to reconsider their reluctance. rmarini@express-news.net Twitter: @RichardMarini    Catch every San Antonio area moment!

Revolutionizing the hummus category with the introduction of the industry's first USDA organic, non-refrigerated and preservative free hummus, hummustir is quickly becoming the nation's go-to healthy hummus. The innovative packaging designed to preserve the freshness of the ingredients without the need for preservatives, is the first specially designed packaging of its kind to be used in this food category. Synthetic preservatives like potassium sorbate are typically used to extend the shelf life of refrigerated hummus and other refrigerated foods such as canned goods, desserts and dairy products, which studies have claimed are genotoxic, potentially causing damage to genetic information, white blood cells, digestion and skin. Hummustir includes three individual packets consisting of organic chickpea puree, organic tahini and spices, offering consumers a shelf-stable hummus of up to a year before opening and remaining fresh without the use of GMO's or any artificial additives. "It is our philosophy that everyone should have access to real food with real ingredients," said Alon Kruvi, Hummustir's Co-Founder. "Hummustir makes it easy for people to enjoy the health benefits that come from fresh, delicious hummus without making it from scratch." Enjoyed as a snack and as a healthy addition to any meal, hummustir is also the ideal hummus for everyone to customize. Adds Kruvi, "Many are surprised at just how smooth the hummus is given that it simply contains a blend of purely organic ingredients. This makes it easy for everyone to add their own personal flavor." With just a stir, hummustir allows consumers to reap the rewards of the once healthy food that has since been stripped of its high levels of nutrition. Containing just 45 calories per serving, around half the average calorie content found in most refrigerated hummus products, hummustir is loaded with heart-healthy omega 3's, vitamins and minerals.  Hummustir comes in four delicious flavors: CLASSIC Our traditional classic flavor has the perfect balance of chickpeas, tahini and a dash of sea salt for a rich, smooth and delicious hummus that tastes great with just about anything. VILLAGE STYLE A mouthwatering combination of garlic and cumin beautifully blended for dipping, spreading and stirring into your favorite foods. MEDITERRANEAN STYLE A squeeze of tangy lemon gives our traditional hummus a zesty twist for a more exotic hummus experience. BLAZIN Spice things up with a hint of habanero for an extra kick to your dip. Hummustir is available for purchase in major retail food chains and grocery stores featured on http://www.hummustir.com/wheretobuy and online. About hummustir Hummustir was launched in August 2016 by hummus connoisseurs and Co-Founders Alon Kruvi, Rakesh Barmecha and Vineet Bokaria, with the aim of producing organic hummus that makes it simple for everyone to enjoy. Spending years researching, developing and perfecting hummus fresh without preservatives and chemicals used to extend shelf life and enhance flavor like in the ones you see lining the refrigerator shelves in stores, the founders shared a vision of creating a nutritional hummus to positively impact the food industry and consumers everywhere. From crafting the perfect recipe that maintains the smooth consistency of authentic hummus using the finest quality organic ingredients to creating its innovative packaging, each step is thoughtfully designed with everyone in mind. This is because eating real food, made from natural ingredients should be accessible to everyone, a philosophy that's behind the creation of each and every hummustir.

Laura Wallace found the message, written in Chinese, tucked inside the zipper compartment of the purse she purchased at a Sierra Vista Walmart, KVOA reported. Wallace had a Chinese-speaking person translate the note to English. The letter read: “Inmates in the Yingshan Prison in Guangxi, China are working 14 hours daily with no break/rest at noon, continue working overtime until 12 midnight, and whoever doesn’t finish his work will be beaten. Their meals are without oil and salt. Every month, the boss pays the inmate 2000 yuan, any additional dishes will be finished by the police. If the inmates are sick and need medicine, the cost will be deducted from the salary. Prison in China is unlike prison in America, horse cow goat pig dog (literally, means inhumane treatment).” Two other people translated the note to make sure the message was accurate, Wallace added. “I’m very sure that that’s exactly what the note says,” she told KVOA. Wallace said she wanted to share the note to bring awareness to the situation. “I don’t want this to be an attack on any store,” Wallace said. “That’s not the answer. This is happening at all kinds of places and people just probably don’t know.” Walmart issued a statement to KVOA on the incident. “We can’t comment specifically on this note, because we have no way to verify the origin of the letter, but one of our requirements for the suppliers who supply products for sale at Walmart is all work should be voluntary as indicated in our Standards for Suppliers.” Similar notes reportedly have turned up in items sold at stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and K-Mart in the past.

provided by Baruvi Fresh LLC 01 May, 2017, 09:12 ET Share this article NEW YORK, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Since its launch in October 2016, hummustir has already been unveiled in the largest food retail stores across the U.S. including Walmart, Wegmans, Fairway, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Citarella, Central Market, Woodmans Market and Fresh Thyme with many more of the country's leading chains to follow. Revolutionizing the hummus category with the introduction of the industry's first USDA organic, non-refrigerated and preservative free hummus, hummustir is quickly becoming the nation's go-to healthy hummus. Hummustir Story (PRNewsfoto/Baruvi Fresh LLC)... (PRNewsfoto/Baruvi Fresh LLC)... The innovative packaging designed to preserve the freshness of the ingredients without the need for preservatives, is the first specially designed packaging of its kind to be used in this food category. Synthetic preservatives like potassium sorbate are typically used to extend the shelf life of refrigerated hummus and other refrigerated foods such as canned goods, desserts and dairy products, which studies have claimed are genotoxic, potentially causing damage to genetic information, white blood cells, digestion and skin. Hummustir includes three individual packets consisting of organic chickpea puree, organic tahini and spices, offering consumers a shelf-stable hummus of up to a year before opening and remaining fresh without the use of GMO's or any artificial additives. "It is our philosophy that everyone should have access to real food with real ingredients," said Alon Kruvi, Hummustir's Co-Founder. "Hummustir makes it easy for people to enjoy the health benefits that come from fresh, delicious hummus without making it from scratch." Enjoyed as a snack and as a healthy addition to any meal, hummustir is also the ideal hummus for everyone to customize. Adds Kruvi, "Many are surprised at just how smooth the hummus is given that it simply contains a blend of purely organic ingredients. This makes it easy for everyone to add their own personal flavor." With just a stir, hummustir allows consumers to reap the rewards of the once healthy food that has since been stripped of its high levels of nutrition. Containing just 45 calories per serving, around half the average calorie content found in most refrigerated hummus products, hummustir is loaded with heart-healthy omega 3's, vitamins and minerals.  Hummustir comes in four delicious flavors: CLASSIC Our traditional classic flavor has the perfect balance of chickpeas, tahini and a dash of sea salt for a rich, smooth and delicious hummus that tastes great with just about anything. VILLAGE STYLE A mouthwatering combination of garlic and cumin beautifully blended for dipping, spreading and stirring into your favorite foods. MEDITERRANEAN STYLE A squeeze of tangy lemon gives our traditional hummus a zesty twist for a more exotic hummus experience. BLAZIN Spice things up with a hint of habanero for an extra kick to your dip. Hummustir is available for purchase in major retail food chains and grocery stores featured on http://www.hummustir.com/wheretobuy and online. About hummustir Hummustir was launched in August 2016 by hummus connoisseurs and Co-Founders Alon Kruvi, Rakesh Barmecha and Vineet Bokaria, with the aim of producing organic hummus that makes it simple for everyone to enjoy. Spending years researching, developing and perfecting hummus fresh without preservatives and chemicals used to extend shelf life and enhance flavor like in the ones you see lining the refrigerator shelves in stores, the founders shared a vision of creating a nutritional hummus to positively impact the food industry and consumers everywhere. From crafting the perfect recipe that maintains the smooth consistency of authentic hummus using the finest quality organic ingredients to creating its innovative packaging, each step is thoughtfully designed with everyone in mind. This is because eating real food, made from natural ingredients should be accessible to everyone, a philosophy that's behind the creation of each and every hummustir.

Photo Courtesy of HP. Tweet Achieving diversity in BigLaw has proved an uphill battle for advocates of inclusion. But many general counsel—who are uniquely positioned to influence the dynamic of legal teams—have chosen to direct their business to firms that show a commitment to diversity. Kim Rivera, chief legal officer and general counsel at HP, says new tactics are in order. “Despite decades of sustained effort, we’re not demonstrating any kind of sustained practice for diverse lawyers,” Rivera says. “We’re past the point of continuing to talk about it and are doing more bold things, pushing boundaries, pushing the envelope to come up with better ideas.” For Rivera and her team, this meant implementing a groundbreaking program that leverages the power of the purse. HP’s “diversity holdback mandate” allows the company to withhold up to 10 percent of billed invoices from law firms that don’t meet or exceed minimum requirements for diverse staffing. “For people like me—I’ve been working on diversity and inclusion in one fashion or another for over 20 years,” she says. “Now I have this rare, wonderful platform of support … to tell law firms we work with: This is important to us. It’s so important to drive performance and innovation that it’s going to be mandatory.” HP’s initiative builds on the work of general counsel who’ve maintained pressure on outside counsel to create more opportunities for female and minority lawyers. Former Wal-Mart GC Tom Mars and Roderick A. Palmore, formerly general counsel at Sara Lee and General Mills, are just two of many who worked within, and outside of, their organizations to promote change. Mars terminated Wal-Mart’s relationship with firms that didn’t meet diversity targets, and in a 2004 “Call to Action” letter, Palmore urged his peers to commit to ending or limiting relationships with firms that lacked a “meaningful interest in being diverse.” Last August, the ABA House of Delegates passed Resolution 113, calling on corporate legal departments to use their purchasing power to increase economic opportunities for diverse attorneys. Two dozen in-house counsel from top U.S. companies, including McDonald’s, CBS and Verizon, signed a letter pledging to uphold the resolution and urged other GCs to utilize the ABA’s model diversity survey to accurately measure the effectiveness of diversity and inclusion in the legal teams they engage. As businesses cater their sales strategies to a growing diverse demographic, they are seeking contractors who reflect the community at large. A wealth of research has demonstrated that diversity benefits the bottom line. One study published by the market research house Acritas found that law firms offering “very diverse teams” tend to receive a 25 percent greater share of legal spending than nondiverse teams. But research supporting the business case for diversity has had minimal impact on law firm hiring and retention practices, although general counsel have been steadily employing the carrot—and the stick. “I think GCs need to keep up the pressure in any way they can,” says Arin Reeves, a former lawyer and the founder and president of Nextions, a research and consulting firm in Chicago. “It’s the structures in firms that don’t support this. The structures in firms are too heavily weighted toward people’s comfort zones. As long as you’ve got systems of retention and advancement—especially promotion, and promotion into leadership in firms—that are incredibly subjective, comfort-zone-based systems, everything else is going to nibble around the edges.” Rivera says she’s seen an immediate effect from HP’s initiative, with the teams coming to pitch business “more diverse than ever before.” But it’s only the first step—Rivera is collaborating with other GCs and looking at ways to expand the program. “How can we help smaller and medium-sized practitioners? How can we help firms rethink the traditional economic structures that have been a barrier to diversity? But I want to walk before we run. I want to build something that’s sustainable, and then we can build upon it as we go.” Correction The print version of “HP Mandates Diversity,” May, should have stated that the ABA House of Delegates passed Resolution 113 last August. The Journal regrets the error. This article originally appeared in the May 2017 issue of the ABA Journal with this headline: "HP Mandates Diversity: General counsel say bold moves are necessary to achieve lasting change."

Continue Reading Below The money, more than 90% of which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. That could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to make splashy acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders. Apple's quarterly results will show the company has doubled its cash pile in just over 4 1/2 years. In the last three months of 2016, it racked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. As of December, the company had $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities. Apple, like many big American companies, parks most of that cash offshore rather than paying U.S. taxes on its overseas profits. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enabled it. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans. One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefiting investors including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Wall Street analysts tend to focus more on companies' net cash position than the headline number. Since 2012, Apple has gathered some $88 billion in debt to fund payouts to shareholders. But even subtracting that, Apple would be left with more cash than the total stockpile of Microsoft Corp., the next richest tech company, which has $126 billion in cash, not accounting for debt. With the exception of financial companies, Apple's stash exceeds that of any other U.S. company in recent history, said Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "I have never seen a company in this kind of extreme position, barring a winding-down," she said. "Apple's a cash box right now." Apple cash and cash equivalents are spread across short- and long-term securities, including corporate securities, U.S. Treasury securities and money-market funds. When Apple had its 1990s bankruptcy scare, then CEO Steve Jobs arranged a cash infusion from Microsoft, setting his resolve to keep reserves for future emergencies. Mr. Jobs also believed Apple could better boost its stock price by using its money to develop new products than through buybacks or dividends. His biggest product, the iPhone, has only supercharged the cash machine. Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the devices in the decade since it was introduced, and today claims 91% of all the profits in the smartphone sector. Mr. Cook has been somewhat more accommodating of shareholder desires than his predecessor. He started a program of dividends and stock buybacks in 2012 that has since sent more than $200 billion to shareholders. And he has invested more in some areas, such as research and development. But the CEO also stared down Carl Icahn in 2013 and 2014 when the activist investor bought a stake in Apple and demanded it increase buybacks. And Apple remains frugal in other realms, such as marketing. It spent less than $1.8 billion on advertising last year -- not even half the amounts laid out by smaller rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., according to company filings. Apple also avoids large acquisitions. It bought at a rate of 15 to 20 companies a year over the past four years, generally spending several hundred million dollars on companies it can easily assimilate. Its biggest deal was the $3 billion it spent to buy Beats Electronics LLC in 2014. The swelling war chest, however, has fueled hopes for bigger deals to vault Apple in new directions such as self-driving cars and entertainment. At Apple's 2015 shareholder meeting, one investor asked Mr. Cook about buying Tesla Inc., which today is valued around $51 billion. The CEO didn't directly respond. Robert Nichols of Windward Capital Management Co., an Apple shareholder, says it should buy Netflix Inc., valued around $65 billion, to jump-start its video-streaming business and bolster its position against Amazon. "You can either build [content and distribution] or you can buy it," and buying would help Apple gain ground where it is behind, he said. With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S. Either way, a sense is growing that Apple's cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. "If this a rainy-day fund, they're saving for a millennial flood," said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.

The woman said she bought the purse at the superstore in Sierra Vista, Arizona, and later found the note, written completely in Chinese, reported KPTV.  She had the note translated three times to be certain that the message was correct.  An Arizona woman says she believes that she found a note from a Chinese prisoner pleading for help in a purse she bought at Walmart The note's author writes that he or she is a prisoner in China being forced to work about 14 hours a day with little food or medical attention.  The alleged prisoner pleads for help from whoever reads the note, but the woman who found it said she does not have the means personally to help the prisoner, so she hopes something comes out of sharing it.  Similar letters to this one have been traced back to stores that outsource a lot of their labor, such as K-Mart, in the past.  KPTV - FOX 12 Share or comment on this article e-mail 477 shares Most watched News videos Shocking footage shows aftermath of severe turbulence on Bangkok flight Incredible rescue of baby from capsized truck captured on video Awkward moment woman rejects marriage proposal at Fenway Moment car accident causes gas tanker to explode in Ohio Woman pops cyst with 16 gauge screwdriver and pushes out fluid Theresa May's embarrassingly quiet day of door-knocking in Scotland Excitable toddler performs his own version of the Haka dance Moment shooter opens fire at black pool party guests Baby elephant tossed around after getting in the way of a bull Kelly Ripa reveals Ryan Seacrest as her new co-host Canadian crowd sing entire Star-Spangled Banner when mic fails Terrifying moment tyre explodes into air and destroys car The flight from Hell: Horrific turbulence leaves 27...

SHARE Woman accused of kicking, biting officers Sophia Weaver By Gabrielle Porter Monday, May 1, 2017 A 21-year-old Grand Junction woman accused of kicking one police officer in the stomach and biting another while they tried to remove her from the North Avenue Walmart on Sunday evening could be charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer. Grand Junction police officers responding to a report of a suspect they were told was “acting crazy” at the store found Sophia Catherine Weaver, sitting on the ground with her knees against her chest, an affidavit for her arrest said. An officer told her to leave because a store manager said he wanted to file a trespassing restraint and “at least two employees said they felt threatened by the woman’s words and actions,” the report said. Weaver, however, allegedly refused to leave. “She insisted she was waiting for an order of french fries,” an officer wrote in the report. When another cop arrived, they re-approached Weaver and told her to leave again. She was acting erratically, however, walking toward the door before veering off and insisting she didn’t do anything wrong, the report said. When an officer put his hand on her shoulder to redirect her toward the door, Weaver started to physically resist, the report said. As the officers tried to cuff her, she “wrestled free and kicked me in the abdomen causing pain,” the report said. Weaver continued to struggle as the officers put her in a patrol car. “I heard (the other officer) tell Weaver to stop biting him,” the officer wrote in the report. Weaver appeared in Mesa County Court on Monday afternoon, where Judge Bruce Raaum told her she could be charged with assault, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, menacing and trespass. Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein on Monday asked that Weaver be held on a cash-only bond because of the allegations that she attacked two officers and other issues including mental-health problems and substance abuse. Public Defender Scott Burrill asked that she be released on a personal-recognizance bond so she can keep a job she said she started recently. Raaum ordered Weaver to remain in custody in lieu of a $5,000 cash-only bond. Weaver, who told Raaum she reacted at Walmart because she was “attacked from behind,” which triggered her mental illness issues, is due in court at 8:30 a.m. Friday.

Monday night, Glasper stood in the very same room in the very same library branch during another city planning meeting and noted that she and her fellow Weston Ranch residents are still waiting. “Where’s the shopping center?” Glasper asked. “It’s frustrating. … There’s no place here in Weston Ranch.”  City officials say they are hoping things will improve sooner rather than later. Monday night, they invited Stockton residents to attend a public workshop aimed at helping to plan a brighter long-range future for the city. About 50 community members turned out. “I like the fact they are coming to the community and asking our opinions,” Glasper said. “I’m going to stay hopeful.” The city has held multiple public workshops around Stockton in the past year. The goal, officials say, is to create new policies and programs that form an amended General Plan for Stockton to carry the city through 2040. For some Weston Ranch residents Monday, that meant removing obstacles to a new Walmart or supermarket in their community. For others, it meant getting a full-service pharmacy, or promoting community health, or making the city friendlier to pedestrians and bicyclists. All, however, made it clear they are tired of waiting. “What’s going to happen down here in Weston Ranch?” 59-year-old David Gori said. “I’ve lived (in Weston Ranch) for 20 years and I haven’t seen nothing going on down here.” Focusing on goals Four broad topics were addressed Monday night: transportation, land use, safety and community health. If a new General Plan ultimately achieves it objectives, the city by 2040 will be more easily traversed by foot and bicycle; there will be more retail and commercial options available closer to where people are living; communities will be safer from both crime and the dangers of flooding; and green space will be preserved. Stockton officials received their mandate from the City Council about a month ago. The new General Plan that is supposed to make all of this happen still is at least a year from adoption. But consultant Charlie Knox and Community Development Director David Kwong acknowledged Monday that no matter what plans Stockton adopts, the city also will need cooperation from the private sector. “It does require some interest by private development,” Knox said. “You can zone something for grocery stores and wait and wait and wait, but if the developer isn’t there ...” His voice trailed off. Still, Knox said with the right programs in place residents will not have to wait all the way until 2040 to see a better Stockton. Free Weston Ranch? More than two years ago, a group of unhappy Weston Ranch residents wanted to drag Stockton into divorce court. But Monday night, the discussion in Weston Ranch focused on the long-term future of the relationship — an urban-planning version of marriage counseling. Late in 2014, a group of Weston Ranch dissidents said they wanted to secede from Stockton. They continued to make their case publicly into at least the first half of 2015. If any remaining secession advocates were present Monday night, they opted not to publicly express their opinion. But that does not mean the residents are satisfied now. “Our community does not get treated like Stockton,” said resident Michael Busby, sounding a familiar theme Monday. On tap The city will hold another workshop from 5:30-7 p.m. Tuesday at the Arnold Rue Community Center, 5758 Lorraine Avenue. Then, there will be more presentations before the Planning Commission and the City Council, followed by internal work aimed at generating the release in the fall of a draft of a new General Plan. Perhaps what results from a new General Plan will finally ease frustrations that seemingly never go away in Weston Ranch. Looking ahead to 2040 and the plan’s finish line nearly a quarter-century from now, one Weston Ranch resident asked the unanswered question that lingers on the minds of many: How long will it take to see change? “What’s go to happen,” the resident asked, “before 23 years? — Contact reporter Roger Phillips at (209) 546-8299 or rphillips@recordnet.com.

Photo / KPTV An Arizona woman says she believes that she found a note from a Chinese prisoner pleading for help in a purse she bought at Walmart. The woman said she bought the purse at the superstore in Sierra Vista, Arizona, and later found the note, written completely in Chinese, reported KPTV. She had the note translated three times to be certain that the message was correct. The note's author writes that he or she is a prisoner in China being forced to work about 14 hours a day with little food or medical attention. The alleged prisoner pleads for help from whoever reads the note, but the woman who found it said she does not have the means personally to help the prisoner, so she hopes something comes out of sharing it. Similar letters to this one have been traced back to stores that outsource a lot of their labor, such as K-Mart, in the past. - Daily Mail Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Northland news briefs Northland news briefs Hawke's Bay Today Car and ute collide in Takapau A crash has occurred in Takapau, Central Hawke's Bay this afternoon between a ute and… Bay of Plenty Times Tauranga duo got chance to survive reality show challenges .One on one interviews with the Tauranga Survivor NZ contestants Our Features' Top Stories Driven Are sedans dead?

Officials want to end rent court disparities Business Crofton toy tape company announces partnership with consumer tape company InRoad Toys Handout Crofton resident Andy Musliner, InRoad's CEO, started the business in 2002 from his home when he began trying to design a toy for building roads for his then-3-year-old son. Crofton resident Andy Musliner, InRoad's CEO, started the business in 2002 from his home when he began trying to design a toy for building roads for his then-3-year-old son. (Handout) Lorraine MirabellaContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Crofton-based InRoad Toys, which makes paper tape that sticks to flat surfaces to create roads for toy cars, announced a partnership Monday with one of the nation's largest consumer tape makers, North Carolina-based Shurtape Technologies LLC. InRoad Toys, which began selling its PlayTape products in Wal-Mart stores in January, also said it has expanded its distribution channels to include international toy retailer Imaginarium, select Target stores and O'Reilly Auto Parts, a 4,900-store automotive chain. The investment by Shurtape, maker of Duck Tape, FrogTape and T-Rex tape, will enable additional growth for InRoad. InRoad said it finalized a round of funding led by Shurtape for an undisclosed amount. Since the product was introduced three years ago at the International Toy Fair in New York, distribution has mushroomed from a few small toy stores to 12,000 outlets in 35 countries. The company this year was named the Maryland Home-Based Business of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration. PlayTape, which resembles roads and rail lines, is billed as easy to tear and reposition, allowing children to create instant pathways for toy vehicles. The company also sells Hot Wheels PlayTape through a licensing agreement reached just over a year ago with Mattel Inc.  Learn about the local trail-blazers who started their own companies. (By Kim Walker) The partnership with Shurtape, which became InRoad's primary manufacturer earlier this year, will help InRoad to expand production while increasing efficiency and reducing costs, the companies said.

Wayne Kozak - a New York man wanted in the murder of his mother found in the Summit Township Super 8 motel around two weeks ago. And most notably Steve Stephens - the Cleveland Facebook killer. All on the run, all caught in Erie County. Chief Don Dacus, Erie Police Department, says, "You have Route 5, Route 20, I90, they're the east (and) west corridors. You have 79 that ends right here in the city of Erie. You have I86 that travels east (and) west through New York state and ends right here in Erie County. So we have all the main arteries of the country that come right to us." Now police looking for 24-year-old Ager Mohin Hasan from Hamilton, Ontario wanted in connection to a woman found dead in her kitchen. He was spotted at the Harborcreek Walmart this weekend. Trooper Cindy Owens, Pennsylvania State Police, says, "I don't think there's a time where it's greater or a time where it's less. Just happened that they all came here within the a week and half, two weeks. " However, officers say they always keeping an eye out. Dacus says, "Known high-crime areas of the city, we try to be extra vigilant in running plates that may be from Ohio, or New York or Canada. In high crime neighborhoods just for the simple fact that we know the business that goes on in high-crime areas." Owen says, "If we see a violation, of course we're going to make a stop whether it be an in-state tag or an out-of-state tag. Then also if we get information from an outside agency, they'll send out a bolo is what we call it, be on the lookout. If we get that information then it's shared of course with the officers in the area. If we see that vehicle or a vehicle that matches that description, of course a stop will be made." The Erie Police Department and Pennsylvania State Police say they've been able to successfully capture fugitives thanks to everyone working together and because of tips from the public. Dacus says, "Erie's always been a big-town mentality, so people share information here pretty well. Our working relationship with surrounding law enforcement is I can't say enough about it. It's very good." Owens says, "Between Pennsylvania State Police and all other agencies, local departments, and also the outside agencies, we try to relay information as quickly as possible."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Niels Epting Apple has $250 billion in cash just lying around Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 1st, 2017 at 5:54 PM Share Tweet The iPhone, in addition to turning the entire smartphone industry on its head, helped transform Apple into one of the most valuable companies on the planet. With a market cap bordering on $770 billion at the time of writing, not to mention a stock price trading at an all-time high, Apple investors are sitting pretty right about now. Tomorrow, Apple will release its earnings report for the quarter gone-by, and if iPhone sales check in higher than anticipated, Apple shares may skyrocket even higher. Don't Miss: Even more Galaxy S8 problems are beginning to pop up Ahead of Apple’s earnings report, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apple tomorrow will relay that it now has more than $250 million in the bank. Last we heard, Apple was sitting on $246 billion in cash. “Apple is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars,” the Journal notes, “an unrivaled hoard that is greater than the market value of either Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined.” Of course, the rub is that the vast majority of Apple’s cash resides in bank accounts overseas. Consequently, Apple has shied away from bringing that cash back to the U.S. as to avoid a 35% corporate income tax rate. The following chart via Statista illustrates Apple’s current cash situation. Stowing away cash overseas is hardly an efficient way to take advantage of  years worth of iPhone-fueled profits, but that may all change now that Donald Trump is President. During the course of the 2016 Presidential election, Trump’s tax plan listed on its website indicated that it will provide businesses with the opportunity to repatriate profits “held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent.” Suffice it to say, if Trump follows through on his promise, Apple stands to enjoy a staggering amount of tax savings. In a hypothetical scenario where Apple opts to repatriate $75 billion, it would save approximately $18.7 billion under Trump’s proposed tax holiday. In the meantime, Apple is in no rush to do anything drastic with its vast cash reserves overseas. Speaking to this point, Tim Cook relayed the following during a 2013 interview with the Washington Post: “If you look at it today, to repatriate cash to the US, you need to pay 35 percent of that cash. And that is a very high number. We are not proposing that it be zero. I know many of our peers believe that. But I don’t view that. But I think it has to be reasonable.” Tags: Apple View Comments Trending 1 Tech Nintendo can’t keep up with Switch demand, even using airplanes 2 Tech Even more Galaxy S8 problems are beginning to pop up 3 Tech The Galaxy Note 8 might fix everything that’s ‘wrong’ with the Galaxy S8 4 Tech The OnePlus 5’s camera will be fantastic if these leaked photos are real 5 Deals Amazon’s 15 best daily deals: Amazon Echo sale, Fitbits, Alexa smart plugs, Roku Ultra, and more Picked For You Nintendo can’t keep up with Switch demand, even using airplanes By Chris Smith May 1st at 11:03 PM Hubble just delivered one of the most gorgeous space photos ever By Mike Wehner April 30th at 3:00 PM Even more Galaxy S8 problems are beginning to pop up By Chris Smith May 1st at 7:45 AM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad Post to Cancel

Of course, I only buy wine as a gift and liquor as an ingredient for my amazing amaretto pound cake or other decadently delicious culinary concoctions. Which is to say that it would be fine with me if there were no big-box liquor stores in South Carolina What is not fine with me is our Legislature passing bad laws, constitutionally suspect laws, knee-jerk laws. And yes, I realize this is not a rare thing, but there are lessons here about the oft-confused distinction between bad court rulings and bad lawmaking. My gracious, I thought: I had no idea so many senators were held so tightly in the clutches of the liquor industry. Since forever, South Carolina limited liquor stores to three per owner, apparently worried that concentrating more stores in a few hands would lead to more advertising, more price cutting and, most important, more drinking. Perhaps that was true when it was hard to find a liquor store, but with one on practically every block — 75 in Richland County alone — it’s hard to believe that’s true today. So the limitation no longer holds water. Total Wine, with stores in Columbia, Charleston and Greenville, challenged the limit, and in March the state Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional economic protectionism. Independent liquor stores, facing the prospect of the same Wal-Mart-style competition that has driven other local businesses out of business, ran crying to the Legislature. Cindi Ross Scoppe It’s not clear that the court was constitutionally correct; Justice John Kittredge makes a strong case in his dissent that the majority used the wrong legal standard to reach its conclusion. But the case is decided, so the question now is what the Legislature ought to do. Or not do. I was in the Senate the day senators bobtailed onto the state budget their rescue-the-local- liquor-stores amendment: They created a “supplemental fee” equal to 100 percent of a company’s annual proceeds from one of its three existing stores if it opens a fourth. My gracious, I thought: I had no idea so many senators were held so tightly in the clutches of the liquor industry. The Senate declared its clearly confiscatory fee “necessary to fund additional law enforcement, regulatory measures, health care costs, and associated impacts on the health, safety, and welfare of the State’s residents resulting from the anticipated additional sales of liquor.” __________ Read the court order and the dissent SC Senate wants to reverse court’s liquor-store decision Read the Senate amendment, 109.12 __________ I understand the dangers of alcohol; I am a persistent proponent of tougher laws against drunken driving. But the Senate’s justification is ridiculous. Does anyone seriously believe that another really big store in a large-enough-to-support-it community is going to measurably increase consumption? Or increase crime? Or endanger the “health, safety, and welfare” of our citizens? Last week, the House replaced that ridiculous language, and the fee, with a more straight-forward gift to local liquor stores: It prohibits the Revenue Department from issuing a fourth license to anyone. I’d imagine there would be constitutional problems with ordering the state to ignore a Supreme Court order. As for the Senate’s fee? Well, I would hope the state would need something more than legislators’ pulled-from-thin-air justification to assert its constitutionality. But as Justice Kittredge pointed out, states have extraordinary leeway when it comes to liquor. (My favorite part of his opinion, quoting from an 1894 state Supreme Court order: “liquor, in its nature, is dangerous to the morals, good order, health, and safety of the people, and is not to be placed on the same footing with the ordinary commodities of life, such as corn, wheat, cotton, tobacco, potatoes, etc.” Tobacco, an ordinary commodity of life. My, how times have changed.) Liquor is dangerous and is not to be placed on the same footing with the ordinary commodities of life, such as corn, wheat, cotton, tobacco, potatoes, etc. 1894 SC Supreme Court order Constitutional or not, the three-store limit makes no sense. And a confiscatory tax on any industry is only good public policy if it actually protects someone other than the competition. Sen. Larry Grooms, who was joined by Sens. Katrina Shealy, Vincent Sheheen and John Scott in proposing the fee, said he wasn’t defending liquor stores but rather the sanctity of legislative power. “I’m not opposed to considering unlimited licenses,” he said, calling the three-store limit ridiculous. “But it’s also ridiculous for the courts to write the laws of the state.” The House and Senate still must decide which, if either, liquor-industry protection plan to put into the state budget, and then Gov. Henry McMaster will decide whether to veto it. Yes, it is. That doesn’t happen as often as critics suggest — as they do whenever a court strikes down a law they like. But it does happen. Justice Kittredge says it happened here, and he might be right. It certainly happened last year, when our Supreme Court said, essentially, “we don’t believe the Legislature intended for the law to say this, so we interpret it to mean something entirely different.” And so it gave a local prosecutor the authority previously reserved to the state attorney general to convene a State Grand Jury. In spite of being presented with contemporaneous evidence that the Legislature had every intention of doing precisely what the court found nonsensical. In spite of being presented with no evidence to the contrary. In the end, it’s frequently up to legislators to decide whether the effect of a court-written law is bad or good, and to leave it or reverse it. In the State Grand Jury case, Legislators didn’t even complain, much less write a new law to overturn or modify the court-written law. They should show similar restraint in this case.

 US consumer debt is piling up Wolf Richter, Wolf Street May 1, 2017, 5:18 PM 1,924 facebook linkedin twitter email print Occupy Wall Street demonstrators participating in a street-theater production wear signs around their neck representing their student debt during a protest against the rising national student debt in Union Square, in New York. Reuters/Andrew Burton American consumers are holding $1 trillion in revolving credit, mostly in credit card debt. So how well is this segment of consumer debt holding up? Synchrony Financial – GE’s spin-off that issues credit cards for Walmart and Amazon – disclosed on Friday that, despite assurances to the contrary just three months ago, net charge-off would rise to at least 5% this year. Its shares plunged 16% and are down 27% year-to-date. Credit-card specialist Capital One disclosed in its Q1 earnings report last week that provisions for credit losses rose to $2 billion, with net charge-offs jumping 28% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Synchrony, Capital One, and Discover – a gauge of how well over-indebted consumers are managing to hang on – have together increased their Q1 provisions for bad loans by 36% year-over-year. So this is happening. Other worries about consumer debt in the US are piling up. The $1.4 trillion in student loans are already in crisis, though the government backs them, and they cannot be charged off in bankruptcy. Mortgage debt is still hanging in there, given the surge in home prices that make defaults unlikely. But of the $1.1 trillion in auto loans, subprime loans packaged into asset backed securities are getting crushed by net charge-off rates that are worse than during the Financial Crisis. The US economy is fueled by credit. Americans turning themselves into debt slaves makes it tick. Take it away, and what little growth there is – nearly zero in the first quarter – will dissipate into ambient air altogether. So it’s time to take the pulse of our American debt slaves. In a new study, life insurer and financial services provider Northwestern Mutual found that 45% of Americans that have debt spend “up to half of their monthly income on debt repayment.” Those are the true debt slaves. Excluding mortgage debt, American carry an average debt of $37,000. Of them, 47% carry $25,000 or more, and more than 10% carry $100,000 or more in debt, excluding mortgage debt. Most of them expect to get out of debt before they die, but 14% expect to be in debt “for the rest of their lives.” This debt adds stress. About 40% said that debt has a “substantial” or “moderate” impact on their financial security; and about as many consider debt a “high” or “moderate” source of anxiety. Given the rising defaults, this is likely to get worse. And what changes would most positively affect their financial situations? The top two: earning more money (29%) and getting rid of debt (26%). Alas, those two, for many people, are precisely the most elusive factors in the current economy. But there is a lot of irony in how Americans look at debt. The study asked them what they would do with a $2,000 windfall: 40% said they’d pay down debt. And this is the irony: they’d pay down their maxed out credit cards, but a few months later, their credit cards would be maxed out again, and thus that $2,000 would be consumed. Because the money always has to get spent. It’s not like consumers don’t know this. According to the study, one quarter of Americans flagged “excessive/frivolous” spending as the financial pitfall they are prone to. And how are these debt slaves keeping the plates spinning? According to the study: 35% said they pay as much as they can on each of their debts each month. 19% said they pay off debts with the highest interest first and make minimum payments to others.” 18% (and 25% of Millennials) said they pay what I can when they can. 17% make minimum monthly payments to each creditor. The study didn’t say how many of them are beginning to fall behind on their debts. But that number is growing, as the soaring net charge-offs at Capital One, Synchrony, and Discover show. “One of the hardest challenges is resisting the urge to splurge on items that are beyond our budget,” explained Rebekah Barsch, VP of planning, Northwestern Mutual. “While giving into temptation can feel good in the short-term, it often contributes to an ongoing cycle of buy and borrow that can become hard to escape.” All the more so because buy-and-borrow has become the replacement American dream for a large number of people – with the corollary: if you can borrow more, you can buy more. But these debt slaves are a crucial driver of the economy. Spending money they don’t have on goods and services they cannot afford and may not need keeps the economy from sinking. If they ever started living within their means and paying off debt as they go, the economy would quickly reveal its true colors. This time, lousy consumer spending and the “weather” were blamed for the hobbling economy, even as inflation rose to the Fed’s target. Read the original article on Wolf Street. Copyright 2017.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Brands Take Stands: 13 Major Corporations Urge Support for Paris Agreement – The Minute SOURCE: 3BL Media, LLC DESCRIPTION: In the most recent example of brands taking stands, 13 major corporations have written to President Trump urging him to keep the US signed on to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The letter, organized by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, was signed by BP, DuPont, General Mills, Google, Intel, Microsoft, National Grid, Novartis Corporation, PG&E, Schneider Electric, Shell, Unilever and Walmart. Their reasoning is pretty clear: the bottom line. They argue that continued US participation “expands markets for innovative clean technologies, generating jobs and economic growth,” and note that U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in this area. Lack of U.S. participation, say the companies, could put “access to these growing markets at risk.’’ These companies have a combined market capitalization of nearly $2.5 trillion. If money talks, this latest example of the growing trend to take a stand on behalf of progressive business strategy practically shouts. I’m John Howell for 3BL Media.

WEST VALLEY CITY — A Tooele man who police say was knocking things off shelves just so he could watch an employee pick them up has been arrested for investigation of voyeurism. The man, 30, was at Wal-Mart, 3180 S. 5600 West, on Friday afternoon. He was observed "using a cellphone to capture images of a female employee's rear end as she bent over to pick up items that (he) knocked off the shelf," according to a Salt Lake County Jail report. He was arrested for investigation of voyeurism by electronic equipment. According to Wal-Mart security, the man has done the same thing to the same employee in the past, the report states. The man was convicted of voyeurism in 2007 in Tooele Justice Court, according to court records. A stalking injunction was filed against him in 2016 that forbids him from going into a Dollar Tree store in Tooele. Add a comment Like that? Read this.

The Commerce Department is expected to report the U.S. deficit on trade goods and services in March was about $44 billion, indicating the United States is on track for another trade gap in excess of $500 billion for 2017. For decades, the trade deficit has been a source of torment. Critics blame it for jobs losses, and apologists say it permits Americans to consume more and cheaper products without much harm. Both arguments have an element of truth but most importantly, the trade deficit must be financed. Foreign governments and private persons buy U.S. Treasuries, corporate stocks and bonds, and real estate in tony locations like Manhattan and Miami Beach, and we have to pay interest, dividends and rent on those assets that grow larger each year. Americans make similar investments abroad, but overall foreigners are buying more here. The U.S. net international investment position (NIIP) is now minus 45% of gross domestic product, and economists at the Peterson Institute estimate that deficit will increase to 53% in 2021. No nation has seen its position reach minus 60% without enduring a major financial crisis. Economists are inclined to believe bilateral deficits — or even deficits in particular commodities like oil — don’t matter but if one country or commodity is huge in the numbers then the global problem can’t be addressed without addressing the particular country or commodity. China accounts for more than 60% of the U.S. trade deficit and petroleum for more than a quarter of the rest. The Trump administration proposes to fix the China trade by applying pressure to open its markets — if Americans can sell more in China, then we can continue to enjoy cheap consumer goods at Wal-Mart. And by liberating the oil and gas sector from Obama-era regulations and continuing to build out wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. As for China, the president’s recent statement on trade policy indicates revved up use of trade remedy laws to keep out or at least penalize subsidized and dumped imports. For U.S. industries that benefit — hooray! — but Beijing advantages domestic producers in so many ways, from forced technology transfers from foreign investors to generous benefits for technology startups, that Trump’s strategy reminds me of the farmer chasing an infestation of grasshoppers with a butterfly net. The Peterson Institute suggests in a forthcoming study a program of currency-market intervention to offset foreign government intervention in currency markets and lower the value of the dollar BUXX, +0.00%  across the board. These days, manipulation by foreign governments is not the problem — but rather the lack of confidence in the durability of existing regimes. Marine Le Pen challenging the future of the European Union and China’s authoritarian regime are scaring investors and driving down the euro EURUSD, +0.1651%  and yuan USDCNH, -0.0348%  . At the Mar-a-Lago Summit, Presidents Trump and Xi announced a 100-day review of policies to address the trade deficit but that is as unlikely to yield results as were similar bilateral talks initiated by Presidents Bush or Obama. Warren Buffet, for many years, has suggested a system of import certificates and elsewhere, I have advocated a tax on the conversion of currency into yuan. The latter would essentially raise the price of imported goods and encourage reshoring. Under the Buffet plan, exporters would receive certificates to import goods in amounts equal to their foreign sales and in turn, those could be sold to importers, who would be required to present certificates to bring goods and services into the country. Those certificates would go to the highest bidders and hence be used to import goods that had the highest value to consumers. Rather than apply it to all our trading partners — and cause global outrage — I would just apply it to trade with China and endure its bellicosity as needed. Either Beijing finally starts realigning its economy to rely less on trade surpluses with the United States or this scheme would do it for them. No matter which tack chosen, Americans would pay more for toasters, T-shirts and TVs. However, that burden would pale by comparison to losses in jobs and living standards imposed by a debt crisis on the scale of that endured by other nations who left their problems to fester until international investors quit buying their bonds and other assets.

More than 230 people sought refuge from the storms Sunday night in 25 shelters across six states. There have been as many as 10 reported fatalities, although that figure is expected to rise. "This month is historically the peak month for tornadoes, so it's critical that people stay informed and get prepared," said Brad Kieserman, vice president of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "Our first priority is providing shelter, so that those affected have a safe place to stay. As more severe weather is expected for this coming weekend, the Red Cross will go where we're needed for as long as we're needed. When conditions improve, we will then help people in their first steps on the path to recovery." In Missouri, some communities were forced to evacuate due to rising rivers, and more evacuations could occur today. Red Cross disaster workers have opened numerous shelters where more than 130 people spent Sunday night. Flooding also hit central and southern Illinois, so the Red Cross is also helping in that area. The Red Cross also has shelters open in Arkansas, where the governor declared a state of emergency after residents in Sharp and Fulton counties were forced to leave their homes due to river flooding. In Oklahoma, Red Cross disaster workers opened shelters after the governor declared a state of emergency due to severe storms, flooding and snow affecting a large part of the state. Tornadoes ripped apart parts of Texas, where as many as 5,000 buildings may be affected. And in Kansas, a major snowstorm dumped more than a foot of snow. The Red Cross has shelters open in both states. Meanwhile, the Red Cross also responded to the shooting situation at an apartment complex in San Diego, California, providing housing and canteen services to almost 50 displaced individuals. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP  People should download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of tornadoes, flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters. The App also includes emergency first aid information and a Family Safe feature which allows people to instantly see if loved ones are okay.

Kelsie Schelling (Photo: Facebook) Kelsie Schelling has been missing since 2013. Schelling's mother, Laura Saxton, said her daughter disappeared shortly after she texted a photo of her eight-week ultrasound to her ex-boyfriend, Donthe Lucas. Schelling made the two-hour trip from Denver to Pueblo to meet Lucas, at his request. Schelling was last seen at the Wal-Mart store in the 4000 block of West Northern Avenue in Pueblo on Feb. 4, 2013. Lucas later withdrew $400 from an ATM using Schelling's card. He was also seen driving her vehicle to the Wal-Mart parking lot. In April, authorities started excavating the backyard of a Pueblo home where Lucas once lived. Investigators said they found evidence in the yard of the home in the 5100 block of Manor Ridge Drive. They wouldn't say what the evidence is, but said it was not a body. Lucas is considered a person of interest in the case but investigators have not called him a suspect. On Monday, the Pueblo Police Department said they were working with members of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to search an open field near Lucas's former home. A photo posted by the police department showed crews in the field with shovels and heavy machinery. Saxton believes her daughter is dead and that Lucas is responsible.   Related stories Evidence found in yard of home linked to missing Denver woman Ex-boyfriend’s former home searched in 2013 disappearance of pregnant Denver woman Colorado woman sent boyfriend an ultrasound photo — and then she vanished Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email Popular Craigslist scammer to homeowner: ‘I’m just trying to make a few bucks, you know?’ Boy could face charges for jumping into Bass Pro Shops fish tank Delta pilot punches female passenger in fight at Atlanta airport One killed, one injured in Aurora shooting Latest News Wheat Ridge Team wins at Eco Marathon Oil and gas company’s initial tests of wells find no leaks PHOTOS: Masego, Moods, Kamau and Fast4ward play the Bluebird Theater New barrier along Cherry Creek bike path creating concerns for homeless News Ex-boyfriend’s former home searched in 2013 disappearance of pregnant Denver woman News Evidence found in yard of home linked to missing Denver woman News Families rally at Capitol on Colorado Missing Persons Day Trending French police find chilling clues after family’s disappearance News Landfill search for missing Charlene Voight ends after 4 months News Woman’s body found in grassy area near Lakewood Wal-Mart store News Police: Ashley Mead’s body parts might have been left in several areas, suitcase News Thieves take Wal-Mart employee’s keys, drive off in vehicle with purse News Missing Boulder child found; remains in Oklahoma dumpster might those of mother News Man accused of planting explosives in downtown Denver hotel pleads not guilty National/World News ‘He’s a monster:’ Man sentenced in ‘horrific’ kidnapping, sex assault of 2-year-old National/World News Tipster reveals how Tennessee teacher Tad Cummins covered up identity News Suspect in deaths of El Paso County teens arrested 3 weeks earlier in violent attack Mobile Apps iPhone: KDVR & KWGN App Android: KDVR & KWGN App iPhone: Pinpoint Weather App Android: Pinpoint Weather App Facebook Twitter Instagram snapchat Snapchat Email Alerts About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers KDVR Online Public File • KWGN Online Public File • EEO Report • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 100 East Speer Blvd. Denver, Colorado 80203 • Copyright © 2017, KDVR • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

If you were on Android, it was a pretty cool service where, by using the Amazon app, there was a wide variety of games that could be had for no cost to you...ever. Paid games were free, and free-to-play games included some premium currency for you to play without ever paying. The whole thing was kind of like digging through the $5 DVD bin at Walmart. You're digging through a lot of unrelated, uninteresting to you stuff to find the gems, but there are some real gems in there if you dig. Developers got paid based on time spent in the app, and I'm sure Amazon got a bunch of analytics data and found a way to draw non-Fire users to their app, which isn't on Google Play, and developers got paid for their library content. But I guess either the program wasn't driving enough people to the Amazon app, or it wasn't making financial sense for neither Amazon nor developers, so Underground is going away. New app submissions are closing on May 31st for Amazon Underground Actually Free, though updates can be made until 2019. Users will lose access to the Actually Free store in the summer, though those apps will still work. Check Out a Couple Gorgeous New 'Into the Rift' Animations 'Artificial Superintelligence' is the First Game from the Makers of the Hilarious 'CARROT' Apps, Coming May 11th http://wizodd.tumblr.com Wizard of Odyssey Do Android developers keep the Amazon Underground versions of their apps up to date? That ecosystem always seemed like it had a great start, but wasn't curated/cared very well ... many app reviews seem to imply that their software was abandoned. That is certainly the case with Humble Bundle mobile apps. As much as we hate the way iOS breaks old games with each update, at least Apple is trying to force developers to commit to some degree of long-term support. The Kindle Fire hardware is so cheap, though "good enough," but without care and feeding of the app ecosystem, it's not very compelling. YankeeBlue000 That sux. I also own a Kindle Fire HDX, & Fire TV, along with my Ipad. It was a pretty cool service to have for those devices. Although I always had a feeling that at anytime it would soon end because of poor game sales. lifeat78 That's too bad. My kids have Kindle Fires, and there have been some pretty good games available through that system. It's certainly saved me some money. korossyl If you've never heard of "Underground Actually Free," this headline is really confusing.

By Doug HarlowStaff Writer Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-612-2367 Share Comment Read Article SKOWHEGAN — A local man who allegedly used a doctor’s scalpel to slash another man he said had used racial slurs against him has been indicted by a Somerset County grand jury. Charles Adam Fairley, 33, of North Avenue, Skowhegan, is charged by the grand jury with aggravated assault, a Class B felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Police at the time said Fairley lives in an apartment with his girlfriend. He said the girlfriend’s daughter lives upstairs in the same building with her boyfriend. When the alleged victim and his girlfriend arrived at the apartment house April 12, he “started taunting Charles by yelling out the ‘N’ word multiple times,” interim Skowhegan police Chief Joel Cummings said. Fairley came out to confront the 23-year-old man, and they argued in front of the apartment house. Charles Adam Fairley “Charles made a swiping motion to the victim with a concealed scalpel,” Cummings said. “He swiped at his neck.” A friend of Fairley later said the racial taunting could be considered a hate crime and they will be talking to a lawyer about possible charges there. An indictment is not a determination of guilt, but it indicates that there is enough evidence to proceed with formal charges and a trial. Also indicted by the grand jury on Friday was Buddy S. Burton Jr., 36, of Augusta charged in connection with a high-speed highway chase April 5 from the Palmyra Wal-Mart that ended in a crash on Interstate 95 just past a Waterville exit. Burton is charged by the grand jury with two counts of felony theft, eluding a police officer, passing a police roadblock, operating after suspension and criminal speed. Burton drove in excess of 100 mph at times and avoided the first set of tire deflation spikes set out by state police on the interstate. When he hit the second set, the tires on the left side of the Jeep began to deflate and he started to lose control of his vehicle, police said. Burton went off the road around mile 133 and into the ditch on the right side of the interstate. The grand jury also handed down indictments on Eric J. Horan, 36, of Brunswick, on charges that he sexually assaulted a teenage girl in Madison, then fled the area to avoid prosecution. He allegedly sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl Dec. 29, but the crime was not reported until Jan. 5. He is charged with unlawful sexual contact, a felony; unlawful sexual touching; and with sexual abuse of a minor. An indictment is not a finding of guilt, but is an indication that enough evidence is present in a case to proceed with trial. Also indicted by the grand jury were the following people: • Eric M. McCarthy, 33, of St. Albans, charged with two counts of felony drug trafficking, two counts of possession of drugs, illegal possession of hypodermic needles and with criminal forfeiture, all Feb. 4 in St. Albans. • Brandy L. Boutilier, 28, of Harmony, charged with felony drug trafficking, felony possession of drugs, illegal possession of hypodermic needles and with criminal forfeiture, all Feb. 4 in St. Albans. • Michael Allen Tayse, 40, of Anson, charged with felony domestic violence assault, criminal operating under the influence, operating without a license and disorderly conduct, all April 15 in Norridgewock. • Matthew M. Almeida, 31, of Clinton, charged with two counts of Class A felony robbery, Class B felony aggravated assault, Class C felony stealing drugs and misdemeanor stealing drugs in a home invasion robbery in Palmyra Jan. 28. • Zachary Ryan Haines, 25, of New Portland, charged with Class B felony aggravated assault and Class C assault April 20 in New Portland and with felony Class C domestic violence assault April 9 in New Portland. • David Burrill, 23, of Lee, charged with domestic violence assault on a child less than 6 years old May 13 in Bingham. • Lee J. Wurzel Jr., 32, of Skowhegan, charged with Class C felony theft Oct. 1 in Canaan. • Jacob Hemingway, 27, of Skowhegan, charged with Class B felony drug trafficking and with possession of drugs March 2 in Skowhegan. • Dustin Randall French, 27, a transient, charged with Class C felony assault and criminal trespass Sept. 8 in Skowhegan. • Michael Hardy, 42, of North Carolina, charged with two counts of Class A arson and Class C conspiracy to commit burglary July 22 in Harmony. • Lisa Woodard, 45, of Dexter, charged with two counts of Class A arson and Class C conspiracy to commit burglary July 22 in Harmony.

Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell got no bonus and saw his pay cut by one-third after a year marred by disappointing sales, customer defections and executive departures. Cornell’s compensation declined 33 percent last year to $11.3 million, most of which came from stock awards valued at $9.65 million, according to a proxy statement filed Monday. The company said management fell “well short” of sales and profit targets. Brian Cornell Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg Cornell has grappled with the aftermath of a poor holiday season, when customers increasingly chose to shop at rivals like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or online through Amazon.com Inc. Target’s heads of marketing, digital, grocery and innovation have all left during the past year. To cope with the slowdown, Cornell is reducing prices, refurbishing stores and introducing new brands in areas like apparel. The plan hasn’t appeased investors, who have pushed the shares down 23 percent this year. While Cornell’s pay declined in each of the past two years, rival Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon earned $22.4 million in 2016, up 13 percent from the previous year. Wal-Mart has posted 10 consecutive quarters of positive U.S. same-store sales. Cornell’s performance-based equity awards pay out over three years and are based on hitting stock price targets and other financial goals. Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith and operations chief John Mulligan did receive cash bonuses because they were based on a broader set of measures including website performance and growth in key categories like baby and wellness. Mark Tritton, the Minneapolis-based company’s new head of merchandising, received $5.2 million in total compensation, including a $500,000 sign-on bonus.

The Cupertino company is likely to reveal it has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars – an amount that is double its cash pile from just four and a half years ago. The firm has been able to avoid US corporate taxes by keeping nearly 93 percent of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents and securities off shore – a route many major companies have taken. Scroll down for video  Apple is set to report its quarterly financial results on Tuesday, which is expected to greater than the foreign cash reserves of the UK and Canada combined. Firm is said to have topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, which is double its cash pile from just four and a half years ago Not only will Appel's results show a total of cash that is greater than two countries, but it is also said to exceed the market values of Wal-Mart Stores In and Procter & Gamble Co., Tripp Mickle reported with The Wall Street Journal, who also noted that the results exclude any and all Apple's debt. Apple cash and cash equivalents are dispersed throughout both' short- and long-term securities, including corporate securities, U.S. Treasury securities and money-market funds,' Mickle explained.

Share this article Share 313 shares Apple, among many other major corporations, keep a majority of their funds in other countries in order to avoid paying the 35 percent US corporate-income-tax rate. However, last week the Trump administration unveiled plans to dramatically cut taxes for US businesses and individuals, slashing the corporate rate to 15 percent, but the once-in-a-generation overhaul is headed for a tough fight in Congress. And The Wall Street Journal noted that if the plan were to go through, it would allow Apple to use their money wisely 'through acquisitions or by sending more to shareholders'. Apple CEO Tim Cook (pictured) is not opposed to bringing more cash to the US if the changes allow it and CFO, Luca Maestri, also explained that the changes 'would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns' Apple CEO Tim Cook is not opposed to bringing more cash to the US if the changes allow it and CFO, Luca Maestri, also explained that the changes 'would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns'. 'What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions,' Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January.  Last year, the tech giant was named as the biggest corporate tax avoider in the United States after booking $218.55 billion (£171.6 billion) of profit offshore last year. TRUMP'S MAJOR TAX CUTS  Slashing taxes on income and business was a key part of Trump's election platform. Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest.  Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. The plan's signature reform would be a dramatic reduction of the corporate tax rate, from the current 35 percent to 15 percent. Tax brackets for individuals would be compressed from seven to just three -- 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, lower than the current top rate of 39.6 percent. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs.  The tech giant was able to save $65.08 billion (£51.1 billion) that it should have paid in tax thanks to its convoluted arrangements. The report revealed that last year three quarters of the Fortune 500 companies use subsidiaries in offshore tax havens where they sent a total of $2.42 trillion (£1.9 trillion) of income. In the US alone this amounted to $715.62 billion (£561.9 billion) in tax which they avoided paying. The report said many of the biggest companies in the world use a foreign office to 'disguise' their profits as coming from another country even if they are not.    Read more: Apple’s Cash Hoard Set to Top $250 Billion - WSJ Share or comment on this article e-mail 313 shares Most watched News videos Shocking footage shows aftermath of severe turbulence on Bangkok flight Incredible rescue of baby from capsized truck captured on video Awkward moment woman rejects marriage proposal at Fenway Moment car accident causes gas tanker to explode in Ohio Woman pops cyst with 16 gauge screwdriver and pushes out fluid Theresa May's embarrassingly quiet day of door-knocking in Scotland Excitable toddler performs his own version of the Haka dance Moment shooter opens fire at black pool party guests Baby elephant tossed around after getting in the way of a bull Kelly Ripa reveals Ryan Seacrest as her new co-host Canadian crowd sing entire Star-Spangled Banner when mic fails Terrifying moment tyre explodes into air and destroys car The flight from Hell: Horrific turbulence leaves 27...

Joe Mullin - May 1, 2017 7:13 pm UTC Enlarge TorrentFreak reader comments 95 Share this story At this point, the most common ways to get illegal digital content are no secret. There's peer-to-peer downloading, "cyberlocker"-type sites, and unauthorized streaming sites that demand to put sketchy software on your computer. But what if you could download Hollywood flicks to a USB drive at a convenient kiosk for just a few cents each? And do so while shopping at your local mall? This sounds like a dream of convenient and cheap entertainment, but it's just one more piracy nightmare for the entertainment industry. Enlarge TorrentFreakRemarkably, there appears to be just such a machine in Ethiopia, according to a report out this weekend on the TorrentFreak website. The bright yellow kiosk, at right, was spotted by a TorrentFreak reader at an Ethiopian "All Mart," described as Ethiopia's equivalent of a Walmart. "Basically, you go to this very big store, and you approach the machine, and you plug in a USB drive," the anonymous reader, who provided photos, told TorrentFreak. "The screen will turn on, and it will let you browse through a massive archive of movies." The ATM-style machine has a monitor where customers can pick out a movie and a USB port that the movie can be downloaded onto after payment. Feature movies cost between three and five Ethiopian birr, which is between 13 and 22 US cents. Prices depend on the movie's release date, with older movies oddly costing more. Single songs are available for 13 cents, as are TV show episodes. The project appears to be about a year old. Escape Computing, the company behind the kiosks, has a Facebook page that advertised an "urgent vacancy" for a Sales Associate position back in May 2016. The company is based in Addis Ababa, the capital and largest city of Ethiopia. Addis Insight, an Ethiopia-based news website, reported on the company in July 2016. "Apparently, the maintenance guy torrents all day and stores the data on his drive—the drive shown by the SwiftMedia monitor," reports TorrentFreak's Ethiopian source. "This would not have been a big deal as this is Ethiopia, and the allegedly democratic government has bigger issues." TorrentFreak contacted Escape Computing but didn't hear back. Since the company was hiring for various positions throughout the East African country, one can assume the SwiftMedia model is in several cities. The machine is an interesting glimpse into the innovative and incredibly brazen methods of piracy that can flourish in a country that's not strongly connected to international systems of policing. Promoted Comments ZhanMing057 Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post Many moons ago I worked part time in a small audio equipment shop in Beijing. We had a gigantic, multi-terabyte library of torrented music (this was the early 2000's). One of our services was to load hard drives that customers brought in with music, for a small fee. Because people usually didn't have that much disk space, they'd come in from time to time for new music. It was surprisingly good business, in the days when most of Beijing was still in the process of migrating to fiber. I recall that we made about as much from the hard drive refills as we did from selling headphones. 1090 posts | registered 1/28/2013 Joe Mullin Joe has covered the intersection of law and technology, including the world's biggest copyright and patent battles, since 2007.

Officials made that very clear during a news conference Monday. Randolph County Judge David Jansen said during the news conference, "We have some that won't move. I hope that everybody takes this serious. Get out while you can." He added that "our number one priority is no loss of life." Arkansas Highway 67/62 between Pocahontas and Corning is closing. City and county officials anticipate the water to come across the highway near McDonald's and Walmart in Pocahontas by Tuesday afternoon. Those floodwaters could top off at 28.5 to 29 feet as the Army Corps of Engineers continues to monitor the levee. "We're going to lose the levee, folks," Jansen said. "National Weather Service said the crest may change. They won't go down, but they may go up." Pocahontas Mayor Kary Story says the evacuations are for businesses as well. He says all residents and business owners have until 8 a.m. Tuesday to evacuate. Over 150 homes in the Robil Addition are to be evacuated. The area was hit hard by flooding just six years ago. Officials are preparing shelters for those displaced at the old Randolph County Nursing Home, 1405 Hospital. Dr. Should there be any overflow, those residents will be housed at the Pocahontas Community Center, 300 Geneva Dr. Jansen said those needing sandbags can come to the road department on Highway 115 to get them. Over 17,000 were made Monday morning. "We learn every time we have a disaster. We've had our share. We'll get through this," Jansen said. Region 8 News will have more information as details emerge.

Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business — especially on smartphones.   (Michael Short / Bloomberg)   By Alex WebbBloomberg Mon., May 1, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO—Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. posted results last week that extended their dominance of how we shop and search online. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. will in the coming days add evidence that tech behemoths command an ever-widening share of consumer time and spending. Amazon’s revenue soared as shoppers favoured it over brick-and-mortar stores, while Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business — especially on smartphones. “Each has built unique moats that allow them to continue to dominate,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. “For Google, no one can catch them on search because of the technology and intellectual property. For Amazon, scale is their friend and no one can compete on selection, price and fulfilment capabilities.” Read more: Amazon wants Cheerios, Oreos and other brands to bypass Wal-Mart Article Continued Below The companies have vast networks of complementary products that feed off one another to generate more sales, making it ever harder for competitors to keep up. “Given the strength of Google and Amazon, we think Facebook is likely to look similar,” Schachter said. On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to report first-quarter profit of $2.57 billion (U.S.), up 70 per cent from a year earlier, while revenue climbs 45 per cent to $7.82 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. When Apple reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sales are expected to climb 5 per cent to $53 billion. Revenue from the App Store and other services such as Apple Music will likely jump 20 per cent to $7.2 billion, according to UBS analyst Steven Milunovich. “The general theme that the big are getting bigger” applies to Apple’s self-feeding ecosystem, Schachter said. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys apps and other services, feeding data such as photos and contacts into the device, making it harder to swap for a competitor’s device. Higher margin service revenue then feeds back into Apple’s development budget, helping it build more advanced products to sell to the same consumer. Google’s advertising business is very different, but has similar self-feeding qualities. The company got 97 per cent of mobile paid search clicks in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017, according to client data from digital marketing firm Merkle Inc. That was up from 82 per cent in the same period in 2014. With more searches, Google gets more ad dollars to reinvest to keep its search engine ahead of the competition — mostly represented by Microsoft Corp.’s Bing. Google also gets more data on what results people click on, which can be used to improve its software even more, and keep people coming back to find information. “There are clear benefits to that scale,” Mark Ballard, senior director of research at Merkle, said. “There’s that feedback loop.” For advertisers, Google’s large online audience makes it one of the first places to go to run online marketing campaigns. The other is Facebook. Merkle client spending on Facebook ads was up 71 per cent in the first quarter, from a year earlier. These advertisers get about 70 per cent of their online traffic from Facebook and that hasn’t changed in recent years despite the rise of competitors like Snap Inc., Ballard noted. Facebook and Google captured 77 per cent of U.S. digital ad spending last year, up from 72 per cent in 2015, according to a recent analysis of data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau by Pivotal Research Group. For advertisers, it’s “easier to concentrate budgets with a smaller number of players. It’s easier to manage,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. Marketers have long griped about the “duopoly” atop digital advertising. But they keep giving Google and Facebook money. That’s largely because few other places offer wide reach, channels for targeting consumers and better returns. Those advantages only multiply as the tech companies expand. Verizon Communications Inc.’s new Oath ad business “may figure out a special sauce, but they will never be the first port of call,” Wieser said. When Google and Facebook get those calls first, they see what advertisers plan to spend elsewhere and can sell them other services and tools, according to the analyst. Advertisers disagree about what company could offer a viable third alternative. Some suggest another internet titan: Amazon. The largest online retailer isn’t a leading digital advertising destination yet, but on its earnings call last week, chief financial officer Brian Oslavsky reported “consistent growth” from that business. Research firm EMarketer expects the company to generate more display ad revenue than Twitter Inc. by next year. Even so, most of Amazon’s first-quarter revenue gains came from grabbing retail market share as more people shop online, rather than in stores. That shift is fuelling a record pace of retailer bankruptcies this year, despite a growing U.S. economy and solid consumer spending. What began with bookstores, movie rental outlets and electronics retailers like Borders, Blockbuster and Circuit City, is spreading to apparel and sporting goods chains like Aeropostale Inc. and Sports Authority Holdings Inc. Once online spending in a category passes 20 per cent, it’s tough for brick-and-mortar retailers to survive and easy for Amazon to gobble up market share, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive officer of Boomerang Commerce Inc., which designs software for large retailers. Amazon has been disciplined about only pursuing retail categories that are already shifting online, giving it momentum against competitors playing defence, he said, adding that more apparel bankruptcies will come in the next two years. Like Google, which has introduced the Pixel smartphone to help secure its direct relationship with consumers, Amazon has introduced the Echo smart speaker to encourage customers to buy services and products from its website. The software makers are expanding into hardware to feed their money machines.

Skip to content comics games Submit tip Contact CGC Insider Search for: Here Are All Of The Spider-Man: Homecoming Funko Store Exclusives…Must Own The Peter And Spidey Two Pack Posted by Jeremy Konrad May 1, 2017 Comment Well, we knew this was coming. Funko has announced their store exclusives for the Spider-Man: Homecoming line of figures. Gamestop gets two exclusives, with a Tony Stark Dorbz figure and a green glow version of The Vulture. Hot Topic is getting the unmasked Spider-Man pop (which i can confirm is hitting stores right now as I bought one a half hour ago). Walmart Gets what is my favorite of these: an unmasked version of Peter in the homemade suit. I don’t know what it is about the look of that suit but I love it. There will also be two exclusive Pop two-packs. One will be at Target and will include Iron Man in his Mark XLVII suit and Spider-man in his regular suit and crouching pose. The other will surprisingly be exclusive to Best Buy and will feature Peter Parker and Spider-Man together. That one is sure to be popular as well, who doesn’t want a two-pack that features Peter and Spidey together? Best Buy is an odd choice, as most of their exclusives previously have mostly been video game related, they must have been pretty successful. Between them and the announced Cars 3 exclusive going to Meijer stores in the Midwest, collectors are going to have a lot of added stops in their Pop hunts. I assume these are going to sell like crazy, so hopefully we get more Homecoming Pops after the film is out. As I said, I found the Hot topic one along with all of the regular releases today, so look for all of these to be on shelves anytime now.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple has how much cash? By Levi Sumagaysay / May 1, 2017 at 10:33 AM It’s been a whole six months since Apple reported a record cash hoard. Now the company is expected to report Tuesday that the pile has grown even larger — to more than $250 billion. That’s higher than the market value of humongous companies such as Wal-Mart, and nearly equivalent to that of General Electric. That would also mean the iPhone maker would have doubled its cash pile in about 4 1/2 years, the Wall Street Journal reports. Apple is scheduled to report second-quarter results Tuesday, and to give an update about the company’s massive cash hoard. Talk about how much cash Apple has usually fuels speculation about possible acquisition targets. The names thrown around have included Disney and Twitter; now some analysts are mentioning Tesla and Netflix. Also, how much money Apple holds overseas always makes for interesting water-cooler talk: In October, CFO Luca Maestri said 91 percent of the company’s $237.6 billion hoard was parked outside the United States. That number is likely to be more closely watched than ever after President Donald Trump’s promise to entice companies to repatriate their cash with a lower tax rate and CEO Tim Cook’s plans — which he mentioned in the fall — to bring “billions” back to the United States this year. Analysts expect Apple to report earnings of $2.02 a share, up 6.3 percent from the year-ago quarter. Their estimates about how many iPhones the company sold are all over the place, with the most optimistic pegging the sales to have grown about 4 percent. Apple shares are up about 2 percent today to $146.51 and are trading at a record high. They are up more than 50 percent since last May as investors seem to be feeling optimistic about what the company has up its sleeve for the iPhone’s 10th anniversary in September. (Bloomberg has reported that Apple will unveil upgraded versions of the current models, as well as an iPhone with a redesigned look.) That’s different from the sentiment about Apple a year ago, when iPhone sales were slowing. In fact, in the newly published Mercury News’ special report on Silicon Valley’s top 150 public companies by revenue, Apple actually dragged the SV150 down because its 2016 sales and profit fell from the year before. But now, “everyone expects Apple to cure cancer with their next product launch,” Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, told the New York Times.   Photo: An Apple store in Hangzhou, in the Zhejiang Province of China, in 2016.

Tornadoes News provided by American Red Cross 01 May, 2017, 13:20 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross is on the ground across six states, helping people affected by record severe storms, flooding and tornadoes which hit the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley regions. More than 230 people sought refuge from the storms Sunday night in 25 shelters across six states. There have been as many as 10 reported fatalities, although that figure is expected to rise. "This month is historically the peak month for tornadoes, so it's critical that people stay informed and get prepared," said Brad Kieserman, vice president of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "Our first priority is providing shelter, so that those affected have a safe place to stay. As more severe weather is expected for this coming weekend, the Red Cross will go where we're needed for as long as we're needed. When conditions improve, we will then help people in their first steps on the path to recovery." American Red Cross volunteer Bailey Moir surveys the damage in her hometown of Canton, TX after tornadoes swept through this past weekend. Moir watches as people sort through their belongings in the rubble, knowing she is headed next to help her father do the same at his home nearby. In Missouri, some communities were forced to evacuate due to rising rivers, and more evacuations could occur today. Red Cross disaster workers have opened numerous shelters where more than 130 people spent Sunday night. Flooding also hit central and southern Illinois, so the Red Cross is also helping in that area. The Red Cross also has shelters open in Arkansas, where the governor declared a state of emergency after residents in Sharp and Fulton counties were forced to leave their homes due to river flooding. In Oklahoma, Red Cross disaster workers opened shelters after the governor declared a state of emergency due to severe storms, flooding and snow affecting a large part of the state. Tornadoes ripped apart parts of Texas, where as many as 5,000 buildings may be affected. And in Kansas, a major snowstorm dumped more than a foot of snow. The Red Cross has shelters open in both states. Meanwhile, the Red Cross also responded to the shooting situation at an apartment complex in San Diego, California, providing housing and canteen services to almost 50 displaced individuals. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP People should download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of tornadoes, flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters. The App also includes emergency first aid information and a Family Safe feature which allows people to instantly see if loved ones are okay.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Red Cross Responds to Deadly Severe Weather Across Six States WASHINGTON, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — The American Red Cross is on the ground across six states, helping people affected by record severe storms, flooding and tornadoes which hit the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley regions. More than 230 people sought refuge from the storms Sunday night in 25 shelters across six states. There have been as many as 10 reported fatalities, although that figure is expected to rise. „This month is historically the peak month for tornadoes, so it’s critical that people stay informed and get prepared,” said Brad Kieserman, vice president of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. „Our first priority is providing shelter, so that those affected have a safe place to stay. As more severe weather is expected for this coming weekend, the Red Cross will go where we’re needed for as long as we’re needed. When conditions improve, we will then help people in their first steps on the path to recovery.” American Red Cross volunteer Bailey Moir surveys the damage in her hometown of Canton, TX after tornadoes swept through this past weekend. Moir watches as people sort through their belongings in the rubble, knowing she is headed next to help her father do the same at his home nearby. In Missouri, some communities were forced to evacuate due to rising rivers, and more evacuations could occur today. Red Cross disaster workers have opened numerous shelters where more than 130 people spent Sunday night. Flooding also hit central and southern Illinois, so the Red Cross is also helping in that area. The Red Cross also has shelters open in Arkansas, where the governor declared a state of emergency after residents in Sharp and Fulton counties were forced to leave their homes due to river flooding. In Oklahoma, Red Cross disaster workers opened shelters after the governor declared a state of emergency due to severe storms, flooding and snow affecting a large part of the state. Tornadoes ripped apart parts of Texas, where as many as 5,000 buildings may be affected. And in Kansas, a major snowstorm dumped more than a foot of snow. The Red Cross has shelters open in both states. Meanwhile, the Red Cross also responded to the shooting situation at an apartment complex in San Diego, California, providing housing and canteen services to almost 50 displaced individuals. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP People should download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of tornadoes, flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters. The App also includes emergency first aid information and a Family Safe feature which allows people to instantly see if loved ones are okay. The free Emergency App is available in app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.

You're out of luck Dad's chocolate chip cookies were discontinued due to poor sales. CTVNews.ca Staff Published Monday, May 1, 2017 1:20PM EDT If you’ve been scanning grocery store shelves looking for that elusive box of Dad’s chocolate chip cookies, we’ve got some bad news. The chocolate chip cookies were discontinued late last year. And even though the company’s online product locator may have told you the cookies can be found at your nearest Wal-Mart or Costco, the treat is no longer available in Canada. “They were discontinued simply because they were not a good seller,” Stephanie Cass of Mondelez Canada, the company that owns Dad’s brand, told CTVNews.ca in a telephone interview on Monday. Cass said Dad’s chocolate chip cookies were the “poorest performer” among the brand’s cookie varieties, which also include the much more popular oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. But that doesn’t mean that the plain chocolate chip variety didn’t have a loyal following. On social media, Mondelez Canada and the U.S.-based parent company Mondelez International have been inundated with messages from disappointed cookie fans.  Some customers were angry because, in many instances, the Mondelez social media team replied that the cookies were still available and directed people to use the online product locator that indicates the cookies can be purchased at a number of different locations. But Cass said that was a mistake because the company’s customer relations team did not realize the product had been discontinued. The company is now updating its online information to address the issue, she said. “We apologize for that. It was never intentional.” The demise of Dad’s chocolate chip cookies didn’t come as a surprise to everyone. Hot take: I've always hated those Dad's cookies. Awful. — Rob Freeman (@robfreemanYYJ) May 1, 2017 All those people who are sad that Dad's chocolate chip cookies are being discontinued should have probably bought them once in a while. — Aaron H.M. ������ (@AaronHM) April 30, 2017 Report Error MOST WATCHED false CTV National News for Monday, May 1, 2017 Air Date: May 1, 2017 false Taxpayers on the hook for Trump Whistler visit?

Drivers get a hint of things to come on Shaver Road where a new water main along with bike lane and other work are planned this spring and summer.Tom Haroldson/Special to MLive  If the weather cooperates, construction will begin today on Shaver Road from Vanderbilt Avenue to West Centre Avenue. The construction involves a water main replacement, new water services and new asphalt milling and resurfacing. During construction, traffic will be shifted and reduced to one lane in each southbound and northbound lane. Motorists are advised to be alert while traveling in the construction area. Access to driveways and businesses, such as Wal-Mart and Meijer's, will be maintained on Shaver Road throughout the construction period. The project is anticipated to be completed by Aug. 19. Traffic and construction updates will be made through the PortageAlert System. To sign up for PortageAlert, visit www.portagemi.gov, follow the links to the PortageAlert portal, sign up and subscribe to the "Shaver Road Reconstruction 2017" subscription, then click "Save." For more information on the project, call the Department of Transportation & Utilities at 329-4422. The Shaver Road work is one of three big ones for Portage this season. Coming up later will be Portage Road, between Mandigo and Osterhout avenues, that includes drainage improvements, bike lane construction and a sidewalk extension on the east side from Mandigo to Osterhout Avenue. Portage Road is also slated for a reconstruction and redesign from Lakeview Park north. The project involves a "road diet" proposal to reduce Portage Road from five to three lanes from Ames Drive to Lakeview Drive and from four to three lanes from Lakeview Drive to East Osterhout Avenue. A "road diet" is considered when an area might want to reduce vehicle speeds, allow for bike lanes or sidewalks for better safety for bicyclists and pedestrians and to help improve the streetscape or redevelopment.

The woman said the purse was bought at a Wal-Mart. After she found the note, written in Chinese, the woman had the note translated three times to be certain it was correct. The note's author said he or she is a prisoner in China, and forced to work about 14 hours a day with little food or medical attention. Similar letters to the one the Sierra Vista woman had translated have been traced back to stores such as K-Mart in the past. The woman said she doesn't have the means to help the prisoner, but hopes something comes out of sharing the note. KTVK TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The company’s cash pile continues to grow at a substantial pace. According to a new report, Apple’s cash pile has surged to over $250 billion. That’s a quarter of a trillion dollars. This is an enviable cash pile that’s almost unheard of, it’s greater than the foreign currency reserves of many countries combined. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is going to confirm the figure in its quarterly earnings release today. It will confirm that it’s sitting on cash reserves of more than $250 billion. That’s more than the market value of both Walmart and FMCG giant Procter & Gamble put together. It’s even greater than the foreign currency reserves held by the United Kingdom and Canada combined. It’s a safe assumption that Apple’s cash pile has crossed $250 billion because the last confirmed figure from Apple put it at $246.09 billion in December last year. It was racking up cash at a rate of $3.6 million an hour in the final three months of 2016. Apple has already been under increasing pressure from shareholders to spend some of the cash it’s hoarding to further increase shareholder value. There are many ways it can do that one of which includes a special dividend. Apple can also use the money that it has to buy companies, no wonder there are rumors of Apple considering an acquisition of Tesla or Netflix. Given the amount of money it has, Apple can buy both companies and still be left with cash in the bank. It may even have to face mounting pressure to bring back some of that cash to the United States, considering that more than 90 percent of that $250 billion is held outside the United States.

General Electric and IBM round out the top five, CNBC reported. Apple's stockpile of cash reportedly has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled hoard that is greater than the market value of either Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined, The Wall Street Journal reported. Apple's money, more than 90% of which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and granting a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home, WSJ.com reported. "Those policies could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to dole out more money to shareholders or make splashy acquisitions," the WSJ explained. Meanwhile, CNBC reported that at 35 percent, the U.S. corporate tax rate is the highest in the world. That's caused many multinationals to keep their overseas earnings abroad in tax shelter countries like Ireland and Luxembourg. However, approval of the broader plan that entails the tax holiday is unlikely, according to Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist for Capital Economics. "With the deep cuts to individual income and corporate tax rates estimated to increase the federal budget deficit by $7 trillion over a decade," he wrote, CNBC reported, "there is next to no chance of the plan ever being approved by Congress in its current form." The main obstacles for the Trump tax plan are Senate rules. While reconciliation bills need only a majority in the Senate, they cannot increase the deficit beyond a 10-year horizon, which the tax plan is estimated to do. The alternative is to garner 60 votes in the Senate and be signed into permanent law. "The chances of the latter happening are close to zero," Hunter wrote. Meanwhile, many other respected economic voices are predicting robust growth and additional stock-market gains amid Trump's blueprint to truly "Make America Great Again." David Horowitz, author of the best-selling book "Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America," told Newsmax TV that the market rally since Republican Donald Trump won the election has more room for gains as the president pushes his pro-business agenda. “There's more upside. Starting from when he was president-elect he started this stock market boom,” he told Newsmax TV's “The Income Generation Show.” “There will be corrections. There are going to be setbacks along the way like the healthcare which they hurried too fast. If you're looking over the long term of this administration I think the stock market is going to love Trump,” Horowitz said. Other respected economic gurus agree. Trump has a victory coming, "a home run," with his tax-reform plan announced this week, but expect some "back and forth" debate as with healthcare, economic pundit and Trump campaign adviser Larry Kudlow said Sunday, per The Hill. "I can't think of anything better for business, better for wage earners, better for economic growth than Trump's 15 percent tax cut plan," Kudlow told "The Cats Roundtable" on 970 AM-N.Y. "I think it's a home run." Kudlow acknowledges there will be still be considerable debate, perhaps even a "struggle," in getting the game-changing reform passed in a stalemated Congress that has blocked everything President Trump has tried to do to date.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Chris Neiger May 1st 2017 10:55AM This year has already been fraught with bankruptcy news. Over the past few months, nine major companies have filed for bankruptcy. Topping the list for 2017 are hhgregg, RadioShack (for the second time), Wet Seal, The Limited, and others. While these companies are in the middle of the bankruptcy process, they're following in the unfortunate footsteps of many recognizable retail brands before them. Here are five major retailers you probably know that have all gone under during the past 10 years: 1. Circuit City Circuit City was once one of the main electronics retailers in the U.S. Based in Richmond, VA, the company can trace its history back to 1949, and dominated the electronics space up until the 1990s. In its heyday, Circuit City had 1,520 stores across the U.S. and Canada, with 46,000 employees. But the company faced increasing pressure from Best Buy, big-box stores like Walmart, and online sales from Amazon. After a series of failed strategy changes, the company ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and closed its doors the following year. Circuit City left a pile of assets after its demise, to the tune of $3.4 billion. 2. Linens & Things Linens & Things was a key player in the housewares market. In its prime, the company had more than 500 stores across the U.S. Unfortunately, massive cutbacks in consumer spending caused problems for the company, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2008. Just two years earlier, the private equity firm Apollo Management bought the company in an attempt to turn it around. In the end, Linens & Things closed up shop with $1.7 billion in assets. 3. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea The grocery store chain, often referred to as A&P, limped along for several years by filing for bankruptcy twice. The company had been in business since 1859, starting just a couple of years before the Civil War, but was forced to close its last store in New York City two years ago. A&P met its match among rising competition in the grocery-store market, and after more than 150 years in business, the company shuttered its doors and sold off $1.6 billion in assets.

Sports Authority E-commerce claimed another victim last year when Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy. The company had a total of 463 locations across the country, but couldn't keep up with increasing competition, high leadership turnover, and instability from past mergers. Sports Authority had $1.3 billion in assets at the time of its Chapter 11 filing -- the same amount the private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners paid for the company back in 2006. Rival Dick's Sporting Goods swept in and bought the Sports Authority's intellectual property -- mainly customer information -- for about $15 million. 5. RadioShack It was just two years ago when Radio Shack first filed for bankruptcy, with about $1.2 billion in assets. Sprint(NYSE: S) and the hedge fund Standard General took over about 1,700 of the company's once 4,000 stores, and tried to keep the company afloat.. But Sprint announced last month that it will close the remaining stores and convert several hundred of them to Sprint stores. After nearly a 100-year run in the retail business, RadioShack may finally be seeing its end this time around. 10 stocks we like better than Sprint When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The internet has taken business away from many traditional retailers, but the surviving chains have started to smarten up about how they present their merchandise. Motley Fool Staff May 1, 2017 at 11:05AM In this segment of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Sarah Priestley is sitting in as host, and she's joined by Motley Fool contributor Daniel Kline to talk about the chains that are getting it right. The two break down how some chains have figured out how to change the shopping experience to improve the customer experience and drive sales. Sarah and Dan also talk about what they're willing to buy online and what they insist on buying in stores. And they break down some of the technology that might benefit physical and digital retailers when it comes to clothing sales specifically. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 25, 2017. Sarah Priestley: I was listening to a webinar that was done by the same guy from Deloitte, and one of the things he was mentioning was, the department-store construct actually doesn't work well for a holistic, natural kind of shopping experience. The example that he gave, which I'm going to paraphrase, is that when you go to the luggage section, you may want to buy luggage for your vacation, and what would be great to have with this is women's summer dresses and bikinis and flip-flops and all those kinds of things. But because they're territorial about the space allocation, they're incapable of being flexible to provide customers want. Dan Kline: But you are seeing more of that. We talked about Target before. The new Target setup that they're starting to roll out, I think it's about a third of their stores this year, is going to have one entrance for Grab & Go. So you walk in, you want a snack, you want a drink, maybe they've found that toilet paper is something that people just want to buy and leave -- they need toilet paper. That's a terrible example. The second entrance is going to be clothing and seasonal items and things people take more time to buy. So as a retailer, you have to align your store to your market. It's very simple. If I walk into a liquor store, they've figured out a long time ago to put the gin next to the tonic, and that the olives should probably be somewhere close by. But when you walk into a Macy's, shoes and socks are not necessarily in the same place, or pants and belts, or to take it, as you did, to another level, where you go to these more esoteric connections. You need to see more dynamically changing stores, where they're seasonally really making moves to captivate customers. And you have to just make shopping fun. Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. I think another thing is, a lot of these retailers sell things that are so easily commoditized online. And like you said, if they don't have that experience element to the shopping experience, they're going to lose out. If you take Home Depot, for example, their stock is up 10% this year, which is completely different from the rest of the retail environment. They offer something that you really can't replicate online. They have experts who are going to give DIY-ers advice. You can't really sell lumber or deliver lumber and paving slabs that easily. And I admit that that's very difficult to transfer to clothes and things like that, but it's a similar principle. You're getting a lot more of a value proposition. Kline: There's also an immediacy. Obviously, if you're going to buy drywall at Home Depot, you're either going to pay them a fortune to deliver it -- it doesn't really matter if you come into the store how you get it. But if your sink is broken and you need a plumbing piece, you don't want to wait for two days. And [Amazon.com] (NASDAQ:AMZN) has some methods of dealing with that. They have a patent application on a truck that drives around that can 3D-print parts like that. But until things like that exist, a lot of the demand at a store like Home Depot is, "It's Saturday and I'm free and I'm going to build a fire pit outside." Or, "Oh my God, my toilet doesn't flush anymore, I have to get the pieces to do that." But other retailers have to figure out how to make that happen. Do you buy clothes online? Priestley: No, I don't. I don't buy clothes online because I would like to try clothes on and feel them and everything else before. And what my husband believes is going to happen is that you almost have a showroom where you go and try the clothes on and then order them and they are delivered at home. I don't know if I buy into that, because I very much like to feel the weight of what I've bought when I've bought it. But that's another possibility. Kline: I do a mix. I will go to a Kohl's or Macy's and I'll buy a shirt. And if I like the shirt, I will then buy 10 more of the shirt online. I agree, especially with women's sizing, a small doesn't mean things the way -- men's sizes are more exact in terms of inches and length. So it can be a challenge. But I think the tools are eventually going to make it so you can virtually try things on. Priestley: That's true. I wonder how much they're going to catch on. I know there's a lot of tech disruption people are talking about. [Virtual reality], you can look at a screen and it will try on the clothes for you without you having to actually go into a changing room. I don't know how much they're going to catch on, and if that's really where the tech disruption is happening. I think the tech disruption is happening much more in terms of the granularity of information that you have over your consumers' social-media campaigns, all those things that probably weren't available when these big stores were established. But I really think, as you said, they could take lessons from these nimble start-up companies that have entered the market with zero barriers and are really cashing in on where the retailers are failing.  Kline: And I think one of the things you're seeing with Wal-Mart, which is another retailer that's had its struggles but is quietly growing and adding stores, is the true integration of "buy online, return in store." I buy from Amazon almost every day. And I joked earlier, but if I buy a shirt and it doesn't fit, the odds of me going through the trouble of returning it are very, very low. If all I had to do was walk to the mall and drop it off at the Amazon kiosk, that would be a lot easier. For now, Target, Wal-Mart, even Costco is playing with this a little bit, have that advantage that you can buy something digitally, and when it doesn't work out, it's a lot easier to return it than having to figure out how to get UPS to pick up at your house. Priestley: And that's really a small example of a bigger problem with this. Omnichannel, for a lot of the traditional retailer CEOs, really means you have your store and you have your online presence, whereas those things, those two things are basically integrated, they're essentially the same thing. We are online all the time -- I can be in a Target store and checking on Amazon to do a price comparison. It's those kinds of things that I think they need to stop looking at it like, "5% of revenue is from mobile and 95% is from in-store, so all my focus needs to go on the in-store," and actually focus on the two things as an integrated experience. Kline: Marc Lore from Wal-Mart, who runs their digital operation, talked about this. I think more chains need to bring in digital-first people and empower then. Priestley: Absolutely. He came from Jet.com through the acquisition. Kline: And he created Quidsi, which is Diapers.com. He's been a serial success-failure. He's had companies that weren't making any money that scared Amazon. First Amazon brought Quidsi, and then Wal-Mart bought Jet, which was a company losing money on $1 billion in sales. He's a really interesting case. When you inject him into this old-line way of thinking at Wal-Mart, he goes, "Wait a minute, we are not going to compete with Amazon by selling a Prime knockoff. It isn't going to work. So let's just give it away." You have to be willing -- this is a very tough thing for a retail CEO to deal with -- to have some bad quarters, because you're going to cut into your margins, you're going to do a lot of negatives. But if you can capture a customer and have a good experience -- I bought some things online at Kohl's, and they shower you with discounts and all sorts of other ways to get you back; it was a pleasant experience, and I would absolutely buy from them again. And I think that's what more of your Macy's and your other chains -- it might be too late for Sears. I'm not sure Shop Your Way, which they talk about being the future of the company, has any customers. But you really need to break everything and figure out, "I have this asset, these physical stores, how do I keep my customers a customer whether they're coming into that store or not?"

The PPS-13BL is one of the loudest alarms ever manufactured by Vigilant at 135dB peak volume with a breakthrough high resonant circular design. It uses Vigilant’s Help Cord™ activation, including a rip cord with grenade style pin for easy and decisive activation in any emergency. The palm-sized PPS-13BL also features a wrist / tether strap with an included bag clip, making it the ideal alarm to wear on a uniform, attach to a backpack, or hand carry. Batteries are also included, pre-loaded, and user replaceable. The Night Vision Personal Alarm™ (model PPS-13BL) is available at Amazon.com, Sears.com, Walmart.com, eBay.com, and VigilantPPS.com Night Vision Personal Alarm™ Flashlight: Red LED lights are good for night illumination without altering your eye’s natural dark vision adaption. Use the red LED press-and-hold button for immediate vicinity illumination without losing your natural „night vision.” When you turn off the red illumination your eyes don’t have to adjust back to the darkness. Night Vision Personal Alarm™ is a trademark of Robinhood Digital, LLC. 135dB Alarm : 135dB Peak volume at source (< 1 inch), 130dB RMS volume at distance of 3m. This is one of the loudest personal alarms ever manufactured by Vigilant for sale in the United States.

The only way to silence it is by replacing the grenade-style pin. Criminals do not like to draw attention, and will likely run off when they realize the alarm cannot be easily stopped.

Disguised as unassuming ATM points, the bright yellow kiosks act as full-fledged self-service media distributors and can be readily found in local malls across the country, TorrentFreak reports. As you might guess, the legalities of setting up such machines are highly questionable, to say the least. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE “At the beginning of this year, All Mart (the Walmart equivalent here) brought in a new machine. It’s basically a monitor with a USB port but shaped like an ATM. It’s called SwiftMedia and there’s a guy who ‘maintains’ it,” a source told TorrentFreak. “Basically you go to this very big store and you approach the machine and you plug in a USB drive. The screen will turn on and it will let you browse through a massive archive of movies.” Here are a couple of photos of the machine: The SwiftMedia kiosks are reportedly maintained by a company called Escape Computing, selling various affordable packages for 25, 50 and 100 birr (or approximately $1, $2, and $4). Feature movies purportedly cost between three and five birr to download. “At first I assumed these movies had their rights lifted or something because well, you know, but then I later found out that the movies I had first seen were just there on release day,” the source further said. Adding that, “[a]pparently the maintenance guy torrents all day and stores the data on his drive, the drive shown by the SwiftMedia monitor. This would not have been a big deal as this is Ethiopia and the allegedly democratic government has bigger issues.” Meanwhile, if you happen to be an avid movie watcher straight out of IT school, give Escape Computing a shout – they might have a job for you. on TorrentFreak Read next: The world's last male northern white rhino is now on Tinder to help sustain the species GeariOS Share on Facebook (1718) Share on Twitter (342) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

See Offers Nation & World Posted Yesterday at 8:58 AM Updated May 1 increase font size During President Trump’s first 100 days, he made 488 false or misleading claims Trump's repetition of statements that have been proven false makes him unique among American politicians. By Glenn Kessler and Michelle Ye Hee LeeThe Washington Post Share Comment Read Article President Trump in the Oval Office in March Associated Press/Evan Vucci President Donald Trump is the most fact-challenged politician that The Fact Checker has ever encountered. He earned 59 Four-Pinocchio ratings during his campaign as president. Since then, he’s earned 16 more Four-Pinocchio ratings. But those numbers obscure the fact that the pace and volume of the president’s misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up. The president’s speeches and interviews are so chock full of false and misleading claims that The Fact Checker often must resort to roundups that offer a brief summary of the facts that the president has gotten wrong. We also cataloged the president’s many flip-flops, since those earn Upside-Down Pinocchios if a politician shifts position on an issue without acknowledging he or she did so. So here are the numbers for the president’s first 100 days. — 488: The number of false or misleading claims made by the president. That’s an average of 4.9 claims a day. 10: Number of days without a single false claim. (On six of those days, the president golfed at a Trump property.) 4: Number of days with 20 or more false claims. (Feb. 16, Feb. 28, March 20 and April 21.) He made 19 false claims on April 29, his 100th day, though we did not include his interview with “Face the Nation,” since that aired April 30. — While the president is known to make outrageous claims on Twitter – and that was certainly a major source of his falsehoods – he made most of his false statements in unscripted remarks before reporters. (Interviews were another major source of false claims.) That’s because the president would rely on talking points or assertions that he had made in the past – and continued to make, even though they had been fact-checked as wrong. This makes Trump somewhat unique among politicians. Many will drop a false claim after it has been deemed false. But Trump just repeats the same claim over and over. In particular, the president repeatedly took credit for events or business decisions that happened before he took the oath of office – or had even been elected. He gave himself credit for the January jobs report – 216,000 jobs – even though the data was collected the week of Jan. 12, before he became president. (In other words, the gain in jobs took place from Dec. 12 to Jan. 12.) Among other deals, Trump took credit for $1 billion investment by Fiat Chrysler (which the company said was due to talks with unions in 2015), $1 billion General Motors investment (also in the works for some time), 10,000 jobs added by Walmart (announced in October), 10,000 jobs created by Intel (announced originally in 2011), 1 million planned jobs by Chinese e-company Alibaba (a plan outlined in 2015), and a $25 billion investment by Charter Communications (in the works since 2015). Trump also touted a big investment by Japanese company SoftBank – which announced its investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory. On at least 15 occasions, Trump boasted that he had personally negotiated a cut between $600 million and $725 million off an order for Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. But Lockheed had already planned the cost reductions, saying in December that the next batch of 90 planes would cost six to seven percent less per plane than the previous order. (This was well before any meeting that Trump had with the company’s chief executive.) The Air Force’s budget had already accounted for the cut in price – and the price is expected to keep dropping. Another Trump favorite was claiming – seven times – that the United States had spent $6 trillion on wars in “the Middle East.” He usually utters this figure to note the money would have been better spent in the United States. But Trump is lumping together the wars in Iraq (in the Middle East) and Afghanistan (in South Asia), which together cost about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. He is also adding in estimates of future spending, such as interest on the debt and veterans’ care for the next three decades. Trump has also repeatedly asserted (17 times) that the Affordable Care Act was failing or on the edge of disaster or in serious trouble. But the Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges, despite well-documented issues, is not imploding and is expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Trump, as he did during the campaign, also cherry-picked numbers about premium increases to make the increases sound worse than reality. Trump repeatedly also blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) – “the worst trade deal ever made by any country” — for resulting in the loss of one-third of U.S. manufacturing jobs. He also claimed that the entry of China into the World Trade Organization led to the closure of as many as 70,000 factories. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2017 concluded the “net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP.” Meanwhile, manufacturing jobs in the United States have been adversely affected by many factors, especially changing consumer tastes and technology. Drawing a connection between China’s entry in the WTO and factory losses is a stretch, especially because the Great Recession played a big role in factory closings. Judging from Trump’s repeated false claims, one would think that he is not a regular reader. But on March 21, Trump remarked that the news media was too judgmental about his statements. “If it’s off by 100th of a percent, it’s like I end up getting Pinocchios,” he said. That’s a start. Hope springs eternal. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story? If so, please fill out our accuracy form Send questions/comments to the editors.

Joe Mullin - May 1, 2017 12:59 pm UTC Enlarge / A customer buying a new iPhone in Russia. Sergei FadeichevTASS via Getty Images reader comments 217 Share this story When it reports its quarterly financial results on Tuesday, Apple will likely have a quarter-trillion dollars in cash in the bank. That's a greater hoard than any other company in recent US history, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported the numbers on Sunday. For comparison, Apple's cash pile exceeds the market value of Walmart and Procter & Gamble. The sum is more than the foreign cash reserves of the UK and Canada combined. Further ReadingApple sets revenue and iPhone sales records in Q1 of 2017Some 93 percent of the company's cash and other liquid assets are kept overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a tax holiday to encourage companies to bring money back to the US, as well as a lower corporate tax rate, fueling more speculation about how Apple will use its money. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he's interested in moving some of the company's cash stateside if tax conditions are right. One possibility is delivering a huge dividend to shareholders. Another is the possible acquisition of companies that are true giants in their own right. Capital managers suggested to the WSJ that Apple could buy a company like Tesla, valued at $51 billion, to push forward a self-driving car project. Another idea is buying Netflix, valued at $65 billion, to work on video-streaming and as a hedge against Amazon. An even more outlandish idea—still within the realm of possibility—would be to buy The Walt Disney Company, which has a market cap of more than $180 billion. Apple also has around $88 billion in debt to fund shareholder payouts. But even subtracting that amount, Apple has by far more cash than any other company. The second richest tech company is Microsoft, which has $126 billion, not counting debt. Another writer previewing Apple's earnings over the weekend, MarketWatch columnist Tim Mullaney, said that the "seemingly foolish call" he made two years ago—that Apple's stock could hit a value of $1 trillion by 2017—may well come to fruition. Apple set revenue and iPhone records last quarter, although growth in China slowed a bit.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Amway Supports Women and Youth Entrepreneurship at India CSR Forum SOURCE: Amway DESCRIPTION: On April 14, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and U.S.-India Business Council met in Delhi, India at a Corporate Social Responsibility forum to discuss best practices in promoting women and youth economic empowerment, and identify and address barriers to entrepreneurship and workforce participation. The theme of the forum was “Making Economies Work for Women and Youth” and was made possible through a partnership with Amway, Abbott, and Walmart. Although women’s access to economic opportunities has greatly increased around the world, many women and girls still face considerable barriers to economic participation. Investing in women can help unleash untapped talent, lead to innovation, generate new consumers and produce a multiplier effect for the economy. Women also reinvest the majority of their income in their families and communities. Geeta Pillay, a top Amway leader in India, shared her journey as an entrepreneur with those in attendance. “For years I had a focused career path, but becoming an entrepreneur allowed me to live a more balanced life, take control of my time, and provide financial freedom,” said Pillay. “I have a passion for empowering women and families to build a better quality of life.” According to the McKinsey Global Institute, achieving gender equality in India will have a much larger economic impact there than in any other region in the world. Amway is proud to partner and promote women’s economic empowerment in India and around the world.

The goal of a capitalist, free market-based society is that as companies get more successful, they invest their winnings back into the company, increasing productivity, hiring more people, and thus improving the overall state of the economy. While inherently flawed, this system has brought us a lot of good, and has lifted quite a number of people out of abject poverty. However, one has to ask what individuals and corporations hoarding this much money as Apple is doing are contributing to society. Apple's 250 billion dollars are locked away, and aren't used for anything. Every day, Apple is extracting vast sums of wealth from society - as they should in a capitalist society - but they are no longer investing it back into society. And Apple isn't alone in this, of course - a rich few are extracting immense amounts of wealth from society without giving back. This breaks the traditional capitalist model. Things like increased automation and robotisation are only going to accelerate this process. At some point, we're going to have to stop and ask ourselves if this is tenable, and if not, what we are going to do about it. It goes against the core 'values' of die-hard capitalists, but we might reach a point where we have to forcibly - through law - take it from companies like Apple.

It's currently sold exclusively online to a global, 20-30 year old female, predominantly American market. Since being founded in 2013, Flat Tummy Tea has grown rapidly, largely attributed to the strength of their branding and their innovative and effective use of social media. Their secret is a very specific process and ROI based algorithm used on various online platforms. To date, Flat Tummy Tea has built a targeted social media following of over 1,300,000, many of whom are now customers.

FOCUSfactor® FOCUSfactor is sold at America's leading retailers such as Costco, Sam's Club, Wal-Mart, BJ's Walgreens, CVS and The Vitamin Shoppe. FOCUSfactor, America's leading brain health supplement, is a nutritional supplement that includes a proprietary blend of brain supporting vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other nutrients. In December 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued US Patent 8,329,227 covering FOCUSfactor's proprietary formulation "for enhanced mental function." The issuance of the patent marked one of the few times a patent has been issued for a nationally branded nutritional supplement. FOCUSfactor is clinically tested with results demonstrating improvements in focus, concentration and memory in healthy adults. www.focusfactor.com Neuragen® Neuragen® is a topical product that works directly at the site of the pain as opposed to oral products. Neuragen® reduces the spontaneous firing of damaged peripheral nerves. By calming these firings at the source, Neuragen® is clinically shown to reduce shooting and burning pains quickly and without the side effects of orally taken medications. This is in part due to the small lipophilic molecules found in Neuragen® which rapidly carry the active ingredients through the rough outer layer of the skin to the site of the pain. Neuragen® is available over the counter in most local pharmacies either in the diabetic section or the analgesic (pain) section. For more information, please visit www.neuragen.com. Hand MD® Hand MD is the world's first anti-aging skincare line formulated specifically for the hands. Hands reveal a woman's true age and the rejuvenation of the hand has become women's #1 aging concern. Developed by Kara Harshbarger and renowned celebrity dermatologist Dr. Alex Khadavi, Hand MD's extensive clinical trials show significant improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, skin hydration, hyper-pigmentation and radiance. HAND MD launched on QVC and sold out in an astonishing 5 minutes. www.hand-md.com The Synergy Effect® The Synergy Effect is Synergy's fast-growth online marketing platform, a growth engine built to grow brands exponentially online. Launched in 2017, The Synergy Effect powers Synergy's brands online, driving revenue using best-in-class digital strategy and its proprietary ROI algorithm.

The Challenge starts at 11 am and you can sign up for a team at that time. For those of you who don't know what Swagbucks is, it's a website where you can earn cash back on everyday tasks you do online like shopping, answering surveys, discovering deals, and watching videos. You can even earn by searching the web! See more details below. . Swag Wars Team Challenge 1. Click HERE to join the challenge and be assigned to a team. If you don't already have an account, you can sign up on this page as well. 2. Starting May 1 at 11 am ET, you'll contribute points to your teams total as you complete different activities on Swagbucks. The activities are also worth SB points so you'll earn those as well. 3. Check back on the page often to see the scores and what you've contribute so far. All members who participate and contribute at least 400 points to their team’s total will receive a SB bonus in the form of a SB Swag Up Rebate on their next gift card! Not only that, but if you are a new Swagbucks member and you earn 300 SB before June 1st, you'll get a 300 SB bonus (as long as you've signed up through this link. Members of the 1st place team earn 50 SB Swag Up Rebate, 2nd place earns 35 SB Swag Up Rebate, 3rd place earns 20 SB Swag Up Rebate, 4th place earns 10 SB Swag Up Rebate and 5th Place earns a 5 SB Swag Up Rebate. Your SB Swag Up Rebate will be made available on Friday, May 5 and will expire on Sunday, May 31 at 11:59 pm PT. If you've never used Swagbucks before, now is a great time to join, especially if you participate in the Team Challenge because it's an opportunity to win an extra bonus for trying out the site. Look below for a new member sign-up bonus! New to Swagbucks? If you don't know about Swagbucks yet, it's the largest rewards website that gives people free gift cards for the things they do online (searching, shopping, watching videos, playing games and more). You earn points called SB for online activities and then you can cash them in for gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, CVS, Lowes, Starbucks, Paypal, Bass Pro Shops, Kohl's and so many more! It's free to join and I have earned a bunch of gift cards in the many years I have been a member. How do you get these SB points? There are lots of ways. * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps (I earn about 80 - 100 SB a day doing this) * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Just this week, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made a few weeks ago. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus.

Oldest First Newest First View all observant May 1, 10:37 p.m. SENGLISH27529 - This week I have more time after 11 am to do my computer work with out interruption - team challenge or not . 2 weeks from now early mornings will be my best time - and stronger coffee . I am doing OK - my team is in the lead and I have contributed 375 points so far with a few more hours to go before bedtime . Good Luck Everyone !! QUOTE Report as abuse senglish27529 May 1, 5:49 p.m. Faye, most likely I have doomed you -- we're already firmly in last place. *sigh* DH is on the Obi-Won team, and last I looked, that team was leading. At least ONE member of this household won't finish in last place! Observant, I decided some time ago not to let the team challenge start times impact my SB activities. I have the most time available in the mornings, so if I wait until noon to start earning, I'm likely to not meet my daily goal. Just not worth it to me for those hundred or so team points. I *do*, however, like to be able to register early for the challenge, so that I don't have to (try to) remember to do it at a set hour. :-) Stephanie QUOTE Report as abuse Faye Prosser -WRAL Smart Shopper May 1, 2:59 p.m. I finally signed up just now and I'm a Luke Swagwalker too, Stephanie! There is hope for me because I know you have been on winning teams. Or maybe I just doomed you.... lol observant - I agree - this late start is odd. At first Swagbucks told bloggers that the challenge started at 5 pm tonight and then corrected it. That would have been really odd! QUOTE Report as abuse observant May 1, 12:25 p.m. Today kept us on our toes - I did not even log in until 11 am to prevent earning before the team challenge began. We have been spoiled by the early join lately . A couple of times I earned a significant number of SBs before the official start time so they did not count for my teams QUOTE Report as abuse senglish27529 May 1, 11:04 a.m. I'm a Luke Swagwalker. :-) I wasn't able to sign up until 11:00 sharp. Almost had me worried, since I couldn't see the "Join Now" button until then. :-) Stephanie QUOTE Report as abuse Meet the Author Contributors Faye Prosser WRAL Smart Shopper Connect Follow Follow Subscribe Search Printable coupons Coupon websites Kids eat free database Search other WRAL recipes Resources Frugal Living and Couponing 101 Coupon policies and reward programs Smart Spending workshop schedule Smart Spending Resources website Popular Recommended Discussed Local News Wake Arrests Out and About Nightlife Photos Go Ask Mom Red wolf pups born at the Museum of Life and Science Local News Brother of Raleigh girl found dead after car crash dies Local News Since debut of '13 Reasons Why,' calls into Raleigh's suicide prevention hotline nearly triple Local News Investigators: Onslow students 'catfish' teacher, post nude photo online Weather WRAL WeatherCenter Forecast Basketball Hoop dreams help Oregon teen create million-dollar business News Evening Pick 3 Pick 4 and Cash 5 Go Ask Mom Pool Time!

Photo - Reuters   Sharelines Where to build Trump’s wall? #Where to build Trump’s wall? What do Huntsville (Alabama), Princeton (Indiana), Georgetown (Kentucky), Blue Springs (Mississippi), San Antonio (Texas), Buffalo (West Virginia), and Greer (South Carolina) have in common? They are the locations where Toyota and BMW built their manufacturing plants in the United States. None is in the U.S. Rust Belt – the tract of industrial towns stretching from Michigan to eastern Pennsylvania – where much of the car industry and its suppliers were traditionally located. Evidently, the U.S. Rust Belt’s decline was not the exclusive doing of China and Mexico. It was also caused by the auto industry’s geographic spread into other regions of the U.S., out of the clusters in which it had originally been concentrated. And this shift resulted not so much because GM moved its plants, but because it lost market share to Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Hyundai, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. Of course, pointing this out does not reduce the pain for those affected. But it does change the policy implications – and the lessons from the U.S. example are relevant worldwide. Two approaches have been pursued so far to help communities affected by this phenomenon. The first is embodied in the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programme, which provides workers affected by international competition with financial support for retraining, job search, relocation, income maintenance, and health insurance. The second approach is to provide trade protection to affected industries, as U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to do. Neither approach is likely to help the Rust Belt. Any economy’s success is very much affected by the performance of that sliver of activities that can sell their output to outsiders. And what is true for countries is also true for states, cities, and towns, provided we redefine what we mean by selling to “outsiders.” These “export” activities have an outsize and amplified impact on the growth of the local economy as a whole. Every geographic area must buy products it does not make and pay for them by selling to outsiders some of the output that it does make. But outsiders have the option of buying from others. So, these “export” activities face a level of competition that the local grocer, coffee shop, or barber does not. Moreover, the income brought into the community by the “exporters” creates a large multiplier effect. When a mine shuts down, the result is not just unemployed miners. The grocer, coffee shop, and barber go out of business, and everybody leaves, turning the place into a ghost town. The disruption can be caused not only by an industrial closure. Once upon a time, there were many relatively small department-store chains and other retailers with headquarters spread throughout the U.S. and outlets in a few towns. These headquarters brought income into their town by providing back-office services to their network of stores. But consolidation in the retail industry, driven in part by Walmart and Amazon, dealt a deathblow to many of these companies. The impact on the local communities where these retailers were headquartered was as devastating as a mine closure: the “export” activity ceased and towns shrank by a multiple of each “export job” lost. Video rentals, bookstore chains, pharmacies, home improvement stores, electronics and camera shops, catalogue stores, and more: all went the way of the horse and buggy. At the start of 2017, Walmart had 5,332 stores in the U.S. It is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, where it employs more than 18,000 workers. Clearly, trade protection does not help if Detroit is competing with Blue Springs, Mississippi. Nor do import tariffs help those left unemployed by the bankruptcy of Blockbuster Video, Borders Books, CompUSA, Circuit City, Payless, or Virgin Megastores. In the meantime, employment at Amazon grew by 47 per cent over the past year, to 341,000 people. But with Amazon employment concentrated in California, Texas, and Washington, the geography of those jobs is very different from that of those it is replacing. As with the geographic relocation of U.S. manufacturing jobs, TAA is not a solution for this kind of ailment. After all, whereas TAA targets individuals directly impacted by foreign competition, much of the competition faced by local economies is not coming from abroad, and many of the jobs being lost are not in the industries directly affected by outside competition, but in the surrounding economy. Facilitating individuals’ relocation does nothing for those left behind in shrinking towns. With industry after industry disrupted by technological change, much of this pain is hard to avoid. But interventions at the individual level must be complemented with assistance at the level of local economies. The goal should be clear: as a town’s “export” industries are disrupted, new “export” activities must take their place, lest the town shrink and become impoverished. This highlights the need for what UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called a Modern Industrial Strategy, aimed at “delivering jobs and economic growth to every community and corner of the country” to “ensure [that] free trade and globalisation work for all.” To achieve this, a new set of place-based policies will be needed. The point is not to prop up dying industries, but to increase the birth rate and reduce the infant-mortality rate of firms in industries that can take their place, especially those that can sell to “outsiders,” reconnecting each location with external and increasingly global markets. In their recent book The Smartest Places on Earth, Antoine van Agtmael and Fred Bakker document how this is already happening in parts of the U.S. Rust Belt, where many towns – such as Akron, Ohio, or Albany, New York – have reinvented themselves. These places are not only recovering; we know from how they voted last November that they are also not buying into Trump’s wall-building agenda. - Project Syndicate < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Patent Reveals Possible Future Smartphone with Full Wraparound Display & Smart Spine Feature | Main | Samsung Seeks to Join the Micro-LED Display Race along with Apple, Sony and Oculus » May 01, 2017 Apple's Cash to Top a Quarter Trillion Dollars with 90% Overseas   It's being reported today that Apple is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined.   The Wall Street Jounal reports that more than 90% of Apple's money "is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. That could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to make splashy acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders.   Apple's quarterly results will show the company has doubled its cash pile in just over 4 1/2 years. In the last three months of 2016, it racked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour.   As of December, the company had $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities. Apple, like many big American companies, parks most of that cash offshore rather than paying U.S. taxes on its overseas profits.   Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enabled it. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans.   One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefiting investors including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January.   With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S.   Either way, a sense is growing that Apple's cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. "If this a rainy-day fund, they're saving for a millennial flood," said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The 5 Biggest Retail Bankruptcies of the Past Decade Even businesses that have endured since the Civil War are no match for the cutthroat retail wars. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) May 1, 2017 at 6:00AM Image source: Getty Images. This year has already been fraught with bankruptcy news. Over the past few months, nine major companies have filed for bankruptcy. Topping the list for 2017 are hhgregg, RadioShack (for the second time), Wet Seal, The Limited, and others. While these companies are in the middle of the bankruptcy process, they're following in the unfortunate footsteps of many recognizable retail brands before them. Here are five major retailers you probably know that have all gone under during the past 10 years: Image source: Circuit City Corporation. 1. Circuit City Circuit City was once one of the main electronics retailers in the U.S. Based in Richmond, VA, the company can trace its history back to 1949, and dominated the electronics space up until the 1990s. In its heyday, Circuit City had 1,520 stores across the U.S. and Canada, with 46,000 employees.   But the company faced increasing pressure from Best Buy, big-box stores like Walmart, and online sales from Amazon. After a series of failed strategy changes, the company ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and closed its doors the following year. Circuit City left a pile of assets after its demise, to the tune of $3.4 billion.    Image source: Getty Images. 2. Linens & Things  Linens & Things was a key player in the housewares market. In its prime, the company had more than 500 stores across the U.S. Unfortunately, massive cutbacks in consumer spending caused problems for the company, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2008.  Just two years earlier, the private equity firm Apollo Management bought the company in an attempt to turn it around. In the end, Linens & Things closed up shop with $1.7 billion in assets.  Image source: The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. 3. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea The grocery store chain, often referred to as A&P, limped along for several years by filing for bankruptcy twice. The company had been in business since 1859, starting just a couple of years before the Civil War, but was forced to close its last store in New York City two years ago.  A&P met its match among rising competition in the grocery-store market, and after more than 150 years in business, the company shuttered its doors and sold off $1.6 billion in assets.  Image source: Getty Images. 4. Sports Authority E-commerce claimed another victim last year when Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy. The company had a total of 463 locations across the country, but couldn't keep up with increasing competition, high leadership turnover, and instability from past mergers. Sports Authority had $1.3 billion in assets at the time of its Chapter 11 filing -- the same amount the private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners paid for the company back in 2006. Rival Dick's Sporting Goods swept in and bought the Sports Authority's intellectual property -- mainly customer information -- for about $15 million. Image source: Getty Images. 5. RadioShack It was just two years ago when Radio Shack first filed for bankruptcy, with about $1.2 billion in assets. Sprint (NYSE:S) and the hedge fund Standard General took over about 1,700 of the company's once 4,000 stores, and tried to keep the company afloat.. But Sprint announced last month that it will close the remaining stores and convert several hundred of them to Sprint stores. After nearly a 100-year run in the retail business, RadioShack may finally be seeing its end this time around.

The Commerce Department is expected to report the U.S. deficit on trade goods and services in March was about $44 billion, indicating the United States is on track for another trade gap in excess of $500 billion for 2017. For decades, the trade deficit has been a source of torment. Critics blame it for jobs losses, and apologists say it permits Americans to consume more and cheaper products without much harm. Both arguments have an element of truth but most importantly, the trade deficit must be financed. Foreign governments and private persons buy U.S. Treasuries, corporate stocks and bonds, and real estate in tony locations like Manhattan and Miami Beach, and we have to pay interest, dividends and rent on those assets that grow larger each year. Americans make similar investments abroad, but overall foreigners are buying more here. The U.S. net international investment position (NIIP) is now minus 45% of gross domestic product, and economists at the Peterson Institute estimate that deficit will increase to 53% in 2021. No nation has seen its position reach minus 60% without enduring a major financial crisis. Economists are inclined to believe bilateral deficits — or even deficits in particular commodities like oil — don’t matter but if one country or commodity is huge in the numbers then the global problem can’t be addressed without addressing the particular country or commodity. China accounts for more than 60% of the U.S. trade deficit and petroleum for more than a quarter of the rest. The Trump administration proposes to fix the China trade by applying pressure to open its markets — if Americans can sell more in China, then we can continue to enjoy cheap consumer goods at Wal-Mart. And by liberating the oil and gas sector from Obama-era regulations and continuing to build out wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. As for China, the president’s recent statement on trade policy indicates revved up use of trade remedy laws to keep out or at least penalize subsidized and dumped imports. For U.S. industries that benefit — hooray! — but Beijing advantages domestic producers in so many ways, from forced technology transfers from foreign investors to generous benefits for technology startups, that Trump’s strategy reminds me of the farmer chasing an infestation of grasshoppers with a butterfly net. The Peterson Institute suggests in a forthcoming study a program of currency-market intervention to offset foreign government intervention in currency markets and lower the value of the dollar BUXX, +0.00%  across the board. These days, manipulation by foreign governments is not the problem — but rather the lack of confidence in the durability of existing regimes. Marine Le Pen challenging the future of the European Union and China’s authoritarian regime are scaring investors and driving down the euro EURUSD, +0.1743%  and yuan USDCNH, -0.0348%  . At the Mar-a-Lago Summit, Presidents Trump and Xi announced a 100-day review of policies to address the trade deficit but that is as unlikely to yield results as were similar bilateral talks initiated by Presidents Bush or Obama. Warren Buffet, for many years, has suggested a system of import certificates and elsewhere, I have advocated a tax on the conversion of currency into yuan. The latter would essentially raise the price of imported goods and encourage reshoring. Under the Buffet plan, exporters would receive certificates to import goods in amounts equal to their foreign sales and in turn, those could be sold to importers, who would be required to present certificates to bring goods and services into the country. Those certificates would go to the highest bidders and hence be used to import goods that had the highest value to consumers. Rather than apply it to all our trading partners — and cause global outrage — I would just apply it to trade with China and endure its bellicosity as needed. Either Beijing finally starts realigning its economy to rely less on trade surpluses with the United States or this scheme would do it for them. No matter which tack chosen, Americans would pay more for toasters, T-shirts and TVs. However, that burden would pale by comparison to losses in jobs and living standards imposed by a debt crisis on the scale of that endured by other nations who left their problems to fester until international investors quit buying their bonds and other assets.

Las Vegas Sun May 2, 2017 Currently: 76° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events Betting Las Vegas Raiders UNLV sports Gaming Vegas Golden Knights Smith's World Newsletter signup 0 Metro demonstrates progress and revamped use-of-force policies Mikayla Whitmore A display of Metro Police training in Las Vegas offered a “behind the police tape” view of an officer-involved shooting, April 20, 2017. By Ricardo Torres-Cortez (contact) Monday, May 1, 2017 | 2 a.m. A gray Chevrolet Impala pulls into the parking lot of a Metro Police training facility, followed by a black-and-white with lights flashing. The Metro officer quickly got out of his SUV, and so does the distraught suspect. “Hey, Metro Police — get back in that car!” the officer yells. “You’re always harassing me. Everywhere I go!” the driver shouts back, throwing his hands up in frustration. His car is unregistered. Its taillight is broken. And the officer notices something sticking out from the suspect’s waist. Metro Training Launch slideshow » Two loud bangs shock the reporters gathered for Metro’s eighth annual Media Day. April 20. Police showcased what happens “behind the yellow tape” after an officer-involved shooting, from the time gunfire erupts through the ensuing investigation and the psychological effects on officers who’ve been put in the position to use deadly force. Although staged, the shooting felt unnerving, from the sirens and bullet casings to the blood-stained gauze on the suspect being loaded into an ambulance. The point of shaking up the spectators is to impart some sense of what officers experience after a shooting. SWAT officer Brett Brosnahan was shot at in 2014, by one half of a vigilante couple who’d gunned down two other officers and a civilian. Brosnahan came face-to-face with Amanda Miller inside the Wal-Mart where she and her husband, Jerad, had holed up. Brosnahan fired back, hitting her in the shoulder, and left the building to inform his team. Jerad was later fatally shot in the chest, and Amanda died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Brosnahan says he thinks of the shooting every day. “Usually it’s dreams,” he said. “Sometimes they’re nightmares — the what ifs, what else could have happened to me that day. ... I feel a lot of grief, because I miss my friends who were murdered.” During mandatory leave and three to four months of therapy, officers who’ve been involved in shootings go through medical evaluations, Metro Capt. Kelly McMahill says. Once cleared, an officer is placed in a training scenario re-creating the traumatic incident. That’s followed by secondary evaluations and a process of slowly re-acclimating to the job. Or not. “We weren’t always as good at this as we are today, and we’ve learned a lot,” McMahill says. “Quite frankly, we’ve lost some of our officers because they went through a shooting and we hadn’t given them what they needed.” Metro’s use-of-force policies were revamped after a 2012 review by the U.S. Department of Justice and have since been praised by the federal agency. Departments across the country have consulted Metro to try to emulate its approach. Although violent crime was up last year in Metro’s jurisdiction, a 20-year low of 10 people were shot by police in 2016 (three fatally). The agency credits its modified training and de-escalation practices for the low number of officer-involved shootings. “We had a history of this agency having too many officer-involved shootings, and they were just not tactically sound,” McMahill says. What happens after an officer-involved shooting? Shootings take a matter of seconds, but use-of-force investigations can take six months if there’s a fatality. Metro’s staged incident during Media Day was condensed, but it painted a detailed picture of protocol after the discharge of an officer’s weapon. Here’s how the scenario unfolded: The following list is incomplete and does not reflect exact chronology. Click here for details on the full process. 1. After the wounded suspect was transported, a police supervisor approached the officer involved for a debriefing. 2. Detectives rounded up witnesses and interviewed them about what they saw. 3. Crime-scene analysis began, with the Critical Incident Review Team (an administrative arm of Metro) working alongside the Force Investigation Team. 4. A detailed account surfaced: The suspect’s name and criminal history, and a summary of what investigators knew so far. Officers took notes and asked questions. 5. The officer involved led Detective Joe Patton on a walk-through. A crime-scene analyst followed, placing a cone where the officer believed he was when he fired. 6. Robert Daskas, Clark County’s assistant district attorney for the Criminal Division, watched body-worn camera footage and took a walk-through. He could call an independent investigation or file charges if he perceived the officer acted criminally. (Two civilian members of Metro’s Use of Force Review Board also would read reports and take walk-throughs before voting on whether the shooting was justifiable.) 7. The officer’s rights were explained to him before he would be summoned for an interview at headquarters. Investigators would press him on every detail. “Why did you go right instead of left? Why did you make this decision when instead you had this available over here?” Kelly McMahill said, illustrating the intensity of the questioning. “We learned many years ago when our (officer-involved shooting) numbers were very high that we had to start getting comfortable being very uncomfortable. It’s the only way to get better. If we ever get comfortable pulling the trigger, we’re doing something wrong.” 8. Investigators photographed the officer and his tool belt. They took his firearm, counted the bullets and photographed both. 9. McMahill would tape a statement for Metro’s public information office, while officers made suggestions: “If it takes 30 takes, it takes 30 takes,” Sgt. Jeff Clark said. She would then go in front of reporters and recite the statement, taking some questions. “The suspect is in stable condition; investigators found a gun on the scene.” Within 72 hours, the Clark County undersheriff would give a detailed briefing with comprehensive information Metro has collected. 0 Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

(Josh Redsun/Daily Republic) Fairfield Fairfield Gun Expo winds down By Susan Hiland From page A1 | May 01, 2017 ShareTweet ShareTweet FAIRFIELD — The Fairfield Gun Expo wound down quietly Sunday with waves of people coming in but not as many as Saturday. The weekend attendance pleased Guy Meyers of Mountain Aire Promotions because it was a good turnout with more than 1,000 people attending the event over the two days at the Specialty Event Center, the old Walmart site on Chadbourne Road. “The biggest challenge really was how to promote the venue because so many people know this under different names,” Meyers said. He said he was pleased that his 350 vendors had a nice building to display their wares and a sunny weekend that drew the crowds to enjoy some time out of the house. “Anyone will say that it’s never enough people,” he joked. “But it was very good for the first time we had it here.” People of all ages attended the event. Anyone under 18 needed to be accompanied by an adult. Meyers said he was happy to see all ages out because he sees it as an opportunity to teach children about gun safety. “They have a chance to learn about gun safety,” he said. “Guns are a tool and you must learn to use them properly.” Big changes are coming with several laws being enacted next year that will have a direct impact on sales. Meyers is well aware of the laws. “Online sales are basically outlawed,” he said. “Certification is needed for buying ammo just like if you bought a gun.” At this point he recommends people buy the ammo they need before all the laws come into effect and the prices jump to meet the demands. Bryon Owens is stationed with his family at Travis Air Force Base and visited his first gun show in California since leaving Tennessee. “I just came out to see what they had,” he said. “If I don’t find anything, then I’m not going to buy.” He started recently acquiring guns for home protection. “I’m going to teach my son, who is 17, gun safety,” he said. Vendor Eminence Arms came the farthest for the event, driving 1,500 miles from Idaho. “It’s a different demographic today, lots of people are shying away from featureless automatic rifles,” said owner Jeremy Martin. He counts it as a good weekend even if the attendance on Sunday was down. They recently updated their website and were eager for people to check it out on a large screen television they brought. “We go to great lengths to study California law and make sure we are in compliance,” he said. They also help customers with their questions on the laws, which is something he thinks people appreciate. “Once you know the laws, it’s easy to make the sale,” he said. Mountain Aire Promotions’ next gun show will take place May 6-7 at the Lodi Grape Festival. More information can be found at www.mountainairepromotions.com.

Virtually every department of the 180,000-square-foot store will be overhauled. A much larger produce section, with a greater selection of sought-after organic items, will be at the store’s main entrance. A New York City-based specialty cheese shop will be inside the store. And customers will be able to order groceries online and pick them up later the same day by pulling into a reserved parking spot where store employees will load groceries into customers’ cars. The remodel comes at a challenging time in retail, when brick-and-mortar stores are being squeezed by online shopping and customers’ fixation on low prices. National retailers, including Sears Holdings Corp., Macy’s Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and Payless ShoeSource, recently announced hundreds of store closings. Macy’s announced it would close stores in Salem and Portland. Payless said it would close stores in Springfield, Newport and three other Oregon cities. The number of U.S. retailers seeking bankruptcy protection in the first four months of 2017 has almost exceeded last year’s total, according to a recent analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. “A lot of the big retailers, especially in dry goods, have been suffering,” said Lynn Kahle, marketing professor at University of Oregon’s Lundquist College of Business. “The Internet has taken a big toll,” he said, referring to the ease and convenience of shopping at Amazon.com and other online retailers. “It’s hard to see it getting much better for brick-and-mortar retailers.” Faced with stiff price competition, Fred Meyer may be positioning itself as the higher-end grocer in west Eugene. “I assume Fred Meyer is trying to control that upscale part of the market by providing a quality experience you can’t get at WinCo or Walmart,” Kahle said. Fred Meyer has Portland roots and employs about 1,200 people in Lane County. It has been owned by Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. since 1999. The 34-year-old west Eugene store was due for a facelift. Fred Meyer generally refurbishes its stores every 10 to 15 years, and the West 11th Avenue store hadn’t had an upgrade since 2002, spokesman Zach Stratton said. In its remodel, Fred Meyer is trying to give customers what they say they want — a richer in-store experience for those who want to taste and try products and chat with salespeople or who want the option of not having to set foot in the store by using Fred Meyer’s ClickList online ordering service. “It’s a tough retail environment right now, and everyone feels that,” Stratton said. “For us, the biggest thing is just the changing customer and how customers want to shop, and we’re doing the best we can to meet customers where they are,” he said. “People want to get online and place an order. .... Then we have those who want to come in and browse and have associate interaction every week.” Last year’s $11 million upgrade of Fred Meyer’s Santa Clara store provides a glimpse of how the west Eugene store might look when work is completed in October. “You’re going to see some similarities in decor,” Stratton said. But the west Eugene store will be “the latest and greatest,” he said. Instead of just having a growler fill station, the west Eugene store will have an area where shoppers can sit and drink a glass of wine or beer. It also will have a Murray’s cheese shop. Murray’s opened 40 years ago in New York City’s Greenwich Village. Kroger, Fred Meyer’s parent company, bought Murray’s early this year and has been adding the cheese shops to Fred Meyer stores. Murray’s employees are trained to help customers sample and discover cheeses. The remodel also gives Fred Meyer the opportunity to set aside space at the west Eugene store for ClickList, its online shopping program. “You need a whole room to store stuff,” Stratton said. “We have to have fridge and freezer space to hold your order for you.” To use ClickList, a customer goes online, places an order, then drops by the store later, pulling into a designated parking spot, Stratton said. Customers call a number on their phone, and Fred Meyer employees bring out the order and help customers load it. There’s no minimum or maximum order, but ClickList orders tend to be large, Stratton said. Customers have been pleased, he said. They can leave notes on the order — for example, three bananas: two yellow and one green, Stratton said. A customer’s first three orders are free; each additional order costs $4.95, he said. Kroger introduced the service in its Cincinnati headquarters about two years ago and brought it to Fred Meyer early last year, Stratton said. Fred Meyer rolled out the same-day pickup service at its Santa Clara store last November. “People love it,” he said. “Customers with kids love it, or elderly customers, especially in the winter here in the Northwest. It’s something we’re continually asked to add; it’s definitely in demand.” The tab for the West 11th Avenue store remodel is expected to be $5 million more than the Santa Clara project. The west Eugene upgrade is larger in scope, Stratton said. “They’re relocating departments, instead of remodeling in place,” he said. Construction crews are adding infrastructure, such as more energy-­efficient refrigeration, and a new roof, Stratton said. “So those kinds of costs add up.” The biggest challenge of the remodel is keeping customers and employees informed of constant changes inside the store, he said. “It’s always a challenge when customers and associates have become so accustomed to how a store has been since 2002 to come in and bread is in a different aisle or a department is down for a day,” Stratton said. “We rely on our associates to be knowledgeable and be that reassuring voice guiding customers through this.” With many remodeling projects under their belt, Fred Meyer officials know how to predict customer shifts, Stratton said. “It’s pretty typical for a small decline in traffic while people try another place during the remodel, but it’s not significant,” he said. “It’s not a huge drop for us.” Managers order products daily and keep track of sales compared with the previous month and the previous year, Stratton said. “Our biggest priority in all this is friendly associates to guide customers and keeping things in stock,” he said. “Whatever is on your list, we want it to be in that day.” Refurbishing each department while staying open is like a “big jigsaw puzzle,” Stratton said. Crews organize the work into 100 small areas, so they might have to temporarily move products while they work on a specific area, he said. During the seven-month project, contractors will work through the night, especially as they near completion. “We try to do a lot of the loud drilling between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.,” Stratton said. The store plans to keep its current departments: food, shoes, apparel, toys, garden, home improvement, furniture, housewares, electronics, jewelry and pharmacy. The Starbucks coffee shop has been closed temporarily but will reappear when the project is completed, he said. The pharmacy has been moved temporarily to another space in the shopping center, west of Fred Meyer’s main entrance. Fred Meyer generally follows the lead of what customers are saying in-person and through online surveys, Stratton said. Customers say they’re interested in healthy eating and living, and in natural, organic and local foods, so Fred Meyer is stocking more of those, he said. “It’s a big trend,” said Dan Phillips, managing partner of Phillips Enterprises Inc., a food market design company based in Langley, Wash. “People are more aware of what they’re putting in their bodies,” he said. “They want to know where it’s coming from.” “You’re seeing (retailers) like Fred Meyer dump a lot of money into these programs. ... This is their answer to Whole Foods.” Some Fred Meyer stores are reducing their electronics or furniture departments, Stratton said, adding that he didn’t know if that was the plan in west Eugene. “There are always going to be people who go to Fred Meyer and get groceries for the week and a pair of sandals, or a piece of lawn furniture,” Stratton said. “We’re not going to change that one-stop shopping that people enjoy and expect at Fred Meyer.” Phillips said Fred Meyer’s hybrid department/grocery store is “a great concept.” “You can go and not only get your entire cart of food, but you can get sheets, and a couple of shirts for the kids, and Levi’s jeans and Carhartts,” he said. “I’ve gone in and bought my fishing license at the same time and a quart of oil for my car.” Phillips said the grocery side probably helps Fred Meyer at a time when many traditional department stores are struggling. “I bet that’s a high profit margin for them in the grocery portion that helps balance out sales (in other departments),” he said. Whether a remodel will pay for itself — and how quickly — depends on a store’s weekly sales, Phillips said. He figures a busy Fred Meyer store could pay for a $16 million remodel in less than a year. Also, Kroger, Fred Meyer’s parent company, is footing the bill. Kroger reported profits of almost $2 billion on revenues of $115 billion last year. “I would say the $16 million bill probably won’t impact (Kroger’s) bottom line,” Phillips said.

Aloha Mayor, Q: I am extremely worried about the future of Maui with a huge influx of illegal Mexican immigrants and the homeless population from the mainland (given one-way tickets from the city that is ridding itself of them). My husband and children are of Hawaiian/Japanese blood. I worked in migrant farm education while finishing my master’s degree—the drugs, gang violence and abuse of the welfare system are outrageous. We have a huge local population that could be assisted with these funds—I am scared for our future on Maui. At least 20% of the population in Target, Ross and Walmart are from Mexico. I am by no means prejudiced—I am just worried about the impact this group will have on the job market, taking away jobs from our local population because they don’t pay taxes and can undercut them. ADVERTISEMENT Please address these issues—please. With aloha… A: You raise several broad-ranging questions that span a variety of jurisdictions, agencies and oversight. I have not heard of a “huge influx” of illegal immigrants from Mexico or elsewhere, but if that were the case, we would rely on federal immigration officials to monitor and enforce existing laws. It should be noted that over several generations, Hawai‘i has seen waves of migrants from around the world who came here to work, such as on the sugar cane plantations—which may be the reason your husband’s Japanese family members came here. My own great-grandparents came here from Okinawa to farm. In today’s economy, even with our current low unemployment rate we sometimes rely on legal immigrants who are willing to take service jobs that others may not want to apply for. And when it comes to families living on the beach with children, we do not discriminate in our offer to help them find shelter and services. My own great-grandparents came here from Okinawa to farm.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why It's Better to Stay Invested, Even When the Market Is Unpredictable The market is full of volatility, and huge drops are known to happen, but it’s still best for investors to buy and hold through it all. Motley Fool Staff Apr 30, 2017 at 5:30PM It can be tempting to try to time the market, and get out before the crashes and recessions, but there's a mountain of research that suggests it's much better for investors to fight that urge and stay invested. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann go over some of that research and explain why it's so important to stay invested for years at a time, and not try to miss bad days or months. Also, they talk about the best thing an investor can do for their returns, and how investors should feel about buying into a bull market like this, where so many companies look a bit overvalued compared to their average prices. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 21, 2017. Dylan Lewis: I think a couple things that underpin why it's better to stay invested, even with the unpredictability of the market. There's a ton of volatility out there. Since 1928 -- this is a stat that I love -- the S&P 500 has lost 20% or more in six years -- 1930, 1931, 1937, 1974, 2002, and 2008. Aside from Great Depression years, in the following year of each 20% drop, the market has roared back with 25% or more return. So, the good and bad tend to follow each other very closely.  If you look at things on an individual basis, as well, JPMorgan puts out this guide to retirement every year, it's kind of an overview of asset allocation, different strategies, and they also looked at the impact of staying fully invested versus missing certain days in the market. Over 1996 to 2015, missing the 40 best days in the market takes your returns negative if you had been invested in the S&P 500, and six of the ten best days for the market during that period were within two weeks of the ten worst days. So, individually picking and looking at these individual indicators can be really difficult, and oftentimes the market tends to flip very quickly. Again, getting to timing, it's really difficult to nail that down. David Kretzmann: Yeah. If you're hesitant to buy today, you have to figure out, what would make you a buyer of stocks? Would it be after a 10% drop? A 15% drop? A 30% drop? What are you waiting for to be a net buyer of stocks? And making that kind of timing decision is incredibly difficult. That's why you have great investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch who say, "Do not do market timing, it's probably the worst thing you can do for your future returns as an investor." Often, psychologically, when the market is down 8%, you might think, "Oh, I'm just going to wait until it's down a little bit more, I'm going to wait for it to recover a little bit," and you get into these mind games where you're hurting your future returns, because making that timing decision of both when to buy and when to sell, it just raises the probability that you're going to mess up somewhere along the line. As you've outlined in a nice way, Dylan, the key is to be invested through the good and the bad times. I know later in the show, we'll talk about some different ways that you can invest in a way that you're still comfortable and you're sleeping well at night, which is what you should do.  But the best thing you can do as an investor, the main advantages you have, here at the Fool, we believe, first, in, investing in individual companies. So, you have to factor that in. You're not necessarily buying an index fund, or buying a whole collection of companies. You're focusing on individual businesses. As an individual investor, your main advantages are, you can try to find and invest in and hold the greatest businesses out there -- the Apples, the Alphabets, the Facebooks, the Amazons, those kinds of companies -- and then you can also hold for a really long time. On Wall Street, the average holding period for a stock is now less than six months. Back in 1960, it was over eight years. The average holding period for a stock today is weeks or months. But, as an individual investor, you can say, "I'm just going to tune out that short-term noise. I want to invest in great businesses. I don't care about what's going to happen over the next year or two, I'm more interested in, what is Amazon or Facebook or Apple going to look like in 10 or 15 years, not what they're going to look like in the next year." So, as an investor, the best thing you can do is lengthen your holding period, or your time horizon. Our former Fool colleague Morgan Housel has done some incredible research on this, looking back at historical S&P 500 data going back to 1870. He found, if you had held a stock for one year, basically looking at every incremental one-year period going back to 1871, if you just held for one year, it's basically like flipping a coin. One year you will be up, one year you'll be down. It's flipping a coin, basically gambling, if you're just trying to predict where things are going to go where things are going to go over the next year. But if you lengthen that out to five years, 10 years, 20 years, the odds of you making money at the end of those longer holding periods increases each time. There's actually been no 20 year period that if you had bought and held the S&P 500 over 20 years where you lost money. That's after inflation. That includes the Great Depression, it includes the Great Recession. Really, the message there is, the No. 1 best thing you can do as an investor to guarantee higher returns is to lengthen your time horizon.  Lewis: You talked about investing in individual companies. I think that's something that can get lost in the huge macro stories we see. Very often, will something that is a sweeping macro issue really impact a company like Facebook? The fundamentals that underlie the businesses that you're investing in probably aren't touched all that much by something like rising interest rates. Yes, it will at least be something that impacts of broad market, but they still have the user growth they have, they still have the base of advertisers that are happy to put stuff on their platform. So, you have to remember that you're investing in the individual business, and while it's scary that there might be some rumors circulating about cataclysmic stuff going on in the market, the fundamentals of that business are really what's underpinning your investment. Kretzmann: Definitely. Within the Odyssey II portfolio in Supernova that I head up with a team of a few other Fools, I will admit that we are having a harder time finding glaring bargains with individual companies right now. Stocks are, for the most part, more expensive than they typically are. You get outside of your comfort level a little bit. But we're tasked every month with managing this real money portfolio, and we have to make a purchase every month. The approach we take there is just focusing on the individual businesses. We'll build up positions in companies over time. I think at a time like this, you want to build positions in companies that you'll be comfortable adding to if they go on sale 20%, if they go down 20% to 40%. So, maybe that's Amazon, maybe it's Alphabet. Whatever it is, companies that you feel pretty confident will be around over the next 10-15 years, companies that are generating strong cash flow, maybe they pay a dividend, maybe you start with a small position and then say, "You know what? I would actually really be happy if I could buy this company for a 30% discount, because I don't care where it'll be in a year or two. I'm more interested in the next five to 10 years or more." Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

It's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service - one that could undercut Google's growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Alphabet's first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues.  YouTube's inability to keep big-brand ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google's digital family into a problem child, although it's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service THE AD BOYCOTT  Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen.    Major advertisers didn't start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. However, it was good news for Alphabet Inc's non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store. It has long been sandwiched between Google's advertising juggernaut and its moonshot ventures that have captured popular imagination. Not any more. The business, categorized as 'Other Revenue' in its earnings report, posted a 49.4 percent jump in revenue to $3.10 billion on Thursday - a sum already bigger than Twitter Inc's annual revenue. The business now represents about 13 percent of Alphabet's total revenue, compared with 10 percent a year earlier. That may not be a big jump but definitely shines a light on Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc. The company's earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion.  Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday's extended trading. 'In Q1, our largest growth in headcount and capital expenditure was in cloud,' Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts on Thursday. Amazon's cloud business grew 43 percent to $3.66 billion in the first quarter. Microsoft's cloud unit grew 93 percent. 'We believe Google will continue to gain traction in the cloud market, and when combined with Google Play and sales of Google's hardware products, we see Google's 'other' revenue growing 38 percent to nearly $14 billion in 2017,' Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi wrote in a client note.

Share this article Share However, it was good news for Alphabet Inc's non-advertising business, which houses its cloud unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store. The company's hardware business also started gaining traction after Google released a pair of high-profile hardware products last year - the Pixel phone and the Google Home, a smart speaker like Amazon's Echo. But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year.  Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. 'There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person,' says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had 'thousands and thousands' of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. 'They don't want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don't have to because they have many other choices.' Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had 'thousands and thousands' of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands.  'We are evolving overall to a better place,' Pichai said. At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing 'extraordinary' growth without providing specifics. Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won't leave a huge dent in Alphabet's earnings.  That's because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company's golden goose - Google's dominant search engine.  Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet's revenue even as it expands into other fields. Experts say the results show Google's efforts to cut down its dependence on revenue from advertising, where it competes with Facebook Inc, are working But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. Before the boycott began, YouTube's ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's finances. Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. 'This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand,' says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.)  The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube.  FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. This Wednesday, April 26, 2017, photo shows the Google mobile phone icon, in Philadelphia. Alphabet Inc., parent company of Google, reports financial results, Thursday, April 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. 'It's going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away,' he said. 'There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term.' Investors, however, apparently aren't too worried so far. YouTube's financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google's ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet's net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike.

The major lenders are expected to unveil more that $15b in profits in the coming days More evidence house price growth in Sydney and Melbourne slowed over April Footwear retailer RCG Corp plunges on an earnings downgrade Investors are similarly unimpressed with a sales downgrade from Mayne Pharma Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:43pm on 1 May 2017 That's it for Markets Live today. Thanks for reading and your comments.        See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 4:43pm on 1 May 2017 If the Reserve Bank was still retaining its narrow focus on keeping inflation between 2 and 3 per cent per annum, it would be cutting interest rates at its May meeting on Tuesday. Futures traders and economists are almost certain it won't, and will, instead, keep rates steady for the ninth straight month when it meets tomorrow. Market economists are glad for the RBA's ability to look beyond inflation rates when setting the interest rate – though opinions differ on what exactly it should be focusing on. The domestic economic is growing, but still weak. And the currency is still high – factors that some say should lead the RBA to cut rates. But record-low interest rates, others argue, have added oomph to booming housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne, leading them to conclude raising interest rates would be the most effective way to address this. "I think they should be cutting," said Market Economics' Stephen Koukoulas, an economic adviser to former prime minister Julia Gillard. "We had confirmation last week that underlying inflation has been stuck below the bottom of the target band for what, 18 months, and shows few signs of picking up. "We've got no prospect of underlying inflation moving into the target. "Add to that unemployment edging up, underemployment high, retail sales weak ... to me those criteria would suggest that we need lower rates." If the RBA were solely concerned with inflation-targeting, it would be cutting to 1 per cent, said Capital Economics' chief Australia/New Zealand economist Paul Dales. The Australian economy, he said, would benefit from a lower currency.  "One thing [RBA] governor [Philip] Lowe has communicated effectively is his growing concerns about financial stability. That's why economists are thinking on these lines – governor Lowe himself said he's concerned about dealing with a mess in five years' time when the housing market pops. "I think interest rates should be around where they are – and should stay there for a long time. It's not an ideal situation ... but now is not the right time to keep going [at inflation]."

Housing prices, which have in Sydney doubled since 2009 and are contributing to high indebtedness of some households - a topic RBA Governor Philip Lowe is due to give a speech about on Thursday. Photo: Bloomberg 4:38pm on 1 May 2017 Shares have ended at the session's high and now within 50 points of the elusive 6000-point level after news late morning suggested US congress had managed a deal that would avoid a government shutdown helped push Wall St futures higher and helped the ASX overcome its early wobbles. OK, that's a long lede, but stay with us. The ASX 200 added 32 points or 0.5 per cent to 5956, preparing for another assault on the 6000-mark - a threshold it tried and failed to overcome on four different occasions some 2 years ago. Its looking increasingly likely the banks will push us over the brink thanks to what are expected to be strong earnings numbers in the coming days. They moved in and out of favour this morning before ultimately pushing higher: Westpac added 0.7 per cent, ANZ 0.6 per cent, NAB 0.3 per cent and CBA 0.1 per cent. Macquarie added 1.2 per cent. Only one in four of the top 200 names were lower, reflecting the day's gains was more than a financial sector story. Telstra's 0.9 per cent gain was a help, as was a 1.4 per cent jump in Wesfarmers and a more modest 0.6 per cent gain. BHP added 0.7 per cent, but Rio and Fortescue lost 1 per cent. South32 fell 2.2 per cent. Mayne Pharma was the worst performer in the top 200 after announcing lower than expected sales from its generic drugs portfolio. Outside the bigger names, footwear retailer RCG Corp plunged 27 per cent on an earnings downgrade. Winners and losers today in the top 200. Photo: Bloomberg 4:18pm on 1 May 2017 In our latest instalment of "healthcare stocks behaving badly" (allegedly): Australia's largest private hospital operator Ramsay Health Care is being accused of threatening to reduce surgeons' access to operating theatres in Coffs Harbour if they became involved with a competitor. Competition regulator ACCC brought a Federal Court claim against Ramsay on Monday, alleging misuse of market power and exclusive dealing. ACCC alleges when Ramsay became aware that a group of Coffs Harbour surgeons were planning to establish a competing private day surgery facility in Coffs Harbour, senior Ramsay executives told these surgeons if they became involved with the competitor Ramsay would substantially reduce or withdraw their access to operating theatre time at Baringa Hospital. It is alleged the surgeons suspended their plans to establish a competing day surgery as a result of Ramsay executives' threats. Ramsay operates Baringa Private Hospital and the Coffs Harbour Day Surgery, the only private hospital and private day surgery facilities in the Coffs Harbour region. "New independent day surgeries in other areas have increased competition, reduced waiting lists and costs, delivered greater choice, and improved access to surgical procedures. It is vital to ensure such competition is not stamped out by established operators," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said. "Misuse of market power and other anti-competitive practices can cause significant harm to consumers, other businesses, and the competitive process more generally, which is why we believe this is an important case for us to take," he said. ACCC is seeking pecuniary penalties, declarations, compliance program orders and legal costs against Ramsay. Ramsay said in an ASX statement it intends to vigorously defend the matter. "As the matter is now before the court, Ramsay will not be making any further comment ont he allegations other than as required to keep the market informed in accordance with its continuous disclosure obligations." Ramsay shares fell 1.4 per cent today to $70.70. 3:37pm on 1 May 2017 Mayne Pharma buried its bad news a long way back in its presentation to investors today but when shareholders caught on their reaction was sharp. The company's shares plunged more than 10 per cent after it revealed sales for a flagship suite of US generic drugs would not meet guidance. The news was buried on on page 107 of a 110-page oupdate released to coincide with an investor day the company was holding today. The company said in the investor update that tougher generic drug pricing was behind the revised guidance for the suite of drugs called the Teva portfolio. Mayne bought the portfolio of drugs from pharmaceutical giant Teva Pharmaceuticals last year for $845 million. The aquisition saw Mayne's first-half profit soar 278 per cent to $72.7 million in February. Mayne, which is worth more than $1.8 billion, re-affirmed its full-year profit guidance only a few weeks ago during its first half results in February. Chief executive Scott Richards said at the time that the outlook for the group "continues to be positive with significant growth opportunities from recent acquisitions, new product launches, further business development activities and transaction-related revenue and cost synergies." He said the generic product division would benefit in the second half from a full six-months' contribution from the Teva product acquisition. Mayne shares also dived in December on the back of a US price fixing lawsuit. The civil complaint filed by 20 US states accuses six companies – including Teva and Mayne – of conspiring to artificially inflate prices on an antibiotic and a diabetes drug.

The company's bad news was buried at the end of a 110-page update. Photo: Josh Robenstone Back to top 3:10pm on 1 May 2017 US House and Senate negotiators reached a tentative bipartisan deal on Sunday night (Monday AEDT) on a $US1.1 trillion bill to keep the government open until the end of September, according to Republican and Democratic aides. GOP leaders eager to focus on health care and tax overhauls bowed to Democratic demands to eliminate hundreds of policy restrictions aimed at curbing regulations from the bill, leaving the Trump administration with few victories. The White House sought funding to begin building the border wall, a well as $18 billion in cuts to domestic agencies, and both demands were rebuffed. The spending deal includes money for Planned Parenthood, despite Republican demands to defund the group over its provision of abortions. The deal's provisions were described by aides on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement. President Donald Trump will be able to point to a $15 billion boost for the Pentagon, although $2.5 billion of that money is contingent on the administration delivering a new plan to fight Islamic State. Trump also will get a $1.5 billion for border security, but it can't be used for the border wall or additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to a congressional aide. There are also no new restrictions on money going to so-called sanctuary cities that don't fully enforce federal immigration laws. "This agreement is a good agreement for the American people, and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday night in a statement. "The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren't used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle-class relies on, like medical research, education, and infrastructure." Donald Trump will be able to point to a $15 billion boost for the Pentagon. Photo: AP 2:33pm on 1 May 2017 The backer of a Chinese joint-venture in advanced talks with Quintis to become its new preferred buyer in China is a former director of the Australian sandalwood grower. Graeme Scott has held board seats on Quintis' finance arm Arwon Finance, Quintis Forestry, Quintis Leasing and the parent Quintis, which was known as TFS at the time. Those directorships concluded in 2005 and 2006 and he remains a shareholder of the Perth-based group. Mr Scott is one of the parties behind a joint venture in China that is in negotiations with Quintis to become potentially its biggest buyer in China, following a disclosure in March that Quintis' largest buyer had yet to place an order this year amid a crackdown on duty avoidance by mainland importers. In an update on Monday, Quintis told shareholders that it struck an agreement with a mystery plantation investor at the eleventh hour to extend the life of a put option worth more than $30 million. The put, which if exercised forces Quintis to buy back immature sandalwood trees off the investor at a fixed price of previously $33.9 million, was due to expire on April 30. It is the second time it has been rolled over. Under the new terms, and "in light of the current corporate activity", it can be exercised between either July 10 to 14, or December 11 to 15 this year. If the investor exercises their option in the July window, the value of the contract is unchanged. If the investor elects to exercise in December, the value of the put increases by 6.25 per cent, a sweetener of 15 per cent on the equivalent annual rate. Quintis became a target of intense short selling when a contested research report published by US hedge fund Glaucus argued that Quintis shares were worth zero and likened the business to a Ponzi scheme, claims that the company consistently disputes. The subsequent fall in its share price was followed by the exit of its founder and chief executive Frank Wilson, who declared a plan to partner with a backer and take back the company. 1:57pm on 1 May 2017 In an up-and-down day the ASX is once again pushing higher, with fluctuating interest in the major lenders accounting for much of the action. The ASX 200 is up 17 points, or by 0.3 per cent, to 5941. As mentioned, the big four banks are the swing factor. After starting all higher, they copped some selling later in the morning but are now mixed.  Westpac and ANZ are up a touch, NAB is flat, while CBA is off 0.3 per cent. Rio and Fortescue are down, but BHP has climbed. South32 is down 2 per cent, Wesfarmers is recovering from its trading update last week, up 1.7 per cent, while Woolies is 0.3 per cent ahead. One of the worst performers is Mayne Pharma, down 10 per cent as it lowered it sales guidance in its Teva generic drugs business. 1:50pm on 1 May 2017 The flood of Israeli-based start-ups listing on the ASX is showing no signs of abating, with secure communications technology company Elsight the latest planning to go public on the exchange. The company is raising $6.5 million at 20¢ a share and a valuation of $18.17 million. It has met with a range of institutional investors and family offices on a roadshow in Australia this month. It joins the likes of Israeli firms Votiro Cybersec and CyberGym which are also listing on the ASX this year. Chief executive and co-founder Nir Gabay said the stock market in Israel was "weak", so firms had started looking for other options. "The next option was the NASDAQ, but you need to be a $1 billion company to list there, then you look at Hong Kong, but even then you need to be a $150 million company," he said. "But there is a good relationship between the ASX and Israel, so that was the best option for us." As part of the listing, Elsight has created a new Elsight Limited Australia company which will acquire the assets of Elsight Israel. The Israeli company is already profitable, having made a net profit of $US98,000 ($131,000) for the full year to December 31 and $US932,000 in revenue. Elsight's technology is designed for in-the-field communications and allows video and other data streams to be sent securely over multiple networks simultaneously, increasing bandwidth and allowing video to be streamed from the other side of the world in almost real time. It works by splitting the data into packages, encrypting these and then transmitting them via multiple sim cards, WiFi, LAN or radio networks and then reassembling it at the other end. The company was founded in 2009 by Mr Gabay and Roee Kashi, with the men having come from the Israeli special forces and military intelligence. Until recently Elsight had been prevented from selling internationally by the Israeli government. Elsight currently has customers in Israel, South Africa, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. The capital raised through the listing will go towards research and development, as well as marketing, as it expands into other industries such as logistics, transport and media. Elsight co-founders Roee Kashi and Nir Gabay are taking the company public on the ASX. Photo: Paul Jeffers 1:17pm on 1 May 2017 "It always feels odd talking in 't's and 'trillions' not 'b's and 'billions'," Duncan Burns says. "But we never lose sight of the fact that its our clients' money and they have entrusted us to manage it."   The former Wall Street investment banker and hedge fund trader probably oversees more money than just about any portfolio manager in Australia, but he's an unlikely subject for a profile. If Burns has any views on the market, compelling stock tips or diatribes about the stupidity of central bankers and politicians, he's not willing to share them. Instead, Vanguard's head trader wants to talk about how he and his team invest and trade hundreds of billions of dollars trying to track the region's stock market indices at the lowest cost. Last year he said, his team traded $100 billion of stocks in the region. "If we can save one basis point through more efficient trading on that $100 billion, that's $10 million saved in investors' accounts, right where it belongs." The one dominant trend in funds management is how every day, billions of dollars are given up on trying to beat the market, and moving from active funds to lower-cost passive funds. Vanguard, by virtue of its ultra low costs, has captured much of this flow and has swelled its assets under management to $5.4 trillion, of which $2.9 trillion are tracking equity indices around the world. The portfolio managers and traders based in Melbourne are responsible for $93 billion of funds across the Asia-Pacific region. As Burns explains, they're some of the toughest and highest cost equity markets in the world and when the objective is to track the stock market at the lowest possible cost. It's a daily challenge. "Indexing is really simple to understand and implement. However, it requires a lot of behind-the-scenes work to execute well. "The benchmark indices are calculated without the frictional cost of transacting in the real world – so right out of the gate we are behind as an indexing community." Read more at the AFR. Vanguard portfolio manager Duncan Burns doesn't give stock tips. Photo: Pat Scala Back to top 12:44pm on 1 May 2017 Footwear retailer RCG Corp has slashed full-year profit guidance by 11 per cent – the second downgrade in three months – after sales of brands such as Skechers, Vans and Doc Martens remained weak in March and April. RCG, which owns Hype DC, The Accent Group and The Athletes Foot, now expects underlying EBITDA for the year ending June to come in between $74 million and $80 million, compared with $60 million in 2016. RCG shares have plunged 19 per cent to 67¢ in early trade on Monday, taking losses since February to 50 per cent. RCG cut its guidance in February from $90 million to between $85 million and $88 million after like-for-like sales at Hype went backwards in the eight weeks after Christmas and sales growth slowed in the Accent division.  RCG's co-chief executive Hilton Brett said trading conditions had been challenging in the last two months, confirming anecdotal reports that discretionary spending had remained lacklustre since consumers snapped their handbags closed after Christmas. Mr Brett said like-for-like sales in the Accent Retail and Hype business in March and April were flat. Whilst this was an improvement on trading between Boxing Day and mid-February, when Hype like-for-like sales fell 2.8 per cent, sales had not met management's expectations. The Athlete's Foot failed to grow sales, despite gains at rival chains such as Super Retail Group's Rebel Sport, while same-store sales at RCG's vertical retail business had fallen 5 per cent since mid-February and wholesale sales were below expectations. The latest downgrade is likely to fuel fears that the athleisure trend has peaked after five years of strong growth. "The slowing sales that RCG is experiencing are in line with our view that the growth rates experienced by athleisure footwear will moderate as the cycle matures," Citigroup's small cap consumer analyst Sam Teeger said in a recent report. The struggles at RCG Group may have to do with the waning of the athleisure trend more broadly. Photo: BrettHemmings.com 12:37pm on 1 May 2017 Chinese gas distributor ENN and private equity firm Hony Capital now jointly hold a 12.81 per cent of embattled oil and gas group Santos after ENN revealedtoday that it was "acting in concert" with Hony. The move comes just days before the Santos annual general meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday. ENN, which is itself controlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Yusuo, became a big shareholder in Santos in March 2016 when it bought an 11.7 per cent stake, which had previously been held by Hony Capital. Hony bought up extra shares of its own accord in late 2016 and there has been much speculation in the market that the two had been working in unison. That has now been formalised by the Chinese duo, with the signing of an "Acting in Concert" agreement, which stretches for the next 24 months. There has been speculation from time to time about whether the Chinese firms may eventually seek more control of Santos. Hony originally became a shareholder in late 2015 when it took up a large chunk of shares in Santos as part of a share placement and equity raising. That capital raising and placement followed the rejection by the Santos board of a separate $7 billion takeover bid by an entity called Scepter Partners which was backed by the royal families of Brunei and the United Arab Emirates. ENN in late 2016 sent a letter to Santos chairman Peter Coates expressing annoyance at being denied a seat on the board after it pushed for a directorships because of its large holding. A substantial shareholder notice lodged with the ASX on Monday showed that ENN's stake in Santos was now 12.81 per cent, up from 11.82 per cent in the previous notice given by ENN to the ASX on May 2, 2016. Santos has been under the pump in the past week because Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is putting in place by July 1 a mechanism which will allow for the imposition of export controls to be placed on selected gas companies when there there is a shortfall of gas supply in the domestic market. Santos shares are 0.7 per cent lower at $3.46, and have plunged by more than a quarter of the past 12 months. Chinese gas distributor ENN now holds 12.81 per cent of Santos. Photo: Supplied 11:51am on 1 May 2017 Prices in Sydney and Melbourne slowed in April mainly due to falls in apartment prices, but more data is needed before a cooling is confirmed, CoreLogic said in its April Hedonic Home Value Index. There was no increase in Sydney's overall house price in April while Melbourne's house price rose a small 0.5 per cent. Canberra posted the largest fall in prices among the capital cities of 2.8 per cent.  "The two hottest housing markets in the nation have shown signs of slowing down in April, with the CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index recording a rise of just 0.1 per cent over April, the lowest month-on-month rise in capital city dwelling values since December 2015," head of research Tim Lawless said. "The moderation in growth was due largely to a slightly negative April result in Australia's largest capital city housing market, Sydney, where dwelling values were broadly flat over the month." "The market is slowing down but we need to see a few more months before we make a a conclusion that the market has peaked. It's [still] coming down from such a high base." "We need to be cautious in calling a peak in the market after only one month of soft results. April, in particular, coincides with seasonal factors including Easter, school holidays and ANZAC day long weekend." Mr Lawless classified the fall in prices in Canberra and even a rise in prices in Darwin as "noise". But the impact of APRA's tightening on investor loans should not be disregarded although property agents said the impact of cooling measures would take time and over several months. "The softer results should also be viewed against a backdrop of an ever evolving regulatory landscape s which is firmly aimed at slowing investment and interest-only mortgage lending," Mr Lawless added. "Testament to this is mortgage rates which have been edging higher, particularly for investors and interest-only loans, as well as rental yields which have been hovering around record lows. The higher cost of debt, as well as stricter lending and servicing criteria, has likely dented investment demand over recent months." Sydney house prices have risen more than 70 per cent since 2012, but there has been a slowdown in April.  Photo: Wolter Peeters 11:30am on 1 May 2017 Photo: The Wall Street Journal A year ago, many investors had given up on Apple, whose stock price had fallen more than 30 per cent from its 2015 peak. Apple's once-unstoppable growth had come to a crashing halt: the number of iPhones sold was down 13 per cent, and the company posted its first revenue decline in 13 years. Today, Apple's business remains sluggish, but that hasn't stopped investors, including the famously tech-averse Warren Buffett, from falling in love with it again. Shares of the tech giant - the most valuable company in the United States by market value - have repeatedly hit new highs this year. On Friday, they closed at $US143.65, up nearly 60 per cent from last May's trough. What's driving the stock, say sceptics and fans alike, is hope - hope that the new iPhones due in September, after the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone's introduction, will be dazzling enough to inspire existing iPhone users to upgrade and prompt others to switch from Android phones made by Samsung, Huawei and other manufacturers. "Everyone expects Apple to cure cancer with their next product launch," said Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, who has managed tech-focused mutual funds through many ups and downs. Investors will get more data about Apple's performance, and perhaps some clues about its future, on Tuesday (US time), when the company reports its results for the financial quarter that ended in March. Analysts expect the company to report a slight increase in iPhone sales and overall revenue. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal says Apple is expected to report that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion [US] dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the UK and Canada combined. Apple is expected to make more updates in its next high-end iPhone, including a high-resolution screen that covers the phone's entire face. But the company has also suggested that much of its future growth will come from services like Apple Music, Apple Pay and the cut that Apple takes from application sales and subscriptions in the app store.

Despite uncertainly around foreign investment rules, Chinese companies pumped $15.4 billion into Australian deals last year with commercial property, infrastructure and agriculture the most popular. Now in its sixth year the report, Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia, found that mining, once the backbone of the investment relationship, had dropped to sixth place with deals worth $839 million last year, down 35 per cent from 2015.  Co-author of the report, Doug Ferguson from KPMG, said Australia's investment relationship with China continued to diversity with a record number of deals in 2016, while more of these than ever before were done by private companies. Just under half the value of Chinese investment in Australia last year was conducted by private companies, although many of these would have received financing from state-owned banks and retained strong links to Beijing. "Despite the impact of uncertainties about Australia's foreign investment review regime, Chinese investment ... continued to diversity and records were smashed," said Mr Ferguson. He said Chinese investment in Australia was starting to "mature" and that parties from the mainland accepted they often needed to form local joint ventures and take minority stakes for high profile deals. This attitude saw property develop Shanghai CRED team-up with Gina Reinehart and accept a minority stake in the purchase of the Kidman cattle empire. But while Australia retains its second place behind the United States in the aggregate value of Chinese investment since 2007, another of the report's co-authors warns that others were catching up. While forecasting strong outbound investment over the longer term, the reported noted efforts by Beijing to moderate capital outflows to keep the yuan relatively strong may impact deals this year. "Real estate, hotels, films, entertainment and sports clubs are among the industries singled out as exhibiting a tendency for 'irrational' overseas investments," the report said. "This is expected to impact investment flows to these sectors in the future." Chinese investment in Australia is at its highest point since the 2008 global financial crisis, according to a new report. Photo: Rolex Dela Pena Back to top 10:33am on 1 May 2017 Shares have shaken off a soft overseas lead to open firmly higher in early trade as investors bet on solid bank results amid a broad uplift. The ASX 200 is up 21 points or 0.3 per cent at 5945 points. Investors are still happy to push banks higher ahead of earnings numbers, Westpac up 0.4 per cent, while ANZ and CBA have added 0.3 per cent. NAB is only marginally higher, while Macquarie continues to push towards its pre-GFC highs, adding another 1.3 per cent. Gains in Woolies, Wesfarmers, Tesltra and CSL are all bolstering the index as it climbs towards 6000 points. Mining and energy stocks are the drags, with BHP off 0.2 per cent, Rio down 0.3 per cent and Rio 1.2 per cent despite Friday night's strong increase in spot iron ore prices. Yesterday's weaker than expected Chinese factory activity indicator may have had something to do with the weakness for the sector. South32 is down 0.5 per cent. In energy, Origin's 1 per cent drop, Santos's 0.7 per cent loss and Oil Search's 0.6 per cent is weighing against the morning's gains. Among the morning's biggest movers is Platinum Asset Mgt, which has dropped 4.4 per cent, while gold miners feature strongly in the best performers. Winners and losers in the ASX 200 this morning. Photo: Bloomberg 10:07am on 1 May 2017 The combined profits of Australia's big four banks likely exceeded $15 billion in the first half, as lenders started to benefit from a round of late 2016 interest rate hikes and strong home loan growth. Big four investors have enjoyed share price gains of more than 6 per cent so far this year, and half-year results from three of the big four in the coming weeks are expected to show profits also ground higher across the industry. Even so, there remains a question mark about whether NAB and Westpac can sustain their dividends, as the industry prepares for looming rules that may force lenders to set aside billions more in capital. ANZ will kick off the half-year bank reporting season tomorrow, with analysts tipping a $3.5 billion cash profit in the six months to March, and a flat interim dividend of 80¢ a share. NAB on Thursday is tipped to deliver earnings of $3.25 billion and also keep its dividend flat. Macquarie Group, whose share price last week closed at $93, not far off its 2007 record high of $97.10, is tipped to deliver a full-year profit of more than $2.1 billion on Friday. That would exceed last year's record of $2.06 billion for the investment bank, which will be among the biggest local winners from promised company tax cuts in the United States. Next week, Westpac's profits are expected to exceed $4 billion and CBA, which reports on June financial year, will post a quarterly update, after it notched up half-year profits of $4.84 billion in February. Profits have likely grown across the industry on the back of housing credit growth of 6.5 per cent in the last six months, analysts believe, propelled by higher house prices in Melbourne and Sydney. There are few signs of distress in banks' loan books, and a round of interest rate hikes targeted at property investors in late 2016 may have also helped earnings. "We expect near-term earnings to be well supported by mortgage repricing benefits, investor-led credit growth, benign credit environment and solid trading income," said Macquarie analyst Victor German.

Three of the big four banks post profit results this week, starting with ANZ on Tuesday. Photo: Paul Rovere 9:56am on 1 May 2017 Late last week the S&P 500 volatility index, or VIX, hit its lowest level since 2014, and its second lowest level this decade. "The Vix has plummeted below 11, just as we see the big drivers of the rally beginning to lose steam. Indeed, our derivatives strategy team recently noted that several asset classes were pricing a 'world almost free of risk'," a Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist said in a note late last week. One of your Eds wrote on the topic over the weekend: After years of falling interest rates and central bank support investors have become comfortable buying high and selling higher. Perhaps it's a new bubble: in complacency. What will pop it is anyone's guess. Investors are quick to shrug off worries – France is so last week – and are prepared to buy high in order to sell higher. This is classic bullish behaviour. No surprise there; we are, after all, in a global bull market. Apparently there is no obvious reason for investors to make any dramatic portfolio decisions. Sure, equities are pricey, as are most assets after years of falling rates and central bank bond-buying. But the European Union is not about to break up now that we've decided Le Pen has no chance of winning the second round of French voting. And the global growth upswing is still looking solid. Meanwhile Reuters numbers tell us that listed US companies are having their best quarter of profits since 2011. A global fund manager recently told me that his biggest worry, at least over the short term, was the potential for a big policy mistake in China. The Chinese government has plenty of levers it can pull to maintain growth and stability. The real concern, this fundie said, is that it will pull the wrong ones, or perhaps the right one at the wrong time. That said, a slump on the Shanghai bourse in recent weeks has barely registered globally, despite the falls being driven by a regulatory crackdown on leverage in the Chinese sharemarket. Granted the losses in mainland Chinese shares are not too dramatic, but they have been out of step with the rest of the emerging world, as well as the pro-risk mood more broadly. It suggests investors are not as worried as they were in late 2015 and into 2016 when ham-handed policy interventions sparked a massive wave of anxiety across global markets. Read more at The Financial Review. Investors are apparently not worried about anything much, according to the VIX.  9:44am on 1 May 2017 SPONSORED POST There's something for everyone in markets this week, writes IG strategist Chris Weston: The ASX 200 financial sub-sector needs to hold and build on its break of 7000 and from here make an assault on the 2015 highs which is a mere 2.8% away. Interestingly, the all-time high for the sub-index (from 2007) sits 7.8% away, which seems far more attainable than the broader ASX 200, which needs to appreciate 15.6% to print a new all-time high. The idea of "sell in May and go away" is certainly being talked about, but let's not forget last May the ASX 200 gained 2.4% and despite the average loss over the past decade being 1.6%, most of that can be explained by poor monthly performances in the years between 2010 and 2013. June is actually a far worse month historically to be holding ASX 200 exposure, falling 2.2% on average. We have central bank meetings from the RBA, the Federal Reserve and for FX traders one can also look at the Norges Bank. We have the Fed funds futures pricing at 64% chance of a June hike (from the Federal Reserve), but that pricing mechanism could also easily change given we have pretty much key piece of US economic data being released. Here we see ISM manufacturing (tonight at midnight), core PCE, vehicle sales, services ISM and non-farm payrolls on Friday (consensus 190,000 jobs). We also have the small affair of the French presidential elections on Sunday, and while many see this as a fait accompli, some are showing concern that Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a first round candidate, has formally endorsed Marine Le Pen and this may provide her with a few extra votes. The market doesn't seem too concerned by this though and still see a fairly comfortable victory for Macron, with implied volatility still subdued and EUR/USD nicely supported into $1.0850. Read more. Play Video Replay Video Will bank earnings drive the ASX 200 towards 6000? With ANZ, NAB, MQG and WBC all reporting earnings in the days ahead, will the numbers and outlook breathe further life into a sector that is clearly outperforming. (This video was produced in commercial partnership between Fairfax Media and IG Markets). 9:37am on 1 May 2017 Photo: CBA Growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed faster than expected in April, an official survey showed on Sunday, as producer price rises lost steam and authorities moved to tackle risks in the property market and credit growth. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.2 in April from the previous month's 51.8, which was the strongest reading since April 2012. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a reading of 51.6, the ninth straight month above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Growth in China's services sector slowed slightly to 54.0 in April, compared with the previous month's reading of 55.1, which was the highest since May 2014. Despite the lower PMI figure, the "drivers of industrial recovery remain intact", CBA China and Asia economist Wei Li said. "We expect industrial production growth to register 6.9 per cent year-on-year in April, compared with an average growth rate of 6.8 per cent in Q1," Li wrote. China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter, boosted by higher government infrastructure spending and a gravity-defying property boom. Chinese leaders have pledged to shift the emphasis to addressing financial risks and asset bubbles, which analysts say pose a threat to the world's second-largest economy if not handed well. President Xi Jinping last week called for increased efforts to ward off systemic risks to help maintain financial security, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Some analysts believe China's economic growth may have peaked in the first quarter but that it's on track to hit a target of around 6.5 per cent this year. CBA's Li is more bullish, forecasting the country's GDP to expand by 6.8 per cent in 2017 - the same pace as last year. China's producer price inflation cooled for the first time in seven months in March as iron ore and coal prices tumbled, while property sales growth slowed in the first quarter despite robust property investment.

When detectives started questioning him about Gerald Lee Jensen's disappearance, however, the anger in his voice betrayed his feelings for the man as much as his words. He referred to the missing man in past tense as he talked about his wife Kristan, the mother of Tomlinson's girlfriend Nicole Thornhill. "Like, Kristan, man, I feel sorry for her," he said. "Jerry was just a (expletive)." What detectives would find out, according to prosecutors in Tomlinson's first-degree murder trial, is that Tomlinson had stabbed Jensen to death inside the Stuart apartment he and Thornhill shared with the older couple. A Palm Beach County sanitation worker testified Tuesday that he was using a bulldozer to compact trash at a landfill in April 2008 when he discovered Jensen's decomposed arm sticking out of a pile of rubble. Tomlinson eventually confessed to the killing but said it was self-defense. Assistant State Attorney Erin Kirkwood rejected that theory in her opening statements to jurors, saying the fact that Tomlinson eventually told police that he had plotted the killing showed that he acted out of anger and hatred, not fear. She quoted statements to police in which Tomlinson described Jensen as "evil." Kirkwood and Assistant State Attorney Nita Denton also presented video of Tomlinson and Thornhill purchasing bottles of painkillers at Wal-Mart, drugs they say the two used to try to kill both Gerald and Kristan Jensen. Kristan Jensen testified Tuesday that she reported her husband missing after she returned from a drug detox center. The apartment was messy and smelled of bleach, she said, and she didn't believe her daughter and Tomlinson's explanations that her husband had simply left. Assistant Public Defender Alan Hunt, who along with Assistant Public Defender Jon Hetherington declined to make an opening statement, questioned her about her husband's drug use and past allegations of abuse, including the time she sought a restraining order against him. Kirkwood and Assistant State Attorney Nita Denton told Chief Circuit Judge Steve Levin than they expect to finish presenting witnesses in the case today. If convicted Tomlinson faces life in prison. Thornhill late last year pleaded guilty to second-degree murder charges for her role in Jensen's murder. She is still awaiting sentencing.

Print   Email   Font Resize Local News Pueblo police dig for new clues in woman's 2013 disappearance Investigators scour area near home of ex-boyfriend Donthe Lucas By Jesse Paul The Denver Post Posted:   05/01/2017 10:13:07 PM MDT Pueblo police were again searching and digging for clues Monday in the cold case disappearance of Keslie Schelling, the pregnant Denver woman last seen in 2013 during a trip to meet her ex-boyfriend in southern Colorado. Investigators say they were scouring an area near the home of Donthe Isiah Lucas — Schelling's former boyfriend, who has been called a person of interest in her disappearance. The search Monday follows a similar operation on April 13 at the former family home of Lucas. "We're looking for anything that helps us answer the questions," Pueblo Police spokesman Sgt. Eric Gonzales. "At this time, they've found nothing." Pueblo detectives were working alongside members of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation near the Lucas family home. Gonzales said investigators were in the 1600 block of Savannah Drive. "This is just the continuing efforts in the investigation," Gonzales said. "This is just about a mile from last search that we did." A photo from the scene appeared to show authorities working in a park or open space using heavy machinery. Schelling was 19 years old when she disappeared under suspicious circumstances on Feb. 4, 2013. Schelling was on her way from Denver to meet Lucas in Pueblo when she went missing. A video camera at a Pueblo Walmart recorded her car as it was driven into the store's parking lot at 12:05 a.m., the next day. Schnelling took the trip to show Lucas an ultrasound image. Advertisement Schelling's vehicle was parked and left at the Walmart. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation says an unknown man came back and picked up the car, at black 2011 Chevrolet Cruze LTZ, which was found on Feb. 7, 2013, at St. Mary Corwin Hospital in Pueblo. "A surveillance video showed the vehicle arriving in the parking lot on Feb, 7, 2013, and an unknown person walking away," CBI says on its cold case page about Schelling's disappearance. Schelling has not been found. Her family sued Lucas and Pueblo police in 2015.

The only negative Yeti had, was the price of their products. Now Rtic and Ozark Trail have joined the game and are giving Yeti a run for their actual money. We bring it all together, so you can skip the long-winded YouTube videos and excessive forum rants, and get to saving money. Construction The Yeti, Rtic and Ozark Trail cups are all essentially the same cup by manufacturing standards. Double wall, stainless steel, vacuum sealed insulation and plastic lids with a rubber ring. According to Yeti and Rtic, they are both made out of 18/8 stainless steel. We cannot find any information on the stainless steel used with the Ozark Tumbler. We attempted to find the approximate weight of each cup but it was listed differently on numerous sites. The only conclusion we could make is the Rtic tumblers are slightly lighter in weight. Design The Yeti, Rtic and Ozark Trail tumblers appear to look the same, though dimension vary very slightly. At a distance one could not tell them apart. Each brand has their logo stamped on the side of the cup, near the bottom, and also on the plastic lid. Rtic does have a slightly different, and better, lid design. A larger drink opening on the Rtic lid allows for a straw to be inserted. Rtic also sells a Splash Proof lid that closes over the drinking hole for $5.99. It should be noted that the lids are interchangeable between all three brands. Cost The part we all care about, money. Here is the break down from Yeticoolers.com, Rticcoolers.com and Walmart.com (Ozark Trail): Yeti: 20oz $29.99 / 30oz $39.99 Rtic: 20oz $14.99 / 30oz $19.99 Ozark: 20oz $7.74 / 30oz $9.74 Performance Here are some good comparison videos but if you don’t want to watch them, I will save you the time. The cups all work identical. There seems to be no difference in the effectiveness of the cups vs their price. Conclusion It is hard to say you need to spend your money on a Yeti when the Ozark Trail does just as good. The only negative we can say about the Ozark Trail is it can be a little hard to find in stock in a local Wal-mart. Just some tips for using one of these cups. If you plan to use your tumbler, place it in the refrigerator before filling it. Also attempt to chill your liquid before pouring it over ice. You will be amazed on how much longer your ice will keep. No matter which tumbler brand you own, get out there and enjoy it. Source by Blake W This entry was posted in Uncategorized by admin.

Business Marine veteran entrepreneur launches sunglasses company in Palm Beach County Skeleton Optics features high-end sunglasses for an outdoor lifestyle Entrepreneur Mark Llano introduces Skeleton Optics, a maker of high-end sunglasses for people who love the outdoors. Entrepreneur Mark Llano introduces Skeleton Optics, a maker of high-end sunglasses for people who love the outdoors. Marcia Heroux PoundsSun Sentinel Privacy Policy Entrepreneur Mark Llano, a former Marine who built a $200 million-a-year military supply business in Wellington, is scoping out a whole new market for his new business founded about six months ago. Skeleton Optics, also based in Wellington, is a maker of high-end sunglasses for people who love the outdoors. The business is a marked changed from his previous company, Source One Distributors, which sold tactical gear, weapons, safety products and other goods to the military and police departments. In 2015, Source One was acquired by Washington-based military supply company Unifire for an undisclosed amount. “As an entrepreneur, you have to know when it’s time to [move on]. Working with the government is probably one of the best things I’ve ever done. You learn a lot. But when there’s an opportunity to find something different and something invigorating, I found personally it was time to make a change,” said Llano, 48. Llano said the move also made sense financially. With Source One, he took on a lot of financial risk -- which paid off as demand for military supplies grew during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he also saw how quickly lines of credit could disappear during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. He also traveled a lot, booking up to 150,000 miles a year to build Source One. The apex was in 2014 when Source One Distributors won a $10 billion contract from the Defense Logistics Agency. “There were plenty of opportunities during those 14 years to sell. I didn’t feel like it was right then. There was plenty of room to grow,” said Llano, named Florida’s Veteran Small Business Champion of the Year by the U.S. Small Business Administration. That same year, Llano was named Florida Entrepreneur of the Year by management consultant Ernst & Young. Gilbert Colon, deputy district director for the SBA in Miami previously and now in Jacksonville, said Llano is successful as an entrepreneur because of his passion and tenacity. “Everything that Mark touches turns to gold,” Colon said. After serving in the Gulf War including Operation Desert Storm in 1990-1991, Llano earned a degree at the University of South Florida in Tampa. In 1997, he became a founding partner of Sterling Financial Investment Group in Boca Raton. He left in 2000, and founded Source One Distributors in 2003. Llano also is a Porsche race car driver, part of the Serket Racing team founded in 2012 that works to support veterans and their families. In 2015, Llano decided it was time to sell Source One and start a new venture. “Mark loves the challenge of building new companies and learning new industries,” said Lori Stanek, who is chief financial officer of Skeleton Optics and also Llano’s fiancee. Skeleton was a Colorado company purchased mainly for its name. Llano then shut down the company for nine months to develop a new business plan. Llano soon found that the sunglasses business “was a 180-degree change from the military.” “Marketing for the government business was totally different, not even on the same page. We couldn’t talk about certain things, we couldn’t do certain things. [Skeleton] is fun and exciting,” Llano said. For Skeleton, social media is key. So Skeleton posts pictures of people wearing its sunglasses and enjoying outdoor activities on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. “We wanted to people to feel they’re entering into a lifestyle,” Llano said. Llano said Skeleton’s sales are growing quickly through both online sales and retail distributors. “We’ve only been out there a few months and we’re already doing a few hundred thousand dollars in sales,” he said. He said it would have been easy to manufacture sunglasses in China or Taiwan and put their label on them. But he didn’t want to do that. Instead, Skeleton went to Italy to develop frame molds the company now owns and partnered on lenses with Carl Zeiss Vision — known for its vision technology. Designed for a “rustic, Americana outdoor lifestyle,” the sunglasses retail for $180 to $350, with the highest-priced pairs having limited-edition hand-painted frames. More than $100,000 has been invested in the business so far, said Llano, who is the majority owner. The sunglasses were inspired by Llano’s and Stanek’s experiences during the outdoor activities they enjoy -- fishing, hunting, camping, whitewater rafting, and skeet and trap shooting. Other brand sunglasses were always slipping off the nose or fogging up. So their sunglasses are designed with lenses that easily wipe clean and nose pads that resist moisture and are flush to the frame to prevent slippage. Llano said there are major players in the sunglasses market that will make it difficult to break into retail stores. Luxottica, an Italian company with U.S. operations, makes glasses for brands including Chanel, Prada, Coach and Tiffany, as well as owning Ray-Ban, LensCrafters and Sunglass Hut. Other big players are Costco, Walmart and Solstice. That’s why Skeleton is focusing on the outdoor sports market. “If we take a shotgun approach, we’re never going to be successful….The western community — the ranchers, the farmers, those doing backyard BBQs with the family on Sunday, people going duck or waterfowl hunting — that is Americana. Let’s put our energy into that market...and let’s own it,” Llano said. Wellington landscaper Dan Heller signed up as a distributor for Skeleton about six months ago. He knew Llano through his lawn business. “When he sold his other business and decided to open the sunglasses company, it surprised me. But I know how he is. He’s a very driven person. He loves the chase,” Heller said. Heller said he sees steady growth in distribution of the sunglasses to local bait and tackle shops, motorcycle shops, jet ski shops, and places that sell lawn mowers and tractors. Llano said he finds the consumer market rewarding because he can see people wearing and enjoying his product. “You’re never going to please everybody in business, but we know who our customers are, and that’s what we go after,” he said. mpounds@sunsentinel.com or 561-243-6650, twitter: @marciabiz Copyright © 2017, Sun Sentinel Skeleton Wellington LensCrafters All Sections News Sports Broward Palm Beach Entertainment Classified Obituaries 79°

Companies Whose Execs Meet With The President Enjoy Major Perks By Lydia O'Neal @LydsONeal On 05/01/17 AT 1:32 PM Close Donald Trump’s White House plans to keep its visitor logs hidden from the public eye, and that decision might amount to more than a simple transparency issue, according to a new study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research this week. Using data from the administration of former President Barack Obama stretching from 2009 to 2015, researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign linked company leaders’ White House visits to higher prior campaign contributions, rises in their firms’ stock prices, greater regulatory relief and more government contracts. The study, which excluded follow-up visits and meetings of more than 50 participants, also provided a possible insight into why some companies’ share prices sank in the wake of Trump’s surprise election victory last year. “Using the 2016 presidential election as a shock to firms’ political access, we find that firms with access to the Obama administration deliver significantly lower stock returns following the release of the election result than otherwise similar firms that do not have access,” the authors noted. “Overall, our results provide evidence suggesting that political access is of significant value to corporations.” Of the 2,286 meetings between executives and federal officials included in the study, the most frequent visitors were Honeywell International Chairman and then CEO David Cote, with 30 meetings; General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, with 22; and Roger Altman, founder and former executive chairman of the investment banking firm EverCore Partners, with 21. The study authors could complete their work only because the previous administration granted access to its visitor logs — a tradition Trump’s administration has broken with altogether. So far, Trump has convened White House meetings with executives in the manufacturing, tech, trucking, pharmaceutical, health insurance, retail and banking industries. His business advisory group, chaired by Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO and chairman of the private equity firm Blackstone Group, included the CEOs of General Motors, IBM, PepsiCo, Wal-Mart, Boeing and JPMorgan Chase, among others. Democrats have pushed twin bills in the House and Senate seeking to mandate that Trump disclose who visits not only the White House, but other Trump estates where the former reality TV star meets with diplomats and corporate leaders, such as Trump Tower and the Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago estate — commonly dubbed the “Winter White House.” The nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, along with Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute and the National Security Archive, a non-profit foreign policy research institute, sued the Department of Homeland Security in April over the White House’s failure to disclose visitor records. “We hoped that the Trump administration would follow the precedent of the Obama administration and continue to release visitor logs, but unfortunately they have not,” said CREW’s executive director, Noah Bookbinder, in a press release announcing the April 10 lawsuit. “Given the many issues we have already seen in this White House with conflicts of interest, outside influence and potential ethics violations, transparency is more important than ever, so we had no choice but to sue.” Obama announced in September 2009 after similar litigation that his White House would begin posting visitor logs online.National More Political Capital How Oil And Gas Industry Power Shapes Colorado Politics By David Sirota and Josh Keefe While the state is investigating a deadly explosion at a home that was just a few hundred feet from an aging oil well, Democratic lawmakers struggle to advance any bill opposed by the oil and gas industry.

Business Jewel taps longtime exec to lead grocery chain in changing industry Doug Cygan James C.

Svehla / Chicago Tribune) Greg TrotterContact ReporterChicago Tribune Jewel-Osco, the Chicago area's largest traditional grocery store chain, has tapped Doug Cygan as its next president to lead the company forward in a fiercely competitive grocery industry. Cygan, 53, is a Jewel lifer who started with the company as a parking lot cart clerk at age 17 and rose through the ranks, working most recently as vice president of marketing and merchandising. He replaces Mike Withers, who was promoted to executive vice president of retail operations for Boise, Idaho-based parent company, Albertsons Cos. At the helm, Cygan will continue Jewel's efforts to grow and stay relevant with today's consumers in the rapidly changing industry. After Dominick's went out of business in 2013, an influx of new competitors — chains like Mariano's, Heinen's Fine Foods and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market — rushed in to fight for market share. Other factors, such as the rise of e-commerce, also are challenging traditional grocery retailers like Jewel-Osco. "The one thing about Chicago is, it's so competitive (that) it's really driving our company to improve," Cygan said. "Retail is a lot like sports. If you don't improve and compete, you don't survive." Since Dominick's closed, Itasca-based Jewel-Osco has opened 10 more stores, bringing its current total to 186, and remodeled 114 stores, Cygan said. The plan is to keep growing, at a pace of two to five stores per year, and continue revamping the older stores, he said. Jewel-Osco also will be announcing a new e-commerce option for shoppers soon, Cygan said. Other chains like Meijer and Mariano's recently have unveiled their own plans for online shopping. Jewel-Osco top exec moves up to parent company, out to Boise Greg Trotter Jewel-Osco President Mike Withers has been promoted to executive vice president of retail operations for parent company Albertsons Co.

Jewel-Osco President Mike Withers has been promoted to executive vice president of retail operations for parent company Albertsons Co. A successor for Withers has not yet been announced. Withers will oversee the company's East region operations and split his new position with the current executive... (Greg Trotter) Jewel faces a vast array of competitors large and small. Increasingly, shoppers can buy groceries at a wide variety of stores, including drugstores and dollar stores. Chains like Aldi, a smaller-format discount store, and Walmart have in recent years expanded their selections of natural and organic foods. Meanwhile, Whole Foods Market and Mariano's continue to steadily grow in the Chicago area. "To continue to do well, (Jewel-Osco) needs to focus competition on alternative format retailers. ... To do that, they're going to need to refresh their (product) assortment," said Jon Hauptman, senior director of retail for grocery consulting firm Willard Bishop. "They've done that to some degree, but they'll need to do more." That means more focus on freshly prepared foods and products marketed as natural and organic, Hauptman said. Jewel-Osco has made progress in those areas in recent years and plans to keep doing so, Cygan said. The Jewel-Osco chain is a subsidiary of AB Acquisitions, better known as Albertsons, which is controlled by New York-based private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Proposed Jewel in West Woodlawn promises fresh food, economic boost Ally Marotti Jewel-Osco is planning to open a grocery store in the West Woodlawn neighborhood, with expectations for job creation and an influx of outside commerce into the South Side community.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Spokane Hit-and-run suspect ‘knew there was human skin on her vehicle,’ court records say UPDATED: Mon., May 1, 2017, 11:15 p.m. By Chad Sokol chadso@spokesman.com(509) 459-5047 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS The suspect in a hit-and-run crash that severed a motorcyclist’s leg told an acquaintance that “she knew there was human skin on her vehicle,” according to court documents filed this week. Leslie A. Hester, 33, was arrested Friday in connection with the April 23 crash at 11th Avenue and Southeast Boulevard in Spokane. She appeared in court Monday afternoon. She has been released on her own recognizance. The collision tore the left leg off Daniel “Dutch” Inwood, who was left bleeding out in the street beside his recently purchased Harley-Davidson. Local dentist Dr. James Shelby came upon the scene shortly afterward and bound the leg with a tourniquet of two belts, an action that Inwood says saved his life. Police identified Hester based on a cracked taillight found at the scene of the crash. Court documents say they received a tip that Hester was seen replacing the taillight of her 2001 GMC Yukon in front of a house on East 14th Avenue, where she had been renting a room. When an officer arrived there and began inspecting the SUV, Hester came outside and initially lied that it had been damaged in a Wal-Mart parking lot a few weeks prior, according to court documents. But during a later interview in a detective’s office, “She apologized for not telling the truth,” court documents say. “She talked about the difficulties in her life such as not being able to see her infant daughter, relapsing into methamphetamine use, and not taking her medications for her bipolar disorder.” Hester, who does not have a driver’s license, admitted she was driving at the time of the crash, according to court documents. She told officers there were two other people in the SUV, a woman named “Heather” and a man named “Twin.” Hester said she was distraught because Twin was physically abusing both women and “at one point grabbed Hester around her neck while she was driving,” court documents say. “She knew that she was involved in a collision,” documents say. “She looked behind her and saw sparks. She did not call police because she was so scared.” Updated: May 1, 2017, 11:15 p.m.  Tags: Boy Scout, Daniel “Dutch” Inwood, Harley Davidson, Leslie Hester, motorcycle, Southeast Boulevard, Spokane Police Department Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

City Director Keith Lau wants in on downtown Fort Smith. The commercial real estate broker at KCP Real Estate and Ward 1 Director is now under contract to purchase the C&H Tire building from owner Jerry Hamel. While the deal has not closed, Lau is comfortable it will and has already had conceptual art rendered by Shannon Reith of Studio 6 Architects for a planned restaurant, rooftop bars and two additional lease spaces. Lau told Talk Business & Politics on Monday (May 1) he plans to spend around $1.5 million to turn the development into what commercial realtors call a “white box space.” “White Box” terminology generally refers to the interior condition of either a new or existing building where improvements consist of components like heating and cooling (with delivery systems), lighting, electrical switches, outlets, lavatories, a finished ceiling, walls prepped for painting, and a concrete slab floor. Lau will be adding an elevator as well. “This is a conceptual plan, which means that I don’t have a restaurant yet, I don’t have any retail yet, and I don’t have a cigar shop or cigar bar on the corner. I just had this designed to say, ‘Hey, this would be a really cool space,'” Lau said, adding the idea is to ready the building so an outside tenant can customize it to their needs. “It may be that there are three retail bays there now, but it may end up being one retail bay for one big user. Or, on the restaurant side, they (the tenant) may say, ‘We don’t want the corner bar. We want that all to be the restaurant.’ All that evolves as far as who your tenant is,” Lau said. While that may be the case, Lau has a specific vision in mind. “My dream is a restaurant that has a breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu,” Lau said, citing examples like Foster’s Pint and Plate (in Rogers, Ark.) and Tusk and Trotter (in Bentonville, Ark.) as ideal anchor tenants. “I want to find a user, who would ultimately be interested in signing a long-term lease — 7 to 10 years — and that would be the generator to lease out the other two spaces.” Lau acknowledges the investment to be “speculative” with some risk involved. “As a real estate investment, it’s got to make money. But I’m excited about doing it, and it’s good for downtown. It may be a slow play. It may be one of those deals where I buy the building and sit on it until I can get the right person to come in because I’m not going to lease it to just anyone. I want somebody who’s a good operator, someone I can trust and who has a good backing.” Lau continued: “It would just be cool to put money into downtown. If we play it right, then Fort Smith really could be an entertainment venue. And what a lot of people don’t realize because they get caught up in the (Walmart) Amp or Tulsa, is that to the people that live in Spiro and Muldrow and Charleston and Mena and a lot of the areas around here, we are their Tulsa.” With the project moving along in its development stages, it joins a previous announcement from General Pallets and The Park at West End owner Phil White, who told fellow Central Business Improvement District (CBID) commissioners at a recent meeting he would redevelop the 900 block of Garrison Avenue to include space for retail, a restaurant, and “11 or 12” 2nd floor studio loft apartments. For CBID commissioner and First National Bank of Fort Smith President and CEO Sam Sicard, the investments are the latest examples of business leaders and citizens putting their money where their mouths are when it comes to strengthening downtown Fort Smith. Sicard told Talk Business & Politics he believes five things are driving the growth of the downtown area — “the success of past private developments in downtown over the last several years; public investment in our downtown, particularly the sidewalk and landscaping improvements and riverfront trail; the urban design downtown plan that 64/6 Downtown has been engaged with; the energy and enthusiasm that has been created by downtown events such as The Unexpected, Peacemakers Music Festival, Steel Horse Rally, and many others; and the increase in our residents who work downtown due to the relocation of employers.” “Specifically Propak, but there are others,” Sicard added. Just putting some numbers to a few of the mentions, Propak moved into the Friedman-Mincer building and launched a $3 million award-winning renovation in 2016. The Unexpected art murals project is moving into its third year and has risen to international acclaim with more than 5 million views on social media as of September 2016. The Steel Horse Rally, specifically targeted at motorcycle enthusiasts and music lovers, has brought an estimated $12.618 million economic impact to the region in just two years. Additionally, the U.S. Marshals Museum — considered by some a linchpin of downtown’s future economic development — has finally announced a hard open date of Sept. 24, 2019 while accelerating fundraising efforts. In short, the last three years have been a good run for the area, and in another year, Sicard believes “we will see more jobs, retail stores, and restaurants downtown, and less vacant buildings.” “That being said, it will most likely take several years to fully develop downtown to what many of us believe is its full potential as a regional destination,” Sicard said.

That’s a big market. Grainne Kelly, CEO of Bubblebum, which makes inflatable car seats. For BubbleBum founder Grainne Kelly, the idea for her business arose when she found car rental companies didn’t provide booster seats for a trip in the UK. “When I suggested an inflatable seat they laughed at me,” she says. Ms Kelly contacted crash test laboratories in the UK. She was told that an inflatable seat would not pass a safety test. Undeterred, she flew to China in 2009, got a prototype made and within nine months had brought the product from concept to launch. Suzanne Browne and Martina Craine of ClevaMama came up with the design for their first product, an apron-style bath towel when their children were babies. “Every parent has the same issue when you take the baby out of the bath you think how am I going to hold the baby and the towel at the same time?” Ms Browne says. Ollwyn Moran of Cognikids first had the idea of a “crawl suit” when she was training in neurological development. The ClevaMama sisters had set up an online business and wanting to move into exports they realised they needed their own brand. Their first designs were sketches “on a scrap of paper”. Many mothers create solutions for their children, and they don’t even realise it, Ms Kelly says. “It may be a process like the way they get their bottles ready for their baby’s feed, or it may be a way of attaching their bag onto their stroller. They may not realise it’s an opportunity.” Ms Kelly’s goal was to make BubbleBum into a global brand. To crack the American market, she convinced her husband to leave his job and move to the US with their two sons. That was in early 2010. In just over a year, the product was ready. The BubbleBum seat was given a “Best Bet” rating by a national highway safety organisation and later won a major innovation award. That led to a deal with chain giant Walmart. Ms Moran’s idea resurfaced when her first son, who had been born prematurely, was trying to crawl but “was struggling on our wooden floors at home, slipping and sliding all over the place.” A few years later Ms Moran had the opportunity to turn her idea into a business when she won a student entrepreneur competition with her crawl suit idea. Ms Kelly at BubbleBum says in the US being an Irish brand is “a great selling point”. Constantly innovating is key to success. Ms Moran says she is “obsessed” with researching early child development. Cognikids’ products are based on different stages of development. The appeal of ClevaMama’s products is the simplicity, Ms Browne says. Exporting to over 40 countries, the apron towel is still one of the brand’s best-selling products.

AT AMAZON, spring savings in Patio Lawn and Garden.

Democrats have been saying for years that we need tax increases, and that paying taxes is one of the greatest forms of patriotism. Now it looks like President Trump is going to put their beliefs to the test. Trump’s new tax plan would hit blue states hardest, by eliminating the federal deductibility of state income and property taxes. . . . That’s going to make it harder for blue states to maintain the high tax rates they’ve traditionally levied.States should be able to set their own levels of taxing and spending, but I see no reason why a Walmart cashier in Tennessee (which has no state income tax and low property taxes) should be subsidizing a hedge fund mogul in New York or a studio executive in Hollywood. It’s fine if blue states want to have higher state and local tax rates, as they do, but they shouldn’t be encouraged to do so by federal tax giveaways. And it’s the urban, coastal areas that have done best over the past 25 years, so it seems time for them to pay their fair share now. Fair share! Fair share! The wealthy states can afford to “chip in a little more.” Tweet   Posted by Glenn Reynolds at 10:59 pm Search Instapundit Link to Instapundit Archives Recommended Six: The Movie Becker-Posner Blog BlackProf Books for Kids Blog Cliopatria Deceiver.com Dr. Helen InstaPundit Store!

Children's Outdoor Swing Market - Trends and Forecasts by Technavio Technavio has published a new report on the global children's outdoor swing market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Technavio has published a new report on the global children's outdoor swing market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 01, 2017 05:23 PM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Technavio’s latest report on the global children's outdoor swing market provides an analysis of the most important trends expected to impact the market outlook from 2017-2021. Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on retail goods and services sector, says, “Manufacturers are also developing adaptive swings to make swinging accessible to children with special needs. Apart from being an enjoyable activity for children, swinging is also beneficial for physical, social, and cognitive development.” Sensory stimulation is also affected at large by swinging. Children are recommended to swing more to respond to movement and gravity to develop their proprioception, vestibular coordination, and visual perception. In vestibular coordination, the inner ear is involved, which senses the movement of the head, in interpreting speed and direction of the swing's and body's movement.

The top three emerging trends driving the global children's outdoor swing market according to Technavio consumer and retail research analysts are: Growing number of preschools Preschools play an important role in a child’s development during the crucial growth years. The rapid increase in the number of preschools and kindergartens with high-quality facilities has led to more parents sending their children to such places. Working parents, due to hectic work schedules, find it difficult to spend quality time with their children to teach them. “The learning-while-playing strategy is ideal for developing the intelligence quotient of a child and for imbibing good habits. Children, apart from learning physical activities, are also taught basic etiquette, moral values, sharing habits, and other skills. Additionally, children also get to learn to recognize animals, fruits, and sing rhymes,” according to Brijesh. Increasing number of women in workforce The increase in the number of working women across the world has increased product affordability for consumers; more parents can afford to put their kids in preschools. In 2016, of the total global labor force, more than 40% were women. Of the total population of women, more than 51% of them were working in 2016. The number of working women in developing countries like China has also increased substantially in recent years. The percentage of working women in China increased from 46% of its labor force in 2014 to 64% in 2016. Emergence of online retail E-retailing is the fastest-growing sector of the global retail market. The largest players in the global online retail market for commercial playground equipment including children's outdoor swings are Amazon, Walmart, and Target. The growing number of online websites offering a wide range of children's outdoor swings with additional features has increased the demand for these products, especially among working parents who seek easy accessibility and convenience. The e-retailing of several products, including children's outdoor swings, is gaining popularity because it is a time-saving and cost-effective mode of purchasing products. Online shopping through smart devices such as tablets has also gained popularity over the years because of the high penetration of internet services, improved economy, and the upgrade of purchase and delivery options with the emergence of m-commerce.

Photo by Michelle Watson/CatchLightGroup.com Mango Punch! will be among the entertainment acts at Citgo Freedom Over Texas on July 4. Courtesy photo With a new title sponsor and some fresh young musical talent, Citgo Freedom Over Texas — the big Fourth of July party and fireworks extravaganza planned for Buffalo Bayou Park — is getting a contemporary vibe on its 30th anniversary. Standing on the site of the first Freedom Over Texas event in 1987 — an entertainment venue now dubbed the Water Works at Sabine Street following a $60 million renovation of the park, Mayor Sylvester Turner and city officials unveiled the list of performers and sponsors for this year's event. (The Water Works will be the staging area for fireworks as most of the action will take place around nearby Eleanor Tinsley Park.) Headlining the main stage will be DNCE, the 2016 MTV Video Music Award-winning band fronted by Joe Jonas that had a monster hit with "Cake By The Ocean." Their new single, “Kissing Strangers,” features global superstar Nicki Minaj. Hunter Hayes, who won the Country Music Association Award for Best New Artist in 2012 and the People’s Choice Award for Favorite Male Country Artist in 2015, will precede DNCE on stage. The 25-year-old country sensation is known for such hits such as “Wanted,” “I Want Crazy,” and “Somebody’s Heartbreak." "We're going to keep it young and light and rockin' on the main stage," said Susan Christian, executive director of the Mayor's Office of Special Events. For the first time in the event’s history, the celebration will kick off with a patriotic tribute by the United States Air Force Band of the West before the headliners take to the stage. Other entertainment on various stages include Houston-based Mango Punch!, the Dallas country-rock group Vaudevylle, ThunderSOUL Orchestra, a 14-piece R&B/funk band that includes original members of the Kashmere Stage Band who were featured in the 2011 documentary Thunder Soul, the Austin-based Peterson Brothers, Lil' Nathan and the Zydeco Bigtimers, and The Juke Box, featuring Regina Belle, Erin Stevenson, Chris Walker, and the Ernest Walker Band. Citgo, the Venezuelan-owned American oil refiner with headquarters in Houston, will continue to sponsor the fireworks show, scheduled for 9:35 pm on July 4, as it has for the past three years, as well as take on the role of the lead sponsor of the event for the next three years. Other major sponsors include Silver Eagle Distributors, which has been involved since the event began, Dr Pepper, Walmart, Southwest Airlines, and Wells Fargo. The festival will also include a children's entertainment and game area, a beer garden, food vendors, an area that salutes all five branches of the U.S. military, and other entertainment areas with misters to keep attendees cool in the Houston heat. Tickets, on sale now online, are $5 for adults (and free for children under 5 years old). On June 1, prices will rise to $8, and on July 4 to $10 for adults. Turner and other officials stressed the low-cost community nature of the event, which has become a Houston tradition. "As a native Houstonian, this event means so much to me," Turner said, recalling how his family would park their car on the shoulder of I-45 to watch the fireworks when he was a youngster. "As Houstonians we join our brothers and sisters across Texas to celebrate our unity and freedom, our commonalities, our differences, our cultures, our beliefs, our hopes, our dreams, and our belief in the human spirit."

Senator raises idea of requiring rooftop solar for big buildings - VTDigger Home Projects About Tipster Commentary Data   Categories  Business & Economy Courts & Corrections Education Energy Environment Health Care People & Places Politics Menu Home News by Subject Business & Economy Courts & Corrections Education Energy Environment Health Care People & Places Politics Commentary Special Projects About Tipster Donate SEARCH 2017 Legislature EB-5 Legislator Guide Burlington Campaign Finance Database Bernie Sanders All Major Projects Home Projects About Tipster Commentary Data Business & Economy Courts & Corrections Education Energy Environment Health Care People & Places Politics Menu DONATE Home News by Subject Business & Economy Courts & Corrections Education Energy Environment Health Care People & Places Politics Commentary Special Projects About Share Secure Tips Events Calendar Donate SEARCH 2017 Legislature EB-5 Legislator Guide Burlington Campaign Finance Database Bernie Sanders   Senator raises idea of requiring rooftop solar for big buildings Feb. 8, 2017, 8:47 pm by Mike Polhamus 27 Comments Legislators want to begin exploring whether to require large new buildings to have solar panels on their roofs. A bill, S.21, would form a study committee to consider the question and report back to the Legislature next year with its findings. Sen. Claire Ayer, D-Addison. File photo by Erin Mansfield/VTDiggerSen. Claire Ayer, D-Addison, is lead sponsor of the bill and spoke in its favor last week to the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee. “We’ve got all these big box stores … with ugly roofs,” Ayer told committee members. “Wouldn’t it be nice, if the math worked, if they were generating power?” Whether the math works is the important question, Ayer said, and the study group’s makeup represents an earnest effort to answer it. It’s more important to have business leaders among the group than legislators, she said. “This would be asking industry to look at it, and to see if it’s a good idea and if it could work,” Ayer said. “These are the people that would have to be sold on the idea for it to go anywhere anyway.” Assuming the idea pans out financially, legislators said, it might address issues that have caused considerable controversy among lawmakers, regulators and other Vermonters. “If you’re putting it on roofs, you’re not putting (solar panels) up in fields,” said Sen. John Rodgers, D-Essex-Orleans. One major retailer met the idea with equanimity. A requirement that large new buildings include rooftop solar panels wouldn’t affect whether Wal-Mart chooses to open a new store in Vermont, said Kevin Gardner, the company’s senior director for global responsibility communications. Wal-Mart doesn’t have solar panels on any of its Vermont stores, but “requiring solar would not impact our decision to open additional stores there,” Gardner said. The retail giant has already installed 145 megawatts of solar panels on its properties, and generates more solar power than any U.S. company other than Target, according to a report from the Solar Energy Industries Association.

John Snell As someone who has done maintenance investigations on many low-slope roofs, I can tell you this is a disaster. FAR better to put them on rack in the parking lots. Damon Lane Is that because it makes roof access and inspection difficult, because the mounting systems damage the roof, or what? I have a very small low slope roof that needs replacement and I’m considering adding solar. One benefit I expect is that the solar greatly reduces the UV hitting the roof, which should length its life. That may work for EPDM or similar roofs but maybe not for the gravel topped ones? John Snell While I respect Tom H’s input, the practical experience with low-slope roofs is many of them develop leaks long before the 20 year life comes to an end, even EPDM and other single-ply systems. Regular maintenance and repair can extend these, but that is very challenging with the roof covered with equipment. Yes, the panels can reduce UV on the roof and keep it cooler and, yes, on a small residential roof they could be adequately maintained, but ground-based systems should be weighed carefully for comparison. Glenn Thompson With my experience dealing with flat roofs, it’s not the UV’s on a roof that is the issue, but water either from severe summer rain storms or the melting build-up of ice and snow on a roof during the spring season. The manufacturing facility I worked at for 30+ years was constantly chasing roof leaks. The issue in Vt with flat roofs is not if they will leak but when? Moshe Braner (1) low-slope roofs are a bad idea in the Vermont climate, period. (2) yes putting solar panels over the parking lots (shading the parked cars) would be great, and perhaps could be offered as an alternative to the roof-mounted panels. After all, big buildings always have big parking lots. Glenn Thompson I’ve had limited experience dealing with low-slope roofs or as I call them flat roofs. I have no problem putting solar panels on these type of roofs, although I would oppose the government requiring businesses to do so with new construction. Here is the issue with flat roofs in climates such as Vermont’s. Over time, these type of roofs will leak, and at some point they require re-coating, and then replaced. Having to deal with solar panels just adds to the costs of maintenance of these type of roofs. Something, people need to determine before jumping into covering roofs with solar panels. Again, let that decision be determined by the business, not dictated to by the government. R.J. Adler Requiring solar on big rooftops is a great idea. Big store owners can pay as much as $50,000 or more per year in electricity costs. If they have the space, solar developers can help retailers drive those costs into a system they own, and once the system is paid off that means erasing a $50,000/yr line item from your budget! Think of it as the difference of renting a house vs. buying a house and paying a mortgage. Lower operating costs would make business much easier in the state of Vermont. Even if those retailers can’t foot the bill- solar developers are willing to rent out that roof space (creating another revenue stream), and offer discounted power to other folks in town. That means more power created in Vermont, which is more efficient overall. That also means more job opportunities created in Vermont in a growing field that employs young people like me. Stephen M. Frey RJ I think it’s a win win for building owners, operators, the public and the clean energy industry. How much Megawattage in statewide flat roof, low-slop roof generation capacity are we talking about? Any sense of this from Sun Common’s perspective? Tom Hengelsberg As an architect who has also done many assessments of low-slope roofs, some with solar panels already installed in exactly the manner depicted in the article’s accompanying photograph, I would respectfully disagree with Mr. Snell. I have not seen any issues or reduction in the lifespan of the roofing membrane that would have been caused by the placement of the solar panels. If anything, the panels shade and protect the membrane, possibly prolonging its lifespan. Understand that the panels are installed on a rack system that sits on protective “feet” on top of the membrane, and the whole assembly is weighted down with concrete ballast blocks that also sit on protective slipsheets. The rack system does not penetrate the roof. When the lifespan of the roof is up, the racking can be removed, the roof replaced, and the panels reinstalled (or more likely replaced with a more efficient panel – they keep getting better and better.) The good news is, the lifespan of a membrane roof and a set of panels are about the same: 20-25 years. So if they are installed at the same time, they can be replaced at the same time. I wholeheartedly support this initiative! Many in the architecture profession have been advocating for years to add solar PV to the underused resource of low-slope rooftops. John Snell I fully understand how they are constructed and, while I respect your experiences, I must disagree. I’ve seen many, many EPDM and single-ply roofs fail long before expected life cycle. Maintenance and repair are the keys to long life and both are made much more challenging by rooftop equipment. Ground-based systems would require a separate structure to hold the solar but would be much more accessible to maintenance. We actually have enough roof-top systems in place now where it would be of great value to study them and see how they perform and what the costs of roof membrane maintenance are. Maybe a good project to AIA? rosemariejackowski This sounds great, but there is one problem. Many firemen are opposed because of the hazards. http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/06/firefighters-solar-panels-make-our-jobs-harder-and-more-dangerous-video/ http://www.sfpe.org/?page=FPE_ET_Issue_92 Adam Maxwell I’d be interested in reading white firepersons have to say, but would prefer to read about it from a reputable source. Please point me in the right direction. Thanks! rosemariejackowski There is a lot of information out there. Just Google: Fire danger – solar panels. http://www.wfsb.com/story/28886201/experts-warn-about-potential-dangers-of-solar-panels http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2013/11/04/solar-panel-fire-danger-affects-hundreds-of-california-homes/ bill_christian See my earlier post. I think fire safety is being exaggerated by some people who don’t like solar, like fossil fuel, burn it as fast as possible to get as rich as possible. Speaking of fire safety… bill_christian Those links go to some rather sketchy references. Panels do NOT put out power in moonlight. The added weight is a tiny percent of existing weight, hardly worth considering in a life-or-death decision about access – two or three layers of shingles (often done to reduce re-roofing cost) adds WAY more weight than solar panels do. There are some concerns, but I’d say these articles are rather hysterical and exaggerate the problems. William Cheney What does 2 feet of snow on a roof do to these panels? I wouldn’t want to be the one to have to do snow removal around the panels. Who says solar panels are that attractive to look at? Marcie Gallagher I think the point is that a need for renewable energy transcends socially constructed aesthetic values, and climate change will pose greater inconveniences than solar panels on top of roofs. Additionally, those on top of roofs will be much less visibly intrusive than solar fields. John Snell Not attractive? I’ve been to dozens of nuclear power stations as well as coal-, gas-, trash- and wood-fired plants, also hydro and geothermal. None have been what I’d call “attractive.” Typically, about 80-90% of the energy burned in a fossil plant is wasted as unused heat. And the transmission lines? Not particularly scenic and also dangerous to wildlife and very inefficient. Regional solar and wind production, supplemented by baseload hydro and other, can actually go a very, very long way toward meeting our needs. And then there is the question of our needs: perhaps many are excessive and could easily be trimmed down to be much more efficient. Gus Steves This is a great policy, but if Vermont is actually serious about reaching 90% by 2050 we need to be building out the projects that will significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Rooftop solar is great but we need more multiple-acre solar fields and utility-scale wind. Change may be scary to some, but climate change is even scarier and will effect everybody’s backyard. Some of us even like the look of solar panels, and I personally think there is something quite pleasant about watching a wind turbine spinning in the breeze. I also have a moderate distaste for property taxes, and the folks in Lowell, VT aren’t paying any of those. Adam Maxwell Big box stores are a blight on the landscape. If we can intelligently use that atrociously stupid use of land to produce energy, we should do so for the lifespan of those buildings, and then tear them the hell down! Ken Edwards Let’s mandate all property owners to put up solar panels AND let’s the restrict the market place to a couple of approved solar providers as we do with healthcare. Zachary Kent Haha. I was about to downvote you but then I got ya. Well played. Kyle Hislop I’m sure VPIRG, the lobbying arm of SunCommon is working on that bill for next session. They will be knocking on doors this summer with the petitions to bring to the statehouse. Baby steps to monopolies. Matthew Davis Instead of regulating by mandates the legislature could consider incentivizing RE energy production and energy efficiency. Putting solar panels on a commercial buildings roof is a great idea but if the building is not built to be energy efficient in the long run, what’s the point? Christopher Hamilton On new roofs, it’s hard to imagine the building owners would not want to have solar panels. Not much downside and it makes financial sense. Retrofitting older buildings can be tricky, especially if they were built cheaply. Personally, I’d much rather have panels on every roof than using up prime agricultural land on our more scenic roads. Dick Thodal Insurance companies and engineers should be collaborating to develop acceptable truss reinforcement or exoskeletons for pv panel installation on free stall dairy barns. While they’re at it they should work out deicing systems to allow wind towers on ski areas.

Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on retail goods and services sector, says, “Manufacturers are also developing adaptive swings to make swinging accessible to children with special needs. Apart from being an enjoyable activity for children, swinging is also beneficial for physical, social, and cognitive development.” Sensory stimulation is also affected at large by swinging. Children are recommended to swing more to respond to movement and gravity to develop their proprioception, vestibular coordination, and visual perception. In vestibular coordination, the inner ear is involved, which senses the movement of the head, in interpreting speed and direction of the swing’s and body’s movement.

Additionally, children also get to learn to recognize animals, fruits, and sing rhymes,” according to Brijesh. Increasing number of women in workforce The increase in the number of working women across the world has increased product affordability for consumers; more parents can afford to put their kids in preschools. In 2016, of the total global labor force, more than 40% were women. Of the total population of women, more than 51% of them were working in 2016. The number of working women in developing countries like China has also increased substantially in recent years. The percentage of working women in China increased from 46% of its labor force in 2014 to 64% in 2016. Emergence of online retail E-retailing is the fastest-growing sector of the global retail market. The largest players in the global online retail market for commercial playground equipment including children’s outdoor swings are Amazon, Walmart, and Target. The growing number of online websites offering a wide range of children’s outdoor swings with additional features has increased the demand for these products, especially among working parents who seek easy accessibility and convenience. The e-retailing of several products, including children’s outdoor swings, is gaining popularity because it is a time-saving and cost-effective mode of purchasing products. Online shopping through smart devices such as tablets has also gained popularity over the years because of the high penetration of internet services, improved economy, and the upgrade of purchase and delivery options with the emergence of m-commerce.

Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on retail goods and services sector, says, “Manufacturers are also developing adaptive swings to make swinging accessible to children with special needs. Apart from being an enjoyable activity for children, swinging is also beneficial for physical, social, and cognitive development.” Sensory stimulation is also affected at large by swinging. Children are recommended to swing more to respond to movement and gravity to develop their proprioception, vestibular coordination, and visual perception. In vestibular coordination, the inner ear is involved, which senses the movement of the head, in interpreting speed and direction of the swing’s and body’s movement.

Image Credit: Shutterstock.com / WAYHOME studio Don’t tell your favorite grade school teacher, but bots are infinitely more patient instructors that are willing to offer assistance and information for as long and as often as they’re needed. That’s one reason big-time education advocates such as Bill Gates are so excited by the possibilities of AI, but it has major implications in the workplace, too. Talla, a Boston-area startup, has created a bot that can do many of the routine tasks normally performed by an HR department, such as distributing surveys, gathering data, and even training employees. Sound far-fetched? Such bots are actually more common than many people might realize: 80 percent of companies currently rely on bot-enabled communication tools like Slack and HipChat. Sure, bots can assume busywork and enable better interoffice communication, but a bot’s true power lies in its educational capabilities. For many, this vision of the future might seem like a nightmare in which reliable humans are replaced by annoying chatbots that cause more problems than they solve. However, this pessimism is caught up in antiquated notions of what a bot can be, which are not helped by the chatbots encountered in apps such as Facebook Messenger. In reality, a well-designed, well-implemented bot won’t replace employees, but it can empower them. Last spring, Georgia Tech hired a teaching assistant named Jill Watson. Jill helped the professor by answering any questions students had outside of class, and the students loved her, even if she was only available online. There was a reason for that: Jill was actually an advanced chatbot. When students found out at the end of the semester, they were blown away. While an ordinary chatbot won’t necessarily pass the Turing test, this example shows just how far chatbots have come and how useful they can be as teachers. Here are three ways messaging bots can improve employee training and development. 1. Act like a favorite teacher Good teachers do more than answer questions. They also know how to ask students the right questions, framing those questions in ways designed to pique curiosity about a subject and rewarding students when they excel. A good bot can do the same. When employees enter online training sessions, use bots to pose intriguing questions and place conversations in a context that provokes real enthusiasm. At my company, for example, we use bots to tell riddles to our developers to present a stimulating challenge. After lessons are completed, use bots to reward trainees with fun digital images that serve as virtual badges and hearty congratulations, much like the gold star stickers teachers place on students’ tests. To motivate employees to keep learning, use a bot to create a leaderboard, keep a personal tally for each student, and chart everyone’s progress. Although the gamification of training might sound silly, it gives employees tangible reinforcement: acknowledgement of a job well done. Recognition has been shown to be an excellent way to drive individual performance, which is why so many personal endeavors — from physical fitness to email management — have already been gamified. 2. Pinpoint and fill knowledge gaps Continued education is vital for any skilled position, and bots are well-equipped to help employees stay up-to-date on the latest technologies and methodologies in their fields. Design your bots to help employees assess their own weak spots. Approach this from a no-pressure standpoint. It shouldn’t be about employees getting certain scores. Instead, design your bots so that when employees are asked a question, they can tell you whether they understand the concept. This way, they’re aware of what they need to work on and you know what concepts you need to reinforce as a company. If employees don’t know where to start when prompted with a question, program the bot to immediately respond with additional resources. A digital network called OUR Walmart, which is composed of more than 100,000 employees, uses IBM’s Watson AI abilities to match employees’ questions with existing training materials. Then, have your bot ask the same question a week later to track progress. 3. Increase the retention of information Employees won’t realistically remember every single thing they learned during their initial training; it’s how we work as humans. We learn something the first time; then, without repetition, we slowly begin to lose that knowledge. However, if we’re reminded within a particular cycle — and then reminded again within a longer cycle — we’re much more likely to retain it in the long term. Why not use a bot to manage and automate this process? Design your bots to deploy refresher courses periodically during the initial training period and beyond. Computer learning can be up to 50 percent more effective than in-person training because bots allow employees to revisit lessons as many times as they need to — at their convenience and on their own terms. For example, let’s say you want to focus on functional programming practices and JavaScript for 12 weeks. Program your bot to engage those teammates over that time period, working around their schedules and allowing them to repeat tutorials as needed. Properly designed and implemented chatbots can empower employees to become more self-sufficient and skilled at what they do. It’s a win-win scenario for employees and management. Chatbots aren’t here to frustrate and annoy; they’re here to help — you just have to be willing to let them.

Four people died during the Saturday night storms. Van Zandt County Judge Don Kirkpatrick identified the victims as James Clayton Young, 39, of Alba, and Lucretia Sykes, 49, of Fort Worth. Young was found in his vehicle on Highway 64, east of FM 243. Sykes was found north of Interstate 20, near her vehicle. Next of kin has been notified. According to Van Zandt officials, two more victims were positively identified, as Russell "Rusty" Barlow, a 51-year-old male of Corsicana found in a building and the other victim was identified as Kenneth Hughes a 57-year-old male out of Canton Texas who was found in a residence. Officials say Corsicana man, Barlow, died in a detached garage outside a mansion after the race car he was working on fell on him when the tornado hit.  The Justice of the Peace who pronounced the man dead said that the home was the scene of a wedding that had been planned for later in the evening. Another man died after he was blown from his home on Van Zandt County Road 2434. His wife, who was sitting in a chair beside him at the time, was treated and released from a hospital with stitches and bruises.  The mayor of Canton and Kirkpatrick also provided other updates during the afternoon press conference about available aid in the city and a curfew in place for the area. A curfew remains in place for residents in the affected areas, excluding the city of Canton. Officials are not asking for water at this time. They say they are having issues storing the water due to the quantity received. The triage center at the Canton High School band hall has closed. The Pct. 4 Van Zandt County Constable's Office put out a call on Facebook Monday morning asking for assistance. They have since redirected volunteers to the Command Center in the city of Canton. The department says volunteers will need to bring their own tools, water, meals and whatever else they may require.  A staging area was established at a Canton car dealership Sunday where The Salvation Army disaster teams prepared and distributed meals and snacks to law enforcement and responders who lined up on the frontage road. Today was supposed to be an exciting day for the dealership as they were scheduled to open a brand new showroom. Instead, the buildings were torn apart by the tornado with cars and trucks flipped and strewn all around the property. The Salvation Army says additional volunteers are not needed at this time. The best way to support the ongoing Salvation Army response is to make a financial donation here. The Rapid Response Unit from Granbury, operated by members of the Women's Service League of Hood County, provided roving support on Sunday in addition to two other mobile kitchens from the DFW area. Water and clean up kits were delivered in preparation for distribution on Monday at three points of distribution in the area - Canton High School, Walmart, and the First Methodist Church. Two full size mobile kitchens will continue service today along with the RRU.

Travolta runs a film production camp for young people with “diversabilities,” said Gina Allgaier, chief engagement officer of BFF. “We are excited that they are hosting a one-week camp this week (April 24-28), here at NorthWest Arkansas Community College and then next week Inclusion Films and some of the students will be working with the festival to capture content.” Travolta also will appear on the “Lights! Camera! Inclusion!” BFF discussion panel 11 a.m. to noon on May 3 at The Record South in downtown Bentonville. Travolta and his fellow panelists will discuss potential resources for individual empowerment and how to “become agents for good, right where we are,” according to a BFF press release.

The number of film submissions sent into BFF was larger this year, she added. “While we hope the festival will grow in terms of attendees this year and each year forward, we also are thrilled about the increase in film submissions we receive and that they are now being sent in from all around the world which is indicative of our expansion and the reach of our message.” FESTIVAL HIGHLIGHTS One repeat event going on for 2017 is the “A League of Their Own” reunion game.

Earlier that morning 22-year-old Melinda Vasilije was found dead in a Kitchener apartment. Police have issued a Canada-wide warrant for Hasan's arrest, for one charge of a second-degree murder and three charges of breach of recognizance.  "We are encouraging him to turn himself in to law enforcement officials," said Inspector Michael Haffner in a press briefing on Monday afternoon. Police were called to the building on Country Hill Drive around 3 a.m. Friday and found Vasilije's body. A post mortem revealed she died of multiple stab wounds. Haffner said Hasan and Vasilije had been in a relationship for about a year. Friends remember Melinda Vasilije, woman fatally stabbed in Kitchener apartment Hamilton man faces second-degree murder charges in death of Kitchener woman Police investigate suspicious death on Kitchener's Country Hill Drive Hamilton police searched two residences in Hamilton in attempt to find Hasan on Friday and learned that he connected with a black 2016 Honda HR-V with the licence plate BPKT509. A vehicle matching that description and with that licence plate was seen crossing into the U.S. around 6:00 a.m. on the Peace Bridge between Fort Erie and Buffalo, N.Y. on Friday. Waterloo Regional Police are working with Canada Border Services, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. police forces. Pennsylvania sighting Pennsylvania State Police said a person matching Hasan's description was seen taking the licence plate off a vehicle in a Walmart in Harborcreek Township, near Erie, Pa. around 10 a.m. It's believed the man put the stolen plate on his own vehicle and fled the area. State police said the licence plate is Pennsylvania registration EZV1654 and had a Fraternal Order of Police medallion emblem attached to it.  The Honda HR-V may have also been displaying Ontario licence plate BPKT509. Pennsylvania State Police told CBC News Monday there had been no other sightings of the suspect. Investigators say there was some contact between Hasan and his family via text message on Saturday, but nothing since then. April 3 incident at Vasilije's apartment The three breach of recognizance charges stem from an incident earlier in April at Vasilije's apartment. Police say Hasan is facing one charge of breaking and entering and two counts of assault stemming from that incident. Haffner said the incident was domestic in nature, but he specified that Vasilije had not been assaulted in that incident. After Hasan was released, he was not supposed to enter Waterloo region, nor was he supposed to have contact with Vasilije, as part of his release conditions.

During the early morning hours of April 29, a man identifying himself as Larry Joe Benton entered the Washington County Jail with items for an inmate. During a search, a corrections officer located a glass pipe hidden in the items provided by the person. When the corrections officer located the glass pipe the man calling himself Benton quickly left the jail in a white semi-truck. The sheriff’s dispatch alerted all area law enforcement to the description of the vehicle causing a Chipley Police officer to stop the vehicle at Wal-Mart. Upon the deputy arriving on the scene, law enforcement was able to determine the true identity of the suspect as Larry Edelstein, 53, of Geneva. Edelstein was arrested and booked into the Washington County Jail for obstruction by disguise by providing a false name, possession and/or use of narcotics equipment and smuggling contraband into a detention facility.

The township is due to receive a portion of two grants, one from the Audubon Society for $20,000, and one from the state’s Municipal Assistance Program for $45,000. Supervisor Bruce Steigerwalt said the grants will be applied to working on the township’s zoning ordinances and subdivision and land development ordinances. The board also voted to authorize chairman Franklin Ruch to sign off on any paperwork related to the grants. The board is beginning its 2017 Community Development Block Grant pre-application process. Members agreed that funding obtained from the 2017 CDBG will be combined with 2016 funding in order to work on Douglas St. and Pine St. in Packerton, with any potential additional funding to be applied to Beaver Street. After a recent annual loss prevention audit by insurance company HA Thomson, the board is considering establishing a safety committee. Secretary-Treasurer Natalie Haggerty said that a safety committee could help save the municipality 5 percent, or approximately $4,500, on its insurance costs. The committee could be responsible for training and safety awareness for municipality workers. Before a final decision is made, the board will conduct some further research to see if there is an interest from municipality workers. “I’ll get the ball rolling,” Ruch said. “I’ll talk to someone from the fire company and the ambulance company, see if we can get a committee together.” An initial motion to adopt the committee was tabled until the board can obtain more information. Vice chairman John Wieczorek reported that Walmart and Lowe’s Home Improvement in Lehighton provided grants in the amounts of $2,000 and $1,800 to the Mahoning Police Department. Wieczorek said that the grants may be earmarked for the purchase of walkie-talkies. A motion to pay for replacement tires for a township-owned backhoe were approved. An additional motion to get a quote for testing the backhoe for any issues, especially dealing with the ride control, from Ag Industrial was also passed. The board is considering purchasing a 2003 F250 four-wheel drive utility truck from the Lehighton Water Authority for approximately $4,500. Steigerwalt said that he would like to take a look at the truck before making a decision on the purchase. The road committee approved the seasonal hiring of two workers, Chris Knappenberger and Jeff Kirsch, for part-time positions. The committee also approved the advertisement of two open part-time positions for CDL class B license holders during the summer, on an as-needed basis. Details on the positions will be posted in the near future. The board approved to advertise for the June 14 recycling event, open to all Mahoning Township residents.

Maine wants to issue a yearly supply of dangerous birth control to women Monday, May 01, 2017 by: Vicki Batts Tags: Birth control, dangerous medications, depopulation (Natural News) Birth control has been a topic of immense debate in recent years, and Maine has taken the controversy to a new level with a recent bill regarding the popular medication. One of the aims of the new legislation is to allow women to pick up an entire year’s worth of birth control at once. Currently, insurers from the northeastern state only allow women to receive up to a three month’s supply at once — and in some instances, women are required to go pick up their medication each month. In other words, current laws about birth control in Maine are essentially the same as laws regarding other medications, but this could change under the new legislation. Insurance companies say that the new bill could also prove to be very costly. According to the Maine Health Association, the bill would also require insurers to cover all approved forms of birth control at no cost to the recipient. Bangor Daily News reports that “Supporters of the bill say its purpose is to remove the barrier between women and consistent contraception.” Some might argue that as it stands, birth control is treated exactly the same as other medications — and that this new legislation would be a form of “special treatment” being assigned based on gender. What about everyone else who takes prescription medications? Take for example, diabetics: Should they be given a year’s supply of insulin so they can “remove the barriers” to consistent blood sugar control? Reports show that many patients with diabetes cannot afford the costly drug that they need to stay alive. Without prescription coverage, these drugs can cost up to $400. Conversely, one can purchase birth control for less than $10 at many popular retailers, such as Wal-Mart or Target — even without insurance coverage. Of course, the intention behind this endeavor is not as innocent as its proponents proclaim. One of the perks of birth control that very few people talk about these days is population control. Those little pills women are encouraged to pop every day are very clearly part of the depopulation agenda. Several popular news sources have even authored articles on it: BBC, NPR, The New York Times, and Scientific American are just a few places you can read all about the hidden agenda that lies behind the push for more oral contraception. Despite the mainstream media’s cries about birth control being a “women’s rights issue,” the sad truth is that it’s really not about that at all. Birth control is being pushed en masse not for the sake of women, but for the sake of the globalists’ crude depopulation agenda. And they’ve got women lining up in droves to fall in accordance with their desires. Willing participants certainly make things easier, now don’t they? By perpetuating the belief that birth control is solely an issue of women’s rights, depopulation proponents are able to ensure their goals are met without having to use force (which would most likely not be so readily accepted). In addition to masquerading birth control as being just an issue of women’s rights, the risks associated with oral contraceptives has been dramatically downplayed. The FDA has outlined a myriad of side effects and risks that are posed by birth control. These include increased risk of breast cancer, increased risk of blood clots, heart attacks and strokes, headaches or migraines, liver and gallbladder problems, increased blood pressure, weight gain and changes in mood — including depression and anxiety. Some studies have shown that birth control can raise the risk of depression by up to 80 percent in some cases. And in 2011, a report by the FDA showed that some forms of the medication could raise the risk of blood clots — which can be fatal — by up to 150 percent. Did your doctor outline how high these risks really are when your birth control was prescribed?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Red Cross Responds to Deadly Severe Weather Across Six States Deadliest Start to Tornado Season in 9 Years; May is Peak Month for Tornadoes WASHINGTON, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross is on the ground across six states, helping people affected by record severe storms, flooding and tornadoes which hit the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley regions. More than 230 people sought refuge from the storms Sunday night in 25 shelters across six states. There have been as many as 10 reported fatalities, although that figure is expected to rise. "This month is historically the peak month for tornadoes, so it's critical that people stay informed and get prepared," said Brad Kieserman, vice president of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "Our first priority is providing shelter, so that those affected have a safe place to stay. As more severe weather is expected for this coming weekend, the Red Cross will go where we're needed for as long as we're needed. When conditions improve, we will then help people in their first steps on the path to recovery." In Missouri, some communities were forced to evacuate due to rising rivers, and more evacuations could occur today. Red Cross disaster workers have opened numerous shelters where more than 130 people spent Sunday night. Flooding also hit central and southern Illinois, so the Red Cross is also helping in that area. The Red Cross also has shelters open in Arkansas, where the governor declared a state of emergency after residents in Sharp and Fulton counties were forced to leave their homes due to river flooding. In Oklahoma, Red Cross disaster workers opened shelters after the governor declared a state of emergency due to severe storms, flooding and snow affecting a large part of the state. Tornadoes ripped apart parts of Texas, where as many as 5,000 buildings may be affected. And in Kansas, a major snowstorm dumped more than a foot of snow. The Red Cross has shelters open in both states. Meanwhile, the Red Cross also responded to the shooting situation at an apartment complex in San Diego, California, providing housing and canteen services to almost 50 displaced individuals. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP People should download the free Red Cross Emergency App to receive emergency alerts and information about what to do in case of tornadoes, flooding and other disasters, as well as locations of shelters. The App also includes emergency first aid information and a Family Safe feature which allows people to instantly see if loved ones are okay. The free Emergency App is available in app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.

Apple had a little more than $240 billion as of the end of December. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- When Apple releases its earnings on Tuesday, tech junkies will be looking for clues about the next iPhone and any mention of other new products. Will the new iPhone be called the 8? The 10 or X in honor of its tenth anniversary? Will it come in red? But Wall Street will be watching something else even more closely -- Apple's growing pile of cash. It is likely Apple will report more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in cash and investments on its balance sheet for the first time ever. Apple had a little more than $240 billion as of the end of December. Apple's stack of Franklins, Grants and Jacksons has steadily grown over the past few years. Five years ago, Apple had "just" $110.2 billion in cash. And Apple has increasingly stashed away its cash overseas for tax purposes. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in February that $230 billion of its cash was held abroad. But there are growing hopes that Apple might soon be able to bring back, or repatriate, this cash to the United States at a one-time lower tax rate if President Trump is able to get his tax plan through Congress. Apple could use the cash to hire more workers, build more plants, make acquisitions, repurchase stock and boost its dividend. Some argue that if Apple and other tech giants were allowed to bring back cash to the U.S., it could stimulate the entire economy. To put into context just how much money $250 billion really is, consider the following. Apple's cash, if it were its own company, would be the 12th largest firm in the S&P 500. Besides Apple, Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and General Electric have market valuations higher than $250 billion. And Apple's cash is worth only slightly less than all of GE. It's also worth more than well-known blue chips AT&T, Walmart, Home Depot, Coca-Cola and Disney. (AT&T is in the process of acquiring CNNMoney owner Time Warner. By the way, Apple's cash is worth more than three times Time Warner's market value.) Apple's pot of gold, so to speak, is also worth more than Bank of America, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Visa, Verizon and Comcast. Want more mind-boggling comparisons? $250 billion in cash is about 10 times the market value of Snapchat parent Snap. It is 3.5 times the valuation of Uber, and 20 times that of Twitter. It's also nearly 50 times the market cap of BlackBerry, the former king of mobile phones and a company that has arguably become mostly obsolete in large part due to Apple and the smartphone revolution it helped create.

Come to think of it, they’ve had a pretty strange history. Every time they have a run of success and seemed poised to become a bona fide dynasty, circumstances conspire to ensure that dream falls just a little bit short. You Win Some, You Lose Some…More Bobby Orr might well be the greatest player in National Hockey League history. However, injuries limited him to just 631 games – spread over ten seasons, in a Bruins uniform. Though they did win the Stanley Cup in 1970 and 1972, those teams were – and are – wholly overshadowed by the dynastic Montreal Canadiens of the same decade. The Bruins also iced very good teams throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, making the playoffs every season. But they lost out each time, including four years in a row to the Canadiens (1984 to 1987) and twice, in the Stanley Cup Final, to the Edmonton Oilers (1988 and 1990), the latter time without having to play against Wayne Gretzky. However, they did manage to fleece the Vancouver Canucks in acquiring Cam Neely…only to watch his career be slowed and, ultimately, truncated by injury. Despite being limited to 726 career games, Cam Neely’s power forward prowess earned him a spot in the Hockey Hall of Fame. (The Hockey Writers via The Boston Globe) The early 2000s saw a resurgence…followed by the lopsided trading of superstar captain Joe Thornton for his lack of production during the 2004 Playoffs – a broken rib isn’t a good excuse, apparently. Oh but it’s okay, they were bad enough to garner the fifth Overall Pick in 2006, using it to select Phil Kessel…a budding star who they then proceeded to trade in 2009. Oh but it’s okay, they rebounded and, in June of 2011, got themselves a Stanley Cup! But then their starting goaltender went crazy and they traded away budding superstar Tyler Seguin for being 21 years old. Oh but it’s okay, they made the Cup final again in 2013, so everything’s fine for the future, right?? But let’s trade away future stalwart defenseman Dougie Hamilton, just to be safe. Might as well get rid of prototypical Bruin Milan Lucic, too. Oh but it’s okay, now we have 3 First Round picks in 2015! It’s not like they’ll ALL fail their physicals, right? Right?! …guys? What an interesting, interesting organisation. Read Also:  The Nuck Stops Here: 5th Overall, Juolevi & Green If It ‘Aint Broke, Break It Their uniform history has been up and down, as well. Check out the mid-century versions below, with the design that can’t make up its mind. The stripes on the jerseys are bad enough, but the socks look as though they let a two year-old have at the colour palette as if it were Whac-A-Mole. Did they blow the entire design budget on three completely different jerseys, forcing them to make one pair of socks for the lot? Were they simply trying to distract everyone from whatever was going on with the tail striping? And since when are yellow pants ever a good idea? Illustration by Andrew M. Greenstein, (The unofficial NHL Uniform Database) It’s almost enough to distract you from the fact that, for a solid decade, the Bruins wore what were, essentially, football jerseys. These kits featuring no logo and player numbers on both the front and back were joined, for 1940-41, by a special jersey featuring a collegiate wordmark on the front. After all, nothing says “professional” quite like something you’d find in a student union bookstore. Illustration by Andrew M. Greenstein, (The unofficial NHL Uniform Database) And, of course, everyone fondly recalls the 1990s, when the Bruins decided, “Hey, you know that awesome, “Spoked-B” logo we have? Let’s change it to Winnie the Pooh!” Illustration by Andrew M. Greenstein, (The unofficial NHL Uniform Database) So Close, and yet… But hey, for a team with nearly a century of history behind it, one has to grant them a few duds. Thankfully, the current iteration isn’t too shabby. Illustration by Andrew M. Greenstein, (The unofficial NHL Uniform Database) Mercifully, the Bruins did not give into peer pressure with the advent of the Reebok Edge uniform system and institute vertical striping under the arms. A simple three-stripe, two-colour combination graces the sleeves and tails of the home and away jerseys, with a lovely, two-tone shoulder yoke, as well. These elements are gritty enough to satisfy the stereotypical, tough-guy image of Boston, while being artistically balanced enough to appease the eggheads in the surrounding suburbs. And the Spoked-B logo is, quite simply, one of the best of all time. Combine this with a simple helmet, pant and sock, and the Bruins have a real winner on their hands. Sort of. My only real beef is with the secondary logo. It draws inspiration from Boston’s very first emblem and, truth be told, is really not bad-looking thing at all. However, its presence on the shoulders of the Bruins’ home and away uniforms, breaks up what I like most about them: blockiness and simplicity. It just looks out of place. If the yokes were not there, the secondary logo would look less intrusive (though the jersey itself might be ruined), but the easiest solution would be to just get rid of it altogether. I would even be fine with it on a third jersey… Brad Marchand can’t believe they’re making him wear this. (Bob DeChiara / USA TODAY Sports) …where it, surprise surprise, looked great! Actually, it was the best part of the Bruins’ old third jersey, which looked like a practice uniform. Where are the tail stripes? And why do away with the lace-up collar? The thick, yellow one looks like it belongs on an off-brand jerseys found at Walmart. This third jersey was concocted solely for the purpose of making money. It is boring and cheap-looking, and was clearly designed on the back of a napkin at breakfast by someone who forgot about the project until 23 minutes before it was due. Read Also:  Overtime With BSC: Darling Trade Implications The 2016 Winter Classic against Les Habitants provided an ideal opportunity to redesign their alternate kit. And redesign they did, drawing heavily upon Boston’s original uniform, worn way back in 1924-25. Illustration by Andrew M. Greenstein, (The unofficial NHL Uniform Database) And you know what? It’s not awful. I love the sweater-like collar. The striping is good. The big numbers that teams like to use for outdoor games have been made to look passable in this iteration – not an easy feat. And I especially like how, in going retro, these jerseys still retain the Bruins’ current black backdrop – brown is a tough colour to make work with any apparel, let alone that of a sports franchise. This design was chosen to replace the blue-light special as the Bruins’ full-time third jersey for the this season. Illustration by Andrew M. Greenstein, (The unofficial NHL Uniform Database) But that logo… Come on. Seriously? It was wonky the first time, what with the big “B” and “N” flanking a much tinier “OSTO”. Why would you reuse it? And why, oh why, would you keep it brown?! Just use the alternate logo you already have! Or what about your 2010 Winter Classic jersey (see below), how about some variation of that? Embed from Getty Images Oh wait, you blew that one, too! The traditional yellow and black colour scheme is “complimented” by brown. Nothing says modern like a cartoon, Comic Sans-esque logo and a colour palette from the 1970s, amirite?? Make It Right A team with this much history and this passionate a fanbase deserves a uniform kit to match. Stop screwin’ around and make this right. But please, feel free to keep on trading all of the players you draft in the First Round – that’s just good, wholesome entertainment for everyone.   (All illustrations by Andrew M.

(AMZN) Stock the Best of the FANG Group? Amazon stock should get a boost from its growth opportunities and resiliency By Larry Ramer, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 1, 2017, 10:25 am EDT Get AMZN alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock the Best of the FANG Group? Why General Motors Company (GM) Stock Keeps Beating the Odds Recent Posts: Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock the Best of the FANG Group? Why General Motors Company (GM) Stock Keeps Beating the Odds 3 Chinese Internet Stocks to Buy for Explosive Growth View All Posts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Amazon stock are tremendous juggernauts that cannot and will not be stopped. Amazon is a monster that keeps finding more powerful growth sectors that it can extend its tentacles into. Investors should not miss the chance to buy the shares of this amazing company which still obviously has tremendous amounts of growth ahead of it. Source: Via Amazon The company’s first-quarter results showed how its many highly potent businesses provide it with so much strength and resiliency, making AMZN stock a surprisingly low-risk investment. Even though the growth of its cloud business, usually described as its main growth engine, slowed, the company was still able to beat analysts’ consensus estimates and Amazon stock climbed despite the market’s weakness. Two of AMZN’s businesses that don’t get a lot of publicity may have been major factors behind the beat. Specifically, the company’s “Other revenue” category, which likely includes advertising revenue, jumped 56% to $850 million, and its worldwide shipping revenue surged 37% to $2.5 billion. AMZN: First-Quarter Results Show Strength, Resiliency So even in the unlikely event that research firm Pacific Crest is right and competition significantly lowers the growth rate of Amazon’s e-commerce and cloud businesses, (I say unlikely because both categories are growing explosively and does anyone seriously believe that millions of Americans are going to abandon AMZN for Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT)?) Amazon’s other businesses can and probably will more than take up the slack. In addition to advertising and shipping, its India business and its Alexa product are seriously ramping. Not to mention, Amazon still has its business-to-business e-commerce initiative, its grocery business and its forays into new e-commerce categories such as clothes. It has become somewhat trite to note that AMZN’s two largest businesses — e-commerce and the cloud — have so much room for growth. E-commerce only accounted for around 12% of U.S. retail sales last year, while cloud penetration continues to grow fairly quickly.

Published on May 01, 2017. Ad Age "Media Guy" columnist Simon Dumenco's media roundup for the morning of Monday, May 1: Let's start with a flashback: President Trump told the Associated Press last week that he thinks he could build his border wall "for $10 billion or less." Earlier flashback: "Trump border wall to cost $21.6 billion," per Reuter's February peek at a Department of Homeland Security internal report. Very recent flashback (to yesterday): Congress ponied up $0 for Trump's border wall. Now see No. 3, below. (Side note: Trump's 71st birthday is coming up on June 14.) Anyway, let's get started ... 1. Here's a helpful assortment of spin on the Spending Deal That Is and the Shutdown That Won't Be: "Congress Inks Spending Deal That Jettisons Trump Priorities," per Bloomberg; "Bipartisan Agreement Reached to Fund Government Through September," per The New York Times; "Spending deal gives millions to NYPD for protecting Trump and family," per the New York Post; "Trump's wall won't get a penny as Congress agrees on $1trn spending plan," per Britain's The Independent -- and be sure to click through to see the photo of Trump the Indy chose to illustrate their story. 2. Because Ryan Seacrest doesn't have enough jobs already ... Today's the day! @RyanSeacrest is Kelly's new co-host! #LiveKellyCohost #KellyandRyan #RyanSeacrest pic.twitter.com/MranogG7nO — LIVE with Kelly (@LiveKelly) May 1, 2017 Apple CEO Tim Cook. Credit: Apple 3. "Apple Inc. is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled hoard that is greater than the market value of either Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined," per The Wall Street Journal's Tripp Mickle. 4. "Sebastian Gorka to leave White House amid accusations of links to far-right," per The Guardian. The former Fox News analyst and Breitbart editor, who was blocked from getting a National Security Council clearance because he was arrested in early 2016 for bringing a handgun through security at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, is staying mum for now. Meanwhile, over on the Breitbart home page right now: "White House Sources: Reports of Gorka Leaving White House Are 'Incorrect.'" 5. Speaking of Fox News, the O'Reilly-free network is super excited about the guest it has slated to appear on "The Fox News Specialists," its new 5 p.m. ET political talk show hosted by Eric Bolling, Katherine Timpf and Eboni K. Williams. You'll never guess who it is! OK, sorry, that was fake news; you will totally be able to guess. 6. Because Rupert Murdoch can never own enough media: "Fox Reportedly in Talks With Blackstone to Launch Joint Bid for Tribune Media," per Variety. 7. And finally, ICYMI: "Samantha Bee's 'Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner': the best and worst moments," courtesy of Vox. Here's the part where Jake Tapper asks Bee, "Were you lying then or are you lying now?" Simon Dumenco, aka Media Guy, is an Ad Age editor-at-large. You can follow him on Twitter @simondumenco.

Here's a quick look back at what's happened at the Clinic during his tenure. June 1, 2004: Dr. Toby Cosgrove, chairman of the Clinic's department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, is named the fifth leader of the hospital system since its founding as a group practice by physicians in 1921. He succeeded Dr. Floyd Loop, who held the position for 14 years. Cosgrove officially begins his duties in October 2004. October-December, 2004: Cosgrove removes Pizza Hut from the Clinic main campus food court and begins a 10-year battle to get McDonald's out the door, too, saying that the hospital system needs to lead by example in providing healthy food options for patients. March, 2006: The Clinic announces plans to expand to Toronto, opening a health and wellness center to offer services such as fitness assessments and stress management, and to lure more Canadian business to the main campus. Cleveland Clinic CEO Dr. Toby Cosgrove stepping down Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove talks about decision to step down: Q & A Cleveland Clinic CEO announces plans to step down Toby Cosgrove's quotable moments as CEO Who might take over for Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove?  June, 2007: The Clinic announces it will no longer hire smokers, a policy that will go into place Sept. 1. The move ensures the Clinic will "walk the walk" of a health-care institution that stands for wellness, Cosgrove told The Plain Dealer at the time. September, 2007: Clinic announces plans to open a new hospital in Abu Dhabi, its first outpost overseas. At the time, Cosgrove told The Plain Dealer the Clinic had inquiries from 50 countries to open branches or provide other services. December, 2008: Clinic institutes hiring and salary freeze, travel restrictions in an effort to preserve jobs during the economic downturn. August-September, 2009: Cosgrove tells the New York Times he would not hire obese people if he could do so lawfully. "We should declare obesity a disease and say we're going to help you get over it," Cosgrove said in that interview, much as the Clinic had done with smokers. The remarks sparked controversy, but Cosgrove defended them, saying they were meant to stimulate discussion about the costs of obesity. September, 2009: The Clinic announces plans to build a medical facility in Las Vegas next to the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, an $80 million facility the Clinic started managing earlier in 2009. February, 2010: Lowe's, the home improvement giant, announces a 3-year deal with the Clinic to send its employees needing heart care to Clinic facilities in an effort to cut costs for the company and secure high quality healthcare.  October, 2012: Walmart Stores, Inc. announces a deal with the Clinic that allows WalMart employees and dependents needing heart care to have consultations and care at the Clinic at no out-of-pocket cost. This is eighth such agreement the hospital inks with employers, including aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing. March, 2013: The Clinic forms its first partnership with a large for-profit hospital system, Community Health Systems, a Nashville-based organization that operates more than 130 hospitals nationwide. "This gives us a national footprint," Cosgrove told The Plain Dealer. "The more we talked about it, the more we realized there were tremendous opportunities for both organizations." June, 2013: The Clinic and Case Western Reserve University announce plans to build a new 165,000 square foot medical education building on the Clinic's main campus. "We're absolutely thrilled," Cosgrove told The Plain Dealer at the time. "This increases the educational mission of the Cleveland Clinic and gives it more presence. Where is our education building right now? There really isn't one -- that's the point." August, 2013: The Clinic announces plans to buy up the majority of Akron General Health System with its for-profit partner, CHS. In the deal finalized a year later, the Clinic invested $100 million in the health system to become minority owner, adding Akron General to the Clinic's community hospitals. September, 2013: Cosgrove tells employees that the health system may have to eliminate jobs to meet a target of cutting $330 million from its 2014 budget. The Clinic first offers early voluntary retirement to about 3,000 employees. June, 2014: Cosgrove, 73, is approached by the Obama administration with an offer to run the troubled Department of Veterans Affairs. A Vietnam veteran who served in Da Nang, Cosgrove was a surgeon in the U.S. Air Force and was awarded the Bronze Star and the Republic of Vietnam Commendation Medal. June 7, 2014: Cosgrove turns down the VA position. "This has been an extraordinarily difficult decision, but I have decided to withdraw from consideration from this position and remain at the Cleveland Clinic, due to the commitment I have made to the organization, our patients and the work that still needs to be done here," he said at the time. October 2014: Clinic forms a strategic alliance with Theranos, then a California company on the rise whose 31-year-old CEO promised to revolutionize blood testing by performing diagnostic tests on a single drop of blood. August, 2015: Clinic succeeds in ousting McDonald's from its main campus food court. February, 2016: The Clinic reports its best financial year ever, recording $481 million in operating income in 2015, due largely to employee-driven cost cutting measures. "Over the last three years, we have reduced the cost of providing care some $600 million," Cosgrove tells staffers. "Had we not been able to make that reduction in our cost and efficiency, we would have had one of the worst financial years that we have ever had." May, 2016: Theranos, a strategic partner with the Clinic, faces scrutiny about the accuracy and effectiveness of its blood testing methods. The Clinic, which had said it would test the California company's technology in its health system, remains quiet about the development. The company's tests were never put into place at the Clinic. December, 2016: President Trump taps Cosgrove to sit on his Strategic and Policy Forum, making Cosgrove the only healthcare representative on the 16-member committee which includes CEOs of WalMart, PepsiCo, JPMorgan Chase, and General Motors, among others. December 20, 2016: Cosgrove is once again interviewed for the VA Secretary position, this time by the Trump administration. August, 2016: Clinic is named No. 1 in heart care for the 22nd year in a row by U.S. News & World Report, and the No. 2 hospital in the country overall, its highest ranking to date. January, 2017: Cosgrove, 76, turns down the VA position, again, citing the work he still needs to accomplish at the Clinic. He says he has no immediate plans to step down from his position as CEO. February, 2017: The Clinic CEO reports a nearly 50 percent decrease in operating income in 2016, from the previous year's record high of $481 million during his annual State of the Clinic address to employees. May 1, 2017: Cosgrove announces he will step down as CEO and make way for his successor, who has yet to be announced.

INNOVATE Here's How Your Business Will Be Disrupted When you find yourself adapting, you are already losing By Greg Satell Greg Satell is a popular writer, speaker and innovation advisor.

His first book, Mapping Innovation, will be published by McGraw-Hill in May. @Digitaltonto Author, Mapping Innovation@Digitaltonto WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The principles of running a business are fairly straightforward. You create clear objectives, achieve them efficiently and try to get better as you go. Business school professors have fancy names for this stuff, like "strategic DNA," "core competencies" and "continuous improvement," but in a nutshell all it means is that you try to do things better, faster and cheaper. The problem comes when you find yourself running a square peg business in a round hole world. When that happens, following traditional best practices will only result in getting better and better at doing things people want less and less. Round holes don't care how good your square pegs are or how efficiently you can produce them. Make no mistake. Eventually, every square peg business eventually finds itself in a round hole world. That's why good companies fail. Not because they somehow become stupid and lazy all of a sudden, but because the world changes and they become irrelevant. Then those same practices that led to success now lead to failure. We need to learn to prepare for a future we cannot yet see. Staying True To Your Strategic DNA Every great business is guided by its mission. Southwest Airlines has outperformed every competitor in its industry by relentlessly focusing on its mission of being "THE low cost airline." In the same vein, Sam Walton strived to offer the lowest prices, everyday. Steve Jobs built Apple around "insanely great products" and Google seeks to "organize the world's information." A clear mission determines your objectives and how you will set out to achieve them. It's what attracts talented people to come to work for you and keeps them motivated. It's also what allows you to coordinate the work of hundreds or even thousands of ambitious, hard driving professionals with a wide diversity of experience, expertise and outlooks. So it's should be no surprise that so many business gurus preach the gospel of mission. A clear mission creates stability and prevents everything from spinning wildly out of control. A strong organizational culture is, in the final analysis, simply how an enterprise honors its mission and everything else flows from that. Staying true to the strategic DNA that a mission creates allows square peg businesses to churn out their products with relentless focus and passion. That's what makes them successful. Honing Your Core Competencies To be effective, a mission needs to form the basis for making decisions. It must reflect deeply held values and values, if they are truly and honestly held, always end up costing you something. Without that, it is just a bunch of pretty words that are pinned up in conference rooms for employees to snicker at. Southwest pays for its mission by limiting the types of aircrafts it flies and the cities it services. Sam Walton invested billions in building a logistics operation that nobody else could match because he saw how it would further his mission of offering the lowest price. Steve Jobs was happy to earn his mission by paying almost superhuman attention to even the smallest detail. If you invest resources into achieving your mission over an extended period of time, you will develop core competencies that will differentiate you in the marketplace. Through honing these competencies, competitors will find it difficult, if not impossible, to copy you, because they will reflect not only choices, but a unique combination of people, process and technology. Successful square peg businesses build the best spare pegs and they do it more cheaply and with better quality than everyone else. Driving Profitability A clear mission gives your enterprise purpose. Core competency provides the means to compete. However, it is profits that provide the resources for you to extend your success. That's why every business strives to increase volume and widen margins. Without profits, you will be unable to invest in developing the core competencies you need to achieve your mission. Southwest and Walmart's low cost model allows them to attract customers through lower prices. Apple has invested in developing a unique supply chain. Google invests in armies of super smart engineers and, with its unparalleled technology and data, is able to attract the world's best scientists to spend sabbatical years at the company and increase its knowledge. A truly great square peg business spawns a virtuous cycle in which value creation produces profits and those profits, in turn, are used to create more value. That's what makes a successful business model so powerful, everything is so intricately intertwined and mutually reinforcing that it almost seems like a perpetual motion machine for making money. Unfortunately, none of this amounts to much when you find yourself competing in a round hole world, because nobody has any use for square pegs anymore. Moving From Strategic Planning To Innovation Planning The truth is that no business model lasts forever. Changes in technology, culture and competitive landscape make the need to shift to a round hole world inevitable. The only variable in the equation is whether you do it sooner or later. And make no mistake, it is always better to prepare than adapt. When you find yourself adapting you are already losing. That's why we desperately need to shift from strategic planning to innovation planning. Strategic planning is based on prediction and there is very little we can predict anymore. These days, it's more important to explore than predict, because it is only through exploration that we can learn how to operate in a round hole world in which square pegs have become irrelevant. As I explain in my book, Mapping innovation, the best way to do this is not to focus on ideas or trends, but problems. In my research, I found that what set truly great innovators apart is not that they were more creative, more agile or even that they had a superior vision of the future, but that they had a disciplined and systematic way of uncovering new problems to solve. And that's how you prepare your square peg business for a round hole business. You plan and manage not for stability, but for disruption. You constantly explore and learn about new technologies and approaches that can help you solve unresolved problems in the marketplace. Anything less is just counting the days to your own obsolescence. . The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Apr 30, 2017 Advertisement

Since then, they have struggled. Their latest chapter includes advocates who want a share of the money they collect for their wrongful imprisonment and a lawyer who expects a cut even if he is fired. Chuck Liddy cliddy@newsobserver.com Crime May 01, 2017 10:57 AM Pardoned brothers’ payout triggers fight over who gets a cut By Mandy Locke and Joseph Neff mlocke@newsobserver.com jneff@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Two and a half years ago, state prison officials handed Henry McCollum and Leon Brown $45 cash each to help them get their footing after three decades in prison for another man’s crime. Even in the best of circumstances, their homecoming would have been tough. The brothers have IQs in the 50s and 60s, and Brown is also mentally ill. They were plucked out of their Robeson County town as teenagers after being convicted of the rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl; in the days after their release, family struggled to shelter them properly. Though free, they were broke and bewildered. Soon, they were surrounded by those who understood what they did not: Their suffering might one day bring big payouts. Over the past two years, consultants and lawyers from out of state have gravitated to the brothers, each aiming to stake a claim in any awards the pair might recoup. Now, some of those players are fighting with each other and threatening to sue over their slice of McCollum and Brown’s awards. “What a sad, sad situation,” said James Coleman, a law professor and co-director of Duke Law School’s Wrongful Conviction Clinic. “These two guys are in the worst position to take care of business for themselves. The state dumps them. They basically wash their hands of these guys.” At least one of these awards will come before a federal judge next month. The Town of Red Springs, where police arrested the brothers, has agreed to pay a settlement. The agreement has been filed under seal and awaits approval from U.S. District Court Judge Terrence Boyle. Intervention with a cost The brothers were released in September 2014 after DNA evidence tied another man to the crime. McCollum’s former death row attorney, Ken Rose, and supporters of the North Carolina Center on Death Penalty Litigation tried to help each brother. They raised more than $14,000 for shoes and underwear, rent and utility bills. A social worker helped enroll them in Medicaid and for food stamps. Still, the brothers struggled while they waited for then-Gov. Pat McCrory to grant an official pardon, which would release state-mandated compensation of $750,000 to each. The family grew impatient. Kimberly Weekes, a consultant from Atlanta, heard about the brothers’ plight from a friend who knew the family. Weekes thought she and her business partner, Deborah Pointer of New York, could bring some pressure to bear on the governor to grant the pardon. She introduced herself to the men and Geraldine Brown, the sister taking care of Leon Brown. In January 2015, the brothers and their sister signed a contract with Weekes and Pointer’s for-profit company. The women, who bill themselves as activists, are not lawyers. They would bring “advocacy and civil rights” services to the case, the contract said. Pointer has worked in the field of college admissions; Weekes has consulted for a number of community outreach projects. In exchange, Weekes and Pointer would be paid an advance and receive a share of the state compensation and any civil awards the brothers received in the future. Weekes informed Rose on Feb. 2, 2015, that she would now be representing the family in civil litigation, the pardon process and fundraising. “They came out of the jail with nothing. … They were in pretty bad shape when we came on board,” Pointer said in a phone interview, defending their payment arrangement. “You reward people that help you. I mean, that’s how I work.” The consultants quickly expanded their role. They urged the brothers to fire their first set of civil attorneys, a lawyer from Michigan and a Wake Forest law professor; Pointer and Weekes solicited a new legal team. Eventually, after lunch at a Marriott hotel in Brooklyn, the women settled on Patrick Megaro of Florida and Scott Brettschneider of New York. “We knew it was a match made in heaven,” Weekes said of the lawyers. A bridge loan Even with the legal team in place, Weekes and Pointer stayed involved for several months. The two describe dozens of hours plotting strategy with the lawyers and working on publicity, including tweeting about the case and having students in Pointer’s community activism class at Metropolitan College in New York City call the governor. Related stories from The Charlotte Observer Brothers return home to freedom State approves payments to Henry McCollum and Leon Brown 2014 Death Row interview with Henry McCollum “[The lawyers] looked to us for everything. Everything. We did the soup and the nuts,” Pointer said. Weekes came to North Carolina to visit and says she spent eight days shuttling the brothers to Walmart and doctors’ appointments. Meanwhile, Pointer worked from New York to secure a settlement advance loan to take care of their living expenses. All told, the two worked for about six months and estimate they spent hundreds of hours helping them; Pointer said she has kept track of their work through email correspondence and phone lists. Pointer and Weekes said Megaro, the attorney, signed off on the loan to the brothers and offered his firm’s guarantee of repayment. The loan carried 19 percent interest. Of the $200,000 total advance, the women took $10,000 each as payment for their help. The $20,000 payment to Weekes and Pointer was to be the first of several, according to a copy of the contract Pointer provided. The women were to receive 5 percent each of the brothers’ $750,000 payout from the state and 1 percent of any potential award secured through civil litigation. The women said they provided their contract with the family to the lawyers and never heard any complaints. Megaro and Brettschneider would also receive a portion of any potential civil awards to the brothers. Megaro declined to say how much, saying it was a confidential agreement with his clients. Pointer and Weekes shared a copy of Megaro’s contract, which they say he provided for their review in March 2015. The contract shows a sliding contingency fee: a third of the first million, with 27 percent of any payouts of more than $2 million. Expenses would be deducted from any award. Such terms are standard in civil lawsuits for damages. But Megaro’s firm added an unusual safeguard. The contract calls for an “irrevocable interest” in the contingency fee he negotiated. Even if the brothers fired him and brought in other attorneys, Megaro would still receive his cut, according to the contract. That arrangement may run afoul of state ethics rules for lawyers that require fees be reasonable and earned, said Ellen Murphy, a professor at Wake Forest Law School who specializes in ethics. Megaro defended his compensation, saying he has invested thousands of hours in the case and has missed much of his sons’ lives while traveling to North Carolina to work on McCollum and Brown’s lawsuit. “I’ve represented them vigorously and zealously because I believe they have been wronged, in my heart…” Megaro said. “I have taken years off my life with the travel and stress of this case,” he added. Rose worked for The Center on Death Penalty Litigation, a nonprofit, during the 20 years he represented McCollum; he and a colleague filed the brothers’ request for a pardon for free. Staffers at the center say they donated more than 100 hours of time trying to get the brothers settled after their release. Strained relations After nearly 10 months, McCrory pardoned the brothers in June 2015. The payments it guaranteed are not taxable. With the arrival of the money, allegiances began to falter. Relationships between Weekes and Pointer and the lawyers began to sour after Megaro did not pay them the $37,500 that each was expecting from the brothers’ state compensation. Megaro said the consultants’ contract with the brothers isn’t legally enforceable. “I have no agreement with Deborah Pointer and Kim Weekes,” Megaro said. “I never signed off on any agreement. I have never paid them a single penny nor did I authorize any payment to them, nor would I ever.” Weekes and Pointer vow to sue the lawyers. Other relationships have become strained as well. In a brief conversation with The N&O this month, McCollum had harsh words for Weekes and Pointer, calling them “snakes.” He said “they don’t deserve to get nothing” out of his settlement. Weekes and Pointer said McCollum’s words are hurtful and confusing. Weekes and Pointer also had a falling out with Geraldine Brown, saying “greed” took her over and that she was ill-equipped to care for her brothers. A Fayetteville attorney has now replaced Geraldine Brown as Leon Brown’s guardian. Geraldine Brown couldn’t be reached for comment. Despite quarrels over payments, this is clear: The women and legal team were in communication and collaborating in the spring of 2015, according to emails provided by Pointer. They consulted each other about media interviews for the brothers and a demonstration in Raleigh to apply pressure on McCrory to pardon the brothers. In the email exchanges, Megaro expressed gratitude for the help of Weekes and Pointer, including for alerting him that Brown had been arrested after he got confused one night and began banging on doors at a hotel where he was staying. “Thank you both for helping me,” Megaro wrote in an August email. “This new situation has now created a new sense of urgency so I will have to really start moving on some legal action to make sure he gets appropriate attention.” Brown, who suffers from both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, has been declared incompetent and is a ward of the state living in a group home in the Fayetteville area. McCollum has moved to Richmond, Va. Rose, McCollum’s death row attorney, said he fretted over the brothers after Weekes and Pointer got involved. When Megaro was hired to take the case, Rose said the Florida attorney told him to “stay away from” McCollum. (Megaro denied driving a wedge between McCollum and Rose.) Rose has maintained a connection with his former client but is careful to avoid offering any guidance that could be considered legal advice. That distance pains Rose. “This is a guy I had been representing for 20 years,” Rose said. Locke: 919-829-8927 or @MandyLockeNews The story so far Henry McCollum and his brother, Leon Brown, were convicted largely based on confessions that Red Springs police and agents from the State Bureau of Investigation said they offered. They had been charged with raping and killing 11-year-old Sabrina Buie. McCollum spent more than 30 years on death row; his brother was sentenced to life in prison. In 2014, officials from the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission found DNA evidence matching another convicted murderer on a cigarette butt found at the scene. Attorneys for the brothers had been previously told the evidence had been destroyed. The commission was evaluating only Brown’s case at the time. Commission officials shared the DNA findings with Robeson County District Attorney Johnson Britt and attorneys for the brothers in spring of 2014. Britt and the attorneys decided to jointly ask a judge to free them as soon as possible. A judge granted that request in September 2014. “It was the most perfect way to find justice as soon as possible,” said Britt. Because the brothers were not exonerated through the Innocence Inquiry Commission, the governor needed to grant them a pardon of innocence before they could collect their guaranteed compensation: $50,000 a year for each year in prison with a cap of $750,000. McCrory granted that pardon in June 2015. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:50 CMPD Chief Kerr Putney doesn't defend actions Pause 1:27 Missing Rock Hill teen's family, neighborhood asking for help 0:57 Immigration protesters in uptown Charlotte 2:58 US Rep.

By Sally Beauvais/Marfa Public Radio • 14 hours ago TweetShareGoogle+Email Pecos-Barstow-Toyah ISD teachers help third graders in Room 29. Sally Beauvais / Marfa Public Radio Every year, the state of Texas and local school districts pay more and more for public education. Together, they’ll spend a projected $46 billion on Texas schools in 2017. That money comes from two main places: the state government and local property taxes. But that burden isn’t shared equally. Listen Listening... / 3:57 Listen to the Texas Decides story from Marfa Public Radio. 'Things are frozen in time'  Last year, the Texas Supreme Court called the funding system “Byzantine” and urged legislators to work on “transformational, top-to-bottom reforms that amount to more than Band-Aid on top of Band-Aid.” That seems to be the push lawmakers needed to take school funding seriously in 2017. As the state’s share of the school funding pie chart continues to decline, listener Angela Greca wondered: Why do our property taxes go up every year, but the amount that the state spends per student does not? Greca works with bilingual students at Richardson ISD, just outside of Dallas, and has two kids in the school district. Her daughter was diagnosed with dyslexia last year and gets extra help in the classroom. She’s concerned that special programs like the one her daughter’s in will be the first to go if the state doesn’t increase its spending. Students of Pecos-Barstow-Toyah ISD play outside in the parking lot. Credit Sally Beauvais / Marfa Public Radio Why doesn’t the state spend more? According to Chandra Villanueva at the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin, the simple answer is they’re just following the formula. “What we’ve been seeing happening is that our school finance formulas aren’t adjusted for things like inflation and rising property values across the state. So it’s almost like things are frozen in time,” Villanueva said. Over time, according to State Rep. Dan Huberty, we’ve let rising local property tax revenue fill in that gap created by the formulas. “And so we basically, we’ve shifted the cost for funding of education from the state to the locals,” Huberty said on the House floor last month. Why do our property taxes go up every year, but the amount that the state spends per student does not? 'It seems contradictory' That’s why even school districts that generate a lot of property tax revenue, like Pecos-Barstow-Toyah ISD, are struggling. Pecos is home to about 8,000 residents, with 2,500 kids in the school district. The area has a couple of claims to fame: the Pecos Cantaloupe, the world’s first rodeo, and, according to district superintendent Jim Haley, some of the best barbecue in the state. Oh, and oil. Lots of it. Haley says that since the ‘90s, petroleum has been the main industry in Pecos. And in the eyes of Texas lawmakers, his district is property wealthy – that means that the amount of property tax revenue the district brings in per student is above average. That’s largely thanks to the oil and gas reserves that the district sits on – literally.

We have about 65 percent of families are on free and reduced lunch, meaning they’re close to the poverty level.” Jim Haley is the superintendent for Pecos-Barstow-Toyah ISD.

The remaining 85 percent comes from the oil industry. While this might seem like a lucky break for a district like Pecos, of the $40 million they raise a year in tax revenue, they keep only $19 million, less than half. The rest is absorbed by the state and redistributed to property-poor districts, through a process called "recapture." Teachers are spending out of pocket for supplies As property values in the state of Texas increase, the number of districts that owe recapture is on the rise. This is how Texas tries to keep school funding fair. Some parents, like Stacie Fowlkes, have a hard time seeing it like that. “As a teacher and a parent and a taxpayer, it’s frustrating when all of that money is taken out for your child and then it’s not used for the children in the district,” she said. Fowlkes is a special education teacher and parent of two at Pecos ISD. She and her coworkers are wearing shirts they designed online that say “Straight Outta Room 29,” a nod to the N.W.A. album, and the room where their third graders come for extra help. They’re used to spending money out of pocket for school supplies, even for basic classroom needs. “If you see a teacher at Walmart, you know they’re probably not shopping for their families,” Fowlkes said. “They’re shopping for the kids at school.” With the current funding formula, even property-rich Pecos ISD is operating at an almost $3 million deficit. Next year, they’ll eliminate 17 teaching positions from the budget, which means increased class sizes. All this has parents and teachers not too happy about the whole recapture thing. Chandra Villanueva says it’s unfortunate that recapture has gotten a bad rap. She says recapture is actually doing exactly what it was designed to do: improve equity between districts. She thinks upping how much the state spends is the real solution. Stacie Fowlkes helps a student.

It’s harder for parents in districts to say, 'well if this part of the formula was changed, we’d be in a better position,'” she said. Superintendent Haley is optimistic. He says, this session, lawmakers seem serious about making that formula change. Representative Huberty sponsored a massive education funding overhaul that passed the House last month. It’s one of several bills being considered this session aimed at simplifying and modernizing how Texas funds its schools. If Huberty’s bill makes it to the Governor’s desk, it would provide Texas’s public schools with an extra $1.6 billion.
