(Source: Pima County Sheriff's Office) The suspect allegedly got into a white SUV that drove away from the scene. (Source: Pima County Sheriff's Office) TUCSON, AZ (3TV/CBS 5) - Authorities were searching for a man who allegedly stole an elderly woman's purse at a Wal-Mart in Tucson. The alleged theft occurred around 1:15 p.m. on May 19 just outside of the entrance of a Wal-Mart in the 2100 block of W. Ruthrauff Road, according to a news release from the Pima County Sheriff's Office. Video surveillance showed the suspect waited near the front entrance of the store and followed the woman as she walked outside. In the parking lot, the suspect approached the victim from behind, grabbed her purse from her shopping cart and ran away, according to the news release. The suspect got into a white SUV waiting for him on the east side of the building and drove southbound on N. La Cholla Boulevard. The suspect was described as a Hispanic or Native American man, about 5 feet, 6 inches to 6 feet tall. The man appeared to be in his 30s and had a tattoo on the right side of his neck. He was last seen wearing a white long-sleeve shirt, blue jeans and white shoes, according to the news release. Anyone with information about the incident was asked to call 911 or submit an anonymous tip to 88-CRIME. Copyright 2017 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation). All rights reserved.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch Stock Update For May 21 Posted: May 22 2017, 12:55am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The latest Nintendo Switch stock tracking information for online and in store availability for Sunday, May 21th. On Sunday, May 21, the Nintendo Switch in stock online, but only as part of bundles. Best Buy has restocked the Nintendo Switch on Sunday. We reported about the $299.99 Nintendo Switch availability on Sunday at Best Buy before it was official. Best Buy advertised the Switch in the new Best Buy weekly ad.  Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com Best Buy had deep stock of the Nintendo Switch. Some shopper report that their local store had over 30 units in stock. Other reported on social media to have been able to find a Switch in stock still late Sunday. ToysRUs was restocking the $299.99 Nintendo Switch in stores on Friday. This was a solid opportunity to find a Nintendo Switch console as well as the Walmart.com Nintendo Switch at 5pm ET on Friday. This was the 7th time Walmart sold the Nintendo Switch on Fridays. This time we I used our new improved The Tracker app to buy a Nintendo Switch bundle the Walmart sale. The inventory just lasted 4 minutes. We will give away this Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy Con, 2 Pro Controllers and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as soon as it arrives in our office.  The Nintendo Switch console is available online on Sunday only as part of bundles. GameStop offers three Nintendo Switch bundles. Past week was seeing a big wave of new Nintendo Switch stock. We expect the coming week to be very slow, without any major Nintendo Switch sales, besides Walmart on Friday. Nintendo believes the Nintendo Switch will be as big as the extremely successful Nintendo Wii. Looking at the current shortage, the Japanese video game maker has a long road ahead of them to ship 101 million Nintendo Switch consoles. The positive reception and praise of the Nintendo Switch fuel the demand for the mobile and home console hybrid. Nintendo is also busy marketing the Nintendo Switch with hands-on events and at the E3 2017. Find below the latest Nintendo Switch online availability updates and stock tracking updates for stores. Nintendo Switch Stock at Online Stores On Sunday three Switch bundles are on sale at gamestop.com. The latest bundles from GameStop are priced lower starting at $472.99. GameStop also runs a big video game accessories sale, including discounts of 20% on select Switch accessories. Target's Nintendo Switch bundle on offer at target.com sells for $499.99. It is rather attractive bundle including Pro Controller, Zelda, Mario Kart and a bag. The Switch bundle at Target ships now, while the three GameStop offers ship May 26. Amazon restocked the Nintendo Switch on Wednesday afternoon. Only Prime members got access to the Nintendo Switch stock. When the next Switch sale on Amazon takes place is not known. Use our new Tracker app to get notified when the Switch is in stock at Amazon. On Friday at 5:01pm ET, Walmart is sold again the Nintendo Switch online at walmart.com. This was the 7th time Walmart sold the Nintendo Switch on Fridays.  The Switch will be available as a custom bundle. Through the Walmart app the $299 Switch consoles have been available too. To get an notification when Walmart is again selling the Nintendo Switch online next week try our new Tracker app. The Switch is extremely hard to score on Friday at walmart.com. A lot of successful orders got cancelled afterwards as Walmart sold more than they had available. It is a head-scratcher why Walmart's shopping platform is not able to keep sales and stock in sync. Amazon in the UK is offering the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con with an in stock date of May 25. The price of the UK import comes to $332.22 with 5 day shipping.  At this point no online retailer is selling the $299.99 Nintendo Switch consoles. The Nintendo Switch will continue to be hard to find for the foreseeable future. Nintendo plans to ship 10 million consoles world-wide in the time from April 2017 to April 2018. From the launch on Mach 3 to April 27, the Mario company sold 2.74 million Switch consoles. Online stores restocked the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and the $299.99 Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in time for the launch of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on April 28. Since then the Switch console was out of stock online, besides the TRU bundle offer, according to data from The Tracker. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $90 to $110 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $100 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. The Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con is more rare than the console with Gray controllers, resulting in considerable higher market value. Overall the Nintendo Switch market prices have risen slightly. To find Nintendo Switch in stock online, shoppers can use our new The Tracker app, available as free download for iOS and Android.  There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories. When is Nintendo Switch in stock online again? Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. The Nintendo Switch will likely be offered in special bundles in time for the Holidays. A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Switch bundle has already surfaced in Russia. Because of the incredible demand for the Switch console, the monetary savings on these bundles will be limited. Usually bundles offer a way for consumers to get a free game. Nintendo can afford to just offer some savings, unless the demand is slowing down. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news. How to find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Online We developed the The Tracker app to make finding stock of rare products online as easy and stress free as possible. Download the free app for Apple iPhone or Android phones. From the list products you select to be notified for the Switch with Grey Joy-Con and/or Neon Joy-Con. That is it. It is set and forget. At the moment we detect the Nintendo Switch console in stock at major online retailers, you receive a notification on your smartphone. Now you are just a tap away from buying a Nintendo Switch. You can also see the current availability of the Nintendo Switch consoles in the web version of The Tracker: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con, Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con. Nintendo Switch in Stock at Stores Best Buy stores had the Nintendo Switch in stock this morning. We prepared our readers for this Switch event before it was official. The Nintendo Switch is also available in 869 Walmart stores, 245 Target stores, 24 GameStop locations according to the Nintendo Switch inventory tracker iStockNow (1:30pm ET). The number of Walmart stores increased by over 200 compared to Friday.  The Nintendo flagship store in New York said on April 28 in a tweet to have the Nintendo Switch in stock each morning. People in New York or visitors can give this purchase option a try. Social media posts from people who visited the flagship store confirm the availability of the Switch at the Nintendo store in New York. Some even report that they saw the Switch still on the shelves late afternoon.  The big upcoming Switch games are Arms on June 16 and Splatoon 2 on July 21. Amazon offers pre-order discounts on both of the titles for Prime members to the tune of 20%. Read the latest Nintendo Switch news.

WNYC News Published by WNYC News Walmart Backs Out of Opening Store in Brooklyn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email a Friend Sep 14, 2012 · by Charlie Herman and Ilya Marritz Walmart is abandoning efforts to open a store in East New York, Brooklyn — a move that would have established the retailer's first store in New York City. Although Walmart never confirmed it was in negotiations with Related Companies over a site near Jamaica Bay known as Gateway II, Steven Restivo, a spokesman for the company said in a written statement, "Walmart today announced that we were unable to agree upon economic terms for a project in East New York." A spokeswoman for Related had no comment. Union-backed groups and some elected officials had opposed Walmart opening a store at the location. "Walmart’s withdrawal from Gateway II shows that when New Yorkers join arms, even the world’s richest retailer is no match for them,” said Stephanie Yazgi, a spokeswoman for Walmart Free NYC in a statement. A source familiar with the negotiations between Walmart and Related said the two parties did not come to an agreement on economic terms — not because of vocal opposition. Related received approval to develop the site from the New York state this summer.  It already had approvals from New York City to build a 600,000-square foot shopping facility to house several retailers.  Though currently vacant, Gateway II when finished will be adjacent to the existing Gateway I, already home to several big box retailers like Home Depot and Target. At the same time that Walmart announced ending negotiations at Gateway II, ShopRite reportedly signed an agreement to open a supermarket there.  The grocery store uses union labor, unlike Walmart. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, a vocal critic of Walmart, praised ShopRite. "I welcome this company’s newest location with its history of responsible business practices, supporting its workers and the communities they serve," Quinn said in a statement. Pat Purcell with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1500 said, "This is less about Walmart not going in and ShopRite going in.  The community desperately needed a supermarket." He later added, "A supermarket was a better fit with what is already there." Purcell said the ShopRite will create 1,300 UFCW union jobs. ShopRite did not confirm a deal, but spokesperson Karen Meleta said in a statement, "We have been pursuing this location for some time and believe that we will be able to confirm the status of this potential site shortly." Wal-Mart said it is examining other opportunities across the five boroughs. "We remain committed to bringing new economic development and shopping options to New York City, especially in the neighborhoods that need them most," Restivo said.

Find Out if Amazon, Target, or Wal-Mart Has the Best Offer As consumers increase their online spending, delivery speed, cost, and convenience have become ways for competing retailers to differentiate themselves. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) May 21, 2017 at 10:42AM Free shipping has become an expected perk in many cases when consumers shop online. The challenge for retailers, of course, is to deliver items for free without taking too big a hit while doing so. To make that happen, companies like Target (NYSE:TGT), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) all set a minimum order threshold for a customer to qualify for free shipping. But while these brands offer it in some form, how they define the concept varies. So when it comes to shopping with these major retailers, it is important to understand where each company sets its order threshold to qualify for free shipping and when customers can actually expect their delivery. Wal-Mart is using its stores to ship some digital orders. Image source: Wal-Mart. What does each company offer? Amazon recently lowered its minimum order size for free shipping from $35 of eligible items to $25. That said, shoppers may not like that the e-commerce leader takes five to eight business days to deliver your order. By today's standards, that is slow -- indeed the slowest of the three, arguably -- but that may be intentional. Amazon would prefer to drive consumers to its $99-per-year Prime membership, which comes with free, two-day shipping and even Sunday delivery in many markets. As it turns out, the estimated 65 million Prime members in the U.S. spend "on average about $1,200 per year, compared with about $600 per year for non-member customers," according to a November report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Target's deal, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. The company requires consumers to spend $35 to get free shipping, but the order reaches your door in three to five business days. The retailer also offers this free standard shipping to anyone who uses its REDcard debit or credit card to pay for an online order. Last but not least, Wal-Mart similarly has a $35 free-shipping threshold, but customers who reach that minimum get two-day shipping. That's a perk Amazon customers pay for and one that the brick-and-mortar giant used to charge $50 for under its now-defunct ShippingPass program. Wal-Mart is the clear free-shipping winner Excluding the Amazon Prime membership, Wal-Mart has the best deal for consumers who want to get their orders in two days at no extra charge. Keep in mind, however, that Amazon Prime offers more than 50 million eligible items for its two-day service, while Wal-Mart can only boast around two million. For shoppers who really need their orders now, both Amazon and Target are pushing faster shipping options. Free two-hour delivery is already available to Prime members on some items in limited markets, and Target has been testing one-day delivery on what it calls "essentials" for an as yet unnamed fee. These programs are still in their early days, and for most people, two days is fast enough. It's easy to see why millions of people happily pay for an Amazon Prime membership. In addition to streaming music and video services, being able to place even a tiny order and have it shipped out in two days is very convenient. But if you can survive with a smaller product selection, Wal-Mart has what is currently the best free-shipping offer. Will this pay off for the world's largest retailer? The free two-day shipping from Wal-Mart should aid the company's ongoing efforts to grow its digital customer base, but it will take its toll on margins. Amazon has shown a willingness to play the long game, sacrificing short-term profits to build a loyal customer relationship. Wal-Mart seems to be adopting a similar mindset, but it's hard to know if the company will stick to its shipping offer after a few quarters of e-commerce growth are matched by decreasing profitability.

THE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Buy This Image Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print ARCHBOLD, Ohio — Red Rambler Coffees, a coffee shop in Wauseon that roasts its own blends, faced the ultimate test last week. A team of efficiency experts from the java-loving metropolis of Seattle was arriving Tuesday in nearby Archbold, Ohio, and Kevin Sauder, president and CEO of Sauder Woodworking Co., wasn’t about to play host without a special custom-blended brew to offer his guests. But the experts from Amazon.com weren’t in Fulton County to sip coffee. Kevin Sauder, president and CEO of Sauder Woodworking, shows the volume of the company’s products. THE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Enlarge | Buy This Image They were there to help Sauder Woodworking, the North American industry leader in ready-to-assemble furniture, improve its manufacturing techniques, product development, and shipping strategy to better satisfy Amazon, its Seattle-based e-commerce partner. Nationwide, e-commerce is savaging many bricks-and-mortar retailers, forcing them to cut work forces, close stores, cancel expansion plans, and gut many shopping malls and strip centers. But less talked about is what online shopping is doing to companies that produce goods that are bought — the manufacturers. “We’re really now in two businesses,” Mr. Sauder said. “We’re in long production runs [of items] that sell in Wal-Mart retail, Target retail, and Ikea.” And then there is e-commerce, he said, which “really is about more products, more style, more colors, shorter production runs, more emphasis on quick delivery, and finding the best way to get it to the end consumer damage-free.” Sauder Woodworking’s online sales have more than doubled in a few years, to 35 percent now, up from 15 percent a few years ago. The firm’s chief expects those sales to rise to 50 percent of the firm’s revenue in two years. Many of the changes required by e-commerce cannot be automated, meaning that privately owned Sauder Woodworking has needed to add employees. As a result, worker productivity — the Holy Grail of manufacturing — has fallen off at the sprawling furniture-making operations that began in Archbold 83 years ago. “Our production per labor hours has gone down in the last few years because we have to do more handling and shipping of goods,” Mr. Sauder said. The Amazon.com team came to northwest Ohio to scrutinize the company’s operation and, it was hoped, make Sauder more efficient based on the team’s expertise in dealing with other e-commerce partners. Over the last five years, as it has courted e-commerce partners, Sauder Woodworking has made changes in its revenue sources and business model. For decades, Sauder Woodworking’s forte was making bookshelves, entertainment centers, desks, and a variety of other ready-to-assemble furniture pieces that would be sold in stores of business partners such as Kmart, Wal-Mart, Target, and most recently, Ikea. It would make 1,500 units at a time of a particular unit, put them on pallets, and truck them to the retailer’s warehouse to be stocked later in stores. Because Sauder could be guaranteed only a minimum amount of store display and shelf space, as it was competing with rival products, it limited the number of overall products it made to those that sold best. Logan Alvarez prepares to wrap a package for an online order at the Sauder distribution center in Archbold, Ohio. THE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Enlarge | Buy This Image “Every item had to be a home run,” Mr. Sauder said. But in 2000, Wal-Mart Stores created Walmart.com and a shortly after began selling Sauder products online. Then, sales from Target.com, Amazon.com, and recently, Wayfair.com have added to the mix. Sauder Woodworking, which employs more than 2,000 workers and is looking to hire 150 more, is grateful for the revenues online sales have opened up. “We’re committed to e-commerce,” Mr. Sauder said. But the new business has brought changes. The manufacturer has changed a packing line in its Erie Sauder Distribution Center to handle better packing to products to be shipped to individual customers. The line is now twice as long to allow workers to pack one product while another is being readied for the task. Because individual employees, instead of forklift drivers, now will be lifting heavy items to ship to consumers under the Amazon or Wayfair label, Sauder is reconfiguring 50,000 square feet of space to add an automated area where it can store products and rapidly retrieve them using robots. “I can’t say how much, but I can tell you the investment is significant,” Mr. Sauder said. The company is trying to group similar items together during the manufacturing phase to save time that is normally wasted. For example, workers would use a drilling machine to make parts needing a hole with a specific size. When finished, they stopped to change drill bits before moving on to make a part needing a different size hole. Whether they made one part or 500, it still takes an hour to change drill bits, Mr. Sauder said. But now the company can take parts that are different, but which all use the same size hole, and produce them together in one long run, saving time. Vernon Wachtmann, left, and Shawn Summers stack boxes for shipment. Individual employees, not forklift drivers, are lifting heavy items to ship to consumers under the Amazon or Wayfair label, while other products will go to retailers like Wal-Mart. THE BLADE/DAVE ZAPOTOSKY Enlarge | Buy This Image Errol Denger, the director of commerce strategy at San Francisco-based Adobe Systems Inc., said manufacturers like Sauder are being forced to rewrite their business model because consumers are demanding a better shopping experience and online retailers like Wayfair and others must differentiate themselves from their online and bricks-and-mortar competitors. “Think about why Wayfair wants the extra knobs and other options,” Mr. Denger said. Wayfair knows, he said, that its basic products are likely to be the same or similar to products sold on rival Amazon.com, he said, so extra knobs, colors, and other options on products sold by Wayfair separate its products from others. Mr. Sauder said consumers have become adept at price comparisons while shopping online. “So I know what a 16-ounce bottle of Tide costs, and I’m not going to pay extra for it,” he said. But Wayfair will ask Sauder to add small options and variations to its products, making comparison shopping almost impossible. In the United States, e-commerce is growing at about 15 percent annually and totals about $425 billion a year, Mr. Denger said. “Amazon actually captures 51 percent of all new e-commerce growth in the U.S., and 24 percent of total retail growth,” he said. For a company like Sauder, continual adjustments will be needed for e-commerce orders to keep the process efficient and worth doing, Mr. Denger said. Mr. Sauder said e-commerce is helping Sauder broaden sales. For example, Walmart.com carries higher-end Sauder furniture that Wal-Mart’s stores will not. “People who wouldn’t think of going to Walmart for furniture are willing to look at Walmart.com. ... And suddenly you’re getting a new level of customers you didn’t get before,” Mr. Sauder said. In the future, most furniture will be purchased online, Mr. Sauder said. E-commerce has prompted the company to build a photography studio and add personnel to beef up its digital photography for use on retailer websites. “In the past, with discount retail customers, we would just shoot one or two angles of the product to be available for the carton graphics and catalog sheets,” Mr. Sauder said. “Now, with e-commerce, we probably take over a dozen shots of each item, including a 360-degree video shot, which are then loaded on the e-commerce sites.” Contact Jon Chavez at: jchavez@theblade.com or 419-724-6128.

A proposed settlement of $7.5 million would pay for claims by current and former Wal-Mart associates in the U.S, and Puerto Rico that they were unable to obtain health insurance coverage for their same-sex spouses from 2011 to 2013. The lawsuit was initially filed in 2015 by Jacqueline Cote, an employee at a Massachusetts Wal-Mart. The suit said the Bentonville, Arkansas, company denied medical insurance for her wife. Wal-Mart began offering benefits for same-sex spouses in 2014. A fairness hearing is scheduled for Monday. Judges hold such hearings to determine whether the settlement should be approved as fair, reasonable and adequate.

A high-ranking federal official told the Star his agency has no evidence of “malicious intent” by the eight students. Nevertheless, the purchases reveal what officials say is a potentially troubling vulnerability in federal and Arizona firearms laws, which exempt international students and other nonimmigrant visa holders with hunting licenses from prohibitions on gun ownership. One of the University of Arizona students cited said he was simply intrigued by American gun culture and wanted to have the experience of shooting his own firearm, a common motivation among the cited students, according to the federal official. “It’s totally not possible,” Yifei Gong said of his prospects of ever owning a gun in China, where individual gun ownership is heavily restricted. “You probably won’t have a firearm for your life. That’s why most people want a firearm in China. They can’t buy one; that’s why they want one.” Following advice found online and from fellow international students, Gong went to a Walmart and purchased a resident hunting license in November, according to him and Arizona Game and Fish Department records obtained by the Star. With the license, he said, he went to a gun shop and bought a semi-automatic RAS47, a U.S.-made rifle designed to mimic the Kalashnikov. While self-defense was an element of his desire to purchase a gun, Yifei said it was first and foremost for “fun,” and he took his rifle to local shooting ranges several times. But Gong’s time as an Arizona gun owner was to be short-lived. In the early morning of Dec. 6, a state game and fish officer and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations agents went to Gong’s off-campus Tucson apartment to ask about his license and, ultimately, to seize his firearm, according to a report. Gong was cited by the state officer for fraudulently obtaining a hunting license, a Class 2 misdemeanor to which he pleaded guilty and paid a fine. He is facing no other state or federal charges, according to court documents and a federal official. Gong’s experience was not an isolated incident. As of early May, seven other Chinese students at the UA had been similarly cited and had their guns taken, according to court records and Homeland Security Investigations. The citations and seizures are the most recent development in what Scott Brown, the Phoenix HSI special agent in charge, described as a more than yearlong project of the Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats, a multiagency group of state and federal agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Arizona Department of Public Safety. Despite the ominous sound of the name, Homeland Security Iinvestigations, the lead agency on the matter, does not suspect the eight UA students had any “malicious intent” when they acquired their licenses and guns, Brown said. He did say there are a “very small number” of other cases where there could be such intent, but even with those, Brown clarified, “our concern isn’t necessarily that they themselves pose the direct threat.” “People like to go out in the desert and shoot guns — U.S. citizens and foreign students alike,” he said of what his agency found to be the most common motivation at play. Brown said the cases highlight what he described as a loophole in firearms regulation that “could be exploited by those with malicious intent.” “This is occurring in other states, where there are foreign students, where there are similar state hunting license requirements,” he added. As it stands under federal law, nonimmigrant visa holders, like international students, are generally prohibited from owning guns. However, exemptions are made for those with a valid hunting license or permit, according to the ATF’s website. Arizona law reflects that exemption. To buy a resident Arizona hunting license, applicants must have lived in the state for six months and not claim residency in another state or jurisdiction, according to the Game and Fish Department. One of the requirements of an F-1 student visa is maintaining “a residence abroad which you have no intention of giving up,” according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service’s website. That designation would typically prevent an international student from being able to get a resident hunting license. “The visa paperwork make it very clear that they are not a resident of the United States,” said Gene Elms, law enforcement branch chief with Arizona Game and Fish. “They don’t qualify for a resident license in Arizona.” Nevertheless, Gong said he easily purchased a resident tag at the Walmart on South Houghton Road last November, something Elms said he wasn’t surprised to hear. Other students purchased their resident licenses similarly, though two bought them through AZGFD’s online hunting license portal, according to AZGFD reports. “I went to Walmart and they asked me how long I’ve been here. I’ve been here for at least two years, and they just assumed that I’m a resident of Arizona, and that’s the hunting license they gave me,” Gong said. A Walmart spokesperson confirmed Gong’s purchase. “We have policies and procedures in place to help ensure we comply with applicable laws when issuing hunting licenses,” a statement from the company read. “A customer must provide valid identification at the time of the purchase to confirm residency.” Several local gun shops declined to sell Gong a gun, citing their policy of not selling to international students. However, he said he eventually found one where his hunting license and other documents were enough to buy an RAS47. “I did not know (I was breaking the law) until they seized my firearm. I believe that most of the people who are cited with this charge did not know that,” Gong said. “If there is something wrong with my hunting license, why would they sell it to me?” Nonresident Arizona hunting licenses, while significantly more expensive than resident tags, can be purchased by nonimmigrant visa holders in Arizona. It’s legal for such license holders to buy and own a firearm until the license expires, at which time “they become a prohibited possessor,” said Mark Hart, a spokesman for the Game and Fish Department. No “big hammer” In late 2015, the FBI issued a warning after it received reports of Chinese international students “legally” purchasing guns, according to a Dec. 23 Phoenix ABC 15 story. In one case detailed in the broadcast, a Chinese student was expelled and deported after bringing two AR-15s onto the Arizona State University campus. Brown described that incident as “the most serious” in Arizona involving an armed international student. Then, on Jan. 16, Juang Yue, a 19-year-old Chinese student at ASU, was shot and killed in a road-rage incident, news of which spread quickly in the Chinese student community. In the wake of the tragedy, some Chinese students expressed an interest in buying guns for self-defense, and information on how to acquire them circulated online, as did warnings about the potential dangers of gun ownership. Gong said he was aware of the incident but that it played only a small role in his desire to purchase a gun. It was around the time of the FBI warning and shooting that ASU’s Police Department asked the ATF for assistance with foreign student gun purchases. ATF, in turn, reached out to HSI because of its expertise in immigration-related issues, according to Brown. In late 2016, state game and fish employees also noticed an uptick in students who did not appear to be residents coming to their Tucson office to buy hunting licenses, Elms said. It took time, Brown said, to acquire the records necessary to determine who may have purchased licenses and firearms illegally, as well as what their intent was. The hunting license charges started coming in late 2016, according to court records. But those misdemeanor citations came from the state wildlife agency, not HSI, which could have brought more serious federal firearms charges. “If there’s no malicious intent and we can get the students into compliance, remove the unlawfully obtained firearms ... we don’t need to drop a big hammer,” Brown said about why the state filed the charges. Beyond Gong’s AK-47 lookalike, HSI agents have seized handguns and other rifles from the UA students. “Every person that we’ve talked to, that we’ve seized weapons from, has acknowledged that they were not purchased for the purpose of hunting,” Brown said. “One person did say they were for hunting coyotes. The story was so hideously inaccurate he eventually decided that he didn’t want to stick with that story.” Updates, reform needed There are several efforts underway to make it more difficult for foreign students to improperly purchase guns. While declining to go into details, Brown said the Legislature and Congress may eventually consider legislation that would “close the vulnerabilities.” At the state level, the goal would be to reach “a standardized definition of residency in alignment with the federal definition of residency,” Brown said. When it comes to nonresident hunting licenses, Homeland Security Investigations feels they should enable nonimmigrant visa holders to purchase only guns “specific to hunting/outdoor game sportsmanship,” according to a statement provided by the agency. While he’s sympathetic to the concerns raised by HSI and others, Elms pointed out that many foreign nationals come to Arizona to hunt from around the world and legislative changes could negatively impact their ability to do so. If the department’s commission backs a state legislative change, Elms said the state Game and Fish Department might support it, but at the end of the day, it is federal law “that creates this loophole,” referencing the hunting license exemption for nonimmigrant visa holders purchasing guns. “Our state statute simply points to that federal legislation,” he added. In their statement, HSI agrees that the federal exemptions for nonimmigrant visitors “need to be updated.” “HSI and law enforcement partners have discussed that aliens here for specific hunting and/or professional sporting competition should be the only ones in possession of firearms or granted exemption to purchase firearms,” the statement goes on to say. In the next few years, Game and Fish is switching to an online-only license application process, which could make inappropriately purchasing a resident license less likely. “When you do apply online, you’re prompted with a lot more questions than you would be at the Walmart,” Elms said. Elms and Brown agreed that education could go a long way toward addressing the issue. In the wake of the citations, Brown said HSI and other agencies are working with state universities to make sure such students have a better understanding of gun laws and hunting license requirements. “Life outside of campus can be complicated for all students, domestic and international, and occasionally in upholding all state and federal laws,” a statement from the UA reads, which goes on to say that when situations like this arise, the university’s staff communicates “with relevant legal and law enforcement entities as appropriate.” “Most of the Chinese students here, the problem with them is just their lack of knowledge of the law system,” Gong said. “They know there’s a way you can purchase firearms, but they don’t actually know a lot about the firearms law.” Contact: mwoodhouse@tucson.com or 573-4235.

The big-box retailer has been making strides to expand and improve its e-commerce platform amid an online battle with players like Amazon and Target.

Shares of Wal-Mart's stock were climbing around 1 percent during premarket trading following this news. "We delivered a solid first quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year," Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. "We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers. Our plan is gaining traction." Related: You Probably Shopped at Walmart Last Year On Wednesday, big-box retail rival Target reported earnings, sales and comparable sales that topped Street expectations. Target is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround effort, as it attempts to compete with Wal-Mart's "Everyday Low Price" strategy and Amazon's encroaching presence over the industry. "While [Target] is not trying to directly undercut Walmart on prices, it is trying to use everyday lower prices on daily use items to drive customers into remodeled stores that provide a better experience than Walmart," wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan in a note to clients prior to Thursday's earnings announcement.

Here is my story about when I joined, why I think it's a great site for making a little extra money and how I earn free gift cards to places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, Starbucks, CVS and more. I joined Swagbucks in October 2010 because a couponing friend recommended the site. I had been writing this Smart Shopper blog for about a year when she posted about Swagbucks on the blog. I was skeptical at first because she said she was earning gift cards every month just by doing the internet searches she usually did, watching videos, taking surveys, doing online shopping through their shopping portal and more. I tried it out for a few weeks and was surprised at how many SB points I had earned by doing the things I mentioned above. Keep in mind that I am a blogger so I am on the computer 8 hours a day or more so it's easier for me to earn Swagbucks from my desktop than people who are not on the computer as much as I am. But even if you only spend a little time on the computer, you can still score gift cards every month. And the good news is that they also have a mobile app and multiple mobile video apps that you can download to earn Swagbucks when you not on a desktop. I now earn about $25 - $30 per month in gift cards or Paypal doing searches, watching videos, taking surveys, making my online purchases through their online shopping portal, taking the daily poll and entering the daily Swagbucks code and more. That's over $300 per year for doing easy things online. If you have more time for surveys or do more online shopping, you can easily earn more. I usually cash out my points for gift cards to Paypal (which can be transferred to your bank so it's like getting paid in cash), CVS (who doesn't love free toilet paper, right?!), various gas stations and Starbucks (special treat for my teens every once in a while). New Member Sign-Up Bonus: If you have not signed up get, new members get a SB bonus when you sign up at Swagbucks.com HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus. Make sure you use all caps since it is case sensitive. Read on to see exactly how I earn those SB points so I can cash them in for gift cards. How to Earn SB Points * Search online: Each time you need to search for something online, use the Swagbucks search engine on their website (instead of Google). I actually have the Swagbucks toolbar installed on my desktop and it places a search box right on my screen making it super easy to search. Every once in a while, they award SB points just for doing the searches I used to do using Google. * Take surveys on their website * Answer the daily poll * Watch videos through their website or multiple mobile apps * Use their online shopping portal (I do most of my online shopping at major retailers who are part of the Swagbucks Shop and Earn program (like Amazon.com, Kohls.com, Target.com, Walmart.com and more) and earn Swagbucks every time I shop. Recently, I was credited with 562 SB points (worth $5.62 in gift cards) for an online purchase I made at Kohls.com. * Play games * Participate in special Swag Code events (which I post about on the blog) * Enter the daily Swag Code (which we usually let you know about here on the blog each day). Swagbucks posts bonus codes on their Facebook, Twitter and blog pages each day. If you have the Swagbucks Mobile App, it will buzz when there is a new code. When the code becomes available each day, one of us posts it here on the blog so we can all get it. The codes are only valid for an hour usually. Once you get the code, you then copy and paste the code into the Swag Code box at the top of the homepage of Swagbucks.com. Look for the circle with the words Swag Code next to it. New member bonus Swagbucks sign-up code! As I posted above, new members get a 70 SB bonus when you sign up HERE. To get the bonus SB points, click the text that reads "I have a sign up code" during registration and then enter the code: SMARTSHOPPER to get the bonus.

I normally get gift cards to Lowes Home Improvement (a homeowner always needs something from there) and restaurants (it makes eating out more affordable). Some days I do a lot and some days it is just a little but I try to do some everyday. Thanks for the nudge in the right direction. QUOTE Report as abuse Faye Prosser -WRAL Smart Shopper May 21, 10:06 p.m. vlynn - I agree with you completely. It's pretty easy to reach the $25 mark every month or 2. As I sit here blogging, I am running videos on the SBTV app on my phone and earning super easy SB points. Thanks for your feedback! QUOTE Report as abuse vlynn May 21, 9:32 p.m. The neat thing about swagbucks is that you can do a little or a lot. I barely do anything beyond the codes, searching, & the occasional survey, but I still end up with enough points to earn a $25 gift card every other month. If I did more, I could get them every month, but I'm lazy!

Make sure to subscribe and leave the show a rating on iTunes! First up this week was Monday’s surge in the cybersecurity industry thanks to the widespread WannaCry malware attacks. Shares of some of the world’s largest cybersecurity companies—such as FireEye Inc (NASDAQ:FEYE), Palo Alto Networks Inc (NYSE:PANW) and Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) soared after the cyberattacks hit over the weekend. Cybersecurity stocks tend to gain in response to large-scale hacks because companies are more likely to bolster their protection, and oh boy, was this attack a doozy.

Find out more here: Here’s Why Cybersecurity Stocks Are Soaring Next, the hosts discussed the latest drama from Washington. As the Trump administration continues to deal with the fallout of the firing of James Comey, investors finally seem nervous about the White House’s ability to implement its pro-growth agenda. The latest plot twists include reports that Comey documented Trump’s requests to stop the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia, as well as the Justice Department’s appointment of a special counsel for the ongoing probe. Check out how the markets reacted: S&P 500, Industrial Giants Dip as Trump Controversies Continue Finally, Maddy and Ryan chatted about the latest earnings from the retail sector. This week saw some nice results from the likes of Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), which led the hosts to discuss the overall health of the economy and the success of each companies’ latest initiatives.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Despite the death of the mall in many parts of the country, it remains a mainstay in some rural areas. Hair freshly done from the beauty parlor on a recent Friday morning, Ada Clark, 93, and her daughter Carol, 63, met in front of the J.C. Penney in the Pueblo Mall, about 100 miles south of Denver. Their afternoon plan: a walk around the mall, followed by lunch at Red Lobster.

The Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. was the city’s largest employer, and a now-empty meatpacking plant also offered good wages. The mall — with its 1,100 retail jobs — has outlasted them both. It’s also the social hub for the city — and for the many small towns east to Kansas and south to New Mexico. “Any time I get out of town to go to the mall and maybe to Sam’s Club, I guarantee that within an hour or so, I’m going to run into someone I know,” said Steve Francis, 60, of Lamar, a town of nearly 8,000 people 120 miles east of Pueblo near the Kansas border. “You take your family, your neighbors, and you make a day of it. The Pueblo Mall isn’t just the only game in town two hours away, it’s the only game in town for three counties.” The Pueblo Mall is an outlier in the age of Amazon.com, when socks and laundry detergent and televisions — nearly anything you can think of — can be delivered to your front stoop within hours. The rise of online shopping has summoned a death knell for some of the old standard-bearers of retail. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)© Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post The Pueblo Mall attracts shoppers from hundreds of miles away. Macy’s and J.C. Penney, for instance, have in recent years reported crippling losses and widespread store closures. When those big anchor stores close, suburban malls find it hard to replace them. Many ’60s- and ’70s-era enclosed malls have been abandoned, razed or reimagined. “With department store closings, many malls will have to get creative with how they utilize space,” said Amy Raskin, who follows urbanization trends as chief investment officer at Chevy Chase Trust. She said many malls nationwide have converted space into multifamily residential units, whereas more rural malls may take on nonstandard anchor tenants, such as a Walmart. Despite Pueblo’s three Walmarts and the arrival of a Dick’s Sporting Goods and an Ulta Beauty store, the Pueblo Mall is bustling. On weekends, its nearly 3,000 outdoor parking spaces fill up. Inside are a few relics of the golden age of American malls: Amy’s Hallmark, Claire’s, Kay Jewelers. And in the food court is an Orange Julius, with its old-school classics and a modern update: smoothies. The mall does not track visitors, according to manager Timothy Schweitzer, but based on sales trends, he says traffic has increased 3 percent to 5 percent in the past year. He said the mall’s average sales per square foot are healthy, holding at around $400 over the past six months. He attributed this to the bigger-name tenants that have opened in recent years, including Bath and Body Works, Victoria’s Secret, Charlotte Russe, Hot Topic and Zumi. Load Error It draws kids from all over on the weekends. “It’s still not ­unusual to see out-of-town teams from La Junta [65 miles], Rocky Ford [54 miles] or Walsenburg [53 miles] walk around the mall after soccer or basketball games,” said Carol Clark, who works for the CW Railway and lives 25 miles south in Colorado City. Clark says that when the mall was built, downtown Pueblo suffered and many of its stores closed. The mall became Pueblo’s new town square.© Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post The folks who frequent the Pueblo Mall say they go there for the shopping and the socializing. Now it’s among the city’s main employers, along with two hospitals, including the state-operated Colorado Mental Health Institute. State and federal corrections (there are 13 prisons and the nearby federal Super Max in adjoining counties) also provide jobs, as well as a burgeoning legal marijuana industry that emerged after the passage of Colorado’s Amendment 64. As revenue from online shopping climbs nationally — up 14.7 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year ago — regional malls like Pueblo’s can compete by tailoring themselves to their consumers, said David Mitroff of Piedmont Avenue Consulting in Oakland, Calif. “People are ordering online, and that changes the whole shopping dynamic,” Mitroff said. “But now the mall has barber shops, gyms, local stores and other things you can’t just buy on Amazon. Or you can go see what they have. You can touch it.” Shoppers like Carol Clark do order online — in her case, ­30-pound bags of specialty dog food that can be obtained cheaper and more conveniently that way than by buying it in Pueblo. “The mall, whether in Pueblo or in Denver where my daughters live, is more social,” she said, “and we may or may not buy something.” Civic pride and tradition also play a part. In some markets with older regional malls, people buy from a traditional anchor store such as a Sears because it’s American, Mitroff said. “It reinforces ‘this is our mall, this is our city, let’s shop there,’ ” he said. “Especially if it’s the same price, why wouldn’t you do that? And if city officials say, ‘Do you understand that when you buy at J.C. Penney here, we actually get tax revenue off of that? But if you buy from Amazon, we don’t.’ ” © Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post Two factors working in the Pueblo Mall’s favor: the distance to other shopping centers and the small-town demographics. Pueblo’s median household income is $36,367, according to the most recent 2015 statistics, compared with the state’s $63,909. Shoppers in southern Colorado are often more willing to drive longer distances for their retail purchases, especially for ­durable goods such as refrigerators and other appliances, according to Chris Markuson, director of economic development for Pueblo County. Two other factors work in Pueblo’s favor: the distance to other shopping centers and the small-town demographics. Pueblo’s median household income is $36,367, according to the most recent 2015 statistics, compared with the state’s $63,909. “What this means is that these malls are safe,” said Brian Harper, CEO of New York City-based Rouse Properties, which owns 34 malls in 19 states. “If you’re, say, the third or fourth mall in Cleveland, Ohio, you’ve got to re­invent.” The Farmington Mall in Farmington, N.M., about 300 miles southwest of Pueblo and on the edge of the Navajo Nation Reservation, is a regional focal point. “The Farmington Mall is a perfect example of a mall that will always just be a mall,” Harper said. “A big night out in Farmington, New Mexico — and it’s great — is Red Lobster and a football game afterward — it’s ‘Friday Night Lights.’ Or it’s Red Lobster and the mall or vice versa. So it serves as the hub for Farmington, because there’s no downtown.”© Matthew Staver/For The Washington Post The indoor playground is a draw for families. The mall holds community events throughout the year. But Harper said that even regional shopping centers miles from major metropolitan centers can adapt and offer something new to consumers. Back at the Pueblo Mall on a Friday afternoon, Bruce and Jennifer Miller watch their 2-year-old son and other kids in a small indoor play area near Sears “When I went to the mall as a kid, it was like ‘Yes!’ and sort of a big deal,” says Bruce Miller, a Pueblo native who works in construction. “But when I was a kid, there was no playground. My son really loves it.” The mall holds community events throughout the year, including a “Walk with a Doc” mall-walking program, health fairs, school concerts and, recently, a Child Abuse Prevention Awareness Day and a “Pueblo’s Got Talent” showcase. In front of the playground is the Boot Barn, a national Western and workwear chain that serves people from the many ranches and farms that dot the counties of southern Colorado. The store even stays open on holidays when the rest of the mall is closed. “We had a good day this past Easter,” store manager Jenni Pacheco said. “You can’t predict when your work boots are going to need to be replaced, even if it’s on a holiday. We have rodeos, fairs [the Colorado State Fair is held each August in Pueblo], concerts and even father-daughter dances that keep us busy all year.” And there are plans for new mall tenants, including entertainment outlets, restaurants, and possibly a grocery store, Schweitzer said. A Planet Fitness has opened, along with the women’s plus-size store Torrid. On a recent Friday afternoon, Toni Brgoch of La Veta, a town of 750 that is 65 miles southwest of Pueblo, stopped by the Clinique counter at Dillard’s. Though she was on her way back from visiting her grandchildren in Denver and could have picked up makeup at one of the larger malls, she preferred to stop in Pueblo, where she has been shopping for 42 years. “When my children were young, we came to Pueblo for doctor’s appointments and the mall — we’d make a day of it,” she said. “Growing up in Walsenburg, we had a J.C. Penney, where my mom worked, and a Montgomery Ward mail-order center. But now there’s just a Safeway. Taking the stores out of these towns hurts them. I hope this mall stays.” Retail Isn't Dead (Video by The Wall Street Journal) Click to expand Replay Video Is bricks and mortar shopping dead? Bricks, or clicks?

It draws kids from all over on the weekends. “It’s still not unusual to see out-of-town teams from La Junta [65 miles], Rocky Ford [54 miles] or Walsenburg [53 miles] walk around the mall after soccer or basketball games,” said Carol Clark, who works for the CW Railway and lives 25 miles south in Colorado City. Clark says that when the mall was built, downtown Pueblo suffered and many of its stores closed. The mall became Pueblo’s new town square. Now it’s among the city’s main employers, along with two hospitals, including the state-operated Colorado Mental Health Institute. State and federal corrections (there are 13 prisons and the nearby federal Super Max in adjoining counties) also provide jobs, as well as a burgeoning legal marijuana industry that emerged after the passage of Colorado’s Amendment 64. As revenue from online shopping climbs nationally – up 14.7 percent in the first quarter, compared with a year ago – regional malls like Pueblo’s can compete by tailoring themselves to their consumers, said David Mitroff of Piedmont Avenue Consulting in Oakland, California. “People are ordering online, and that changes the whole shopping dynamic,” Mitroff said. “But now the mall has barber shops, gyms, local stores and other things you can’t just buy on Amazon. Or you can go see what they have. You can touch it.” Shoppers like Carol Clark do order online – in her case, 30-pound bags of specialty dog food that can be obtained cheaper and more conveniently that way than by buying it in Pueblo. “The mall, whether in Pueblo or in Denver where my daughters live, is more social,” she said, “and we may or may not buy something.” Civic pride and tradition also play a part. In some markets with older regional malls, people buy from a traditional anchor store such as a Sears because it’s American, Mitroff said. “It reinforces ‘this is our mall, this is our city, let’s shop there,’ ” he said. “Especially if it’s the same price, why wouldn’t you do that? And if city officials say, ‘Do you understand that when you buy at J.C. Penney here, we actually get tax revenue off of that? But if you buy from Amazon, we don’t.’ ” Shoppers in southern Colorado are often more willing to drive longer distances for their retail purchases, especially for durable goods such as refrigerators and other appliances, according to Chris Markuson, director of economic development for Pueblo County. Two other factors work in Pueblo’s favor: the distance to other shopping centers and the small-town demographics. Pueblo’s median household income is $36,367, according to the most recent 2015 statistics, compared with the state’s $63,909. “What this means is that these malls are safe,” said Brian Harper, CEO of New York City-based Rouse Properties, which owns 34 malls in 19 states. “If you’re, say, the third or fourth mall in Cleveland, Ohio, you’ve got to reinvent.” The Farmington Mall in Farmington, New Mexico, about 300 miles southwest of Pueblo and on the edge of the Navajo Nation Reservation, is a regional focal point. “The Farmington Mall is a perfect example of a mall that will always just be a mall,” Harper said. “A big night out in Farmington, New Mexico – and it’s great – is Red Lobster and a football game afterward – it’s ‘Friday Night Lights.’ Or it’s Red Lobster and the mall or vice versa. So it serves as the hub for Farmington, because there’s no downtown.” But Harper said that even regional shopping centers miles from major metropolitan centers can adapt and offer something new to consumers. Back at the Pueblo Mall on a Friday afternoon, Bruce and Jennifer Miller watch their 2-year-old son and other kids in a small indoor play area near Sears “When I went to the mall as a kid, it was like ‘Yes!’ and sort of a big deal,” says Bruce Miller, a Pueblo native who works in construction. “But when I was a kid, there was no playground. My son really loves it.” The mall holds community events throughout the year, including a “Walk with a Doc” mall-walking program, health fairs, school concerts and, recently, a Child Abuse Prevention Awareness Day and a “Pueblo’s Got Talent” showcase. In front of the playground is the Boot Barn, a national Western and workwear chain that serves people from the many ranches and farms that dot the counties of southern Colorado. The store even stays open on holidays when the rest of the mall is closed. “We had a good day this past Easter,” store manager Jenni Pacheco said. “You can’t predict when your work boots are going to need to be replaced, even if it’s on a holiday. We have rodeos, fairs [the Colorado State Fair is held each August in Pueblo], concerts and even father-daughter dances that keep us busy all year.” And there are plans for new mall tenants, including entertainment outlets, restaurants, and possibly a grocery store, Schweitzer said. A Planet Fitness has opened, along with the women’s plus-size store Torrid. On a recent Friday afternoon, Toni Brgoch of La Veta, a town of 750 that is 65 miles southwest of Pueblo, stopped by the Clinique counter at Dillard’s. Though she was on her way back from visiting her grandchildren in Denver and could have picked up makeup at one of the larger malls, she preferred to stop in Pueblo, where she has been shopping for 42 years. “When my children were young, we came to Pueblo for doctor’s appointments and the mall – we’d make a day of it,” she said. “Growing up in Walsenburg, we had a J.C. Penney, where my mom worked, and a Montgomery Ward mail-order center. But now there’s just a Safeway. Taking the stores out of these towns hurts them. I hope this mall stays.” Tags:  Amazon Colorado economy More Business News retail shopping Click for Digital & Home Delivery - 50% blog comments powered by Disqus More in Business Many women think men are the better investors; they’re not May 21, 2017, 12:05 am Many men and women think men are the better investors.

Sharon Hillstrom, the president and chief executive officer of the Bradenton Area Economic Development Corp. Business May 21, 2017 8:35 AM Private funding can make amazing things happen around Bradenton By Sharon Hillstrom Special to the Herald LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Who would have thought that Bentonville, Ark., would become a destination for visitors interested in American art or students pursuing culinary arts? But that’s exactly what’s happening in the once-sleepy town that is home to Walmart’s corporate headquarters. I visited Bentonville last month to meet with economic development colleagues to discuss trends in community place-making and other strategies for diversifying local economies. What I saw in Bentonville validated initiatives in the Bradenton area’s strategic plan for economic development and presented exciting examples of how private funding can make amazing things happen. The project most closely aligned with our work in Manatee County was Bentonville’s focus on culinary arts as an economic driver. The nucleus for Bentonville’s culinary initiative is a former Tyson Foods factory in the central part of town where Northwest Arkansas Community College has based its culinary program. The building is in Bentonville’s Market District, one of two areas outlined in a city plan to rejuvenate Bentonville and develop its sense of place. The Market District’s focus is on food and culinary experiences. The other area is the Arts District and includes places such as galleries and studios. The vision for the Bradenton area’s culinary focus is still in formation, but our collaborative partners – which include leaders in the local food scene – imagine a market district with shopping, dining, education and training; a hub that helps local businesses related to culinary arts start up and grow. The Market District seeks to capitalize on an emerging food scene galvanized by local restaurateurs in the downtown area. Sound familiar? In the Bradenton area, we have many of the same ingredients as Bentonville, particularly the “enthusiastic entrepreneurial spirit, blossoming food scene and the prospects for community engagement in the region” that one leader in Bentonville’s culinary movement described as keys to their program. The vision for the Bradenton area’s culinary focus is still in formation, but our collaborative partners — which include leaders in the local food scene — imagine a market district with shopping, dining, education and training; a hub that helps local businesses related to culinary arts start up and grow. Our current task is to document the assets that already exist locally: culinary-related businesses, education, training, food production and supply chains. We are working with a team from the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee’s hospitality and business programs, Realize Bradenton and others to create an “asset map.” Then we can better define what types of projects will help to achieve the vision and we can assign a price tag to seek investment in the projects. In Bentonville, the private Walton Family Foundation stepped up with $15 million in grants to finance the community college’s expansion of its culinary program and renovation of the factory building. At the Bradenton Area Economic Development Corp., we are already developing a private-sector fundraising effort to better equip our operation for implementing aspects of our strategic plan. Realize Bradenton has successfully competed for private funding from the Knight Foundation to implement place-making projects in downtown and the Village of the Arts. There is no doubt that creating a successful market district for the Bradenton area also will require far-sighted investors willing to take a long view. Potential investors and Manatee County businesses that are interested in learning more about our local culinary district initiative can contact us at info@bradentonareaedc.com. Sharon Hillstrom is president and chief executive officer of the Bradenton Area Economic Development Corp. (BradentonAreaEDC.com). She can be contacted at info@bradentonareaedc.com or 941-803-9036.

The first thing I learned was another developer had bid on the same project, except in a different part of town. They were going to put it up on the north side of the veterans clinic at Wilson Avenue and Wiley Boulevard. That would have been an excellent place as it is only three blocks from two grocery stores and less than a mile from Wal-Mart. Also, the Ladd Library is near. It also is a lot closer to MercyCare South than the place at 1200 Edgewood Road. I guess if you stretch the truth to the Iowa Finance Commission you can get the funding for a good project in a bad location. CommonBond put in a bunch of projects that they will supposedly pickup the tab on like a sidewalk down Crestwood Drive and a turn lane going south from Edgewood to Crestwood. I wonder if this property on Edgewood was not owned by the city if our esteemed town council would approve this location? They haven’t approved other apartment complexes, according to The Gazette. It was either Mark Twain or Will Rogers who said “If you don’t read the newspaper you are uninformed; if you do read the newspaper you are misinformed.” Do the proper thing council people and vote against this project.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman May 15 – 21: Bristol’s Weekly Traffic Alert BRISTOL – In an effort to keep motorists informed, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) provides weekly information about highway construction and maintenance projects in southwestern Virginia. When traveling through highway work zones, use caution and be alert to changes in traffic patterns and slow-moving or stopped traffic.   To help motorists take the guesswork out of travel plans, call VDOT’s 511 or visit http://www.511Virginia.org/ for real-time traffic information.   Underlined entries with asterisks (***) indicate the listing is new or the status of the project has changed since last week’s traffic alert.     INTERSTATE PROJECTS ***Interstate 81 – Exit 14:  Work is underway to reconstruct Interstate 81 exit 14 to better accommodate traffic volumes and to replace the north and southbound interstate 81 bridges at exit 14. During the week of May 15, be alert to flagging and heavy equipment along Old Jonesboro Road and Dennison due to bridge and grading work.  (Completion: fall 2018) ***I-81 bridges over Halls Bottom Road: Replacement of the Interstate 81 bridges over Halls Bottom Road near exit 10 in Washington County is underway. The week of May 115, be aware of grading and drainage work in the median, and to haul truck traffic entering and exiting the median. I-81 travel lanes may be narrowed through the work zone. Due to safety concerns, Route 808 (Halls Bottom Road) is closed underneath the interstate bridges. Only emergency-response vehicles will have access; all other vehicle traffic will be required to detour. (Completion: Fall 2018) ***Interstate 77 Big Walker Mountain Tunnel: Due to tunnel maintenance at I-77 Big Walker Mountain Tunnel, anticipate southbound left lane closures from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m. nightly Sunday through Thursday nights.   Interstate 81 Exit 17 bridge repairs: Motorists should anticipate periodic nighttime lane closures on I-81 at exit 17 northbound and southbound due to bridge repairs.

C. Rush online@thestate.com Officers salute fallen comrades during the annual SC Law Enforcement Memorial Ceremony earlier this month. C. Rush online@thestate.com Opinion Extra May 21, 2017 6:20 PM Open-carry law makes our job harder Skip Holbrook Guest Columnist LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Columbia, SC Although law enforcement has always been a challenging, difficult and dangerous job, the past few years have been some of the most challenging ever. Far fewer people are choosing to go into law enforcement, and many experienced officers are leaving the field, making it difficult for police agencies to maintain adequate staffing levels, all while violent crime is on the rise in many large cities. Columbia is not immune to this trend. Targeted attacks on law enforcement (Dallas, Baton Rouge) and a rise in line-of-duty deaths have further complicated an incredibly stressful and dangerous job. It’s against this backdrop that the S.C. House passed a bill to make it legal for people to openly carry handguns in the state, with certain location exceptions. The bill won’t become law this year, but it will be front and center when lawmakers return to Columbia in January, and we need to understand its implications. The right to bear arms is fundamental to our democracy, but the sale, purchase, ownership and carrying of guns comes with great responsibility and use of common sense, and I firmly believe an open-carry law will significantly complicate police interactions with citizens, resulting in many unintended consequences. Open-carry law or not, when citizens see someone with a gun, they will call the police. When responding to “person with a gun” calls, officers have few details to help them quickly determine an armed individual’s intent and whether that person poses a threat to public safety or the individual. Columbia Police Chief Skip Holbrook __________ Officials fear open carry gun law could impact Grand Strand’s image Senate panel advances permitless carry bill McMaster endorses bill to allow carrying firearms without permit Their guns are concealed; their strategy, not so much __________ No doubt, we would encounter many innocent, law-abiding people who were armed in compliance with an open carry law. But some will be violent criminals, perhaps even gang members, who don’t yet have a felony on their record that prohibits them from possessing weapons. Also let’s not forget the numerous and frequent protests, demonstrations and marches in our city. Open carry could make it extraordinary difficult for police to protect those exercising their right to assemble and protest peacefully. There is no denying that easily accessible firearms add fuel to already emotionally charged situations, which too often results in tragedy. Recently, Columbia police officers answered a call about a “person with a gun acting erratically” at a local Wal-Mart. It was just the second day on the job for one of the responding officers. Upon their arrival, the officers were easily able to identify the suspect, but because he was in a store with many innocent people nearby, the officers allowed him to leave the store before engaging with him. Obviously, this was a tense, dangerous situation, putting a large number of our citizens and our officers at risk as the armed suspect moved from Wal-Mart through a parking lot and into another business, ignoring officers’ commands. What looks like erratic behavior by the person who called the police could look like perfectly normal behavior to others. Imagine this same scenario if South Carolina had an open-carry law. Conceivably, there could have been many individuals with weapons displayed when officers arrived, making it extremely difficult to distinguish between the suspect(s), accomplices and innocent bystanders. Police would have had to make very quick judgments about whether each armed citizen was a threat. What looks like erratic behavior by the person who called the police could look like perfectly normal behavior to others. Then the split-second decision our officers have to make will be judged by others who have the luxury of time, information and a controlled environment. South Carolina has a number of densely populated cities that welcome many visitors, students at our colleges and universities, vacationers enjoying the beaches and historic areas and spectators attending major sporting events. Does open-carry make these places safer and more welcoming? Some cities are facing increasing rates of drug addiction and crime, particularly gun crimes. Many states prohibit openly carrying firearms. Some that allow open carry, such as Virginia and Pennsylvania, prohibit it in specific densely populated cities. I hope that if our state senators decide to take up this bill, whey will consider the unintended consequences and potential impact to our state’s image and reputation that an open-carry law could have.

The jury — 12 jurors and two alternates — is no longer sequestered and will return at 8:30 a.m. Monday to begin the penalty phase.   Amber Avalos returned to the couple’s home in the 1200 block of 67th Street Northwest in Bradenton from dropping off some of their children at school on the morning of Dec. 4, 2014, when the couple began to argue in the kitchen over his being out drinking the night before. Avalos became enraged when she told him that she was not afraid of him or to die. “I have never put my hands on that woman in 16 years,” Avalos later told lead homicide detectives Jeffrey Bliss and John Kenney following his arrest. “When I put my hands on her that was it.” He punched her multiple times and threw her on the floor of the laundry room. Avalos straddled her, kissed her on the forehead, said I love you and then strangled her with a wire before partially suspending her — wanting to “make sure” she was dead. Avalos went to get his .45 caliber pistol and returned to the laundry room — afraid that Amber might be playing dead — and shot her once. The couple’s then 4-year-old son was home playing video games when Amber Avalos and Potter were killed. He asked Avalos where his “mommy” was but saw only her feet when she lay dead in the laundry room. Avalos told him it was time to go to school and was loading him into the couple’s gold 2003 Chevrolet Suburban when Potter showed up because she and Amber were scheduled to go clean a house together. “I knew she was going to call the cops, and I wasn’t ready for the police to come yet,” Avalos said. He followed Potter into the home, leaving his son in the Suburban. Potter, failing to find Amber in the bedroom, was headed down the hallway toward the laundry room, Avalos said. Avalos said he didn’t want Potter to see his dead wife, so he shot her in the hallway. “I don’t know how many times I shot her,” he said. Then Avalos took his son to the Happy Cubs Daycare, making sure to tell him he loved him on the way and becoming sad after saying goodbye to the boy, he said. He then headed out east, making a stop to see his cousins to tell them what he had done and that he loved them, he said. Avalos didn’t know if his cousins had believed him, but they had given him some money. He ended up leaving his vehicle at Walmart, knowing that soon enough law enforcement would be searching for it. “After what I did, I just wanted to sit in the back seat of a cab and relax,” Avalos said. When detectives asked him when he had formulated his plan to kill Battle, Avalos said, “Months,” and chuckled. At one point he said he vomited just outside the taxi cab because he had been drinking the night before. Avalos also admitted to using cocaine the day before the murders and taking a painkiller that morning for his hangover. The taxi dropped Avalos at a shopping center near Bayshore Baptist, and he read passages from his bible. He then waited, watching for Battle to arrive at the church, knowing that the pastor’s car was not there. After some time, however, Avalos decided to go into the church office and speak with Battle’s wife. But first he made a phone call to his uncle, Lt. Joel Perez, with the sheriff’s office. “I said hey, you need to go to my house, get your boys over there. There’s two people laying down over there,” Avalos said. The widow’s short but vivid recollection took the jurors to the grounds of the Bayshore Baptist Church, 6502 14th St. W., Bradenton, where Avalos shot his final victim. Joy Battle was working in the church office at about 12:45 p.m. when Avalos came in, she testified Wednesday. She sat with him as he began to share his suspicions that their spouses were having an affair with one another. During that time, her husband called and asked if everything was OK after learning Avalos was there. She said she didn’t know. Avalos had made the accusations months before that her husband was having an affair with Amber Avalos, Joy Battle said. But she had told him she had no reason to believe it and offered to pray with him. Her husband arrived at the church within minutes of their phone call, and Joy Battle recalled saying, “Andy, Tripp is here so you can talk to him now.” Avalos got up, walked out and closed the door behind him, she testified. Her husband was on the sidewalk as Avalos approached him. “He pulled a gun from behind his back and he shot him three times and he fell to the floor,” Battle’s widow said, her voice trembling. She began to cry. Joy Battle recalled her husband crying out in pain and her own screams, and she said she took a split second to decide whether to run to him or call 911. “I thought the best chance he had at living was if I called 911, so I went to my phone and called 911,” she said. “I was on the phone with 911, and Andy came back and shot him again.” Avalos walked away from the scene, contemplating “doing more things” like stealing a car or “going out with you guys in a blazing glory,” he later told Bliss and Kenney. Avalos decided otherwise and after seeing a deputy pass him along 14th Street, he quickly ducked into a nearby small wooded area where he would hide for the next two days, coming out only to buy Pringles, a soda and a beer. What ensued was a 51-hour manhunt led by the sheriff’s office to find Avalos — considered armed and dangerous at the time. The frantic search included an alert for Avalos’ gold 2003 Chevrolet Suburban — later found at the Walmart — and Palma Sola and Miller elementary schools, King Middle School and Manatee High School were locked down as deputies rushed to take custody of the Avalos’ children, fearing for their safety. Early on the morning of Dec. 6, 2014, Andres Avalos Sr. made a public plea at an impromptu press conference at the sheriff’s office. The elder Avalos pleaded that his son turn himself in for the sake of his six children, who were in protective custody at the time. A few hours later, the highly sought suspect walked onto the wooden deck behind a mobile home in the Pine Haven Mobile Home Park, 6320 14th St. W., just a couple of blocks from the Bayshore Baptist Church. At about 1 p.m., Melissa and Jerry Hamilton — who lived in Pine Haven — were singing Christian hymns in preparation for a function at their church that evening. Melissa stood in the kitchen, and Jerry sat in the living room as he began to sing the popular Christian song, “I Can Only Imagine,” she recalled for the jury. Suddenly through the sliding glass door, she saw Avalos walk onto their wooden deck. “Can I help you?” she said to Avalos. They called 911 and left their home as instructed by a dispatcher. News quickly broke that Avalos was captured after a caravan of deputies and detectives screeched down U.S. 41 to the mobile home — a sign many hoped that Avalos had finally been located. Deputies and detectives drew their guns and semiautomatic rifles, held up their shields as residents of the quiet mobile home park watched in shock. Avalos was arrested without resisting. Avalos was quickly taken to the sheriff’s office headquarters. In the hours that followed, he would give Bliss and Kenney his detailed confession which a jury watched for about 90 minutes Tuesday afternoon. On Monday, the state will present testimony and evidence to support their aggravating factors needed as they seek the death penalty. The defense will present their own case in support of their mitigating circumstances in their attempts to get Avalos life in prison.

Jewel is looking to buy 19 remaining Strack & Van Tils and may rebrand the stores as Jewel-Osco. editor's pick urgent Strack & Van Til, Marsh both face existential crisis Joseph S. Pete joseph.pete@nwi.com, 219-933-3316 Joseph S Pete May 20, 2017 Updated 15 hrs ago Buy Now Tony V. Martin, The Times The reopening celebration in January at the remodeled Strack & Van Til store on U.S. 30 in Valparaiso. Jewel is looking to buy 19 remaining Strack & Van Tils and may rebrand the stores as Jewel-Osco. Indiana’s two largest independent grocers, Strack & Van Til and Marsh down in central Indiana, ended up in bankruptcy court in recent weeks amid one of the toughest environments for supermarkets in decades. Neither grocer may survive, despite being woven into the cultural fabric, with a rich tradition of serving shoppers over generations. Jewel-Osco is looking to buy the 19 remaining Strack & Van Til and Town & Country stores, and suggested it could rebrand them as Jewels. Marsh warned it could lay off thousands of workers across the state if it doesn't find a buyer within 60 days. “The challenges faced by Strack & Van Til and Marsh are ones that have been affecting the industry nationwide,” Indiana University Northwest Assistant Professor of Economics Micah Pollak said. “The grocery industry is built on razor-thin profit margins coupled with highly perishable products such as produce, meat, dairy and prepared foods. As a result, sudden upheavals in the industry can be difficult for firms, and especially smaller independent chains, to weather.” Strack & Van Til has coped with changes to the grocery industry, including the arrival of Whole Foods in Northwest Indiana, the emergence of non-traditional competitors like Menards and online rivals like Blue Apron. “In the case of Strack & Van Til, they fought hard to adapt by expanding higher-end offerings, updating stores and experimenting with new services like home delivery,” Pollak said. “Unfortunately, these changes are very capital expensive. With such narrow profit margins, the grocery industry is hard-pressed to turn on a penny, much less a dime.” University of Indianapolis Associate Professor of Finance Matthew Will said local grocers can only survive if they innovate or find a niche consumers will pay for. “Remember, this is not a big business conspiracy,” he said. “This is consumers deciding who wins and loses. Amazon, Zappo, Jet, etc., did not exist 15 years ago. And now they may put Macy's, Sears, etc., out of business. Even Walmart is closing stores. No one is or should be immune from progress.” But there are consequences.  “The loss of consumer choice is bad,” Will said. “The failure of a company, unable to satisfy consumer demands, is a normal part of economic progress. People will still buy the same amount of groceries. Some will merely change where they shop. It may be an emotional loss for the region, but their failure is a result of consumer choice... The new Super Meijers and Super Krogers drove Marsh out of business. They have greatly enhanced the shopping experience. Marsh did not.” Consumers will ultimately lose out if Strack & Van Til vanishes from the Northwest Indiana landscape, Pollak said. “What this means for Northwest Indiana and the state is continued consolidation in the grocery industry, a more limited range in terms of where to shop and what is available, and very likely higher prices,” he said. “We will likely have fewer independent grocery businesses, at least until the grocery industry stabilizes further.” He’s especially concerned about the future of the discount Ultra Foods stores, which sometimes served low-income communities. Most are slated for closure, and Strack & Van Til parent company Central Grocers is still trying to find a buyer for the remaining three Ultra stores in Highland, Merrillville and Kankakee. “Many of these stores are the sole grocery store in lower-income areas that would otherwise be vast food deserts,” Pollak said. "Some Ultra Foods have already been closed, and without a prospective buyer more may close. The closure of these stores risks significantly expanding the problem of food deserts in Northwest Indiana, which has dire consequences on the health of our residents and ultimately represents a burden on all Hoosiers.” Highland resident Chadd Huizenga said he would love to continue to have a local, independent supermarket chain in Northwest Indiana. “It is good for the local economy,” he said. “The money people of the Region spend gets recycled back into the Region. Also, more people of the Region are employed.” Highland-based Strack & Van Til once operated 38 stores, grossed more than $1.1 billion a year and employed more than 4,000 in Northwest Indiana alone. It was a staple of Region life — its catered fried chicken, for instance, was widely enjoyed at social gatherings, business functions and church get-togethers. As lore would have it, people have even averted wedding reception catastrophes with last-minute runs to Stracks. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. “What is more important to me, is maintaining a cultural identity,” Huizenga said. “In Northwest Indiana, Strack & Van Til is part of our local identity. We are different from the rest of Chicagoland, because we shop at Strack & Van Til, not Jewel or Mariano's. With the global culture becoming more homogenized and bland, it is important to maintain local culture and identity. This is what makes Northwest Indiana 'Da Region.'” He hopes prospective owner Jewel-Osco at least preserves the Strack & Van Til name. “When it comes down to it, it is just a name, but names are important,” he said. “The name of our grocery store is what keeps Northwest Indiana from being just another boring bland Chicagoland suburb like Orland Park.” Valparaiso resident Dawn Brown considered the Strack & Van Til on U.S. 30 in Valparaiso her store, her Stracks. She visits weekly and counts on employees to tell her which cantaloupe is the sweetest, gets recipes from the meat department, chats with stockers and has favorite cashiers she'll wait longer to see. They'll ask about her daughter's school and swimming, and brag about their grandchildren. The baggers know she wants paper inside of plastic. "The Deli folks started treating my 1-year-old with a slice of co-jack cheese," she said. "As the years went by, my daughter gained confidence by standing in line on her own to ask politely for her piece of cheese. I know it is a small thing, but it is one of her favorite memories of learning to be independent." Her daughter's Girl Scout troop has sold hundreds of boxes of cookies at the Valpo Strack & Van Til, which also helped her swim club by donating boxes of fresh fruit for races.  "Change is inevitable, and a national corporation will more than likely be purchasing my Stracks," Brown said. "What I want them to know is that it will not matter what name is on the sign. What will matter will be the employees inside the store. They are the heartbeat that keeps the business alive. It is my hope that the future buyer will remember that fact and treat them with the respect they have earned over the many, many years inside the store."

(Mike Coppola/Getty Images) Confidential NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday, May 20, 2017, 6:00 PM Tracy Morgan had a tough road when it came to recovering from the traumatic brain injury he suffered in a 2014 highway accident: he had to regain his memory, he had to learn to walk again. He had to go without sex. “That was the hard part!” he exclaims. “Oh my God! My wife, she’s pregnant with triplets right now! My sperm came out wearing a cape!” He must have felt like a born-again virgin when it was time to get back down the business, we noted. “Oh yeah — I even took my wife to my old high school and had her in the staircase,” he joked. Tracy Morgan keeps sex life hot by dressing up as Rob Kardashian At least we think he was joking. Either way, Morgan is back in action, with a new Netflix special, "Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive." In the show he riffs about the road back after the accident, in which a Walmart truck struck the limo he and a few other comics were riding in, killing his friend Jimmy Mack and putting Morgan into an eight-day coma. The Brooklyn native is also set to star in a new comedy series created by Jordan Peele for TBS, about a convict who comes back to a gentrified Brooklyn after a 15-year prison bid. Was the comedy special a hard project to work on, given the trauma he was revisiting? “No!” he exclaims. “Because I'd done with it. I'd done crying about it.” Walmart reimbursed in lawsuit with comedian Tracy Morgan A moment later, Morgan allowed that he's still struggling, and “crying in my heart for Jimmy.” “I still get depressed, I still get upset. I still go through stuff. But I can't sit around thinking about it. I got a young daughter, I got a wife, I got sons. I got a life! Thats not my world, that's not my life. I ain't gonna give Walmart that much!” And he said, he has a powerful ally: “The good will and the love out there in the world for me. I feel it every day now. The most important thing for me is just to give it back.” He also intends to shop at Walmart again. "Can't beat their prices," he joked.

CEO Eddie Lampert defended the buybacks as the most efficient use of capital, arguing that investment in stores wasn't necessary. The company — considered the most vulnerable publicly traded retailer — is now selling off assets to stay afloat. Sears has survived two world wars and the Great Depression. But after a decade under the control of a former Goldman Sachs executive turned hedge fund manager, the 124-year-old retailer is imploding. Sales have been cut in half since 2009, and the company is burning through cash, closing hundreds of stores, and selling off assets in an attempt to stanch the bleeding. Executives are fleeing and store workers face a grim future. A debt repayment from a $500 million loan facility is looming, and some suppliers are trying to cancel contracts and cut back on orders amid fears that the company could soon go bankrupt. The man in charge of Sears, Edward S. Lampert, has blamed the company's decline on everything from shifts in consumer spending to the rise of e-commerce, and even — at times — the weather. More recently, he's taken to attacking the media, saying reports speculating on a Sears bankruptcy are thwarting his efforts to turn the business around. "Every time people use the word bankruptcy, somebody who reads that doesn't get past that word," he told the Chicago Tribune in a recent interview. "It makes it very unfair for us, and it's a very uneven playing field for us." While other retailers are also struggling, analysts take the demise of Sears, which owns Kmart, as a matter of when not if. But what sets Sears apart from other suffering retailers is something that's not as obvious as the rise online shopping and falling foot traffic in shopping malls. It's the steps that Lampert took when he first acquired the company: putting shareholders like himself in front of everyone else, he drained the company of vital resources.  When Sears was flush with cash, this took the form of billions of dollars of share repurchases, even as the stores suffered years of underinvestment. Repurchases, or buybacks, are common among cash-rich companies, but also derided in some corners as a waste of a company's resources as they only serve to create the appearance of improving earnings. No apologies Business Insider/Skye Gould In the early days, Lampert was unapologetic about these. According to an executive at the company then, Lampert was genuine in his belief that Sears could be run differently than other retailers and that the shares were being acquired at a bargain price. "Unless we believe we will receive an adequate return on investment," he wrote in a 2007 letter to investors, "we will not spend money on capital expenditures to build new stores or upgrade our existing base simply because our competitors do. If share repurchases or acquisitions appear to be more productive, then we will allocate capital to those options appropriately." And for years Lampert concluded that share buybacks were the best use of the company's money. They continued even through the financial crisis and totaled $5.8 billion between 2005 and 2010, sometimes at prices as high as $170 per share. Sears' earnings in the same period were $3.8 billion. Today the stock is trading for under $8.  Now that Sears is short on cash and faces mounting debt, Lampert has turned from buybacks to dismantling what was once America's largest and most successful retailer, said David Tawil, president of New York-based Maglan Capital. Tawil has spent his career working in corporate restructuring and bankruptcy proceedings. Sears spun off its Lands' End brand to investors in 2014 and is exploring "alternatives" that could include sales of Kenmore appliances and Craftsman tools. "Eddie has orchestrated for himself, and for the benefit of shareholders, the most protracted liquidation in history," Tawil said in an interview with Business Insider. A Sears spokesman, Howard Riefs, said last year that the spinoffs were meant to create shareholder value and to fund Sears' turnaround. He noted that the company has raised billions from the asset sales and other financing efforts, and those funds have "provided liquidity to help fund our transformation." More recently, he pointed Business Insider to a blog post Lampert published on May 11, in which Lampert said the company is "fighting like hell" to overcome its challenges. "We continue to do what is necessary to improve the near-term performance of our business," Lampert said in the post, noting that the company planned to cut $1.25 billion in costs this year. Wall Street superstar Associated PressLampert got his start at Goldman Sachs, working in the New York-based bank's risk-arbitrage department. He left the bank after four years and in 1988 started a hedge fund, ESL Investments, at just 26 years old. For a time he was a Wall Street superstar. BusinessWeek compared him to Warren Buffett because of his incredible track record as an investor. ESL Investments generated annualized returns of more than 20% per year for 20 years, marking one of the strongest long-term investment records in history, according to a 2013 Wall Street Journal article. Through ESL, Lampert gained control of Kmart in 2003 and he combined it with Sears in 2005 to create Sears Holdings in an $11.5 billion deal. ESL, long one of Sears' largest shareholders, now owns about half of the company. It was soon after he took the reins at Sears, first as chairman, that Lampert began the share buybacks. In his annual letters to Sears shareholders, Lampert defends buybacks as a way to provide "liquidity" (or a buyer) for shareholders who are looking to sell and increase ownership of the company for investors who hold on. But to critics, they are simply a financial maneuver to drive up per-share earnings and create the illusion that a company is doing better than it really is. With the buybacks came cuts in spending on the retailer's stores, as well as reduced promotions and advertising, despite Lampert's promises to revive the company. Never cheaper Peter Morgan/REutersLampert "had a perspective that the retail industry as a whole was too sales-oriented and not enough profit-oriented," one former high-level Sears executive told Business Insider. The executive asked not to be identified discussing private matters. "He wanted to demonstrate to the world that you could reduce advertising and inventory investment — and yes, sales would fall to some new normal — but you would have a more profitable business," the former executive said. At the time, Lampert believed in the long-term success of Sears, according to the executive. When he was buying the stock at $170, more than $150 per share above where it is today, he thought it was a better capital investment than store upgrades, because it was his theory that the stock would never be cheaper. Lampert had high hopes for himself and for Sears. "I want to be known as a great businessman," he said in 2006, shortly after the Sears acquisition. His greatest fear, he said, was that he wouldn't live long enough to complete all his goals. "He was completely confident that he was going to be the next Warren Buffett," the former executive told Business Insider. "He felt that he had created a long-term winner in Sears and it would be his Berkshire Hathaway." That is not how it has worked. Instead, the company has been unable to keep up with shoppers. Serving the customer? Sears"The retail industry is predicated on serving the customer, valuing the customer, listening to the customer, and ultimately giving the customer what she wants — and it’s the employees who deliver this. Anything less is a recipe for terminal illness, if not suicide," says Robin Lewis, a 40-year retail consultant and CEO of industry publication The Robin Report. "Clearly, in the case of Sears, Eddie Lampert has turned a completely blind eye to this truism, and has been bleeding the company to a long and slow but well-managed death for the sole benefit of major investors and himself." Under Lampert, Sears failed to invest in major capital improvements, such as store maintenance or new store concepts. Fortune recounted a 2005 strategy session between Lampert and the top two-dozen executives of the company: Once their presentations started, Lampert also began poking holes in virtually every idea. 'What's the benefit of that?' he asked again and again. 'What's the value?' He shot down a modest $2 million proposal to improve lighting in the stores. 'Why invest in that?' He skewered a plan to sell DVDs at a discounted price to better compete with Target and Wal-Mart. 'It doesn't matter what Target and Wal-Mart do,' he declared. As Lampert slashed spending in-store improvements, "the stores began going down," a 41-year Kmart store employee who was laid off in February 2016 told Business Insider. Don't talk about it SearsWhen Lampert took over, company executives visited stores and told workers they were no longer allowed to discuss any problems the stores were having, according to the employee. "When they quit asking and started telling you how it should be run according to corporate standards, the stores began to go down," the employee said. "There is no morale in any of the stores." An employee of a Sears store in Elyria, Ohio, told Business Insider last year that his store is falling apart. "The walls and floors in my store are all beat to hell ... the roof leaks, the escalator and the elevator break down frequently, but 'Fast Eddie' doesn't want to spend money on the stores," the employee said. Sears spokesman Howard Riefs has denied that employees are discouraged from giving feedback. "One of our cultural beliefs as a company is to embrace feedback," Riefs has told Business Insider. "We have a variety of ways that associates can give authentic feedback – even anonymously, so we would disagree with that suggestion." Lampert, meanwhile, has defended his decisions.  "I was criticized for not investing enough in the stores," Lampert said in 2013. "My point of view is we couldn't invest in everything." Losing investors Sears Investors bought into Lampert's strategy, at first. In 2006, Sears' stock rose roughly 45%, to $156. Then quarterly sales started declining in early 2007, and the stock followed suit. Many Sears executives were expecting Lampert to eventually refocus on investing in stores and advertising. When that didn't happen, some employees began to grow concerned. "There was a feeling of, 'OK, now we have to invest and compete,' through some combination of advertising and promotion," the former Sears executive said. "But it became clear that he either didn’t know how or didn’t want to spend the money." At that point, senior executives began leaving the company.  Since May 2007, Sears' shares have dropped 95%. Over the same period, sales have dropped from $50.7 billion in 2007 to $22.1 billion in 2016. To raise money, the company started selling its real estate and spinning off brands like Sears Hometown and Outlet stores and Craftsman, which was sold to Stanley Black & Decker in January for about $900 million to be paid out over the next several years. In one of its biggest transactions to date, Sears launched and spun off a real-estate investment trust, Seritage Growth Properties, to execute sale/lease-back agreements for 266 Sears and Kmart stores. The deal helped Sears raise about $2.7 billion, most of which was quickly burned through to pay off debt. Seritage is in the process of recapturing the stores it bought from Sears and renting out the space to new tenants for as much as four times the rent that Sears paid. If it can profit from this, that's good for Lampert. He is Seritage's chairman and his hedge fund owns about 40% of the real estate investor's limited partnership, as well as 8.5% of the voting power in its common stock. Starving the business SearsMeanwhile, Sears has been cutting costs by closing hundreds of stores and laying off hundreds of thousands of employees. In 2007, Sears had 3,418 stores and 315,000 employees in the US. The company now has fewer than 1,430 stores and 140,000 employees. Lampert's strategy of underinvesting in stores and selling off assets "starved capital and management resources from the retail business, leaving it unable to respond and adapt to the needs of the evolving consumer and marketplace," Lewis said. The stores are now shells of what they once were, with leaking ceilings, broken escalators, and sometimes no employees to work the registers, according to analysts, customers, and employees from the store level to corporate headquarters. In some stores, employees hang bedsheets to shield shoppers from sections that stand empty. "The majority of stores now border on disgraceful and show a complete lack of retail standards and proper store management," Neil Saunders, the CEO of retail consulting firm Conlumino, told Business Insider. "The impression is of a retailer that has completely given up, and this is something consumers notice." But there was one party that was benefiting — at least for some time — from this strategy: shareholders. Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management told The New York Times in 2013 that Lampert's spinoffs had helped deliver about $10 a share in assets to Sears shareholders, even as the stock price was tanking. At the time, Fairholme owned about 20% of Sears shares. Berkowitz and Fairholme own closer to 25% now.  Not working out Business Insider/Skye Gould The losses eventually lost Lampert the support of many investors in his hedge fund, ESL Investments. "Investors are heading for the exits, discouraged by the declining fortunes of Mr. Lampert’s signature stake in Sears Holdings," Randall Smith at the Times wrote in 2013. The fund's assets are now down to $2 billion from $18 billion in 2007, according to a March 2017 regulatory filing. Lampert says he is committed to restoring Sears to profitability and continuing retail operations online and through a smaller fleet of stores. "I believe Sears Holdings can continue to operate as a very significant member-centric integrated retailer with a large number of stores as long as we receive the support of our vendors and other stakeholders," Lampert said in a blog post this week. The company's window of opportunity for a turnaround is shrinking. It's falling deeper into debt and just lost its second chief financial officer in six months, just as it begins talks with lenders over its $500 million loan facility maturing in July. Most vulnerable SearsIn addition to its chief financial officer leaving, Sears has lost more than a quarter of its executive team in the last five months. The company posted a loss of $471 million in the first quarter, compared to a $303 million loss last year. Revenue declined to $5.39 billion from $5.88 billion. Analysts say a turnaround is hard to imagine at this point. S&P Global Market Intelligence in April identified Sears as the most vulnerable public retail company in the US, saying it has a 24% chance of default within a year. Sears recently said that it's planning to cut more costs and that it's reviewing bids in excess of $700 million for more than 60 of its real estate properties. Selling off real estate will give the company a much-needed cash infusion, but it also diminishes the company's lifeline as it struggles to staunch losses, according to Moody's vice president and senior analyst Christina Boni. "Sears’ financial performance remains extremely weak which is prompting the acceleration of cost reductions by an additional $250 million," Boni said recently. "Its effort to sell real estate which has produced over $700 million of bids currently will enhance liquidity, but accelerates the timeline required to stem operating losses as it asset base diminishes." Eventually, the company will run out of funding sources, according to Tawil. "Normally businesses like this fail and get sold off in pieces in bankruptcy," Tawil said. "This has been the greatest out-of-court liquidation in the history of our nation." *A version of this story was published in June 2016.

A high-ranking federal official told the Star his agency has no evidence of “malicious intent” by the eight students. Nevertheless, the purchases reveal what officials say is a potentially troubling vulnerability in federal and Arizona firearms laws, which exempt international students and other nonimmigrant visa holders with hunting licenses from prohibitions on gun ownership.   One of the University of Arizona students cited said he was simply intrigued by American gun culture and wanted to have the experience of shooting his own firearm, a common motivation among the cited students, according to the federal official. “It’s totally not possible,” Yifei Gong said of his prospects of ever owning a gun in China, where individual gun ownership is heavily restricted. “You probably won’t have a firearm for your life. That’s why most people want a firearm in China. They can’t buy one; that’s why they want one.” Following advice found online and from fellow international students, Gong went to a Walmart and purchased a resident hunting license in November, according to him and Arizona Game and Fish Department records obtained by the Star. With the license, he said, he went to a gun shop and bought a semi-automatic RAS47, a U.S.-made rifle designed to mimic the Kalashnikov. While self-defense was an element of his desire to purchase a gun, Yifei said it was first and foremost for “fun,” and he took his rifle to local shooting ranges several times. But Gong’s time as an Arizona gun owner was to be short-lived. In the early morning of Dec. 6, a state game and fish officer and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations agents went to Gong’s off-campus Tucson apartment to ask about his license and, ultimately, to seize his firearm, according to a report. Gong was cited by the state officer for fraudulently obtaining a hunting license, a Class 2 misdemeanor to which he pleaded guilty and paid a fine. He is facing no other state or federal charges, according to court documents and a federal official. Gong’s experience was not an isolated incident. As of early May, seven other Chinese students at the UA had been similarly cited and had their guns taken, according to court records and Homeland Security Investigations. The citations and seizures are the most recent development in what Scott Brown, the Phoenix HSI special agent in charge, described as a more than yearlong project of the Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats, a multiagency group of state and federal agencies, including Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Arizona Department of Public Safety. Despite the ominous sound of the name, Homeland Security Iinvestigations, the lead agency on the matter, does not suspect the eight UA students had any “malicious intent” when they acquired their licenses and guns, Brown said. He did say there are a “very small number” of other cases where there could be such intent, but even with those, Brown clarified, “our concern isn’t necessarily that they themselves pose the direct threat.” “People like to go out in the desert and shoot guns — U.S. citizens and foreign students alike,” he said of what his agency found to be the most common motivation at play. Brown said the cases highlight what he described as a loophole in firearms regulation that “could be exploited by those with malicious intent.” “This is occurring in other states, where there are foreign students, where there are similar state hunting license requirements,” he added. As it stands under federal law, nonimmigrant visa holders, like international students, are generally prohibited from owning guns. However, exemptions are made for those with a valid hunting license or permit, according to the ATF’s website. Arizona law reflects that exemption. To buy a resident Arizona hunting license, applicants must have lived in the state for six months and not claim residency in another state or jurisdiction, according to the Game and Fish Department. One of the requirements of an F-1 student visa is maintaining “a residence abroad which you have no intention of giving up,” according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service’s website. That designation would typically prevent an international student from being able to get a resident hunting license. “The visa paperwork make it very clear that they are not a resident of the United States,” said Gene Elms, law enforcement branch chief with Arizona Game and Fish. “They don’t qualify for a resident license in Arizona.” Nevertheless, Gong said he easily purchased a resident tag at the Walmart on South Houghton Road last November, something Elms said he wasn’t surprised to hear. Other students purchased their resident licenses similarly, though two bought them through AZGFD’s online hunting license portal, according to AZGFD reports. “I went to Walmart and they asked me how long I’ve been here. I’ve been here for at least two years, and they just assumed that I’m a resident of Arizona, and that’s the hunting license they gave me,” Gong said. A Walmart spokesperson confirmed Gong’s purchase. “We have policies and procedures in place to help ensure we comply with applicable laws when issuing hunting licenses,” a statement from the company read. “A customer must provide valid identification at the time of the purchase to confirm residency.” Several local gun shops declined to sell Gong a gun, citing their policy of not selling to international students. However, he said he eventually found one where his hunting license and other documents were enough to buy an RAS47. “I did not know (I was breaking the law) until they seized my firearm. I believe that most of the people who are cited with this charge did not know that,” Gong said. “If there is something wrong with my hunting license, why would they sell it to me?” Nonresident Arizona hunting licenses, while significantly more expensive than resident tags, can be purchased by nonimmigrant visa holders in Arizona. It’s legal for such license holders to buy and own a firearm until the license expires, at which time “they become a prohibited possessor,” said Mark Hart, a spokesman for the Game and Fish Department. NO “BIG HAMMER” In late 2015, the FBI issued a warning after it received reports of Chinese international students “legally” purchasing guns, according to a Dec. 23 Phoenix ABC 15 story. In one case detailed in the broadcast, a Chinese student was expelled and deported after bringing two AR-15s onto the Arizona State University campus. Brown described that incident as “the most serious” in Arizona involving an armed international student. Then, on Jan. 16, Juang Yue, a 19-year-old Chinese student at ASU, was shot and killed in a road-rage incident, news of which spread quickly in the Chinese student community. In the wake of the tragedy, some Chinese students expressed an interest in buying guns for self-defense, and information on how to acquire them circulated online, as did warnings about the potential dangers of gun ownership. Gong said he was aware of the incident but that it played only a small role in his desire to purchase a gun. It was around the time of the FBI warning and shooting that ASU’s Police Department asked the ATF for assistance with foreign student gun purchases. ATF, in turn, reached out to HSI because of its expertise in immigration-related issues, according to Brown. In late 2016, state game and fish employees also noticed an uptick in students who did not appear to be residents coming to their Tucson office to buy hunting licenses, Elms said. It took time, Brown said, to acquire the records necessary to determine who may have purchased licenses and firearms illegally, as well as what their intent was. The hunting license charges started coming in late 2016, according to court records. But those misdemeanor citations came from the state wildlife agency, not HSI, which could have brought more serious federal firearms charges. “If there’s no malicious intent and we can get the students into compliance, remove the unlawfully obtained firearms … we don’t need to drop a big hammer,” Brown said about why the state filed the charges. Beyond Gong’s AK-47 lookalike, HSI agents have seized handguns and other rifles from the UA students. “Every person that we’ve talked to, that we’ve seized weapons from, has acknowledged that they were not purchased for the purpose of hunting,” Brown said. “One person did say they were for hunting coyotes. The story was so hideously inaccurate he eventually decided that he didn’t want to stick with that story.” UPDATES, REFORM NEEDED There are several efforts underway to make it more difficult for foreign students to improperly purchase guns. While declining to go into details, Brown said the Legislature and Congress may eventually consider legislation that would “close the vulnerabilities.” At the state level, the goal would be to reach “a standardized definition of residency in alignment with the federal definition of residency,” Brown said. When it comes to nonresident hunting licenses, Homeland Security Investigations feels they should enable nonimmigrant visa holders to purchase only guns “specific to hunting/outdoor game sportsmanship,” according to a statement provided by the agency. While he’s sympathetic to the concerns raised by HSI and others, Elms pointed out that many foreign nationals come to Arizona to hunt from around the world and legislative changes could negatively impact their ability to do so. If the department’s commission backs a state legislative change, Elms said the state Game and Fish Department might support it, but at the end of the day, it is federal law “that creates this loophole,” referencing the hunting license exemption for nonimmigrant visa holders purchasing guns. “Our state statute simply points to that federal legislation,” he added. In their statement, HSI agrees that the federal exemptions for nonimmigrant visitors “need to be updated.” “HSI and law enforcement partners have discussed that aliens here for specific hunting and/or professional sporting competition should be the only ones in possession of firearms or granted exemption to purchase firearms,” the statement goes on to say. In the next few years, Game and Fish is switching to an online-only license application process, which could make inappropriately purchasing a resident license less likely. “When you do apply online, you’re prompted with a lot more questions than you would be at the Walmart,” Elms said. Elms and Brown agreed that education could go a long way toward addressing the issue. In the wake of the citations, Brown said HSI and other agencies are working with state universities to make sure such students have a better understanding of gun laws and hunting license requirements. “Life outside of campus can be complicated for all students, domestic and international, and occasionally in upholding all state and federal laws,” a statement from the UA reads, which goes on to say that when situations like this arise, the university’s staff communicates “with relevant legal and law enforcement entities as appropriate.” “Most of the Chinese students here, the problem with them is just their lack of knowledge of the law system,” Gong said. “They know there’s a way you can purchase firearms, but they don’t actually know a lot about the firearms law.” Contact: mwoodhouse@tucson.com or 573-4235.

CEO Eddie Lampert defended the buybacks as the most efficient use of capital, arguing that investment in stores wasn't necessary. The company — considered the most vulnerable publicly traded retailer — is now selling off assets to stay afloat. Sears has survived two world wars and the Great Depression. But after a decade under the control of a former Goldman Sachs executive turned hedge fund manager, the 124-year-old retailer is imploding. Sales have been cut in half since 2009, and the company is burning through cash, closing hundreds of stores, and selling off assets in an attempt to stanch the bleeding. Executives are fleeing and store workers face a grim future. A debt repayment from a $500 million loan facility is looming, and some suppliers are trying to cancel contracts and cut back on orders amid fears that the company could soon go bankrupt. The man in charge of Sears, Edward S. Lampert, has blamed the company's decline on everything from shifts in consumer spending to the rise of e-commerce, and even — at times — the weather. More recently, he's taken to attacking the media, saying reports speculating on a Sears bankruptcy are thwarting his efforts to turn the business around. "Every time people use the word bankruptcy, somebody who reads that doesn't get past that word," he told the Chicago Tribune in a recent interview. "It makes it very unfair for us, and it's a very uneven playing field for us." While other retailers are also struggling, analysts take the demise of Sears, which owns Kmart, as a matter of when not if. But what sets Sears apart from other suffering retailers is something that's not as obvious as the rise online shopping and falling foot traffic in shopping malls. It's the steps that Lampert took when he first acquired the company: putting shareholders like himself in front of everyone else, he drained the company of vital resources.  When Sears was flush with cash, this took the form of billions of dollars of share repurchases, even as the stores suffered years of underinvestment. Repurchases, or buybacks, are common among cash-rich companies, but also derided in some corners as a waste of a company's resources as they only serve to create the appearance of improving earnings. No apologies View photos BI Graphics_Sears Chart 1 copyMore (Business Insider/Skye Gould) In the early days, Lampert was unapologetic about these. According to an executive at the company then, Lampert was genuine in his belief that Sears could be run differently than other retailers and that the shares were being acquired at a bargain price. "Unless we believe we will receive an adequate return on investment," he wrote in a 2007 letter to investors, "we will not spend money on capital expenditures to build new stores or upgrade our existing base simply because our competitors do. If share repurchases or acquisitions appear to be more productive, then we will allocate capital to those options appropriately." And for years Lampert concluded that share buybacks were the best use of the company's money. They continued even through the financial crisis and totaled $5.8 billion between 2005 and 2010, sometimes at prices as high as $170 per share. Sears' earnings in the same period were $3.8 billion. Today the stock is trading for under $8.  Now that Sears is short on cash and faces mounting debt, Lampert has turned from buybacks to dismantling what was once America's largest and most successful retailer, said David Tawil, president of New York-based Maglan Capital. Tawil has spent his career working in corporate restructuring and bankruptcy proceedings. Sears spun off its Lands' End brand to investors in 2014 and is exploring "alternatives" that could include sales of Kenmore appliances and Craftsman tools. "Eddie has orchestrated for himself, and for the benefit of shareholders, the most protracted liquidation in history," Tawil said in an interview with Business Insider.

"We continue to do what is necessary to improve the near-term performance of our business," Lampert said in the post, noting that the company planned to cut $1.25 billion in costs this year. Wall Street superstar View photos AP_02021206916More (Lampert in 2002, before he acquired Sears.Associated Press) Lampert got his start at Goldman Sachs, working in the New York-based bank's risk-arbitrage department. He left the bank after four years and in 1988 started a hedge fund, ESL Investments, at just 26 years old. For a time he was a Wall Street superstar. BusinessWeek compared him to Warren Buffett because of his incredible track record as an investor. ESL Investments generated annualized returns of more than 20% per year for 20 years, marking one of the strongest long-term investment records in history, according to a 2013 Wall Street Journal article. Through ESL, Lampert gained control of Kmart in 2003 and he combined it with Sears in 2005 to create Sears Holdings in an $11.5 billion deal. ESL, long one of Sears' largest shareholders, now owns about half of the company. It was soon after he took the reins at Sears, first as chairman, that Lampert began the share buybacks. In his annual letters to Sears shareholders, Lampert defends buybacks as a way to provide "liquidity" (or a buyer) for shareholders who are looking to sell and increase ownership of the company for investors who hold on. But to critics, they are simply a financial maneuver to drive up per-share earnings and create the illusion that a company is doing better than it really is. With the buybacks came cuts in spending on the retailer's stores, as well as reduced promotions and advertising, despite Lampert's promises to revive the company. Never cheaper View photos RTRFZ3XMore (Lampert, Aylwin Lewis, president of Kmart, and Alan Lacy, CEO of Sears, join hands during an announcement of a merger between Kmart and Sears.Peter Morgan/REuters) Lampert "had a perspective that the retail industry as a whole was too sales-oriented and not enough profit-oriented," one former high-level Sears executive told Business Insider. The executive asked not to be identified discussing private matters. "He wanted to demonstrate to the world that you could reduce advertising and inventory investment — and yes, sales would fall to some new normal — but you would have a more profitable business," the former executive said. At the time, Lampert believed in the long-term success of Sears, according to the executive. When he was buying the stock at $170, more than $150 per share above where it is today, he thought it was a better capital investment than store upgrades, because it was his theory that the stock would never be cheaper. Lampert had high hopes for himself and for Sears. "I want to be known as a great businessman," he said in 2006, shortly after the Sears acquisition. His greatest fear, he said, was that he wouldn't live long enough to complete all his goals. "He was completely confident that he was going to be the next Warren Buffett," the former executive told Business Insider. "He felt that he had created a long-term winner in Sears and it would be his Berkshire Hathaway." That is not how it has worked. Instead, the company has been unable to keep up with shoppers. Serving the customer? View photos IMG_7104.JPGMore (A Sears in Richmond, Virginia, May 2016.Sears) "The retail industry is predicated on serving the customer, valuing the customer, listening to the customer, and ultimately giving the customer what she wants — and it’s the employees who deliver this. Anything less is a recipe for terminal illness, if not suicide," says Robin Lewis, a 40-year retail consultant and CEO of industry publication The Robin Report. "Clearly, in the case of Sears, Eddie Lampert has turned a completely blind eye to this truism, and has been bleeding the company to a long and slow but well-managed death for the sole benefit of major investors and himself." Under Lampert, Sears failed to invest in major capital improvements, such as store maintenance or new store concepts. Fortune recounted a 2005 strategy session between Lampert and the top two-dozen executives of the company: Once their presentations started, Lampert also began poking holes in virtually every idea. 'What's the benefit of that?' he asked again and again. 'What's the value?' He shot down a modest $2 million proposal to improve lighting in the stores. 'Why invest in that?' He skewered a plan to sell DVDs at a discounted price to better compete with Target and Wal-Mart. 'It doesn't matter what Target and Wal-Mart do,' he declared. As Lampert slashed spending in-store improvements, "the stores began going down," a 41-year Kmart store employee who was laid off in February 2016 told Business Insider. Don't talk about it View photos IMG_7085.JPGMore (A Sears in Richmond, Virginia, May 2016.Sears) When Lampert took over, company executives visited stores and told workers they were no longer allowed to discuss any problems the stores were having, according to the employee. "When they quit asking and started telling you how it should be run according to corporate standards, the stores began to go down," the employee said. "There is no morale in any of the stores." An employee of a Sears store in Elyria, Ohio, told Business Insider last year that his store is falling apart. "The walls and floors in my store are all beat to hell ... the roof leaks, the escalator and the elevator break down frequently, but 'Fast Eddie' doesn't want to spend money on the stores," the employee said. Sears spokesman Howard Riefs has denied that employees are discouraged from giving feedback. "One of our cultural beliefs as a company is to embrace feedback," Riefs has told Business Insider. "We have a variety of ways that associates can give authentic feedback – even anonymously, so we would disagree with that suggestion." Lampert, meanwhile, has defended his decisions.  "I was criticized for not investing enough in the stores," Lampert said in 2013. "My point of view is we couldn't invest in everything." Losing investors View photos IMG_7095.JPGMore (Sears) Investors bought into Lampert's strategy, at first. In 2006, Sears' stock rose roughly 45%, to $156. Then quarterly sales started declining in early 2007, and the stock followed suit. Many Sears executives were expecting Lampert to eventually refocus on investing in stores and advertising. When that didn't happen, some employees began to grow concerned. "There was a feeling of, 'OK, now we have to invest and compete,' through some combination of advertising and promotion," the former Sears executive said. "But it became clear that he either didn’t know how or didn’t want to spend the money." At that point, senior executives began leaving the company.  Since May 2007, Sears' shares have dropped 95%. Over the same period, sales have dropped from $50.7 billion in 2007 to $22.1 billion in 2016. To raise money, the company started selling its real estate and spinning off brands like Sears Hometown and Outlet stores and Craftsman, which was sold to Stanley Black & Decker in January for about $900 million to be paid out over the next several years. In one of its biggest transactions to date, Sears launched and spun off a real-estate investment trust, Seritage Growth Properties, to execute sale/lease-back agreements for 266 Sears and Kmart stores. The deal helped Sears raise about $2.7 billion, most of which was quickly burned through to pay off debt. Seritage is in the process of recapturing the stores it bought from Sears and renting out the space to new tenants for as much as four times the rent that Sears paid. If it can profit from this, that's good for Lampert. He is Seritage's chairman and his hedge fund owns about 40% of the real estate investor's limited partnership, as well as 8.5% of the voting power in its common stock. Starving the business View photos IMG_7066.JPGMore (Sears) Meanwhile, Sears has been cutting costs by closing hundreds of stores and laying off hundreds of thousands of employees. In 2007, Sears had 3,418 stores and 315,000 employees in the US. The company now has fewer than 1,430 stores and 140,000 employees. Lampert's strategy of underinvesting in stores and selling off assets "starved capital and management resources from the retail business, leaving it unable to respond and adapt to the needs of the evolving consumer and marketplace," Lewis said. The stores are now shells of what they once were, with leaking ceilings, broken escalators, and sometimes no employees to work the registers, according to analysts, customers, and employees from the store level to corporate headquarters. In some stores, employees hang bedsheets to shield shoppers from sections that stand empty. "The majority of stores now border on disgraceful and show a complete lack of retail standards and proper store management," Neil Saunders, the CEO of retail consulting firm Conlumino, told Business Insider. "The impression is of a retailer that has completely given up, and this is something consumers notice." But there was one party that was benefiting — at least for some time — from this strategy: shareholders. Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management told The New York Times in 2013 that Lampert's spinoffs had helped deliver about $10 a share in assets to Sears shareholders, even as the stock price was tanking. At the time, Fairholme owned about 20% of Sears shares. Berkowitz and Fairholme own closer to 25% now.  Not working out View photos BI Graphics_Sears Chart 2 copyMore (Business Insider/Skye Gould) The losses eventually lost Lampert the support of many investors in his hedge fund, ESL Investments. "Investors are heading for the exits, discouraged by the declining fortunes of Mr. Lampert’s signature stake in Sears Holdings," Randall Smith at the Times wrote in 2013. The fund's assets are now down to $2 billion from $18 billion in 2007, according to a March 2017 regulatory filing. Lampert says he is committed to restoring Sears to profitability and continuing retail operations online and through a smaller fleet of stores. "I believe Sears Holdings can continue to operate as a very significant member-centric integrated retailer with a large number of stores as long as we receive the support of our vendors and other stakeholders," Lampert said in a blog post this week. The company's window of opportunity for a turnaround is shrinking. It's falling deeper into debt and just lost its second chief financial officer in six months, just as it begins talks with lenders over its $500 million loan facility maturing in July. Most vulnerable View photos IMG_7079.JPGMore (Sears) In addition to its chief financial officer leaving, Sears has lost more than a quarter of its executive team in the last five months. The company posted a loss of $471 million in the first quarter, compared to a $303 million loss last year. Revenue declined to $5.39 billion from $5.88 billion. Analysts say a turnaround is hard to imagine at this point. S&P Global Market Intelligence in April identified Sears as the most vulnerable public retail company in the US, saying it has a 24% chance of default within a year. Sears recently said that it's planning to cut more costs and that it's reviewing bids in excess of $700 million for more than 60 of its real estate properties. Selling off real estate will give the company a much-needed cash infusion, but it also diminishes the company's lifeline as it struggles to staunch losses, according to Moody's vice president and senior analyst Christina Boni. "Sears’ financial performance remains extremely weak which is prompting the acceleration of cost reductions by an additional $250 million," Boni said recently. "Its effort to sell real estate which has produced over $700 million of bids currently will enhance liquidity, but accelerates the timeline required to stem operating losses as it asset base diminishes." Eventually, the company will run out of funding sources, according to Tawil. "Normally businesses like this fail and get sold off in pieces in bankruptcy," Tawil said. "This has been the greatest out-of-court liquidation in the history of our nation." *A version of this story was published in June 2016.

 Sears' CEO blames the media for company's decline — but his obsession with Wall Street set it up for failure Hayley Peterson May 21, 2017, 9:06 AM 21,423 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP Sears Holdings spent $5.8 billion buying back shares from 2005 to 2010, draining the company of resources. CEO Eddie Lampert defended the buybacks as the most efficient use of capital, arguing that investment in stores wasn't necessary. The company — considered the most vulnerable publicly traded retailer — is now selling off assets to stay afloat. Sears has survived two world wars and the Great Depression. But after a decade under the control of a former Goldman Sachs executive turned hedge fund manager, the 124-year-old retailer is imploding. Sales have been cut in half since 2009, and the company is burning through cash, closing hundreds of stores, and selling off assets in an attempt to stanch the bleeding. Executives are fleeing and store workers face a grim future. A debt repayment from a $500 million loan facility is looming, and some suppliers are trying to cancel contracts and cut back on orders amid fears that the company could soon go bankrupt. The man in charge of Sears, Edward S. Lampert, has blamed the company's decline on everything from shifts in consumer spending to the rise of e-commerce, and even — at times — the weather. More recently, he's taken to attacking the media, saying reports speculating on a Sears bankruptcy are thwarting his efforts to turn the business around. "Every time people use the word bankruptcy, somebody who reads that doesn't get past that word," he told the Chicago Tribune in a recent interview. "It makes it very unfair for us, and it's a very uneven playing field for us." While other retailers are also struggling, analysts take the demise of Sears, which owns Kmart, as a matter of when not if. But what sets Sears apart from other suffering retailers is something that's not as obvious as the rise online shopping and falling foot traffic in shopping malls. It's the steps that Lampert took when he first acquired the company: putting shareholders like himself in front of everyone else, he drained the company of vital resources.  When Sears was flush with cash, this took the form of billions of dollars of share repurchases, even as the stores suffered years of underinvestment. Repurchases, or buybacks, are common among cash-rich companies, but also derided in some corners as a waste of a company's resources as they only serve to create the appearance of improving earnings. No apologies Business Insider/Skye Gould In the early days, Lampert was unapologetic about these. According to an executive at the company then, Lampert was genuine in his belief that Sears could be run differently than other retailers and that the shares were being acquired at a bargain price. "Unless we believe we will receive an adequate return on investment," he wrote in a 2007 letter to investors, "we will not spend money on capital expenditures to build new stores or upgrade our existing base simply because our competitors do. If share repurchases or acquisitions appear to be more productive, then we will allocate capital to those options appropriately." And for years Lampert concluded that share buybacks were the best use of the company's money. They continued even through the financial crisis and totaled $5.8 billion between 2005 and 2010, sometimes at prices as high as $170 per share. Sears' earnings in the same period were $3.8 billion. Today the stock is trading for under $8.  Now that Sears is short on cash and faces mounting debt, Lampert has turned from buybacks to dismantling what was once America's largest and most successful retailer, said David Tawil, president of New York-based Maglan Capital. Tawil has spent his career working in corporate restructuring and bankruptcy proceedings. Sears spun off its Lands' End brand to investors in 2014 and is exploring "alternatives" that could include sales of Kenmore appliances and Craftsman tools. "Eddie has orchestrated for himself, and for the benefit of shareholders, the most protracted liquidation in history," Tawil said in an interview with Business Insider. A Sears spokesman, Howard Riefs, said last year that the spinoffs were meant to create shareholder value and to fund Sears' turnaround. He noted that the company has raised billions from the asset sales and other financing efforts, and those funds have "provided liquidity to help fund our transformation." More recently, he pointed Business Insider to a blog post Lampert published on May 11, in which Lampert said the company is "fighting like hell" to overcome its challenges. "We continue to do what is necessary to improve the near-term performance of our business," Lampert said in the post, noting that the company planned to cut $1.25 billion in costs this year.

Repurchases, or buybacks, are common among cash-rich companies, but also derided in some corners as a waste of a company's resources as they only serve to create the appearance of improving earnings. No apologies Business Insider/Skye Gould In the early days, Lampert was unapologetic about these. According to an executive at the company then, Lampert was genuine in his belief that Sears could be run differently than other retailers and that the shares were being acquired at a bargain price. "Unless we believe we will receive an adequate return on investment," he wrote in a 2007 letter to investors, "we will not spend money on capital expenditures to build new stores or upgrade our existing base simply because our competitors do. If share repurchases or acquisitions appear to be more productive, then we will allocate capital to those options appropriately." And for years Lampert concluded that share buybacks were the best use of the company's money. They continued even through the financial crisis and totaled $5.8 billion between 2005 and 2010, sometimes at prices as high as $170 per share. Sears' earnings in the same period were $3.8 billion. Today the stock is trading for under $8.  Now that Sears is short on cash and faces mounting debt, Lampert has turned from buybacks to dismantling what was once America's largest and most successful retailer, said David Tawil, president of New York-based Maglan Capital. Tawil has spent his career working in corporate restructuring and bankruptcy proceedings. Sears spun off its Lands' End brand to investors in 2014 and is exploring "alternatives" that could include sales of Kenmore appliances and Craftsman tools. "Eddie has orchestrated for himself, and for the benefit of shareholders, the most protracted liquidation in history," Tawil said in an interview with Business Insider. A Sears spokesman, Howard Riefs, said last year that the spinoffs were meant to create shareholder value and to fund Sears' turnaround. He noted that the company has raised billions from the asset sales and other financing efforts, and those funds have "provided liquidity to help fund our transformation." More recently, he pointed Business Insider to a blog post Lampert published on May 11, in which Lampert said the company is "fighting like hell" to overcome its challenges. "We continue to do what is necessary to improve the near-term performance of our business," Lampert said in the post, noting that the company planned to cut $1.25 billion in costs this year. Wall Street superstar Lampert in 2002, before he acquired Sears. Associated Press Lampert got his start at Goldman Sachs, working in the New York-based bank's risk-arbitrage department. He left the bank after four years and in 1988 started a hedge fund, ESL Investments, at just 26 years old. For a time he was a Wall Street superstar. BusinessWeek compared him to Warren Buffett because of his incredible track record as an investor. ESL Investments generated annualized returns of more than 20% per year for 20 years, marking one of the strongest long-term investment records in history, according to a 2013 Wall Street Journal article. Through ESL, Lampert gained control of Kmart in 2003 and he combined it with Sears in 2005 to create Sears Holdings in an $11.5 billion deal. ESL, long one of Sears' largest shareholders, now owns about half of the company. It was soon after he took the reins at Sears, first as chairman, that Lampert began the share buybacks. In his annual letters to Sears shareholders, Lampert defends buybacks as a way to provide "liquidity" (or a buyer) for shareholders who are looking to sell and increase ownership of the company for investors who hold on. But to critics, they are simply a financial maneuver to drive up per-share earnings and create the illusion that a company is doing better than it really is. With the buybacks came cuts in spending on the retailer's stores, as well as reduced promotions and advertising, despite Lampert's promises to revive the company. Never cheaper Lampert, Aylwin Lewis, president of Kmart, and Alan Lacy, CEO of Sears, join hands during an announcement of a merger between Kmart and Sears. Peter Morgan/REuters Lampert "had a perspective that the retail industry as a whole was too sales-oriented and not enough profit-oriented," one former high-level Sears executive told Business Insider. The executive asked not to be identified discussing private matters. "He wanted to demonstrate to the world that you could reduce advertising and inventory investment — and yes, sales would fall to some new normal — but you would have a more profitable business," the former executive said. At the time, Lampert believed in the long-term success of Sears, according to the executive. When he was buying the stock at $170, more than $150 per share above where it is today, he thought it was a better capital investment than store upgrades, because it was his theory that the stock would never be cheaper. Lampert had high hopes for himself and for Sears. "I want to be known as a great businessman," he said in 2006, shortly after the Sears acquisition. His greatest fear, he said, was that he wouldn't live long enough to complete all his goals. "He was completely confident that he was going to be the next Warren Buffett," the former executive told Business Insider. "He felt that he had created a long-term winner in Sears and it would be his Berkshire Hathaway." That is not how it has worked. Instead, the company has been unable to keep up with shoppers. Serving the customer? A Sears in Richmond, Virginia, May 2016. Sears "The retail industry is predicated on serving the customer, valuing the customer, listening to the customer, and ultimately giving the customer what she wants — and it’s the employees who deliver this. Anything less is a recipe for terminal illness, if not suicide," says Robin Lewis, a 40-year retail consultant and CEO of industry publication The Robin Report. "Clearly, in the case of Sears, Eddie Lampert has turned a completely blind eye to this truism, and has been bleeding the company to a long and slow but well-managed death for the sole benefit of major investors and himself." Under Lampert, Sears failed to invest in major capital improvements, such as store maintenance or new store concepts. Fortune recounted a 2005 strategy session between Lampert and the top two-dozen executives of the company: Once their presentations started, Lampert also began poking holes in virtually every idea. 'What's the benefit of that?' he asked again and again. 'What's the value?' He shot down a modest $2 million proposal to improve lighting in the stores. 'Why invest in that?' He skewered a plan to sell DVDs at a discounted price to better compete with Target and Wal-Mart. 'It doesn't matter what Target and Wal-Mart do,' he declared. As Lampert slashed spending in-store improvements, "the stores began going down," a 41-year Kmart store employee who was laid off in February 2016 told Business Insider. Don't talk about it A Sears in Richmond, Virginia, May 2016. Sears When Lampert took over, company executives visited stores and told workers they were no longer allowed to discuss any problems the stores were having, according to the employee. "When they quit asking and started telling you how it should be run according to corporate standards, the stores began to go down," the employee said. "There is no morale in any of the stores." An employee of a Sears store in Elyria, Ohio, told Business Insider last year that his store is falling apart. "The walls and floors in my store are all beat to hell ... the roof leaks, the escalator and the elevator break down frequently, but 'Fast Eddie' doesn't want to spend money on the stores," the employee said. Sears spokesman Howard Riefs has denied that employees are discouraged from giving feedback. "One of our cultural beliefs as a company is to embrace feedback," Riefs has told Business Insider. "We have a variety of ways that associates can give authentic feedback – even anonymously, so we would disagree with that suggestion." Lampert, meanwhile, has defended his decisions.  "I was criticized for not investing enough in the stores," Lampert said in 2013. "My point of view is we couldn't invest in everything." Losing investors Sears Investors bought into Lampert's strategy, at first. In 2006, Sears' stock rose roughly 45%, to $156. Then quarterly sales started declining in early 2007, and the stock followed suit. Many Sears executives were expecting Lampert to eventually refocus on investing in stores and advertising. When that didn't happen, some employees began to grow concerned. "There was a feeling of, 'OK, now we have to invest and compete,' through some combination of advertising and promotion," the former Sears executive said. "But it became clear that he either didn’t know how or didn’t want to spend the money." At that point, senior executives began leaving the company.  Since May 2007, Sears' shares have dropped 95%. Over the same period, sales have dropped from $50.7 billion in 2007 to $22.1 billion in 2016. To raise money, the company started selling its real estate and spinning off brands like Sears Hometown and Outlet stores and Craftsman, which was sold to Stanley Black & Decker in January for about $900 million to be paid out over the next several years. In one of its biggest transactions to date, Sears launched and spun off a real-estate investment trust, Seritage Growth Properties, to execute sale/lease-back agreements for 266 Sears and Kmart stores. The deal helped Sears raise about $2.7 billion, most of which was quickly burned through to pay off debt. Seritage is in the process of recapturing the stores it bought from Sears and renting out the space to new tenants for as much as four times the rent that Sears paid. If it can profit from this, that's good for Lampert. He is Seritage's chairman and his hedge fund owns about 40% of the real estate investor's limited partnership, as well as 8.5% of the voting power in its common stock. Starving the business Sears Meanwhile, Sears has been cutting costs by closing hundreds of stores and laying off hundreds of thousands of employees. In 2007, Sears had 3,418 stores and 315,000 employees in the US. The company now has fewer than 1,430 stores and 140,000 employees. Lampert's strategy of underinvesting in stores and selling off assets "starved capital and management resources from the retail business, leaving it unable to respond and adapt to the needs of the evolving consumer and marketplace," Lewis said. The stores are now shells of what they once were, with leaking ceilings, broken escalators, and sometimes no employees to work the registers, according to analysts, customers, and employees from the store level to corporate headquarters. In some stores, employees hang bedsheets to shield shoppers from sections that stand empty. "The majority of stores now border on disgraceful and show a complete lack of retail standards and proper store management," Neil Saunders, the CEO of retail consulting firm Conlumino, told Business Insider. "The impression is of a retailer that has completely given up, and this is something consumers notice." But there was one party that was benefiting — at least for some time — from this strategy: shareholders. Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management told The New York Times in 2013 that Lampert's spinoffs had helped deliver about $10 a share in assets to Sears shareholders, even as the stock price was tanking. At the time, Fairholme owned about 20% of Sears shares. Berkowitz and Fairholme own closer to 25% now.  Not working out Business Insider/Skye Gould The losses eventually lost Lampert the support of many investors in his hedge fund, ESL Investments. "Investors are heading for the exits, discouraged by the declining fortunes of Mr. Lampert’s signature stake in Sears Holdings," Randall Smith at the Times wrote in 2013. The fund's assets are now down to $2 billion from $18 billion in 2007, according to a March 2017 regulatory filing. Lampert says he is committed to restoring Sears to profitability and continuing retail operations online and through a smaller fleet of stores. "I believe Sears Holdings can continue to operate as a very significant member-centric integrated retailer with a large number of stores as long as we receive the support of our vendors and other stakeholders," Lampert said in a blog post this week. The company's window of opportunity for a turnaround is shrinking. It's falling deeper into debt and just lost its second chief financial officer in six months, just as it begins talks with lenders over its $500 million loan facility maturing in July. Most vulnerable Sears In addition to its chief financial officer leaving, Sears has lost more than a quarter of its executive team in the last five months. The company posted a loss of $471 million in the first quarter, compared to a $303 million loss last year. Revenue declined to $5.39 billion from $5.88 billion. Analysts say a turnaround is hard to imagine at this point. S&P Global Market Intelligence in April identified Sears as the most vulnerable public retail company in the US, saying it has a 24% chance of default within a year. Sears recently said that it's planning to cut more costs and that it's reviewing bids in excess of $700 million for more than 60 of its real estate properties. Selling off real estate will give the company a much-needed cash infusion, but it also diminishes the company's lifeline as it struggles to staunch losses, according to Moody's vice president and senior analyst Christina Boni. "Sears’ financial performance remains extremely weak which is prompting the acceleration of cost reductions by an additional $250 million," Boni said recently. "Its effort to sell real estate which has produced over $700 million of bids currently will enhance liquidity, but accelerates the timeline required to stem operating losses as it asset base diminishes." Eventually, the company will run out of funding sources, according to Tawil. "Normally businesses like this fail and get sold off in pieces in bankruptcy," Tawil said. "This has been the greatest out-of-court liquidation in the history of our nation." *A version of this story was published in June 2016.

Investors sold off shares of pharmacy giant CVS Health and Walgreens on Wednesday amid renewed speculation that Amazon would enter the business of selling prescription drugs. As the stock market suffered its biggest loss since before the November election, shares of CVS and Walgreens closed down more than 3 percent, to $76.34 and $81.73, respectively. CNBC reported Tuesday that the online retail giant is considering wading into the complicated retail pharmacy market. The news organization reported that Amazon is hiring a general manager to lead a team to explore the idea but hasn't made a final decision. Selling prescription drugs is a big business in the United States — retail pharmacy is a $400 billion industry, according to an analysis by Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting. The top 15 pharmacies — including CVS, Walgreens, Express Scripts and Wal-Mart — accounted for about three-fourths of all prescriptions by revenue in 2016, Fein said. Fein said he could see Amazon most easily entering the market for patients who pay cash, such as for generic drugs or brand-name drugs with discount coupons from manufacturers. Those patients may choose to pay for the drugs themselves because they're uninsured or looking for a better deal than what they would get through their insurer, which could force them to pay the full list price before they hit their deductible. “Prescription drugs is such a big market, and Amazon, I think, looks at every big market and figures out if there's a place for them to play,” Fein said, estimating that the company could capture 5 to 10 percent of the market if it puts enough resources behind the effort. “I think (Amazon) would challenge the economics of the retail pharmacy industry.” The pharmaceutical industry has been criticized for lacking transparency. Drug list prices do not reflect what most people eventually pay for the medicines, and secret rebates and discounts flow between various middlemen in the industry. Many patients who go to fill a prescription have little idea what price they'll be charged at the pharmacy counter or whether they could get that drug cheaper elsewhere. “Having a new competitor in the market would be great. Having a competitor that would potentially be transparent would be potentially even more interesting,” said Kevin Schulman, a professor of medicine at Duke University who has studied the web of financial relationships between drug companies and patients. Schulman said the most disruptive and profitable opportunity for Amazon would be to partner with health plans offered by employers, because many people with insurance simply use whatever is covered by their plan. Capturing that market would require Amazon to make deals with insurers or employers. He noted that Amazon could face challenges related to government regulations and patient privacy requirements, which differ from typical retail. Knowing what online shoppers have put in their carts or plan to buy can be used to try to sell other items to the consumer. “If Amazon would know that you have diabetes or hypertension, they could do a lot with that data,” Schulman said. “In principle, they could set up a marketplace where they behave differently, with different rules and different privacy practices.” One way for Amazon to access the prescription drug market would be to acquire smaller companies already doing commerce in the space, Fein noted. Doug Hirsch, the co-founder of GoodRx, a website that enables consumers to compare prices of prescription drugs at retail pharmacies and offers coupons, said Amazon's entry has long been rumored and that the shopping site could be a welcome addition. He said his company is seeing business from consumers who are shopping around to pay cash directly without going through their health plan because their deductibles are high. But he echoed Schulman's caution that the regulatory landscape would make disruption more complicated than a typical retail market. “There's been at least a dozen companies popped up trying to be the Amazon of prescriptions,” Hirsch said. “It's a complicated sell. It's not like the traditional consumer buying experience because of the lack of price transparency and the many steps that have to go into the flow of purchasing a prescription.” More Business With many social media options, small businesses need focus Banks tighten auto lending as more subprime borrowers fall into default Fracking crew shortage may push oil production surge to 2018 Dreamers // Doers offers resources, moral support for female entrepreneurs Spate of store closures puts a wrinkle in teens' summer job plans TribLIVE commenting policy You are solely responsible for your comments and by using TribLive.com you agree to our Terms of Service.

(Photo by Michael Kitada, Contributing Photographer) Show Caption of Expand A sprawling complex snaked with 5 miles of conveyor belts hums as workers process boxes and ride forklifts. Tools, toys and beige boxes stretch out as far as the eye can see. The cavernous facility, three warehouses tucked alongside the 15 in Riverside County, typically employs 650 people. That number soars to 980 in December as holiday shopping demand peaks. On Black Friday alone, the complex handles 76,000 orders. Don’t be fooled. This is not another story about Amazon, the company many of us imagine when beige boxes and conveyor belts come to mind. Instead, it’s the Mira Loma distribution hub for Ingram Micro, the Irvine-based logistics company considered to be the world’s biggest player in the tech wholesale market. While Orange County in recent years has seen some of its giant tech firms acquired, downsized and relocated (think: Broadcom and Western Digital), Ingram Micro is on a different track. Bought in 2016 for $6 billion by HNA Group and its subsidiary Tianjin Tianhai Investment Co., the company remains rooted in Southern California and is growing and evolving. The company, which reported fourth-quarter sales of $12.2 billion, an 8 percent increase, was founded as Micro D in 1979 by Geza Czige and Lorraine Mecca, a husband and wife team of teachers. Long known as a logistics company, in recent years Ingram Micro has expanded its focus, honing in on software development, the growing cloud storage segment and the maintenance and recycling of personal technology. “People still think we’re a box mover,” Chief Executive Alain Monié said. “We do that, and we’re probably among the best in the world to do that, but we do so many other things. We’re a software company now. We own intellectual property. Our cloud platform that we use for our own needs is being used by more than 130 telecos around the world.” Monié lists Ingram Micros’s accomplishments like a proud father: “We repair devices. We work with companies like Walmart.com or Apple and others to help them fulfill their e-commerce activities. The companies we represent are also learning how much else we can do for them.” The company, with 900 employees in Orange County, has made roughly 30 acquisitions in the last five years, several of which were in the mobile tech services industry.  Monié does not anticipate his employee count will change in Orange County, but the company last year laid off 900 workers at its wireless device repair and distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas, according to state filings. Monié, who is French-born and has been CEO since 2012, sat down with the Register to discuss acquisitions, hiring and the future of the company. His answers have been edited for length and clarity. Q What do you look for when hiring? A It’s a mix of experience and skills and capability to grow in the future. There are some roles where you need prior experience. There are some roles where it’s really about what you can bring in terms of momentum and creativity. In Orange County, we have a lot of IT people. We have a lot of sales and management. So those are the skills we look for here. And there are different skills need for our distribution center. Q Are you finding the right people in Orange County? A It’s not always easy. We first look here, but then, given the scope and the specificity in our business, we have to go national to attract good people. Orange County is a very good destination for potential candidates. Of course, the cost of living here is a question, but there is no issue in bringing interested associates to this region. We have great colleges, weather and quality of life. Q Why have your headquarters in Orange County, especially when tech companies like Broadcom and Western Digital are moving to San Jose?  A It’s historical. We’ve put together a team. You don’t decide to go somewhere else and have 900 people with the skills you need follow you. That just doesn’t happen. Q Why did you move to Irvine from Santa Ana almost two years ago? A We had a very old building that was difficult to renovate without disruption. We stayed in the old building while we did all the preparations (in Irvine) and moved over the weekend. We came to a much more modern environment where we are not isolated. We have other companies around us (Western Digital is in the same business complex). We have amenities around that are good for our people and easy to access. Q What has changed since the company was acquired? A Very little. Part of the discussions we had with them before we closed the deal was how the company was going to be managed. The HNA Group is very experienced in making acquisitions of companies around the world. They always keep management in place and let the companies they acquire continue their business the way they’ve been doing it. Management is still the same. They are very supportive as far as the investments we want to make, but they are not getting into the day-to-day management of the company. We get together on a quarterly basis for board meetings. We agree on our strategies and how to execute those strategies. I’m still running the company the same way I used to. In fact, it’s even easier. There are less explanations to less shareholders on what we’re doing and why we’re doing it. We only have one shareholder now and once that shareholder is convinced we go ahead. It’s much easier. Q The company has made 30 acquisitions in the past five years. Why grow now? A If you don’t grow, you are going to be less relevant to the industry. If you don’t go into new areas that the industry is evolving into, such as the cloud, you’re going to go backward. It’s a necessity for us to stay in the business. Our objective is to do more and better. To do that we need to grow globally and in the diversity of services that we offer. Q What do you look for when deciding what companies to acquire? A There are two types of acquisitions. The first is strengthening the core of your business, doing more of the same to be stronger and to have a better reach for our customers, increasing our footprint and capabilities in our core business. The second type of acquisition is acquiring new skills that we don’t have and are necessary for us to develop in new areas. A number of acquisitions we’ve made are into cloud, into reverse logistics, forward logistics, repairs. Things that we don’t do today but are necessary for us to grow in the future. For example, we bought a company in the Middle East to cover the Middle East and Africa, a region we were not in. At the same time, we buy companies that do cell phone repairs. It’s a lot faster to get skills in the company through acquisition than developing them on your own. Q Are there plans for more acquisitions? A When you’re this big, this diverse, acquisitions will always be a way to grow. They’re a good complement to organic growth and help you get there faster. We will continue using a mix of organic growth and acquisitions. Q How much involvement do you have in the day-to-day operations of the companies you acquire? A We try to preserve the quality and the reason for which we bought them. We are very mindful not to impact that. But we want to instill in these organizations the best practices we have that benefit them. Like security. Cybersecurity is something we are very focused on. Some of the companies don’t have the same level of investment in those areas. Another is compliance. When you buy companies that are smaller or in certain geographies, they don’t normally have the same compliance programs. We are very focused on expanding the level of the compliance programs to all of the acquisitions. The company reported fourth quarter sales of $12.2 billion, an 8 percent increase. To what do you attribute the growth?  As we add skills and services, we become even more relevant to our customer base. The more relevant you are, the more they come to you. We’re also doing well in grabbing some market share. What’s next for Ingram Micro? We will continue growing our core business: our distribution business around the world. At the same time, we will grow our business units: our cloud business unit, our lifecycle services and our commerce and fulfillment, which is executing the delivery of products for those who have a website where you can buy stuff. When you go on any website, you click the buy button. Someone then needs to ship and deliver it to you. Someone needs to do the logistics for you. We’re investing a lot in that area around systems to connect. We need to create systems that link you as a customer to who has that stuff you’re buying and where and making that happen. We don’t have to do it all ourselves. All we have to do is create that platform that connects the customer to those that have the inventory. That’s growing very fast, double-digit growth. A lot of people now are not buying hardware and laptops, they can get those same services on the cloud. Enterprises do it also. Instead of having big data centers in the company, they use the cloud. We’re offering that transition-premise premise to the cloud to our current customers. Lifecycle services is really around capturing the value. With phones, we used to only make a certain amount of money when the phone was first sold. That device has a life. It gets repaired. You have an insurance plan that goes with it. And then at the end of the life, it can be redeployed in other geographies. We accompany the device all along its life. We’re acquiring additional services to go with that. We’re acquiring in new geographies too. How did you start using cloud technology and how do you see the technology progressing? The analogy is clear between virtual goods and physical goods. As a distributor, we buy hardware from those who manufacture it, put it in a distribution center and when our customers order something, we deliver it. Now, instead of physical goods, you have services that are on the cloud. You can buy storage. You can buy computer capability. How do we now become the distributor of those services? What we have created is a platform. It’s the equivalent of the warehouse. It allows you to go and procure and provision all of these cloud services into an IT system, into a piece of software. It’s creating the equivalent of a warehouse by creating the software platform. It’s a natural path to continue as a distributor. It’s a natural evolution. There’s some uncertainty now/lack of knowledge about how policy affecting business could change. How has this affected Ingram Micro? The bigger changes are technology shifts and that’s what we’re focused on. What we need to do is be resilient and make sure that we are flexible and adaptable. The real area we need to focus is on actual technology changes that modify the fabric of what we do. Get the latest news delivered daily!

At their monthly meeting Thursday, township supervisors conditionally approved land development plans submitted by the auto parts store. Supervisor Robert Leibensperger said AutoZone plans to build near Wal-Mart in Hometown. For approval, AutoZone must post escrow and provide an improvements agreement. “The estimated opening for this store is December 2017. However, many factors affect the opening date of a store and the scheduled opening date can change weekly,” AutoZone spokeswoman Tracy Houston said in an email to the Standard-Speaker. She noted that a typical AutoZone store has 8,000 square feet and employs eight to 10 people. In an unrelated matter, Leibensperger asked solicitor Chris Riedlinger to send a letter to the township’s trash hauler, Tamaqua Transfer. According to Leibensperger, the township is receiving complaints from residents who claim their garbage isn’t being collected, or is being collected days after the scheduled pickup date. “It has to be followed up on,” Leibensperger said. “People are getting upset.” Tamaqua Transfer took over the township’s trash and recyclable collections in March. Leibensperger announced that the township’s road crew will begin spring cleanup toward the end of June. Workers will sweep streets, cut weeds and trim trees. Other business The supervisors also: ■ Approved the Hometown Fire Police to assist the Tamaqua Fire Police with Tamaqua’s Memorial Day parade on May 29. ■ Approved the purchase of 12 grinder pumps for Lake Hauto from Site-Specfic Design Inc. for $21,044.04. ■ Noted that the township office will be closed for Memorial Day on May 29. ■ Reminded residents who have garbage collection on Mondays that their May 29 pickup will be rescheduled to May 30. Also, the June 2 pickup will be moved to June 3. ■ Accepted the resignation of road foreman Barry Ruch. His last day will be May 26.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 21 May 2017 | MYT 1:00 PM As retail stores close, where are the jobs going? by suzette parmley The Bebe chain of women's clothing stores is among the latest victims of changing buyer habits. — Dreamstime/TNS PHILADELPHIA: In late April, struggling women's apparel chain Bebe said it was closing all 180 stores – the latest casualty amid a steady stream of defaults, bankruptcies and closures over the last year.  While experts say more closures are coming, something else is occurring: The losses of traditional retail jobs are being absorbed by the likes of Amazon, with its new fulfilment centres and warehouses.  But shopping is taking a new form, experts say, thanks to the Internet.  Michael Niemira, principal of the Retail Economist LLC, likened online shopping to the catalogue sales of the early 20th century that supplied goods to consumers in areas where stores did not exist.  "Today, some communities are losing stores that are not profitable, and the online distribution is filling the gap as catalogue sales once did," he said. The survivors will "stay alert to demographic and shopping trends" with fewer stores.  It's why Target Corp is going with smaller format stores while investing US$7bil (RM30.25bil) in new IT over the next three years.  And it's why megastore Wal-Mart went on a shopping spree, starting last year, to buy online firms, such as jet.com, to offset its weaknesses. Its latest target, reports suggest, is online men's fashion retailer Bonobos.  Digitally native brands, such as Away, Bonobos and Warby Parker, are creating a new kind of retail store, suggested David Bell, a marketing professor at the Wharton School.  It's a "zero inventory, high-experience store" in which customers enter an amazing space, get a brand experience and buy items that are shipped to them.  Information gathering and fulfilment used to occur under one roof, creating the need for large stores to hold all that inventory, Bell said.  But that model is fading. "Retail of the future will look more like a Tesla showroom than an old-school dealer lot, with 1,000 cars – except the one that you want – sitting out in the rain," Bell said.  The Philadelphia region's powerhouse King of Prussia Mall is expected to fare much better in the new world than its competitors on the lower end.  Still, David Simon, CEO of the mall's owner, Simon Property Group, stressed the need for change. "I'm hopeful that retailers will focus on improving their in-store experience, and that could be a lot of different ways," Simon told analysts earlier this year. "That could be through technology, that could be through a better look and feel."  Richard Hayne, CEO of Urban Outfitters Inc, said the US overbuilt retail space in much the way it did in housing.  Retail added too much space in the 1990s and early 2000s, creating "a bubble, and like housing, that bubble has now burst," he said in a March 2017 earnings call. "We are seeing the results; doors are shuttering and rents retreating."  Retail bankruptcies over the last 12 months are near recession levels, said RBC Capital Markets retail analyst Brian Tunick. These include BCBG, Payless, PacSun and department store closures (45 Macy's, 140 JC Penneys and 150 Kmart/Sears stores in fiscal 2017).  Yet there are hopeful pockets. Growing are value-oriented chains such as Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Ross, and TJX, owner of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, as well as beauty retailer Ulta.  Non-store retailers, such as Amazon, run establishments classified as distribution centres, and can augment their workforce with employees from temporary help agencies.  Amazon employs more than 7,500 full-time workers in New Jersey in seven fulfilment centres.  In Pennsylvania, the majority of warehouse jobs are in the Lehigh Valley to staff new facilities, according to commercial real estate firm CBRE Inc. Total warehouse jobs have spiked 38% over the last five years, reaching 75,354 last year, state records show.  The Philly region is perfect for distribution centres serving the East Coast, noted Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics Inc. Fulfilment jobs are helping offset store job losses, he said, "but will not be enough to make up for broader losses in the industry," as chains keep cutting stores and employees (Target, Kohl's) and robotics are introduced.  Perkins said retailers will need to step up their online game to compete with Amazon's coming one-hour delivery and its potent two-day Prime delivery (for paying members).  "Many chains are still taking four to seven days on delivery, which is way too long," Perkins said.  Amid the retail carnage, trendy eyewear company Warby Parker, which began online, has been adding stores aggressively. It now has 50 stores. The company said it will open 25 stores this year.  Mark Petrie, 50, of Lake George, New York, is a longtime Warby customer who knew what he wanted when he stepped into the downtown Philadelphia store on a recent Thursday: big, chunky glasses with black frames. He said he had "been online a million times but it's hard to try glasses on online."  "That's why having this store is so great," said Petrie, a real estate agent. "We don't have one in Lake George."  "I like instant, total gratification," he said.  And he got it. A pair of US$95 (RM410) Nash glasses with dark, tortoiseshell frames.  Then there's Rosemarie Monzo Mazzeo, a 46-year-old physician. She has bought more items online with Lilly Pulitzer over the last five years, especially on clothes she thinks will sell out. For other stuff, she visits the retailer at King of Prussia Mall.  The high-end women's clothier is adding four to six stores a year and is investing heavily on its website.  Fourth quarter sales – which included a significant increase in online sales – went up 26% in fiscal year 2016 over the previous year.  "It's like being in an adult candy store with all the beautiful colours and textures," Mazzeo said of each visit. "It's a fun experience and it's become a bonding experience between me and my daughter." — The Philadelphia Inquirer/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested French researchers find way to unlock WannaCry without ransom Piracy is theft The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Family forced to live under flyover Jang giving up LPGA membership, returning to Korean tour Dead and forgotten – hundreds die alone and unclaimed advertisement Latest News Google woos developers to catch Amazon in digital assistant race WannaCry attack is good business for cyber security firms Ex-IBM employee from China pleads guilty to code theft charges Amid industry pushback, China offers changes to cyber rules: sources Did your package get dumped in transit?

Sign Up Online Newspaper SectionsSubscribe Business Greuling: Plenty still succeeding in tough retail environment By JOHN GREULING - Will County Center for Economic DevelopmentMay 20, 2017 Caption John Greuling As many of our local municipal leaders and economic development officials wanting to recruit more retail development head off to Las Vegas this week to the annual real estate conference of the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), there is a rising concern about the state of the retail business sector in the region and across the country.  We have all been reading about the trials and tribulations of iconic retail giants like Sears and JC Penney. Locally, we have seen our share of retail closings (Sports Authority, K-Mart, HH Gregg, etc.). 2017 is shaping up to be the worst year for retail bankruptcies nationally since the Great Recession. The recent announcement that Joliet-based Central Grocers filed for bankruptcy protection, on the heels of two of their local affiliates, Certified Warehouse Foods and Ultra Foods, closing Joliet stores, is an indicator of major shifts in the sector. Competition from discount groceries, expanding demand for “gourmet” food products and online shopping were the reasons given by the company for the bankruptcy. There has been continued pressure on stores such as Macy’s, Target and even Walmart just to maintain market share, much less grow it. The impact of e-commerce (say “Amazon”) on bricks and mortar stores is hard to deny. In 2016, e-commerce sales represented 11.7 percent of all retail sales, an increase of 1.2 percent over 2015. Amazon alone represents over 3 percent of all retail sales in the country today and has grown by 25 percent annually over the last two years. Amazon’s impact in Will County has been off the charts: Three years ago, Amazon had zero employees in the county. When they open their fourth fulfillment center in Monee this October, they will have 6,000 full-time employees and be the largest employer in Will County by over 3,000 people. But e-commerce isn’t the only culprit. People are spending more money on data services (phone plans, Netflix), travel, entertainment and dining, and education. All of these impact the traditional retail spend. A change in the bankruptcy code itself over a decade ago has had a dramatic impact on Chapter 11 filings for retail concerns.  That change shortened the time a company has to restructure in bankruptcy to 210 days – seven months. Prior to 2005, it was not uncommon for bankruptcies to take 18 months or longer. This change has allowed suppliers, vendors and landlords to force companies into bankruptcy before they have had a chance to restructure. In the case of Central Grocers, it was pressure from their food suppliers to collect delinquent payments that precipitated the bankruptcy. The good news?  Despite some store closings and shifting demand, the retail sector in Will County continues to thrive.  Specialty grocers, furniture, dining, auto service and supply, personal care and fitness, and home improvement retailers catering to the needs of our local population are doing well.  Our regional malls, both in Joliet and Orland Park, are always near or at full occupancy. A new upscale retail/mixed use development, Rock Run Crossing, is being planned at the intersection of I-80 and I-55, the true crossroads of America.  As Will County continues to grow, adding residents and new jobs, we will remain attractive to new retail and commercial enterprises. It may look and feel different (smaller stores, more dining and entertainment) but it will continue to provide gathering places for people to shop and relax. It’s an important element of the quality of life Will County has to offer. • John Greuling is president and CEO of the Will County Center for Economic Development.

Jessica De Leon Bradenton Herald Verdict read in court Saturday afternoon after a jury found Andres "Andy" Avalos Jr. guilty in the Dec. 4, 2014, slayings of his wife, a neighbor and a local pastor. Jessica De Leon Bradenton Herald Crime May 20, 2017 2:28 PM Andres “Andy” Avalos Jr. found guilty of three murders — now faces death penalty or life in prison By Jessica De Leon jdeleon@bradenton.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Bradenton Andres “Andy” Avalos has been found guilty of three counts of murder in the Dec. 4, 2014, slayings of his wife Amber Avalos, 33; neighbor Denise Potter, 46; and the Rev. James “Tripp” Battle III, 31. The courtroom was calm after 13 hours of deliberations, and the jury delivered their verdict at 2 p.m. Saturday. Families of the three victims had waited for more than two years for justice. Battle’s wife, widow and other loved ones embraced one another quietly after the verdict was read. Potter’s aunt, Julie Konkol, said she was grateful that justice had been served not only for her niece but for Amber Avalos and Battle. “I pray that his children and the families of Denise and Rev. Potter find some sense of peace now that the jury found him guilty of these three horrendous murders,” she told the Bradenton Herald on Saturday. Avalos was found guilty of two first-degree counts of murder in the deaths of Potter and Battle. He was found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, Amber. He now faces the death penalty or life in prison. Avalos showed no emotion but drummed his fingers as the verdict was read. The jury — comprised of 12 jurors and two alternates — is no longer sequestered and will return at 8:30 a.m. Monday to begin the penalty phase. Amber Avalos returned to the couple’s home in the 1200 block of 67th Street Northwest in Bradenton from dropping off some of their children at school on the morning of Dec. 4, 2014, when the couple began to argue in the kitchen over his being out drinking the night before. Avalos became enraged when she told him that she was not afraid of him or to die. “I have never put my hands on that woman in 16 years,” Avalos later told lead homicide detectives Jeffrey Bliss and John Kenney following his arrest. “When I put my hands on her that was it.” He punched her multiple times and threw her on the floor of the laundry room. Avalos straddled her, kissed her on the forehead, said I love you and then strangled her with a wire before partially suspending her — wanting to “make sure” she was dead. Avalos went to get his .45 caliber pistol and returned to the laundry room — afraid that Amber might be playing dead — and shot her once. The couple’s then 4-year-old son was home playing video games when Amber Avalos and Potter were killed. He asked Avalos where his “mommy” was but saw only her feet when she lay dead in the laundry room. Related stories from the Bradenton Herald Andres "Andy" Avalos Jr. walks into courtroom Avalos told him it was time to go to school and was loading him into the couple’s gold 2003 Chevrolet Suburban when Potter showed up because she and Amber were scheduled to go clean a house together. “I knew she was going to call the cops, and I wasn’t ready for the police to come yet,” Avalos said. He followed Potter into the home, leaving his son in the Suburban. Potter, failing to find Amber in the bedroom, was headed down the hallway toward the laundry room, Avalos said. Avalos said he didn’t want Potter to see his dead wife, so he shot her in the hallway. “I don’t know how many times I shot her,” he said. Then Avalos took his son to the Happy Cubs Daycare, making sure to tell him he loved him on the way and becoming sad after saying goodbye to the boy, he said. He then headed out east, making a stop to see his cousins to tell them what he had done and that he loved them, he said. Avalos didn’t know if his cousins had believed him, but they had given him some money. He ended up leaving his vehicle at Walmart, knowing that soon enough law enforcement would be searching for it. “After what I did, I just wanted to sit in the back seat of a cab and relax,” Avalos said. When detectives asked him when he had formulated his plan to kill Battle, Avalos said, “Months,” and chuckled. At one point he said he vomited just outside the taxi cab because he had been drinking the night before. Avalos also admitted to using cocaine the day before the murders and taking a painkiller that morning for his hangover. The taxi dropped Avalos at a shopping center near Bayshore Baptist, and he read passages from his bible. He then waited, watching for Battle to arrive at the church, knowing that the pastor’s car was not there. After some time, however, Avalos decided to go into the church office and speak with Battle’s wife. But first he made a phone call to his uncle, Lt. Joel Perez, with the sheriff’s office. “I said hey, you need to go to my house, get your boys over there. There’s two people laying down over there,” Avalos said. The widow’s short but vivid recollection took the jurors to the grounds of the Bayshore Baptist Church, 6502 14th St. W., Bradenton, where Avalos shot his final victim. Joy Battle was working in the church office at about 12:45 p.m. when Avalos came in, she testified Wednesday. She sat with him as he began to share his suspicions that their spouses were having an affair with one another. During that time, her husband called and asked if everything was OK after learning Avalos was there. She said she didn’t know. Avalos had made the accusations months before that her husband was having an affair with Amber Avalos, Joy Battle said. But she had told him she had no reason to believe it and offered to pray with him. Her husband arrived at the church within minutes of their phone call, and Joy Battle recalled saying, “Andy, Tripp is here so you can talk to him now.” Avalos got up, walked out and closed the door behind him, she testified. Her husband was on the sidewalk as Avalos approached him. “He pulled a gun from behind his back and he shot him three times and he fell to the floor,” Battle’s widow said, her voice trembling. She began to cry. Joy Battle recalled her husband crying out in pain and her own screams, and she said she took a split second to decide whether to run to him or call 911. “I thought the best chance he had at living was if I called 911, so I went to my phone and called 911,” she said. “I was on the phone with 911, and Andy came back and shot him again.” Avalos walked away from the scene, contemplating “doing more things” like stealing a car or “going out with you guys in a blazing glory,” he later told Bliss and Kenney. Avalos decided otherwise and after seeing a deputy pass him along 14th Street, he quickly ducked into a nearby small wooded area where he would hide for the next two days, coming out only to buy Pringles, a soda and a beer. What ensued was a 51-hour manhunt led by the sheriff’s office to find Avalos — considered armed and dangerous at the time. The frantic search included an alert for Avalos’ gold 2003 Chevrolet Suburban — later found at the Walmart — and Palma Sola and Miller elementary schools, King Middle School and Manatee High School were locked down as deputies rushed to take custody of the Avalos’ children, fearing for their safety. Early on the morning of Dec. 6, 2014, Andres Avalos Sr. made a public plea at an impromptu press conference at the sheriff’s office. The elder Avalos pleaded that his son turn himself in for the sake of his six children, who were in protective custody at the time. A few hours later, the highly sought suspect walked onto the wooden deck behind a mobile home in the Pine Haven Mobile Home Park, 6320 14th St. W., just a couple of blocks from the Bayshore Baptist Church. At about 1 p.m., Melissa and Jerry Hamilton — who lived in Pine Haven — were singing Christian hymns in preparation for a function at their church that evening. Melissa stood in the kitchen, and Jerry sat in the living room as he began to sing the popular Christian song, “I Can Only Imagine,” she recalled for the jury. Suddenly through the sliding glass door, she saw Avalos walk onto their wooden deck. “Can I help you?” she said to Avalos. They called 911 and left their home as instructed by a dispatcher. News quickly broke that Avalos was captured after a caravan of deputies and detectives screeched down U.S. 41 to the mobile home — a sign many hoped that Avalos had finally been located. Deputies and detectives drew their guns and semiautomatic rifles, held up their shields as residents of the quiet mobile home park watched in shock. Avalos was arrested without resisting. Avalos was quickly taken to the sheriff’s office headquarters. In the hours that followed, he would give Bliss and Kenney his detailed confession which a jury watched for about 90 minutes Tuesday afternoon. On Monday, the state will present testimony and evidence to support their aggravating factors needed as they seek the death penalty. The defense will present their own case in support of their mitigating circumstances in their attempts to get Avalos life in prison.

(Mike Coppola/Getty Images) Confidential NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday, May 20, 2017, 6:00 PM Tracy Morgan had a tough road when it came to recovering from the traumatic brain injury he suffered in a 2014 highway accident: he had to regain his memory, he had to learn to walk again. He had to go without sex. “That was the hard part!” he exclaims. “Oh my God! My wife, she’s pregnant with triplets right now! My sperm came out wearing a cape!” He must have felt like a born-again virgin when it was time to get back down the business, we noted. “Oh yeah — I even took my wife to my old high school and had her in the staircase,” he joked. Tracy Morgan keeps sex life hot by dressing up as Rob Kardashian At least we think he was joking. Either way, Morgan is back in action, with a new Netflix special, "Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive." In the show he riffs about the road back after the accident, in which a Walmart truck struck the limo he and a few other comics were riding in, killing his friend Jimmy Mack and putting Morgan into an eight-day coma. The Brooklyn native is also set to star in a new comedy series created by Jordan Peele for TBS, about a convict who comes back to a gentrified Brooklyn after a 15-year prison bid. Was the comedy special a hard project to work on, given the trauma he was revisiting? “No!” he exclaims. “Because I'd done with it. I'd done crying about it.” Walmart reimbursed in lawsuit with comedian Tracy Morgan A moment later, Morgan allowed that he's still struggling, and “crying in my heart for Jimmy.” “I still get depressed, I still get upset. I still go through stuff. But I can't sit around thinking about it. I got a young daughter, I got a wife, I got sons. I got a life! Thats not my world, that's not my life. I ain't gonna give Walmart that much!” And he said, he has a powerful ally: “The good will and the love out there in the world for me. I feel it every day now. The most important thing for me is just to give it back.” He also intends to shop at Walmart again. "Can't beat their prices," he joked.

Updated 6 hours ago The editorial “Another climate change canard: Warmed-over PR” would have been more persuasive with a wider and more timely perspective. Today, it is impossible to find any organization in the world representing active scientists doing current research published in peer-reviewed journals that rejects the connection between human-caused carbon dioxide and climate change. But major organizations in other disciplines have joined the call for policy action, such as the National League of Cities, the American College of Physicians and the American Society of Civil Engineers, among many others. In March, the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, representing more than half of the nation's doctors, called on health care professionals to save lives by advocating for climate change policy action. In the business world, corporate giants are committing to serious reductions in their operational emissions — companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsico, Walmart, Target, Nike, Apple, Google, Ford, GM, General Mills, Cargill, Kellogg's, Mars and Unilever. On Jan. 12, Ceres.org published a letter to President-elect Trump titled “630 Companies and Investors Tell Washington: Continue Accelerating the Low-Carbon Economy.” Letter signatories, including DuPont, Monsanto, Johnson & Johnson, Campbell Soup and Hewlitt-Packard, are all on board with the scientists.

(AP Photo/Christopher Sherman) REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) — Waving arms and brandishing a long electric prod, the ranch hands and truck drivers herd about 400 leggy calves onto trucks as the sun crests on the outskirts of this border city. After spending their first eight months on the ranches of Gildardo Lopez Hinojosa, the calves are about to cross the border — bound for Texas and U.S. feed lots beyond. On one of the three bridges connecting Reynosa with Texas, they might cross paths with the beef and chicken shipments that Lopez imports from the U.S. for his local chains of butcher shops and fried chicken restaurants. He gets the best price for his calves in the U.S. and it's cheaper for him to import U.S. chicken than ship Mexican chicken from the country's interior. Lopez has been selling calves and buying beef across the border for about as long as the North American Free Trade Agreement has been in effect. President Donald Trump has said the agreement that is the basis for much of the $500 billion annual trade between the U.S. and Mexico needs to be renegotiated or scrapped entirely. To hear him tell it, NAFTA was "a catastrophic trade deal for the United States." The reality is far more complicated, especially at the border where communities are enmeshed in a shared economy that can be affected by actions or words in either country. "It's a lie to say that NAFTA didn't work," said Rafael Garduno Rivera, an economist at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching in Aguascalientes, who studies the agreement's impacts. "It worked and worked very well and for both sides in various areas. Like everything there were losers and winners." Maquiladoras, as Mexican assembly plants are known, get most of the attention. They churn out everything from flat-screen televisions and washing machines to auto components that might cross borders a dozen times before a car comes off the assembly line in Michigan. But U.S. border retailers — downtown discount stores and high-end outlet shopping and malls — also depend on Mexican shoppers, especially those whose jobs in Mexican border cities allow them to shop in the U.S. For nearly 25 years, Lopez has been sending cows to the U.S. and importing beef to Mexico. Three days a week he loads four to six trailers with his young cows and sends them across the bridge connecting to Pharr, Texas. Once cleared by USDA veterinarians there, buyers from elsewhere in Texas, Arizona or even up toward the Canadian border pick up their cows. After that initial sale, Lopez does not know where they go. In theory, some could come back to him mixed in among the 25 tons of beef he imports from the U.S. every week for his butcher shops. He buys from the big beef processors like IBP, National Beef and Supreme Beef, wherever he finds the best price. Lopez's calves create jobs in U.S. feed lots and slaughterhouses and the cheaper U.S. chicken he buys allows him to employ more Mexicans in his restaurants. Among his various businesses he employs about 400 people. Nearly 5 million U.S. jobs depend on trade between the two countries, according to a study released last fall by the non-partisan Washington, D.C.-based Wilson Center Mexico Institute. "The United States depends on Mexico as much as Mexico depends on the United States," Lopez said. Monica Weisberg-Stewart, across the border in McAllen, Texas, knows that as well as anyone. Her family ran discount stores on the border for more than 60 years, before making the business decision a couple years ago to close. Now Weisberg-Stewart leases their properties to other businesses. The border economy is so interconnected that moves in either country can have dire consequences. As an example, she recalled when the U.S. began requiring a new, more expensive visa for Mexicans who crossed to U.S. border cities. "It wiped out a socio-economic group that would come over here on a daily basis for groceries, milk, products, just their daily goods," she said. "Mexico not coming, Mexico not shopping, affects us." Border residents on both sides say that is already happening. A weaker Mexican peso has been a principal factor, but the unwelcoming rhetoric and fear of the sort of reception they will receive has been another. Several hundred miles upriver from Reynosa, Lidia Gonzalez sat in the shade of El Porvenir, Mexico's town square selling used clothing purchased in El Paso. "It's all second hand because people can't buy new," Gonzalez said. "It's OK for us, because from that we eat." But she was anxious because her supplier had cut back her buying trips recently. She said Mexican customs officials suddenly began hassling the buyer about her purchases, something Gonzalez attributed to the generally deteriorating relations between the two countries.

Gonzalez has a visa that allows her to cross, but the last time she felt U.S. immigration agents were interrogating her more than usual. For now she has stopped crossing out of fear they might take her visa. Just west of El Paso, Marisela Sandoval, 39, of Sunland Park, New Mexico, said she had seen fewer border crossers like Gonzalez at her job at a Wal-Mart. Sandoval said Mexican shoppers were fewer and consequently sales this year in the store where she works had been way off. "Because of the dollar and the feelings about Trump, what he was saying," Sandoval explained. "People were getting afraid because in the bridge they were making them sign a paper that would say that they would take their visa and they were afraid to even come." The weaker Mexican peso put an end to Gilberto Lozoya's shopping trips to Laredo, Texas. Lozoya, 24, has spent four years working in maquiladoras in Nuevo Laredo, a major trade thoroughfare to the United States. He now works as an engineer supporting assembly lines producing gas valves, thermostats and other products so they keep running, but he's ambitious and hopes to advance. At night he studies English, because it would help him move up the ladder at so many foreign-owned maquiladoras, including the Illinois-headquartered engineering and manufacturing firm Robertshaw, where he works now. He used to cross to Laredo to buy school supplies that he couldn't find. But the strong dollar put such purchases out of reach. Many maquila workers making only $50 to $60 for a six-day work week rely on a few hours of daily overtime to make ends meet, he said. If something happened to the maquila jobs, Lozoya said he worries the unemployed would fill the ranks of the drug cartel that controls Nuevo Laredo. But nothing is clear at the moment, he said. "So far we don't know what situation we're in and what this new president (Trump) is going to say that could affect us." Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Business Nation & World Complex world of border trade: Cattle go north, meat south Originally published May 21, 2017 at 9:05 pm Updated May 22, 2017 at 12:00 am Share story By CHRISTOPHER SHERMAN The Associated Press REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) — Waving arms and brandishing a long electric prod, the ranch hands and truck drivers herd about 400 leggy calves onto trucks as the sun crests on the outskirts of this border city. After spending their first eight months on the ranches of Gildardo Lopez Hinojosa, the calves are about to cross the border — bound for Texas and U.S. feed lots beyond. On one of the three bridges connecting Reynosa with Texas, they might cross paths with the beef and chicken shipments that Lopez imports from the U.S. for his local chains of butcher shops and fried chicken restaurants. He gets the best price for his calves in the U.S. and it’s cheaper for him to import U.S. chicken than ship Mexican chicken from the country’s interior. Lopez has been selling calves and buying beef across the border for about as long as the North American Free Trade Agreement has been in effect. President Donald Trump has said the agreement that is the basis for much of the $500 billion annual trade between the U.S. and Mexico needs to be renegotiated or scrapped entirely. To hear him tell it, NAFTA was “a catastrophic trade deal for the United States.” The reality is far more complicated, especially at the border where communities are enmeshed in a shared economy that can be affected by actions or words in either country. Most Read Stories Seahawk Michael Bennett escalates criticism of ESPN's Stephen A. Smith Student’s pregnancy tests a Christian school’s values What drivers can and cannot do under Washington state's new distracted-driving law Why the obituary for Eudocia Tomas Pulido didn’t tell the story of her life in slavery Seahawks’ Michael Bennett does great things, but why the immaturity?Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. “It’s a lie to say that NAFTA didn’t work,” said Rafael Garduno Rivera, an economist at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching in Aguascalientes, who studies the agreement’s impacts. “It worked and worked very well and for both sides in various areas. Like everything there were losers and winners.” Maquiladoras, as Mexican assembly plants are known, get most of the attention. They churn out everything from flat-screen televisions and washing machines to auto components that might cross borders a dozen times before a car comes off the assembly line in Michigan. But U.S. border retailers — downtown discount stores and high-end outlet shopping and malls — also depend on Mexican shoppers, especially those whose jobs in Mexican border cities allow them to shop in the U.S. For nearly 25 years, Lopez has been sending cows to the U.S. and importing beef to Mexico. Three days a week he loads four to six trailers with his young cows and sends them across the bridge connecting to Pharr, Texas. Once cleared by USDA veterinarians there, buyers from elsewhere in Texas, Arizona or even up toward the Canadian border pick up their cows. After that initial sale, Lopez does not know where they go. In theory, some could come back to him mixed in among the 25 tons of beef he imports from the U.S. every week for his butcher shops. He buys from the big beef processors like IBP, National Beef and Supreme Beef, wherever he finds the best price. Lopez’s calves create jobs in U.S. feed lots and slaughterhouses and the cheaper U.S. chicken he buys allows him to employ more Mexicans in his restaurants. Among his various businesses he employs about 400 people. Nearly 5 million U.S. jobs depend on trade between the two countries, according to a study released last fall by the non-partisan Washington, D.C.-based Wilson Center Mexico Institute. “The United States depends on Mexico as much as Mexico depends on the United States,” Lopez said. Monica Weisberg-Stewart, across the border in McAllen, Texas, knows that as well as anyone. Her family ran discount stores on the border for more than 60 years, before making the business decision a couple years ago to close. Now Weisberg-Stewart leases their properties to other businesses. The border economy is so interconnected that moves in either country can have dire consequences. As an example, she recalled when the U.S. began requiring a new, more expensive visa for Mexicans who crossed to U.S. border cities. “It wiped out a socio-economic group that would come over here on a daily basis for groceries, milk, products, just their daily goods,” she said. “Mexico not coming, Mexico not shopping, affects us.” Border residents on both sides say that is already happening. A weaker Mexican peso has been a principal factor, but the unwelcoming rhetoric and fear of the sort of reception they will receive has been another. Several hundred miles upriver from Reynosa, Lidia Gonzalez sat in the shade of El Porvenir, Mexico’s town square selling used clothing purchased in El Paso. “It’s all second hand because people can’t buy new,” Gonzalez said. “It’s OK for us, because from that we eat.” But she was anxious because her supplier had cut back her buying trips recently. She said Mexican customs officials suddenly began hassling the buyer about her purchases, something Gonzalez attributed to the generally deteriorating relations between the two countries. Gonzalez has a visa that allows her to cross, but the last time she felt U.S. immigration agents were interrogating her more than usual. For now she has stopped crossing out of fear they might take her visa. Just west of El Paso, Marisela Sandoval, 39, of Sunland Park, New Mexico, said she had seen fewer border crossers like Gonzalez at her job at a Wal-Mart. Sandoval said Mexican shoppers were fewer and consequently sales this year in the store where she works had been way off. “Because of the dollar and the feelings about Trump, what he was saying,” Sandoval explained. “People were getting afraid because in the bridge they were making them sign a paper that would say that they would take their visa and they were afraid to even come.” The weaker Mexican peso put an end to Gilberto Lozoya’s shopping trips to Laredo, Texas. Lozoya, 24, has spent four years working in maquiladoras in Nuevo Laredo, a major trade thoroughfare to the United States. He now works as an engineer supporting assembly lines producing gas valves, thermostats and other products so they keep running, but he’s ambitious and hopes to advance. At night he studies English, because it would help him move up the ladder at so many foreign-owned maquiladoras, including the Illinois-headquartered engineering and manufacturing firm Robertshaw, where he works now. He used to cross to Laredo to buy school supplies that he couldn’t find. But the strong dollar put such purchases out of reach. Many maquila workers making only $50 to $60 for a six-day work week rely on a few hours of daily overtime to make ends meet, he said. If something happened to the maquila jobs, Lozoya said he worries the unemployed would fill the ranks of the drug cartel that controls Nuevo Laredo. But nothing is clear at the moment, he said. “So far we don’t know what situation we’re in and what this new president (Trump) is going to say that could affect us.” CHRISTOPHER SHERMAN Next Story Schools using smart phone technology against sex assaults Previous Story AP Source: Ford replaces CEO in push to transform business Contact Newsroom staff list FAQ Contact form About the company Seattle Restaurant Week Newspapers in Education Fund for the Needy Employment Historical Archives Pulitzers Company information Permissions Seattle Times Store Advertise Classifieds Autos Homes Obituary Jobs Media Kit Advertise with Us Subscriber Services Subscribe Activate Account Manage Subscription Place Temporary Hold Report Delivery Issue Make a Payment Print Replica Today’s Front Page Facebook Twitter RSS Feeds Newsletters Mobile Apps Subscribe Copyright © 2017 The Seattle Times Company | Privacy statement | Terms of service Get our Morning Brief delivered to your inbox.

After spending their first eight months on the ranches of Gildardo Lopez Hinojosa, the calves are about to cross the border — bound for Texas and U.S. feed lots beyond. On one of the three bridges connecting Reynosa with Texas, they might cross paths with the beef and chicken shipments that Lopez imports from the U.S. for his local chains of butcher shops and fried chicken restaurants. He gets the best price for his calves in the U.S. and it’s cheaper for him to import U.S. chicken than ship Mexican chicken from the country’s interior. Lopez has been selling calves and buying beef across the border for about as long as the North American Free Trade Agreement has been in effect. President Donald Trump has said the agreement that is the basis for much of the $500 billion annual trade between the U.S. and Mexico needs to be renegotiated or scrapped entirely. To hear him tell it, NAFTA was “a catastrophic trade deal for the United States.” The reality is far more complicated, especially at the border where communities are enmeshed in a shared economy that can be affected by actions or words in either country. The Pentagon may be shopping with you on Amazon Advertisement “It’s a lie to say that NAFTA didn’t work,” said Rafael Garduno Rivera, an economist at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching in Aguascalientes, who studies the agreement’s impacts. “It worked and worked very well and for both sides in various areas. Like everything there were losers and winners.” Maquiladoras, as Mexican assembly plants are known, get most of the attention. They churn out everything from flat-screen televisions and washing machines to auto components that might cross borders a dozen times before a car comes off the assembly line in Michigan. But U.S. border retailers — downtown discount stores and high-end outlet shopping and malls — also depend on Mexican shoppers, especially those whose jobs in Mexican border cities allow them to shop in the U.S. For nearly 25 years, Lopez has been sending cows to the U.S. and importing beef to Mexico. Three days a week he loads four to six trailers with his young cows and sends them across the bridge connecting to Pharr, Texas. Once cleared by USDA veterinarians there, buyers from elsewhere in Texas, Arizona or even up toward the Canadian border pick up their cows. After that initial sale, Lopez does not know where they go. In theory, some could come back to him mixed in among the 25 tons of beef he imports from the U.S. every week for his butcher shops. He buys from the big beef processors like IBP, National Beef and Supreme Beef, wherever he finds the best price. Lopez’s calves create jobs in U.S. feed lots and slaughterhouses and the cheaper U.S. chicken he buys allows him to employ more Mexicans in his restaurants. Among his various businesses he employs about 400 people. More continuing resolutions likely through FY2019 Nearly 5 million U.S. jobs depend on trade between the two countries, according to a study released last fall by the non-partisan Washington, D.C.-based Wilson Center Mexico Institute. “The United States depends on Mexico as much as Mexico depends on the United States,” Lopez said. Monica Weisberg-Stewart, across the border in McAllen, Texas, knows that as well as anyone. Her family ran discount stores on the border for more than 60 years, before making the business decision a couple years ago to close. Now Weisberg-Stewart leases their properties to other businesses. The border economy is so interconnected that moves in either country can have dire consequences. As an example, she recalled when the U.S. began requiring a new, more expensive visa for Mexicans who crossed to U.S. border cities. “It wiped out a socio-economic group that would come over here on a daily basis for groceries, milk, products, just their daily goods,” she said. “Mexico not coming, Mexico not shopping, affects us.” Border residents on both sides say that is already happening. A weaker Mexican peso has been a principal factor, but the unwelcoming rhetoric and fear of the sort of reception they will receive has been another. Several hundred miles upriver from Reynosa, Lidia Gonzalez sat in the shade of El Porvenir, Mexico’s town square selling used clothing purchased in El Paso. “It’s all second hand because people can’t buy new,” Gonzalez said. “It’s OK for us, because from that we eat.” But she was anxious because her supplier had cut back her buying trips recently. She said Mexican customs officials suddenly began hassling the buyer about her purchases, something Gonzalez attributed to the generally deteriorating relations between the two countries. Gonzalez has a visa that allows her to cross, but the last time she felt U.S. immigration agents were interrogating her more than usual. For now she has stopped crossing out of fear they might take her visa. Just west of El Paso, Marisela Sandoval, 39, of Sunland Park, New Mexico, said she had seen fewer border crossers like Gonzalez at her job at a Wal-Mart. Sandoval said Mexican shoppers were fewer and consequently sales this year in the store where she works had been way off. “Because of the dollar and the feelings about Trump, what he was saying,” Sandoval explained. “People were getting afraid because in the bridge they were making them sign a paper that would say that they would take their visa and they were afraid to even come.” The weaker Mexican peso put an end to Gilberto Lozoya’s shopping trips to Laredo, Texas. Lozoya, 24, has spent four years working in maquiladoras in Nuevo Laredo, a major trade thoroughfare to the United States. He now works as an engineer supporting assembly lines producing gas valves, thermostats and other products so they keep running, but he’s ambitious and hopes to advance. At night he studies English, because it would help him move up the ladder at so many foreign-owned maquiladoras, including the Illinois-headquartered engineering and manufacturing firm Robertshaw, where he works now. He used to cross to Laredo to buy school supplies that he couldn’t find. But the strong dollar put such purchases out of reach. Many maquila workers making only $50 to $60 for a six-day work week rely on a few hours of daily overtime to make ends meet, he said. If something happened to the maquila jobs, Lozoya said he worries the unemployed would fill the ranks of the drug cartel that controls Nuevo Laredo. But nothing is clear at the moment, he said. “So far we don’t know what situation we’re in and what this new president (Trump) is going to say that could affect us.” Related Topics Business News Government News Lifestyle News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Government News » Complex world of border… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Top Stories House GOP presses for civil service changes, as President's 2018 proposals emerge Top Story AP FACT CHECK: Trump claims unearned exoneration on Russia Government News Congress should be more aggressive in tracking down agency inefficiencies, GAO says Management Cautious optimism surrounds Thornberry’s defense acquisition bill Acquisition Federal pay debate heads back to Capitol Hill this week Pay & Benefits Fed Photo of the Day Pennsylvania National Guard completes challenging obstacle course Today in History 2009: CDC briefs public on H1N1 flu outbreak THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN TICKER May 19, 2017 Close Change YTD L Income 18.8743 0.0272 2.24% L 2020 25.4849 0.0713 3.69% L 2030 28.3983 0.1247 5.24% L 2040 30.5784 0.1574 6.00% L 2050 17.5334 0.1025 6.69% G Fund 15.3241 0.0010 0.78% F Fund 17.8378 -0.0067 1.75% C Fund 33.1090 0.2235 7.16% S Fund 42.7394 0.3045 5.78% I Fund 27.9748 0.2088 10.16% Closing price updated at approx 6pm EST. each business day.

Curtain Call Is Latest Victory For Animal Welfare Activists By Greg Allen • 8 hours ago TweetShareGoogle+Email View Slideshow 1 of 3 Protesters with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), including a costumed tiger, gathered at City Hall in Los Angeles last year to call on the city to prohibit circuses from using tigers, lions, and other wild animals in their acts. Circuse View Slideshow 2 of 3 SeaWorld ended its long-running killer whale show after criticism that the whales suffered and became violent in captivity. View Slideshow 3 of 3 A pamphlet showing an image of Cecil the lion at a vigil in central London last year. After Cecil was killed by an American dentist and trophy hunter in Zimbabwe, the lion's story went viral online. Listen Listening... / Listen to the Story When Feld Entertainment, owners of Ringling Bros., announced it's cancelling the circus after nearly 150 years, it was one of the biggest victories yet for animal welfare activists. How the circus treats it animals — especially elephants and big cats — has long been a focus for groups like the Humane Society of the U.S and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They see it as part of a larger change going on in this country — about how Americans view animals and the way we treat them. If you've gone to the circus in recent years, you probably saw them. At one protest outside the Ringling Brothers circus in Phoenix earlier this year, people shouted "Boycott the circus." PETA was founded in 1980 and "Ringling Brothers was a target of ours from the very beginning," said Lisa Lange, senior vice president of communications. She believes the protests played a key role in changing public attitudes about the circus. In announcing the end, Feld Entertainment chairman Kenneth Feld acknowledged the decades of conflict with animal welfare groups. But he said the decision was made because of declining attendance and a change in public taste. "Yes, people no longer have a taste for that kind of entertainment," Lange said. "But we believe it's because they now know what that kind of entertainment costs those animals." The demise of the Ringling Brothers circus comes just months after SeaWorld agreed to stop breeding its captive orcas and to move away from its signature theatrical shows. Around the same time, the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced it was closing its dolphin exhibit and would move its dolphins to an ocean sanctuary. "It's happening across the economy. It's happening across our culture," said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society. He believes a major change is going on in how Americans view animal welfare issues. "We're really seeing a rising tide of consciousness when it comes to the treatment of animals." Animal welfare groups have seen success in many other areas as well. In the last few years, major pork producers have eliminated confinement pens for pregnant sows. Egg producers have also begun getting rid of cages for their chickens. Pacelle says some of this has been accomplished through legislation. In other cases, change has been pushed by retailers like McDonald's and Wal-Mart. "In most cases, companies are now adapting," he said. "They're simply changing the way they do business to reflect a growing consciousness about animals and wringing the animal cruelty out of the business model." Lisa Lange of PETA says after decades of working on animal rights, she believes the movement has finally hit the mainstream. She believes a major factor is the power of social media. We have the ability to show people a video of elephants for example being beaten behind the scenes at a Ringling Brothers performance. And we put that up on our Facebook page, Instagram, we tweet it out. And millions of people see that video within hours. Pacelle cites a powerful example — the death of Cecil the lion. For years, the Humane Society worked to stop trophy hunting of lions, elephants and other big game with limited success. But two years ago, when a Minnesota dentist killed a lion in Zimbabwe named Cecil, the story went viral. One brave Zimbabwean activist got a hold of the image of the grinning hunters over the slain lion and, within 24 hours, more than a billion people had seen it. Soon, all the major air carriers had agreed to ban shipment of lion, elephant, rhino and other large animal trophies worldwide. Pacelle believes concern about animal welfare is now a value shared by all Americans. The question is what that will mean next for agriculture, entertainment, research, and other fields in which animals play a role. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

Today, Xbox Wire revealed that the new promotion will be live on a few of its 1TB bundles like Xbox One S Halo Wars 2 Bundle, Xbox One S Battlefield 1 Special Edition Bundle, and the Xbox One S Gears of War 4 Bundle. While these bundles can be purchased directly from the Microsoft Store, they can also be purchased at other retailers like Amazon, Target, GameStop, Best Buy, and Walmart. If those bundles above aren't to your liking or the price point is still a bit high, you can always settle for the Xbox One S Minecraft Favorites Bundle with 500GB of storage for $249. While the price of the various Xbox consoles bundles might be tempting, it might be a better decision to wait it out until June 11, when Microsoft will announce more details about its next console at E3 2017.

Morgan, 48, also joked about celebrating his return to conjugal fitness like it was his first time, by getting busy on a staircase in his old high school. Tracy Morgan said the hardest part of recovering from his 2014 auto accident was having to abstain from conjugal activity with his wife, Megan Wollover The comedian, who celebrates his second wedding anniversary to Megan Wollover this summer, seems to be making a running joke out of the possibility of welcoming additional kids to his current brood. On May 11, Vulture ran a story in which Morgan, while promoting the May 16 release of his Netflix special, 'Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive,' stated that the next thing he intended to tackle on his bucket list was to 'go impregnate my wife tonight.'  'I'm old school.

Circuses have been a target of PETA since it was founded in 1980. Richard Vogel/AP Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook When Feld Entertainment, owners of Ringling Bros., announced it's cancelling the circus after nearly 150 years, it was one of the biggest victories yet for animal welfare activists. How the circus treats it animals — especially elephants and big cats — has long been a focus for groups like the Humane Society of the U.S and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They see it as part of a larger change going on in this country — about how Americans view animals and the way we treat them. If you've gone to the circus in recent years, you probably saw them. At one protest outside the Ringling Brothers circus in Phoenix earlier this year, people shouted "Boycott the circus." PETA was founded in 1980 and "Ringling Brothers was a target of ours from the very beginning," said Lisa Lange, senior vice president of communications. She believes the protests played a key role in changing public attitudes about the circus. In announcing the end, Feld Entertainment chairman Kenneth Feld acknowledged the decades of conflict with animal welfare groups. But he said the decision was made because of declining attendance and a change in public taste. "Yes, people no longer have a taste for that kind of entertainment," Lange said. "But we believe it's because they now know what that kind of entertainment costs those animals." The demise of the Ringling Brothers circus comes just months after SeaWorld agreed to stop breeding its captive orcas and to move away from its signature theatrical shows. Around the same time, the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced it was closing its dolphin exhibit and would move its dolphins to an ocean sanctuary. "It's happening across the economy. It's happening across our culture," said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society. He believes a major change is going on in how Americans view animal welfare issues. "We're really seeing a rising tide of consciousness when it comes to the treatment of animals." Animal welfare groups have seen success in many other areas as well. In the last few years, major pork producers have eliminated confinement pens for pregnant sows. Egg producers have also begun getting rid of cages for their chickens. Pacelle says some of this has been accomplished through legislation. In other cases, change has been pushed by retailers like McDonald's and Wal-Mart. "In most cases, companies are now adapting," he said. "They're simply changing the way they do business to reflect a growing consciousness about animals and wringing the animal cruelty out of the business model." Lisa Lange of PETA says after decades of working on animal rights, she believes the movement has finally hit the mainstream. She believes a major factor is the power of social media. "We have the ability to show people a video of elephants for example being beaten behind the scenes at a Ringling Brothers performance. And we put that up on our Facebook page, Instagram, we tweet it out. And millions of people see that video within hours." Pacelle cites a powerful example — the death of Cecil the lion. For years, the Humane Society worked to stop trophy hunting of lions, elephants and other big game with limited success. But two years ago, when a Minnesota dentist killed a lion in Zimbabwe named Cecil, the story went viral. One brave Zimbabwean activist got a hold of the image of the grinning hunters over the slain lion and, within 24 hours, more than a billion people had seen it. Soon, all the major air carriers had agreed to ban shipment of lion, elephant, rhino and other large animal trophies worldwide. Pacelle believes concern about animal welfare is now a value shared by all Americans. The question is what that will mean next for agriculture, entertainment, research, and other fields in which animals play a role. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

The juror was allowed to stay on the Jackson County panel that ultimately last month cleared Jacob Ewing of charges of aggravated indecent liberties and aggravated criminal sodomy with a child younger than 14 years old, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. The newspaper said it has obtained unsealed transcripts of a closed-door meeting with the judge in which a special prosecutor, Jacqie Spradling, voiced concerns about the juror and the trial's setting in Holton, a 3,300-resident town divided by allegations against Ewing. At issue were posts by the juror's husband on a Facebook page dedicated to Holton, with the husband questioning the accuser's age — she was 13 at the time of the alleged attack in 2014 — and describing the trial as a "witch hunt." When confronted about that during the private meeting with the judge April 20 before deliberations, the juror denied discussing the case with her spouse and said his feelings about Ewing's guilt or innocence wouldn't compromise her impartiality, the transcripts show. She called herself "a very independent thinker," and said, "I apologize for my husband." "It's not like we're deciding whether to have turkey or ham for Thanksgiving, you know. It's a very serious, serious matter," the transcripts quote her as saying. But the juror also admitted she didn't want to be on the panel, fearing Holton run-ins with people involved in the case. "Because it's just a high-profile case and, regardless of which way it goes, who wants to go to Wal-Mart and run into, you know, the victims' advocates or, opposite end, the defendant's family?" the transcript quotes her as saying. "You know, it's just not something that's going to be comfortable." Spradling unsuccessfully asked that the woman be replaced, citing the juror's reluctance to serve and her contemplation of avoiding public places. Ewing remains jailed, awaiting more sex crime-related trials scheduled for June, August and October. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

I have to admit, I'm NOT shocked by how Holtonites have recently presented themselves to the outside world. WHY? I replaced a 7-12th grade teacher in a KS HS (1/2 of a 1A district). That teacher had sexual relations with girls as young as 7th grade; and hosted parties with alcohol, The county attorney threatened charges unless the teacher left. He did so, and moved to the county seat. During my year of teaching, a school board members' sophomore son was having sexual relations with the teacher's 7th grade partner; only now she was in 8th. In my interview, the USD Super had told me about the parties & alcohol. As far as I could discern, everyone in town was aware of the teacher's sexual predation on students. 0 Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Sign in to comment Login/Signup loading...

Morris May 21, 2017 Between 6 million and 7.5 million retail industry jobs are vulnerable to automation within ten years, according to an exhaustive study released this week. The report, by Cornerstone Capital Group, concluded that the jobs of as many as 47% of the 16 million Americans currently working in retail could be made redundant by highly-automated e-commerce and other innovations. In-store roles most vulnerable to automation include cashiers and order clerks while salespeople and freight handlers are slightly less exposed. Jobs that require a personal touch like store greeters would also be insulated from direct replacement by robots or apps. But increasing competitive pressure could still make such jobs too expensive for stores to justify. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Cornerstone’s study points out that while sales roles are just as likely to be filled by women as men, 73% of retail cashiers are women—and that job is considered “one of the most easily automatable” in the entire economy. Amazon, for instance, is developing a convenience store format called Amazon Go that has no cashiers. The plan is for sensors and intelligent vision to automatically detect what customers have in their carts and then bill them when they walk out the door. But details are still being kept under wraps, and in March, Amazon delayed the store's opening while it hones the technology. Cornerstone lays out two strategies retailers can take in dealing with the shifting landscape—what could be termed as the low road and the high road. Lower-end retailers can use technology to increase convenience and volume, while high-end shops should focus on technology that enhances the customer experience. If more retailers ultimately focus on using technology to support highly skilled workers and enhance service, it may mean fewer layoffs and even higher pay for staffers. For more about Walmart, watch: That’s essentially the split that strategy expert Howard Yu laid out in a recent piece for Fortune, citing the Apple Store’s amazing customer service and mobile card-swipe machines as an example of the high-end approach most likely to preserve jobs. But the recent struggles of department stores like Macy’s, which have long focused on customer experience and good service, calls into question just how broadly applicable that model might be. Meanwhile, stores at the lower end of the market are more likely to use technology to eliminate workers, with serious consequences for smaller U.S. cities. Wal-Mart, for instance, has a 25% share of the retail market in U.S. cities with populations under 500,000, suggesting major consequences if it automated a high proportion of jobs. And of course, predictions about retail automation have fallen short before. Grocery stores began aggressively pursuing self-checkout in the early 2000s, but the technology proved unwieldy and frustrating for customers. Fifteen years later, self-checkout takes up a few lanes at most in any store.

Yes, he was a complete, disgusting sexist pig. Yes, he did enormous damage to the women at Fox News, and created an atmosphere there which encouraged and allowed other piggish men there to do the same. However, the bottom line is that however deeply flawed and disgusting, he was still a human being. This guy wasn’t Stalin or Lenin or Hitler or Pol Pot or Assad or some other mass murderer or serial killer. Ailes most likely damaged and/or destroyed some women’s careers by his pigdom, which is really bad. But he’s dead now. When I was young, I had too many terrible encounters with men just like Ailes in positions of authority in various workplaces. Yep, it was to varying degrees a nightmare. It’s terrible, not okay, and beyond shocking the degree to which it is still going on so rampantly these days. Stasi even takes a potshot at Ailes’ wife who said she loved him. Even though he was a pig at work, and possibly elsewhere, this woman claims he had been a good husband. That could be true. This whole gross scandal destroyed that marriage and left him living alone, and his wife living through this hell on her own, too. Can’t Stasi at least have the decency to leave that woman alone right now? Guess not. Alice Tomlin Respect the dead Hixson, Tenn.: I was born in New York and lived in New York for 55 years and now live in Tennessee. I miss New York. That’s why I still read the Daily News. I feel very strongly for women’s rights as I have found myself being treated poorly in the working establishment in my lifetime. As for Roger Ailes, I agree that his approach with women was terrible and my sympathies go out to them. However, I do take exception to Linda Stasi’s column about Ailes’ death. If not out of respect for the dead, she could have at least shown some to his family. I found her article to be extremely in bad taste. Let us hope when her time comes she will not be subjected to the same treatment. Julianne Whittle Venomous writing Manville, N.J.: The publishing of Linda Stasi’s disgraceful column hurts the reputation of the Daily News. Someone should have flagged this horrible discharge of hate speech before it was published. It would have been the decent thing to do. I feel sorry for Stasi and anyone else who harbors that much hate. She needs to seek counseling. Thomas Sobol Get it right Manhattan: It’s “you don’t speak ill of the dead,” not you “should speak well of them.” Dan Bernstein Thanks, Obama Wynnewood, Pa.: I’ve said this before and it bears repeating. Barack Obama is the reason that the well qualified, respected and experienced Hillary Clinton was not our President for the past eight years. Obama was young enough to wait for the 2016 nomination. Instead of biding his time, he entered the 2008 quest and won, even though Hillary received the majority popular vote in the Democratic primaries. Charles McCabe Biased journalism Manhattan: Like the Daily News, I did not support President Trump, cared not for his appeals to fear, and reluctantly cast my vote for Hillary Clinton as a kind of stop-Trump effort. I must warn, you, however, that your “journalism” toward him is more about editorializing against the man now. It’s too deeply one sided (against him) to be considered fair and accurate. Keep the anti-Trump train in your editorials. In the news copy, balance out. In your opinion page, balance out. Edner Pierre-louis Justice for the animals Malverne, L.I.: When Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus shuts down after Sunday’s performances in Uniondale, it will have only itself to blame. Times have changed, and people who care about animals are appalled when they’re chained and beaten until they have no choice but to perform. But instead of modernizing and featuring only willing human performers, Ringling stuck to its failed, archaic business model. Its demise closes one chapter, but work still remains, and other animal exploiters would be wise to take note. Unless they get with the times, their days are numbered, too. John Di Leonardo Anthrozoologist and president Long Island Orchestrating for Nature (LION) Charter advertising Brooklyn: If charter schools have so many children on waiting lists hoping to get in as you claim in “Charters Hot” (May 18), why did they plaster my neighborhood (Carroll Gardens/Cobble Hill) with advertisements for their schools? These neighborhoods are hardly “high need” areas, and the ads cost thousands of dollars, money that should have been spent on the classroom. Furthermore, nowhere do you point out the millions donated by private/hedge funds going to charters (for example the Walmart Waltons recently donated millions to NYC charters, including $24 million to the Success network alone). And why only mention 2016 scores and not mention previous years’ scores, when the exams were new and charters couldn’t “game” them, and DOE schools (while testing all students, including Special Ed and ELL), and under all kinds of regulations charters don’t have to follow outperformed them. Considering this, praising charters for (in 2016) having scores a point or two higher than DOE schools is a hypocritical, self-serving joke. Herman Kolender He’s no hero Fishkill, N.Y.: As an American and Puerto Rican, I find that yes we have plenty of heroes all over this great country of ours, but don’t mention the name of Oscar Lopez Rivera in any context other than as a criminal. My father was a big fan of the FALN until the day he had to choose the between terrorists for the island or his son. I think today he would turn over in his grave. I don’t go to parades but this time I have a great reason for not being there. Benny Rosario The truth is out there Brentwood, L.I.: Why can’t those on TV pronounce former FBI director (now special counsel) Robert Mueller’s name correctly? Would they pronounce mule (the animal) as “mull”? His name is not “mull-er”; it is “mule-er.” W. J. Van Sickle Pox on both houses Pearl River, N.Y.: Both political parties, especially since the 2000 election, have been guilty of hypocrisy and hyperbole. Since the election of Donald Trump, the Democrats have risen to new heights, almost bringing both to an art form. Their holier-than-thou stance regarding everything Trump borders on psychotic. They insist that they represent the feelings of “all” Americans, forgetting that a good portion of us showed our disdain for much of what they espouse. Please, get over your pique and get on with governing. Let the Justice Department decide what Trump did or didn’t do. Thomas McNaughton Obama hate Brooklyn: To Voicer Paul Blous-tein: Your comparison of Barack Obama to Donald Trump was pathetic. Using an innocent error to imply he wasn’t aware of the 50 states to write something that asinine just further lets me know you definitely have a bad case of “Trumpitism” (I hear it’s lethal). Obama wasn’t an habitual liar. Trump lies so much he can’t remember half of the things he’ saying — and that’s most of the time. In the future, try not to make yourself look so much like your fearless leader. Mary Henderson Kaepernick not worth it St. Louis Park, Minn.: Re “Tony Dungy uses questionable analogies — animal cruelty and violence against women — when discussing Colin Kaepernick situation,” (May 17): No owner has to sign him! It’s that simple. They don’t think it would be worth the trouble and it’s their right to feel that way! It’s their team and their money to do whatever they want with. If they don’t think Kaepernick is worth signing, why not just accept it and quit talking about this? Countless other football players have been let go and haven’t received the attention he has. Let it go! Gary Edward Goetz Pols don’t admit hatred Manhattan: Re “Boy, 14, cuffed for sparking fierce Manhattan synagogue blaze” (May 17): Burning a synagogue is a hate crime — 14-year-olds do know better. Our politicians once again attempt to deny the hatred that exists. Plaques honor Vichy France leader Philippe Petain, and concentration camps guards roam free, while we Jews live with our backs up. Anti-Semitic hatred occurs daily but goes unaddressed by government. Has there ever been a Jewish History Month celebrated in a state institution?

But some people are earning their names for being capable of launching thriving businesses in succession. They are called "serial entrepreneurs." According to the Oxford English Dictionary, serial entrepreneur refers to "an entrepreneur who starts up or runs multiple successive businesses, especially one who moves on as soon as the challenge or thrill of making a venture profitable is over." The word was added to the dictionary in 2013, reflecting blooming startup entrepreneurship worldwide. In Korea, Kakao's founder Kim Beom-su, and Chang Byung-gyu, who currently is leading game development company Bluehole, are among the most popular Korean serial entrepreneurs. Born in 1966, Kim studied industrial engineering at Seoul National University. His trail of serial entrepreneurship started when he left Samsung SDS in 1998 and launched an internet cafe franchise, Mission No. 1. In 1999, Kim founded a web-based online game portal Hangame Communication. The business thrived on the back of the explosive spread of the high-speed internet in Korea. In 2000, he successfully led the merger of Hangame and Naver. He worked at the merged company, which was renamed NHN in 2001, until 2007 when he left his own company again. In December 2006, even before Kim left NHN, he founded a startup called IWILAB in the United States. This startup later developed and launched Kakao Talk, which has now become Korea's most-used mobile instant messenger. As the messenger drew over 1 million users, the startup changed its name to Kakao in 2010. In 2012, Kim established the venture capital firm K Cube Ventures aimed at fostering promising startups in mobile services, games and future technology. Currently, Kim is the chairman of Kakao and the CEO of Kakao Brain, a subsidiary dedicated to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Chang Byung-gyuChang was born in 1973 and studied computer science at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology for his doctoral degree. In 1997, Jang established internet service company Neowiz as one of eight co-founders. While he worked as the CTO and internet business head at Neowiz, he contributed to the success of the online chat service Sayclub. As Neowiz started to turn to the online game portal business, Chang left the company in 2005 and founded the startup First Snow and developed a namesake search engine. Chang and his company sold the search engine technology to NHN for 35 billion won ($31 million) a year later. At that time, Chang distributed 30 percent of his own shares in the company, worth an estimated 10.5 billion won, to about 60 employees. In 2007, he established game development company Bluehole. The company released an online computer game called Tera in 2011. The game, in which some 40 billion won was invested for development, has been provided both in Korea and in overseas markets. Like the Kakao founder, Chang also started a venture capital company named Bon Angels in 2012. It mainly seeks for angel investment in startups in their early stages. Overseas cases In the U.S., Tesla founder Elon Musk is considered as one of the most popular serial entrepreneurs. Born in the Republic of South Africa in 1971, Musk founded the software company Global Link Information Network in California in 1995 together with his brother Kimbal. The company changed its named to Zip2 a year later and has provided online city guide software to media companies including The New York Times. Upon the expansion of the company, Musk sold it to Compaq computers for over $300 million in 1999. He also participated in the founding of online financial service firm X.com and internet payment service PayPal, which was later sold to eBay for $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded the space business company SpaceX and struck a $1.6 billion deal with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 2008 to join a program to privatize national space delivery systems. A year later, he famously established electric vehicle maker Tesla. Musk has not stopped and is working on the Hyperloop high-speed transportation system project, a not-for-profit AI research firm OpenAI and neurotechnology startup Neuralink. Another example is Marc Lore, who currently heads Walmart's e-commerce business in the U.S. Lore used to work in banking before starting a sports card trading business called the Pit. It was sold to U.S. memorabilia company Topps in 2001. In 2005, Lore launched an online diaper delivery company called Diapers.com. The company and its affiliates, Soap.com and Wag.com, gained popularity from young parents and was sold to Amazon for $545 million in 2011. He established e-commerce company Jet in 2014, which was acquired by Walmart two years later for over $3 billion. "The success of serial entrepreneurs is based on their bold spirit for challenge and sheer pursuit of innovation, not profit," an industry source said. "To keep the IT industry active and innovative, we need more serial entrepreneurs who don't settle for easy gains at hand." yoonsw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter 'Human spider' successfully scales 555-meter skyscraper with bare hands [PHOTOS] OECD finds S.

Circuses have been a target of PETA since it was founded in 1980. Richard Vogel/AP When Feld Entertainment, owners of Ringling Bros., announced it's cancelling the circus after nearly 150 years, it was one of the biggest victories yet for animal welfare activists. How the circus treats it animals — especially elephants and big cats — has long been a focus for groups like the Humane Society of the U.S and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They see it as part of a larger change going on in this country — about how Americans view animals and the way we treat them. If you've gone to the circus in recent years, you probably saw them. At one protest outside the Ringling Brothers circus in Phoenix earlier this year, people shouted "Boycott the circus." PETA was founded in 1980 and "Ringling Brothers was a target of ours from the very beginning," said Lisa Lange, senior vice president of communications. We're really seeing a rising tide of consciousness when it comes to the treatment of animals. Wayne Pacelle, Humane Society She believes the protests played a key role in changing public attitudes about the circus. In announcing the end, Feld Entertainment chairman Kenneth Feld acknowledged the decades of conflict with animal welfare groups. But he said the decision was made because of declining attendance and a change in public taste. "Yes, people no longer have a taste for that kind of entertainment," Lange said. "But we believe it's because they now know what that kind of entertainment costs those animals." The demise of the Ringling Brothers circus comes just months after SeaWorld agreed to stop breeding its captive orcas and to move away from its signature theatrical shows. Around the same time, the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced it was closing its dolphin exhibit and would move its dolphins to an ocean sanctuary. Enlarge this image SeaWorld ended its long-running killer whale show after criticism that the whales suffered and became violent in captivity. Chris Park/AP hide caption toggle caption Chris Park/AP SeaWorld ended its long-running killer whale show after criticism that the whales suffered and became violent in captivity. Chris Park/AP "It's happening across the economy. It's happening across our culture," said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society. He believes a major change is going on in how Americans view animal welfare issues. "We're really seeing a rising tide of consciousness when it comes to the treatment of animals." Animal welfare groups have seen success in many other areas as well. In the last few years, major pork producers have eliminated confinement pens for pregnant sows. Egg producers have also begun getting rid of cages for their chickens. Pacelle says some of this has been accomplished through legislation. In other cases, change has been pushed by retailers like McDonald's and Wal-Mart. "In most cases, companies are now adapting," he said. "They're simply changing the way they do business to reflect a growing consciousness about animals and wringing the animal cruelty out of the business model." Lisa Lange of PETA says after decades of working on animal rights, she believes the movement has finally hit the mainstream. She believes a major factor is the power of social media. We have the ability to show people a video of elephants for example being beaten behind the scenes at a Ringling Brothers performance. And we put that up on our Facebook page, Instagram, we tweet it out. And millions of people see that video within hours. Pacelle cites a powerful example — the death of Cecil the lion. For years, the Humane Society worked to stop trophy hunting of lions, elephants and other big game with limited success. But two years ago, when a Minnesota dentist killed a lion in Zimbabwe named Cecil, the story went viral.

Soon, all the major air carriers had agreed to ban shipment of lion, elephant, rhino and other large animal trophies worldwide. Pacelle believes concern about animal welfare is now a value shared by all Americans. The question is what that will mean next for agriculture, entertainment, research, and other fields in which animals play a role.

They see it as part of a larger change going on in this country — about how Americans view animals and the way we treat them. If you've gone to the circus in recent years, you probably saw them. At one protest outside the Ringling Brothers circus in Phoenix earlier this year, people shouted "Boycott the circus." PETA was founded in 1980 and "Ringling Brothers was a target of ours from the very beginning," said Lisa Lange, senior vice president of communications. We're really seeing a rising tide of consciousness when it comes to the treatment of animals. Wayne Pacelle, Humane Society She believes the protests played a key role in changing public attitudes about the circus. In announcing the end, Feld Entertainment chairman Kenneth Feld acknowledged the decades of conflict with animal welfare groups. But he said the decision was made because of declining attendance and a change in public taste. "Yes, people no longer have a taste for that kind of entertainment," Lange said. "But we believe it's because they now know what that kind of entertainment costs those animals." The demise of the Ringling Brothers circus comes just months after SeaWorld agreed to stop breeding its captive orcas and to move away from its signature theatrical shows. Around the same time, the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced it was closing its dolphin exhibit and would move its dolphins to an ocean sanctuary.

Chris Park/AP "It's happening across the economy. It's happening across our culture," said Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society. He believes a major change is going on in how Americans view animal welfare issues. "We're really seeing a rising tide of consciousness when it comes to the treatment of animals." Animal welfare groups have seen success in many other areas as well. In the last few years, major pork producers have eliminated confinement pens for pregnant sows. Egg producers have also begun getting rid of cages for their chickens. Pacelle says some of this has been accomplished through legislation. In other cases, change has been pushed by retailers like McDonald's and Wal-Mart. "In most cases, companies are now adapting," he said. "They're simply changing the way they do business to reflect a growing consciousness about animals and wringing the animal cruelty out of the business model." Lisa Lange of PETA says after decades of working on animal rights, she believes the movement has finally hit the mainstream. She believes a major factor is the power of social media. We have the ability to show people a video of elephants for example being beaten behind the scenes at a Ringling Brothers performance. And we put that up on our Facebook page, Instagram, we tweet it out. And millions of people see that video within hours. Pacelle cites a powerful example — the death of Cecil the lion. For years, the Humane Society worked to stop trophy hunting of lions, elephants and other big game with limited success. But two years ago, when a Minnesota dentist killed a lion in Zimbabwe named Cecil, the story went viral.

Soon, all the major air carriers had agreed to ban shipment of lion, elephant, rhino and other large animal trophies worldwide. Pacelle believes concern about animal welfare is now a value shared by all Americans. The question is what that will mean next for agriculture, entertainment, research, and other fields in which animals play a role.

Yes, he was a complete, disgusting sexist pig. Yes, he did enormous damage to the women at Fox News, and created an atmosphere there which encouraged and allowed other piggish men there to do the same. However, the bottom line is that however deeply flawed and disgusting, he was still a human being. This guy wasn’t Stalin or Lenin or Hitler or Pol Pot or Assad or some other mass murderer or serial killer. Ailes most likely damaged and/or destroyed some women’s careers by his pigdom, which is really bad. But he’s dead now. When I was young, I had too many terrible encounters with men just like Ailes in positions of authority in various workplaces. Yep, it was to varying degrees a nightmare. It’s terrible, not okay, and beyond shocking the degree to which it is still going on so rampantly these days. Stasi even takes a potshot at Ailes’ wife who said she loved him. Even though he was a pig at work, and possibly elsewhere, this woman claims he had been a good husband. That could be true. This whole gross scandal destroyed that marriage and left him living alone, and his wife living through this hell on her own, too. Can’t Stasi at least have the decency to leave that woman alone right now? Guess not. Alice Tomlin Respect the dead Hixson, Tenn.: I was born in New York and lived in New York for 55 years and now live in Tennessee. I miss New York. That’s why I still read the Daily News. I feel very strongly for women’s rights as I have found myself being treated poorly in the working establishment in my lifetime. As for Roger Ailes, I agree that his approach with women was terrible and my sympathies go out to them. However, I do take exception to Linda Stasi’s column about Ailes’ death. If not out of respect for the dead, she could have at least shown some to his family. I found her article to be extremely in bad taste. Let us hope when her time comes she will not be subjected to the same treatment. Julianne Whittle Venomous writing Manville, N.J.: The publishing of Linda Stasi’s disgraceful column hurts the reputation of the Daily News. Someone should have flagged this horrible discharge of hate speech before it was published. It would have been the decent thing to do. I feel sorry for Stasi and anyone else who harbors that much hate. She needs to seek counseling. Thomas Sobol Get it right Manhattan: It’s “you don’t speak ill of the dead,” not you “should speak well of them.” Dan Bernstein Thanks, Obama Wynnewood, Pa.: I’ve said this before and it bears repeating. Barack Obama is the reason that the well qualified, respected and experienced Hillary Clinton was not our President for the past eight years. Obama was young enough to wait for the 2016 nomination. Instead of biding his time, he entered the 2008 quest and won, even though Hillary received the majority popular vote in the Democratic primaries. Charles McCabe Biased journalism Manhattan: Like the Daily News, I did not support President Trump, cared not for his appeals to fear, and reluctantly cast my vote for Hillary Clinton as a kind of stop-Trump effort. I must warn, you, however, that your “journalism” toward him is more about editorializing against the man now. It’s too deeply one sided (against him) to be considered fair and accurate. Keep the anti-Trump train in your editorials. In the news copy, balance out. In your opinion page, balance out. Edner Pierre-louis Justice for the animals Malverne, L.I.: When Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus shuts down after Sunday’s performances in Uniondale, it will have only itself to blame. Times have changed, and people who care about animals are appalled when they’re chained and beaten until they have no choice but to perform. But instead of modernizing and featuring only willing human performers, Ringling stuck to its failed, archaic business model. Its demise closes one chapter, but work still remains, and other animal exploiters would be wise to take note. Unless they get with the times, their days are numbered, too. John Di Leonardo Anthrozoologist and president Long Island Orchestrating for Nature (LION) Charter advertising Brooklyn: If charter schools have so many children on waiting lists hoping to get in as you claim in “Charters Hot” (May 18), why did they plaster my neighborhood (Carroll Gardens/Cobble Hill) with advertisements for their schools? These neighborhoods are hardly “high need” areas, and the ads cost thousands of dollars, money that should have been spent on the classroom. Furthermore, nowhere do you point out the millions donated by private/hedge funds going to charters (for example the Walmart Waltons recently donated millions to NYC charters, including $24 million to the Success network alone). And why only mention 2016 scores and not mention previous years’ scores, when the exams were new and charters couldn’t “game” them, and DOE schools (while testing all students, including Special Ed and ELL), and under all kinds of regulations charters don’t have to follow outperformed them. Considering this, praising charters for (in 2016) having scores a point or two higher than DOE schools is a hypocritical, self-serving joke. Herman Kolender He’s no hero Fishkill, N.Y.: As an American and Puerto Rican, I find that yes we have plenty of heroes all over this great country of ours, but don’t mention the name of Oscar Lopez Rivera in any context other than as a criminal. My father was a big fan of the FALN until the day he had to choose the between terrorists for the island or his son. I think today he would turn over in his grave. I don’t go to parades but this time I have a great reason for not being there. Benny Rosario The truth is out there Brentwood, L.I.: Why can’t those on TV pronounce former FBI director (now special counsel) Robert Mueller’s name correctly? Would they pronounce mule (the animal) as “mull”? His name is not “mull-er”; it is “mule-er.” W. J. Van Sickle Pox on both houses Pearl River, N.Y.: Both political parties, especially since the 2000 election, have been guilty of hypocrisy and hyperbole. Since the election of Donald Trump, the Democrats have risen to new heights, almost bringing both to an art form. Their holier-than-thou stance regarding everything Trump borders on psychotic. They insist that they represent the feelings of “all” Americans, forgetting that a good portion of us showed our disdain for much of what they espouse. Please, get over your pique and get on with governing. Let the Justice Department decide what Trump did or didn’t do. Thomas McNaughton Obama hate Brooklyn: To Voicer Paul Blous-tein: Your comparison of Barack Obama to Donald Trump was pathetic. Using an innocent error to imply he wasn’t aware of the 50 states to write something that asinine just further lets me know you definitely have a bad case of “Trumpitism” (I hear it’s lethal). Obama wasn’t an habitual liar. Trump lies so much he can’t remember half of the things he’ saying — and that’s most of the time. In the future, try not to make yourself look so much like your fearless leader. Mary Henderson Kaepernick not worth it St. Louis Park, Minn.: Re “Tony Dungy uses questionable analogies — animal cruelty and violence against women — when discussing Colin Kaepernick situation,” (May 17): No owner has to sign him! It’s that simple. They don’t think it would be worth the trouble and it’s their right to feel that way! It’s their team and their money to do whatever they want with. If they don’t think Kaepernick is worth signing, why not just accept it and quit talking about this? Countless other football players have been let go and haven’t received the attention he has. Let it go! Gary Edward Goetz Pols don’t admit hatred Manhattan: Re “Boy, 14, cuffed for sparking fierce Manhattan synagogue blaze” (May 17): Burning a synagogue is a hate crime — 14-year-olds do know better. Our politicians once again attempt to deny the hatred that exists. Plaques honor Vichy France leader Philippe Petain, and concentration camps guards roam free, while we Jews live with our backs up. Anti-Semitic hatred occurs daily but goes unaddressed by government. Has there ever been a Jewish History Month celebrated in a state institution?

SHARE Your Town, May 21, 2017 By Tammy Gemaehlich Saturday, May 20, 2017 Mother’s Day is in the rearview mirror and I wanted to talk about regifting. No, I’m not regifting a Mother’s Day present I received but am regifting a Your Town column that first published in March, 2009. It brings to mind a few past Mother’s Days spent hiking or biking with the boys, whose “presence” I enjoy as even more than the “presents.” Happy trails ... If you’ve ever walked or biked the Riverfront Trail, you know about sharing the road. This time of year trails are full of walkers, in-line skaters, leisure bikers and the speedier road bikes buzzing past. As a bike rider, when coming upon slower traffic, it’s common courtesy to announce your presence before passing them on the left. Usually, a friendly “on your left” is all it takes. Often though, those who are strolling ahead are in tune with nature and oblivious to what’s behind them. An abrupt “on the left” could easily startle a group who might be otherwise gazing at the view or in deep conversation. Well, that was me last Sunday, coming down from a hike on the lower Liberty Cap Trail. We’d passed several hikers on the way up and down the trail, and there were a few running the four-mile, round-trip distance. Several hundred yards from the trailhead on the way back to the car, the three of us were walking and talking when my son said, “look out Mom.” While there are a number of ways to interpret this, I figured someone must be coming up behind us. I saw my son scoot off the trail to the left, and my other son, slightly in front of us, scooted to the right. Startled, I wasn’t sure which way to go, so I bobbled between left and right, before decidedly moving abruptly to the right at the last second, totally plowing down the runner with my shoulder as he descended the hill at breakneck speed, sending him flying into the soft dirt and rocks. I gasped in horror as I watched the dazed runner, in one smooth motion, roll once off the trail, then returned quickly upright to his feet. He continued his running momentum down the trail, tossing back an apology for going too fast and out of control, before he continued on his way. I felt awful, yet wonderfully empowered, at the same time. Dear Mr. Runner:  if you’re reading this, I hope you’re OK. Please, next time announce “on your left/right” before barreling by slower traffic. While you were picking cactus thorns and rocks out of your shin Sunday night, my boys were high-fiving me for delivering such an awesome hockey-style body-check. Beware: next time I go on an outing I’m taking along my hockey stick instead of a hiking stick. ■ Mesa County Genealogy Society will host help sessions on the first Friday of each month through December, at select Mesa County Libraries branches.

SHARE Shedding an abusive past Susie Smith, right, hugs her 14-year-old daughter outside the Pear Park family home. Smith, who had her daughter at age 15 as a result of a rape by her mother’s boyfriend, is seeking to change the child’s last name to match that of her siblings. Robert Gallob Susie Smith, right, sits beside her 14-year-old daughter outside the Pear Park family home. Susie’s daughter bears her maiden name, and the mother is trying to have it changed to that of her daughter’s siblings. QUICKREAD HOW WE REPORTED THIS STORY Adhering to a long-standing policy followed by virtually all media, The Daily Sentinel does not identify victims of sexual assault unless they give consent. Susie Smith gave the newspaper permission to publish her name but asked that her daughter not be publicly named. The Sentinel has also removed references to Smith’s maiden name, because it is the name currently used by her daughter. By Gabrielle Porter Saturday, May 20, 2017 AUDIO EXTRA: listen She’s so 14. Her nails are painted, but the paint is a little chipped — maybe from playing basketball with the neighbor boy, her best friend. She’s excited about getting a fidget spinner, and her mom would tell you that “boys are everything right now.” She wants a tattoo of the infinity symbol on her wrist, maybe a little cross on her ring finger. At a school choir performance this year, she and her friends planned to showcase their dance moves by doing “the dab” at the end of a song. Her friends chickened out, and she dabbed alone. She didn’t mind. She’s 14. She’s got the same burdens any teenager has — plus one more. She wants to change her name. For years, she never wondered why her name was different from her family’s. She took it in stride that her mom, her dad, her brothers, her sister, all of them had the same name: Smith. But her name was different. A few years ago, she started to question. Her mom and dad sat her down and told her the truth. Her dad was her dad, but he wasn’t her father. Her biological father was in prison. She was born after he, at age 49, raped and impregnated her mother, at age 15. Now she knows that her last name is her mother’s maiden name. It’s the same name her mother had when she was sexually assaulted and threatened. The girl’s last name is her mother’s victim name. She wants to change that name. She wants to be a Smith. ‘OH MY GOD’ The girl’s mother, Susie, was 13 when she met the man who would impregnate her. Susie’s own mother met Robert Leroy Gallob at a bar in Grand Junction. He quickly moved in with the family and, according to Susie, began “grooming” her. By the time Susie was 14, Gallob had started sexually assaulting her. While Gallob would eventually be prosecuted for a single instance of sexual assault based on Susie’s initial report to law enforcement, Susie and Gallob would both later say the sexual assaults were a regular occurrence over two years. Late in 2002, 15-year-old Susie woke up for school one morning. She was lying in bed when she felt something she hadn’t felt before. A “weird, funky feeling.” She pushed on her stomach. It pushed back. “It touched me. I could feel it with my hand,” Susie said. “I was like, ‘Oh my God.’ ”  Susie left her room. Her mother was at work. She approached Gallob. “I looked at him and said, ‘There’s a baby in there,’ ” Susie recalled. “He swore to God that that wasn’t possible, that I was a whore because he had a vasectomy and there was no way.” Susie had never had sex with anyone else. She still thought boys were “icky.” Still, at what she said was Gallob’s urging, she told her mother a boy from Palisade had gotten her pregnant. Her mother didn’t ask much more about the baby’s father, but told Susie to consider adoption. Medical providers at Susie’s appointments reminded her she had options. “I told them, there is no option. This was set forth for me,” Susie said. “It’s not her fault. She’s a baby. She didn’t ask for the situation that she came from. … There was no way.” A few months later, Susie went into labor. Her best friend, her mother and a close family friend all accompanied her from De Beque to St. Mary’s Hospital. The next morning, the day before Gallob’s 50th birthday party, Susie gave birth to a daughter. Gallob, Susie said, was at the bar.   FLIGHT For a year and a half, Susie told nobody who had fathered her child, scared of what would happen if she came forward. A high school student, Susie was frazzled by the challenges of being a teen mother. “My day consisted of waking up, waking my daughter up, feeding her, go to school, get off school, go to work all night in Parachute, then go back home at about 10 o’clock, do all my homework, take care of my daughter, go to sleep for like three hours, and then do it all over again,” Susie said. Susie’s mother quit her job to stay home with the baby, and Susie for a time was the only one in the house with a job. Susie had friends, but didn’t confide in them what was going on at home. She tried to find other outlets, and discovered she had a gift for auto mechanic work, which she loved for the focus it demanded of her. “I could just do something and then be proud of myself at the end,” Susie said. “That was all I needed, was a moment of glory. … Like, ‘Yes, I fixed it.’ “ During that period, Susie’s daughter was her lifeline. A strong, energetic baby, the girl was bright and sweet, hated men and seemed to have an instinct for knowing when her mother needed a little extra love. “She’s been my little rock since day one,” Susie said. Susie still lived with her mother and Gallob and had to leave her daughter at home with the two of them — neither of whom were working — during the day. “I started getting nervous thinking, you know, if he’s doing this to me, what is he doing to her?” Susie said. When the baby was about 18 months old, Susie decided she was done with the constant stress and fear that living with her abuser placed on her. She loaded her daughter into her truck and drove to Grand Junction. She stayed with her best friend, who suspected Gallob had fathered the child. When Susie confirmed the hunch, the friend urged her to tell somebody what had happened. Susie’s mother eventually split with Gallob, and asked Susie during a visit to De Beque in the summer of 2004 to move back home. Susie refused, but didn’t tell her mother why the idea of moving back home was so painful. She left, driving back to Grand Junction. “I got about halfway down the De Beque cutoff and I said, ‘You know what? Screw it. I’m going to turn around and I’m going to tell her,’ ” Susie said. She returned to her mother’s house and told her about the sexual abuse Gallob inflicted on her. “I said, ‘I’ve been raped here. And beaten and abused here. I cannot be here,’ ” Susie recalled. “That’s when she’s like, ‘Oh my gosh, then we need to call the cops.’ “   THE COURT Susie made the call. She reported to law enforcement that Gallob had raped her a single time and that he was the father of her child. Gallob agreed to have his DNA tested but said Susie was lying, that they never had intercourse. “I asked Mr. Gallob why he thought Susan identified him as the father of her baby,” Mesa County sheriff’s investigator Jim Hebenstreit wrote in a report made public after Gallob’s arrest. “Mr. Gallob indicated it may have been because Susan and her mother needed money.” It was almost a year before investigators got results back from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation showing with an “extremely high degree of probability” that Gallob was the child’s biological father. Susie, meanwhile, was trying to stay off the grid, daughter in tow. She had dropped out of school. She stayed with friends, moving regularly, afraid that Gallob would make good on threats he made to her never to tell anyone. “At that point in my life, I knew that if I said something and he found out that I said something, that he would find me. He would hunt my ass down and try and kill me,” she said. “Nobody knew where I was. … Every time I’d start feeling like maybe he knows where I live, I’d go somewhere else.” The Sheriff’s Office obtained a warrant for Gallob’s arrest, but he bonded out of jail, prompting Susie to drive through the night to stay with a relative in Arkansas. In the summer of 2006 Gallob pleaded guilty to a single count of sexual assault. Attending his sentencing hearing was harrowing for Susie. “Even though he was in chains behind that table, I was still scared of him because I remember him always saying, ‘You know, you ever press charges on me, tell anybody, I’m gonna kill you,’ ” Susie said. “Before I walked in that courtroom every thought went through my head about how he was going to kill me in that courtroom.” Gallob was sentenced to five years to life in the state prison system and ordered to register as a sex offender. When Susie walked out of the courtroom — enduring name-calling from people gathered to support her mother’s ex-boyfriend — she felt free for the first time in years. “I could walk down the street and not have to look over my shoulder,” she said. “I could take my daughter into Walmart or City Market, the local mall even, and not have to worry about being hurt.”   NEW LIFE A few months after Gallob was sentenced to prison, 19-year-old Susie’s life was marching on. She dated a guy, and got dumped. None the worse for the breakup, she went out cruising North Avenue with a friend. A lane over, Rifle resident DJ Smith was having a night out with his brother. He pulled up next to a 1992 Dodge Stealth, saw the flash of Susie’s blond hair, and from there followed standard North Avenue cruising protocol. “We chased each other around town, then pulled over and started talking,” DJ said. “Aside from her hotness?” DJ was immediately struck by Susie’s personality and openness. “It was like, ‘Wow, finally an honest person,’” he said. “We just kind of hit it off from there.” DJ took Susie hiking in the Uncompahgre National Forest, in the rain and mud. They were in sync, agreeing about almost everything. He fell hard. She did too. In the past, Susie had worried about bringing a man into her and her daughter’s lives. She reminded herself that she had a reliable gut sense about people, and that she would fight tooth and nail to protect her daughter. She warned DJ, in any case, not to expect much from meeting her child. “I said, ‘She’s not going to like you and she hates men and just be prepared,’ ” Susie said, waving off DJ’s assertion that kids loved him. DJ arrived at the Grand Junction apartment Susie was sharing with her brother at the time. The moment he walked in the door, Susie’s daughter flung herself at him with an enormous hug. “I think in that moment is when I decided that I wanted to have a huge life with him,” Susie said. “Have kids and get married one day. Because my daughter was me at that time, and for her to have that intuition- … She didn’t even know his name yet.” Susie and DJ, who had a young daughter himself, moved in together. They were planning a wedding when they found out Susie was pregnant with their first boy. If Susie’s daughter was a miracle that saved her in a dark chapter of life, her son with DJ was pure joy. “Finding out with my oldest son that I was able to conceive again and have a baby, and I get to have a baby with an amazing man?” Susie said. “It was a very different feeling because at the same time I also knew that this … was something I asked for.” A second son followed quickly, swelling the Smith family’s ranks to four kids, one dad, one mom. Susie pushed thoughts of Gallob into the distance, except when it was time to file letters to the parole board — and except when a medical provider questioned where the girl’s father was because Susie included nothing about his medical history on a set of forms she filled out. Staff at the medical office told a confused Susie she should obtain an official custody order for the daughter she’d cared for her entire life. Susie petitioned in Mesa County Court for allocation of parental responsibilities, which a judge granted. “(Then the judge) said, ‘Now understand, he can file for custody at any time until the age of 18,’ ” Susie said. “I said, ‘Wait, what?’ “ Gallob could have called in to the court hearing from prison but didn’t, and Susie put the troubling comment out of her mind. Meanwhile, Susie’s daughter quickly forgot that DJ had ever not been Dad, and the couple decided not to tell her she had a different biological father — not to lie, but to protect her. “She needed to know what a real dad is,” Susie said. “She has known that her whole life, thanks to my husband.”   PAROLE Susie wrote victim impact letters every year to Colorado’s state parole board, asking that Gallob not be released. As his 2013 review approached she said she felt instinctively it would be different that year, based in part on conversations she had with his prison therapist, who seemed to be squarely in Gallob’s corner. On March 4, 2013, a Monday, Susie sat on her bed as she called in to Gallob’s parole review, all the while “trying to keep my composure because inside I was freaking out.” She listened as Parole Board member Alfredo Pena questioned Gallob about his background and what support he would have from his family if he were granted parole. Gallob admitted to the parole board that he had sex with Susie “30 to 40 times” over a two-year period starting when she was 14. When prompted by Pena, Gallob said he had four other underage “victims” in the past, although he wasn’t clear about exactly what type of sexual contact he had with them. When she was later notified that Gallob would be paroled on June 26, 2013 – less than seven years after he was sentenced to prison — “mass panic ensued,” she said. Susie had to rush to file new protection orders prohibiting Gallob from contact with her, her daughter, her other children, her workplace, her children’s schools. Meanwhile, her daughter, now about 10, had started to notice things. She felt that Susie, whose cardinal rule was honesty at all times, was hiding something. She started wondering why her last name wasn’t Smith. Susie’s daughter said she remembers a day around that time when something prompted her to ask the question. “I asked about my real dad and if my dad I have now is my real dad,” she said. DJ and Susie went to the store together, giving Susie time to draw courage, the now-14-year-old said. When her parents came back, they sent the younger children out of the room, sat the girl down and told her the whole story. “I had hoped and prayed that that conversation would never exist, my whole life,” Susie said. “I worry that my daughter hates me because I lied to her my whole life … about who her dad was.” The girl said she was in shock. “I was kind of scared,” the teen said. “I didn’t think that those things could actually happen to a person.” It changed the way she saw herself. “(My mom) told me that I was by far way better than him,” the girl said. “(But) it made me kind of feel like I was a bad person because I was from him.”   ‘IT JUST MAKES  ME THINK OF HIM’ It’s been a few years since the girl learned about her mother’s assault and the role Gallob played in her conception, since Gallob was released to Mesa County on parole. Gallob, who currently lives in Fruita with family members, did not respond to The Daily Sentinel’s request for an interview for this story. It appears he has respected protection orders forbidding him contact with the Smiths, and Susie has never encountered him by chance out in the community. But she’s lost the feeling of freedom, and now, so has her daughter. The girl is different from her friends, many of whom are going through the utterly teenaged phase of hating their mothers. Susie is her daughter’s hero. The teen has never seen Gallob, only his Department of Corrections mug shot. But she’s afraid for her mother, that Susie will face retaliation for speaking publicly about her past. She’s afraid she’ll run into Gallob around town. “She worries about that everywhere we go,” DJ said. The girl started wanting to become a Smith officially about a year ago. Her last name isn’t Gallob — she bears Susie’s maiden name. She hates that it’s a tie to her mother’s past. “Every time somebody calls me (by my mother’s maiden name), it just makes me think of him,” the girl said. “I think if I were to change it, it would be better. … He’s like gone out of my mind.” DJ is the girl’s dad. Her two brothers and her sister are all Smiths. The family is tight-knit. They’re the family that piles into the truck and goes to the grocery store together to pick up a gallon of milk. The girl is 14. She could just wait four years until she turns 18, but she wants to change her name now. Smith means belonging. But it also offers protection and some anonymity. With the ubiquitous Smith, the girl would feel less vulnerable to unwanted contact with her biological father. “If he were to try to find me or something, like at least it wouldn’t stick out and it would be harder to find me,” she said. “Everybody’s last name is Smith.” Susie supports her daughter, but there’s a catch. While Gallob is restrained from contact with Susie, her family and anyone under the age of 18, he still technically has parental rights, and his cooperation might be necessary. The court will definitely have to be involved, no matter how the name change is handled. Susie has started working with Grand Junction family law attorney Trudee Gurley, who has offered to take on her case pro bono. But she’s frustrated that Gallob’s presence is cropping up at all. “I don’t even look at him as being associated with her,” Susie said. “The only thing that holds him even around the realm of my daughter is the fact that there’s a freaking paper out there that says the DNA matches. That’s it.”   ‘WHAT I WANT IS  TO BE HAPPY’ Susie and DJ today don’t have a lot of time to ruminate about the past or worry about the future. The couple together runs a construction company and recently opened the doors on a new automotive shop, Twisted Kustoms, and have their hands full raising four kids. Susie is dedicated to her family, and said looking back she wouldn’t trade away her abuse if it meant losing the life she has now. “If I had to do it over 100 times the same way and get my daughter, as long as I got my daughter out of it, I’d do it,” she said. The idea of a new court battle — even if it’s unopposed — is overwhelming, but Susie said she is going to find a way to change her daughter’s name if it means giving her more piece of mind. “What I want is to be happy, and I want my daughter to be happy and I will fight to the ends of the earth and back to be happy,” Susie said. “There is never going to be a day where I don’t have to at least have these memories, unfortunately. I’ll die with these memories, but if I can make it to where my daughter doesn’t have to live with these memories, that’s what matters to me. That’s why I’m doing it.” COMMENTS TOP JOBS Facilities Maintenance Looking for energetic/hard working/self-motivated Individuals who can...

Suburbs Post-Tribune Post-Tribune News Whiting's Garage Mahal brings out sellers and bargain-hunters Jim Karczewski/Post-Tribune Fred Serrano, left, and Rossanne Oroczo sell an array of items Saturday during the city Whiting's annual Garage Mahal. Fred Serrano, left, and Rossanne Oroczo sell an array of items Saturday during the city Whiting's annual Garage Mahal. (Jim Karczewski/Post-Tribune) Michelle L. QuinnPost-Tribune Privacy Policy For a brief second, a bug distracted Melody Vasquez from her job of raking in the cash. The 6-year-old bent over the table set up by her mom, Rossanne Oroszco, during the city of Whiting's Garage Mahal Saturday afternoon, inspecting the flying creature that landed between bottles of shampoo and shaving cream. It was an interesting diversion from working on padding the bank account she just opened a month ago. "I'm selling my toys because I don't use them anymore," Melody said. She wasn't sure if she was going to use her windfall to save for something big or sock it away for a "rainy day," but she knows her family has done well by participating in the annual event. Her mom use the citywide garage sale to sell off her vast stash of personal hygiene products, which she accumulates over the course of the year. She's a couponer, so she ends up with a lot of surplus, Rossanne Oroszco said. "I can't hold all this in my house," she said, laughing. "It's how I circulate my stuff." Her dad, Fred Serrano, does the same thing with movies. The ones he doesn't sell in a year, he brings back the following year. At 25 cents a pop, the hundreds of DVDs he had were priced to sell. And Mallory Santucci, of Chicago's Hegewisch neighborhood, came ready to buy; she walked out with at least 10 movies she's never seen. "Why not? I'd go buy them at Walmart for $3 or $5, and these are a quarter," Santucci said. "All right, I have to get out of this town before I spend all my money." There was plenty of opportunity to lighten the wallet. With more than 150 houses cleaning out their trash/treasures, one would be hard-pressed to not find something. Serrano said he'd like to see to see the Whiting/Robertsdale Chamber of Commerce have two or three Garage Mahals over the course of the year. Mary Hassen, meanwhile, plans to be a "one and done" seller during the giant sale. The only reason she opened her garage was because her son, Ryan Knazur, just bought his own house and was cleaning out his stuff. "I told him I'd give him whatever money we made, so he can have all $23," Hassen said. "I sold a table, proving to the guy it was waterproof as the rain beaded up on it." "And I told her, 'I'm not going through your crap when you die,'" Knazur said, smiling. One buyer took a box of old Atari and Nintendo cartridges off Hassen's and Knazur's hands, Hassen said. Had Jordan Roberts and Joe Pranaitis, both of Whiting, gotten there a bit earlier, they would've scooped them right up. "I'm an aficionado, and the old stuff is worth a lot more," Roberts said. "But I did get the first two 'Jackass' movies -- unrated versions, even -- but the 'Jackass 3' T-shirt was sold. "Why does all the bad stuff happen to me?" If it weren't for a friend's birthday Saturday, Pranaitis wouldn't have been out at all. "I avoid Garage Mahal day like the plague," he said. Michelle L.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Costco to report fiscal Q3 numbers May 25 Shutterstock photo What’s Happening Retailer Costco ( COST ) is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the market close on May 25. Analysts forecast the company to post earnings of $1.31 per share, up from $1.24 during the same period last year. The stock has been trending higher, with shares up 7.3% on the year. Technical Analysis COST was recently trading at $171.37, down $11.81 from its 12-month high and $29.95 above its 12-month low. Technical indicators for COST are bullish and the stock is in a strong upward trend. The stock has recent support above $169.00 and recent resistance below $175.00. Of the 18 analysts who cover the stock, 11 rate it a „strong buy”, one rates it a „buy”, and six rate it a „hold”. The stock receives S&P Capital IQ’s 3 STARS „Hold” ranking. Analyst’s Thoughts When Costco’s relationship with American Express ( AXP ) ended in 2016, the Street feared that it would have a material impact on the company’s bottom line, but those fears have subsided, and Wall Street came back into the stock in the latter part of 2016, and shares have steadily appreciated through the current year. Earnings and sales did disappoint last quarter, which initially drove the stock lower before traders came back and drove shares to a new all-time high at the beginning of May. The stock’s valuation is a bit high, with a P/E of 31.7, but analysts see earnings rising by 5.8% in 2017 and 13.3% in 2018. The consensus calls for earnings of $1.31, but the street has a slightly higher whisper number of $1.33, which is the number the market will really need to see for shares to move higher. It has not be the best earnings season for retailers in general, but so far it has been mall-based retailers that felt the most pain, with retailers such as Wal-Mart ( WMT ) and Target ( TGT ) enjoying nice gains following their reports. In both cases, e-commerce growth played a role, an area where Costco has lagged its competitors. Costco started putting more focus on its online business last year, and Wall Street will pay close attention to whether or not the company is starting to see online sales rise. Watch not only for the company’s quarterly numbers, but also any sign as to the health of the company’s e-commerce growth. Stock Only Trade If you’re looking to establish a long stock position in COST, consider buying the stock under $171.25. Sell if it falls below $154.50 or take profits if it gets to $197.00. Bullish Trade If you want to set up a bullish hedged trade on COST, consider an October 140/145 bull-put credit spread for a 30-cent credit. That’s a potential 6.4% return (15.1% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 15.2% to cause a problem. Bearish Trade If you would prefer to take a bearish stance on COST at this time, consider an October 190/195 bear-call credit spread for a $0.50 credit. That’s a potential 11.1% return (26.3% annualized*) and the stock would have to rise 11.2% to cause a problem. Covered Call Trade If you are upbeat on the stock, but would prefer to build in some protection in the event of an earnings miss, consider an October $173 covered call. Buy COST shares (typically 100 shares, scale as appropriate), while selling the October $173.00 call for a debit of $165.00 per share. The trade has a target assigned return of 4.8%, and a target annualized return of 11.5% (for comparison purposes only).

Published Yesterday With all the racism still going on today, it’s nice to hear a story about true love and sacrifice. That’s what Aaron and Rachel Halbert, a young white married couple did when they not only adopted two dark-skinned children (one boy, one girl), but also delivered three other black children via embryos that were frozen for 15 years. This story is so miraculous for a number of reasons. First, Rachel had been having complications conceiving children of her own. Second, the couple was only expecting to have two children as only two embryos had been implanted into her. One had apparently split into two and therefore she birthed Ryley, Anne Waverly and Whitley. The Aaron and Rachel says they’ve been a targets of disapproving looks from both white and black people. "We knew, especially in the South, that a white couple with non-white children would draw a myriad of different reactions,” Aaron told the Washington Post. “There will always be the older white woman in Walmart who stared at us with sheer disgust, or the African-American mother who looked at us and just shook her head." Regardless, the couple chose to actually back up the true principles of their evangelical faith and embrace all humanity, while providing homes to children who may not otherwise have one. Their family has reportedly been super supportive of their decisions so far. "It’s been heartening to see virtually all of our friends and family express overwhelming support for our family and the unusual ways we’ve built it,” Aaron says. “In our minds, we are just living out our dream.

Print   Email   Font Resize Local News Wagons West offers history lesson for local children Annual event includes cowboy poet, Overland Trail game By Callie Jones Journal-Advocate news editor Posted:   05/21/2017 09:24:07 PM MDT Cowboy Poet Zeb Dennis recites a poem about a cowboy getting bucked off a horse during Overland Trail Museum's Wagons West program Friday. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Click photo to enlarge Students got to make their own sand art as part of Overland Trail Museum's Wagons West program. « 1 2 » Local fourth graders took a trip back in time Friday, with the final Wagons West program at Overland Trail Museum. Due to the weather, the final program had to be adapted, with wagon rides cancelled and everything else moved inside. But the annual program still included lots of fun. Inside the Dave Hamil Building, students learned about Native American life, the tribes that were located in northeast Colorado, their dress and the tools that they used. Students also got a chance to look inside a teepee and learned about the importance of bison to the Native Americans. In the High Plains Education Center, cowboy poet Zeb Dennis entertained students with stories and songs about the Old West. He also shared a little bit about the history of cowboy poetry, which started back in the 1860s. Overland Trail Museum staff member Leslie Fager removes an item from the supply list after students suffer a setback during an Overland Trail game that was part of the Wagons West program. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Also inside the education center, students were able to make their very own sand art pieces to take home. Finally, in the museum's one-room school house, the students adopted roles of various characters for an Overland Trail game. The students were given a list of supplies, a time limit and a supply of cash to begin their journey on the trail. Along the way, they faced treacherous situations, such as approaching Indians, a rattle snake bit and a dangerous thunderstorm. The outcomes of their choices, determined by the toss of a coin, affected the success of their journey, and whether the students' characters would live or die before making it to the end of the trail, where they would homestead. Advertisement Funding for the wagon rides offered on previous days and to bring Dennis to the museum for the Wagons West program was provided by Wal-Mart. The museum has lots of fun programs planned for the summer, including its monthly Family Fun Saturday on the first Saturdays of the month, as well as its July 4 Heritage Festival.

The juror was allowed to stay on the Jackson County panel that last month cleared Jacob Ewing of charges of aggravated indecent liberties and aggravated criminal sodomy with a child younger than 14 years old, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. The newspaper said it has obtained unsealed transcripts of a closed-door meeting with the judge in which a special prosecutor, Jacqie Spradling, voiced concerns about the juror and the trial’s setting in Holton, a 3,300-resident town divided by allegations against Ewing. The case drew similarities to others in Maryville, Mo., and in Dearborn, Mo., in which victims and alleged victims of sexual assault were shamed as justice was sought. “If she steps out and looks like she’s 18 years old, that’s on her,’’ said one potential juror. “That’s just how I feel about it.” Another man excused from the jury pool said he thought he’d probably have to find Ewing not guilty because the young woman’s father should have kept better track of her, and a woman said it would bother her conscience to judge him. Maxwell Kautsch, a Kansas attorney representing the Capital-Journal, filed a motion to intervene in Jackson County District Court seeking to bring the release of the transcript. He argued the document should be public and that Judge Norbert Marek overstepped his constitutional authority by not releasing it as yet to the public. At issue were posts by the juror’s husband on a Facebook page dedicated to Holton, with the husband questioning the accuser’s age – she was 13 at the time of the alleged attack in 2014 – and describing the trial as a “witch hunt.” When confronted about that during the private meeting with the judge April 20 before deliberations, the juror denied discussing the case with her spouse and said his feelings about Ewing’s guilt or innocence wouldn’t compromise her impartiality, the transcripts show. She called herself “a very independent thinker,” and said, “I apologize for my husband.” “It’s not like we’re deciding whether to have turkey or ham for Thanksgiving, you know. It’s a very serious, serious matter,” the transcripts quote her as saying. But the juror also admitted she didn’t want to be on the panel, fearing Holton run-ins with people involved in the case. “Because it’s just a high-profile case and, regardless of which way it goes, who wants to go to Wal-Mart and run into, you know, the victims’ advocates or, opposite end, the defendant’s family?” the transcript quotes her as saying. “You know, it’s just not something that’s going to be comfortable.” Spradling unsuccessfully asked that the woman be replaced, citing the juror’s reluctance to serve and her contemplation of avoiding public places. Ewing remains jailed, awaiting more sex crime-related trials scheduled for June, August and October. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Well, we feel you, because one-too-many skipped products and a billion mad dashes to work later, and our beauty-loving selves have officially had enough. Basically, we want beauty products that are faster, easier, and all-around better, because we just don’t have the time or patience anymore. So we asked for recommendations from the absolute experts of busy mornings: moms. MORE: 30 Best Inspo Photos for Every Type of Lob We chatted with 11 real moms, including stay-at-home entrepreneurs, dermatologists, and beauty vloggers, to find out which beauty products they swear by for their craziest of days, and trust us—they’re seriously good. So whether you’re looking for a brow-defining pomade that’s so easy to use, one mom can draw it on while in the car to work, or a lightweight concealer that another mom swears by for hiding all of her darkest circles, these 12 products are about to become your newest time-saving investments. Click through to see (OK, let’s be real, buy) them all, and be prepared to hit snooze for the first time in years. That is, unless your kids wake you up, first. MORE: The 7 Best Concealers Makeup Artists Swear By 0 Thoughts? 1 of 12 For bold, easy-to-create brows... “This my staple product. It’s long-lasting, a perfect match for my eyebrow shade, easy to clean up, and it always gives me nice, strong eyebrows. Plus, it’s a cream-based formula, which is a lot more easy to maneuver than a powder-based one. I do a lot of my makeup routine in the car after I’ve dropped off my kids, and this brow pomade is really easy to apply on the go." - Tiffany Brown, makeup artist, style blogger, and mother of two (ages six and three) Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade, $18; at Anastasia Beverly Hills Photo: Anastasia Beverly Hills To hide dark circles and exhaustion... “Every morning is different at our house, but they always fly by. In between getting my son out of bed, changing his diaper, and feeding him breakfast, I leave him in his high chair and apply a few coats of Maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealer—it’s seriously my everything. As a mom, you’re obviously always tired, but this concealer immediately makes me look awake and it’s so easy to quickly swipe under my eyes." - Brittanny Travers, full-time mom to a 20-month-old Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Concealer, $9.99; at Maybelline Photo: Maybelline To immediately zap oily, shiny skin... “This has quickly become one of my must-have products—if only I had it in high school when I was blotting my face throughout every class! It’s a true, oily-skin lifesaver, and it leaves my face feeling matte, but never dry. Whether I’m layering makeup over it or leaving the house bare faced, this moisturizer gives me one less thing to worry about in the mornings." - Samantha Robinson, beauty vlogger at Saaammage and mother of two (ages three and five) La Roche-Posay Effaclar Mattifying Moisturizer, $31.99; at La Roche-Posay Photo: La Roche-Posay For fast cleansing, toning, and moisturizing... “This product cleanses, removes eye makeup, tones, and moisturizes, and the best part is that you don’t have to rinse it off. If I’m in a hurry in the morning, it’s lovely to not have to spend time washing my face with a cleanser and water. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized, never greasy in the least bit, and it smells delightful. It’s also very affordable and ideal for traveling, since you’re basically getting three products in one bottle.” - Sunny Hatchett, full-time mother of two (ages eight months and nine) Vichy Purete Thermale 3-In-1 No-Rinse Micellar Solution, $19.50; at Vichy Photo: Vichy For brightening and pore-clearing... “I use this mask about once week, especially when I feel like I need a little deep cleaning. The clay pulls out all of the yucky build-up on my skin, and I feel like it really gives my complexion an all-over glow. It smells so good, almost like a spa, that I’ll forget it’s on my face and then 30 minutes have already gone by. Sometimes I’ll even dab it on a few zits that are driving me crazy and leave it on while I sleep.” - Samantha Wennerstrom, styler blogger of Could I Have That and mother to a two-year-old African Botanics Murula Mineral Cleansing Mask, $89; at African Botanics Photo: African Botanics To zap oily hair immediately... "I try to avoid washing my hair daily, especially since it's very thin and oily, so finding the perfect dry shampoo has been an ongoing mission of mine. But as soon as I started using this dry shampoo, I was able to go a full two days without washing my hair—which this busy mom is definitely not complaining about!" - Claudia Felix Garay, fashion blogger of The Penny Closet and mother to an eight-month-old  Kristin Ess Style Reviving Dry Shampoo, $14; at Target Photo: Kristin Ess For skin brightening and wrinkle prevention... “Along with a sunscreen, I always layer on an antioxidant in the morning, since they help brighten your complexion and also prevent free radicals from damaging your collagen, which can lead to wrinkles. This formula is so light on the skin, and unlike other products I’ve experimented with, it doesn’t break me out. Plus, the gel comes in a pump bottle, so when I’m in a mad rush in the morning, I don’t have to worry about knocking it over!" - Cori Zeichner, full-time mom of two (ages six and four) and beauty blogger of The Derm Wife Skinceuticals Phloretin CF Gel, $165; at Skinceuticals Photo: Skinceuticals To even out your complexion and prevent damage... “I love a tinted product with a high dose of SPF, because it saves me the extra step of having to apply makeup in addition to sunscreen. This one feels weightless on the skin, and the coverage is as good as any foundation I’ve used. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it." -C.Z. La Mer The Reparative Skintint SPF 30, $95; at La Mer Photo: La Mer To tame frizz and stop flyaways... “My all-time favorite hair product right now is Living Proof Nourishing Styling Cream—I literally put it on every time I get out of the shower. Since I’m a mom, I rarely have a chance to blow dry my hair, which is difficult since I also have super-thick, curly hair that requires some work. But this product smooths all my frizz and also prevents flyaways.” - Rachel Girsch, CFO of specialty contracting company and mother of two (ages three and two months) Living Proof Nourishing Styling Cream, $37; at Living Proof Photo: Living Proof To gently cleanse and moisturize... “This really is the gentlest cleanser out there—I use it to wash my face and body, and even use it as a shaving gel. A bar of soap doesn't sound moisturizing, but this one really is, because it actually deposits lipids into your skin that are identical to the lipids that naturally occur in your body. Just because a fancy cleanser is $75, it doesn’t mean it’s good for your skin." - Mona Gohara, dermatologist and mother of two (ages ten and eight) Dove White Beauty Bar, $6.88; at Walmart Photo: Dove For a subtle, bronze-y glow... “I think a nice, healthy glow automatically adds definition to your face, so I love using Nars Bronzing Powder in Laguna. My makeup routine varies since I do TV and video work, but I swirl on this bronzer for even my most casual days, since it immediately gives you a fresh, put-together look without seeming like you tried too hard.” - Amanda, vlogger at AmandaMuse and mother of two (ages five and three) Nars Bronzing Powder in Laguna, $40; at Nars Photo: Nars For long-lasting, yet washable, lash definition... “This mascara truly never smears. I can put it on at 7:30 a.m., and it looks just as good at 10:30 p.m. when I wash it off. The formula isn’t goopy, and it washes off in pieces rather than smearing all over my face or ruining my towels like other mascaras do. I’ve been using it exclusively for five years, and I love it.” - Courtney Maron, managing director of media investment and mother of two (ages three and five) Trish McEvoy Lash Curling Mascara, $31.50; at Trish McEvoy Photo: Trish McEvoy Next slideshow starts in 10s Even Bella Hadid Is Into This Preppy Throwback Print 0 GOT THOUGHTS?

The recent surge in blockchain applications has therefore inevitably sparked discussions about how this technology can be used to enhance procurement and supply operations. The most basic description of a blockchain is a secure digital ledger on which transactions can be made and recorded. Digital ledgers of course are not a new concept, but the difference with blockchain technology is that it is not based on a single or central ledger but decentralised ones in which stakeholders on all sides of a transaction are able to make and record transactions. The technology has so far been synonymous with the digital currency bitcoin but its practical uses stretch beyond financial transactions. Practical applications of blockchain technology for the procurement and supply profession are numerous and can be grouped around two main areas; Procure-to-Pay (P2P) In the P2P sphere, blockchain technology would be perfectly suited to manage invoice payment and validation without the need for third party reconciliation. It could also be integrated into the management of Smart Contracts whereby contracts are executed automatically and performance of suppliers against service level agreements are managed and verified automatically. The tamper-proof nature of blockchains can enable automated transactions when preset conditions are met, eliminating the need for masses of paperwork and man-hours, and in the long term, helping to establish credible predictors of procurement patterns, and budget and inventory requirements. Supplier Relationship Management Risk Management, Pre-qualification and supplier Compliance are vital elements of the procurement cycle in the modern age. As blockchain allows continuous access to update records, data and information, this would prove to be an intuitive method of managing supplier validation processes in real time. Stakeholder Protection From a legal perspective, while internet-based databases enable each stage of the supply chain process to be logged and transmitted across stakeholders, what is particularly significant about a blockchain is that the verification and authentication of each transaction can be directly linked to the execution of the transaction itself. The ‘trust layer’ in blockchains requiring authentication with each transaction before execution allows for real-time validations of transactions as they are processed and because blockchains cannot be unilaterally tampered with, the risk of fraud and malpractice can be reduced. Furthermore, the transparency and traceability features of blockchains can create a digital footprint with an interlocking set of digital passports throughout the entire production life cycle enabling auditability and, from a regulatory perspective, enabling governments and regulators to monitor best practice from ethical supply routes to shipping standards. Emerging challenges The major barrier to the effective adoption of blockchain in procurement processes and supply chains is the lack of common standards over blockchain use that are uniformly deployed cross-border and multi-jurisdictionally. Indeed this has been a core component of the conversation around regulation of blockchain in financial services and it is self-evident that the need for global standards are particularly required when dealing with international transportation and procurement processes. This will be the next frontier from a legal and regulatory perspective and key to whether blockchain technology becomes scalable commensurate with its potential. Blockchains are already making their way into the field. Walmart experimented with the technology last year to track down contaminated food sources while Brighann Cotton are using blockchains to validate the delivery of cotton via sea freight with the information recorded on the blockchain automatically updating smart contracts linked to the transaction. The practical uses of blockchains within the procurement and supply chain practice are numerous and there are ways that the technology can be used within the field that have not yet even been thought of. Such a solution with a ‘single version of the truth’ is a technology not for tomorrow but for today, and we believe it is here to stay. — Sam Achampong, Regional Director, Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS) MENA, and Samuel Thampapillai, Financial Services Disputes & Investigations Associate, Eversheds.

Parents can also download an app to help them find the closest feeding site to them. Information will be posted here later this week on locations and app. “We had a lot of success last year with the app to help parents find the site,” says Carver. “We will have about 90 sites throughout the summer that will be open for different dates. We will average about 3,000 meals a day serving breakfast and/or lunch at the various locations, Monday through Friday. We do serve at least 3 hot meals a week, popular foods that kids like such as hamburgers, pizza and chicken sandwiches. “We are excited to be out in the community and helping kids have a healthy, good summer. Kids can lose up to 10-15% of their body weight during the summer because they do not eat properly. So when they start school, they are often not healthy and get sick more often. We try to keep them healthy during the summer by eating well.” The YMCA partners with both schools in the program. They will be hosting outreach programs with FCS at five different locations this summer including the Tamassee Apartments in West Rome, Alto Park School (under the oak tree), North Broad Youth Academy, Gilbreath Center in Lindale and Restoration Rome (former Southeast Elementary). “At each outreach location, we will be providing lunch and two-hours of activities on Monday through Friday, all summer long,” says Stephanie McElhone with YMCA. “We are grateful to our local and national partners such as Walmart, Tyson Foods, International PAper, RACA and the Commission on Children and Youth who help make this possible.” Donations and volunteers are still needed to help with the YMCA outreach camps. Please contact McElhone at 706-232-2468 or email: smcelhone@ymcarome.org.   Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Related Filed Under: Bartow, Education, Gordon, Polk ← Buzz: City and County Commission meetings this week, Memorial Day holiday garbage pick-up schedule Blast from the past: Work under way at 247 Broad St. showcases ‘The Vogue’ sign from years ago.

By Robin Scher / AlterNet May 16, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: InesBazdar/Shutterstock Ever suffered from a foodborne illness? Fevered sweats, paralyzing stomach cramps, nausea, and a strong aversion to the smell, taste and general presence of the offending food for years to come are just a few of the symptoms which demarcate that special circle of hell reserved for this form of malady. If you’ve been spared such a fate, consider yourself one of the lucky few. Statistically, one in six Americans—about 48 million people—are affected by foodborne illness every year. This number, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, translates to a total of 128,000 hospitalizations and over 3,000 annual deaths. The World Health Organization estimates that globally, 420,000 people die from eating contaminated food.  While these numbers tend to vary, the causes do not. In general, foodborne illness comes from harmful bacteria, toxins or foreign substances that find their way into food. The main reasons for this, as explained on Healthline.com, can generally be attributed to one of four main factors: improper food handling unsafe practices on farms contamination during manufacturing or distributing contamination in stores Some might recall the infamous E. coli outbreak that took place at Chipotle Mexican Grill outlets across the Pacific Northwest. Nearly two-dozen people were sickened, resulting in the chain shuttering 43 of its locations. This is just one of many examples of the type of outbreaks that take place throughout the U.S. on a regular basis. For the morbidly curious, here are the causes of seven recent cases of food recalls that have taken place across the land. 1. Salmonella Who doesn’t like a quick and convenient home-cooked meal from Banquet? Here’s who: the poor souls who ended up sick after eating the brownie mix dessert included in the brand’s breaded chicken nugget meals. The story goes that Conagra Brands Inc., the company that produces this frozen meal, was informed by a supplier that one of the ingredients used to produce its dessert mix may have been contaminated with Salmonella, a bacteria that causes not only food sickness, but also typhoid fever. The company has since alerted the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), who went on to issue a national warning about the problem, which has affected an estimated 110,817 pounds of frozen meals. You may have dodged this bullet, but chances are you’ve encountered Salmonella at some stage. People infected with Salmonella tend to develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection, subsequently suffering for 4 to 7 days. The CDC estimates that Salmonella accounts for up to one million foodborne illnesses in the U.S. every year. While the majority of these patients remain at home, Salmonella poisoning ends up putting 19,000 people a year in the hospital—and in the most extreme cases, leads to an average of 380 deaths, according to CDC counts. 2. Clostridium botulinum The FDA has announced the recall of the Lemongrass and Shrimp Satay sauces produced by TP Food Processing, Inc. of Westminster, Calif. The acidified sauces, which come in 9-ounce hexagon glass jars with red lids, were recalled after the company discovered a batch had not been “properly produced,” which made them “susceptible to contamination with Clostridium botulinum," bacterium that can produce the neurotoxin botulinum, the most powerful known toxin. At present there have been no reported cases of illness. Had there been any cases of outbreak, the consequences would be severe. Botulism, the rare paralytic illness caused by this bacteria, leads to blurred vision and muscle paralysis. The last reported outbreak of botulism in nearly 40 years took place in 2015 in Fairfield County, Ohio due to some improperly home-canned potatoes used to make salad for a church potluck. 3. Listeria Around 8,822 pounds of ready-to-eat ham products was recently recalled by Memphis, Tennessee's Fineberg Packing Co., Inc. The offending meat—hickory smoked and BBQ ham—was taken off the shelves of retail outlets in Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Florida and Wisconsin following the discovery that it may have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, a deadly bacteria that is particularly nasty, as it's able to survive without oxygen. Listeria infections generally tend to affect people with weakened immune systems, such as young children and the elderly. It can also affect healthy individuals in the short-term, leading to fevers, headaches, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. In the case of pregnant women, Listeria infection can also lead to miscarriage. On average, around 1,600 people come down with the illness from this bacteria, known as listeriosis, each year, with around 260 deaths. 4. A magnet Yep, you read that right. After a metal magnet was found in the “beef trim source product” of some Uncle John’s Pride processed sausages, the Tampa-based company was forced to recall 139,909 pounds of its ready-to-eat smoked meat and poultry sausages from retail locations in Alabama, Florida and Georgia, according to FSIS. The contamination remains an isolated incident. 5. Golf balls If there’s one hole you don’t ever want to land a golf ball in, it’s your mouth. McCain Foods USA recently learned that the hard way when it had to recall its frozen hash browns after receiving complaints that the product was contaminated with “extraneous golf ball materials.” In a recall notice issued through the Food and Drug Administration, McCain explained that despite its “stringent supply standards [the golf balls] may have been inadvertently harvested with potatoes used to make this product." The offending hash browns were stocked at Marianos, Metro Market and Pick ‘n Save supermarkets in Illinois and Wisconsin. 6. Rubber and plastic The Miami Herald recently reported the recall of 35,168 pounds of Jose Ole Taquitos Beef Carne De Res that contained some “wayward rubber.” The offending product, produced by Ajinomoto Windsor, was recalled after two customers found “rubber and white plastic from processing equipment” that may have gotten caught up in the beef during production. The 60-ounce bags containing the taquitos were recalled from shops stocking the product in Florida, California, Illinois, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming. 7. Dead bat Saving the best for last, or more accurately, the bat for last: Two Floridians were recently shocked to find that their Fresh Express salad from Walmart contained, ahem, a bat more than they could chew. Last month, the customers prepared to dig into their Organic Marketside Spring Mix salad when lo and behold they discovered some dead bat remains, prompting a CDCl recall and investigation. While the CDC confirmed that both people had eaten “some of the salad before the bat was found,” there have been no signs of ill health or rabies. Now that you’re feeling adequately grossed out, here are a couple of handy tips for avoiding foodborne illness. In general when preparing food, one should stick to the following four steps for keeping food safe: Wash your hands and surfaces when preparing food. To avoid cross-contamination, keep food ingredients separate. Make sure to cook food to proper temperatures, checking with a food thermometer if necessary. Make sure to always refrigerate promptly. There are a number of other precautions worth taking into account. The United States Department of Agriculture has provided a comprehensive list of advice for keeping bad things out of your stomach.

The runners were made and donated by Kaye Foster. (Iva Kay Horner/News-Tribune) It was a night when the phrase, "cold hands, warm hearts" was indeed true. Even the frigid temperatures experienced Saturday night did not deter residents and the business community from coming together to help the family of five-month-old Taylor Grace Fry. At the annual Brush Young Farmers fundraiser event, the community and business gave from their hearts to donate $9,200 to the family of the daughter of Matt and Holly Fry and sister of six-year-old Emily, of Brush. Adding $2,000 to the event was Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, whose goal, member Joan Pearson explained, is "to provide assistance for fundraisers for those in need." She continued, "We're happy to have supported and been a part of this for all seven years." Among the many items presented to bidders by local auctioneers Jim Odle and John Clatworthy were a Monte White print, several gift certificates, a rolling tool cart, dog food, tools, jewelry, a photography session, stuffed animals, gift baskets, children's hats, candles, a 19-inch television, baby/children quilts, gift baskets, half a beef, Broncos items, a cord of firewood, a Miche handbag, behind-the-chute tickets to the Denver Stock Show, a children's wagon, sets of cocktail glasses, a complete set of table runners and a four-month-old Great Dane pup - all donated by residents and area businesses. A portion of the funds raised are designated for the Fry family to help pay for Taylor's health expenses as she was diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome when she was born on June 27. Advertisement CHARGE, a genetic condition caused by a mutation in a single gene, stands for Coloboma of the eye, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retardation of growth and/or development, Genital and/or urinary abnormalities, as well as Ear abnormalities and deafness. At 3-days-old, Taylor underwent open heart surgery where surgeons placed a shunt in her single ventricle to distribute oxygenated blood from her heart to her body more efficiently. Although the surgery helped, she will undergo another surgery at eight-months-old. At a week old, she had nasal surgery because her nasal passage from the top of her ears to the top  of  her  throat did not develop properly. Since then, she has undergone two other surgeries on her nose to alleviate more nasal obstructions. In addition, Taylor also had a tracheostomy to relieve upper respiratory distress. While Taylor was not able to be present for the fundraiser because she remains hospitalized, Matt told those attending, "We thank everyone for all of the support, prayers, generosity and for braving the cold. We pray that Taylor is home by Christmas time." “We all can pray for them," Brush Young Farmer member Dan Kendrick said at the benefit. "Keep them in your prayers." Serving as sponsors for the annual event were Olde Tyme Country Store, Hummingbird Press, Morgan County Commissioners, Griffith Dairy, Brush Grocery Kart, Leprino Foods, Wal-Mart, Frito Lay and the First Christian Church of Fort Morgan. Donations can be made by contacting either Dan Kendrick at 768-3265, Ryan Draegert at 380-7926, Pat Draegert at 380-4728, Dodie Endsley at 768-3126, Steve Griffith at 380-9346, Kevin Hansen at 768-1368 or Bruce Bass at 768-6630. If sending a check, make it payable to: Brush Young Farmers Benefit, c/o Ag Instructor Miss Johnson, P.O. Box 585, Brush, CO 80723.
