College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Wal-Mart Stores E-Commerce Sales Surge 63% The retail titan's online growth accelerated sharply in the first quarter. Joe Tenebruso (TMFGuardian) May 19, 2017 at 6:14PM Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT) reported fiscal 2018 first-quarter results on May 19. The retail giant's e-commerce strategy is gaining momentum, boosted by recent acquisitions and a renewed focus on its online operations. Wal-Mart Stores results: The raw numbers Metric Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $117.542 billion $115.904 billion 1.4% Operating income $5.237 billion $5.275 billion (0.7%) Earnings per share $1.00 $0.98 2% Data source: Wal-Mart Stores Q1 2018 earnings press release. Image source: Wal-Mart Stores. What happened with Wal-Mart Stores this quarter? Total revenue rose 1.4% to $117.5 billion, and 2.5% on a constant currency basis. U.S. comparable-store sales -- excluding the impact of fuel prices -- edged up 1.4%, driven by a 1.5% increase in traffic. Fueling these results was a staggering 69% surge in Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales. The retailer moved aggressively in August to acquire fast-growing e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion, and soon after installed Jet co-founder and CEO Marc Lore as head of its U.S. e-commerce business. Since that time, Wal-Mart has scooped up several other online retailers, including ShoeBuy.com, outdoor gear retailer Moosejaw, and women's apparel seller ModCloth. Wal-Mart is also reportedly in talks to buy e-commerce apparel company Bonobos. Yet CEO Doug McMillon says that these acquisitions have only supplemented Wal-Mart's strong organic e-commerce growth: The acquisitions have received a lot of attention but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. E-commerce sales growth at Walmart U.S. was 63%, the company reported, with the majority organic through Walmart.com. McMillon went on to note that Wal-Mart.com continues to ramp up its selection of goods, and now has 50 million items for consumers to choose from compared to 10 million a year ago. Additionally, Wal-Mart recently introduced free two-day shipping for orders of $35 or more, and launched a new service that allows customers to order products online and receive a discount for picking them up at its stores. "We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers," said McMillon during Wal-Mart's earnings call. Those efforts appear to be succeeding, as evidenced by Wal-Mart's explosive online growth and steady in-store traffic gains. Still, the investments Wal-Mart is making in its digital and store-improvement initiatives are weighing on its margins; first-quarter operating income fell 0.7% year over year to $5.2 billion. Despite the lower profits, Wal-Mart's cash generation remains strong, with the retail titan generating $5.4 billion in operating cash flow and $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter. That -- combined with the more than $6.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet -- allowed Wal-Mart to return $3.7 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Looking forward For the second quarter, Wal-Mart expects comparable-store sales growth (excluding fuel) of 1.5% to 2% for its U.S. locations and 1% to 1.5% at its Sam's Club locations. The company also anticipates earnings per share will be between $1.00 and $1.08. "We're encouraged with our start to the year," added McMillon. "We have momentum across the business. We're making progress and we know we're on the right track." Joe Tenebruso has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Login Search Not Every Retailer is Suffering This Earnings Season May 19, 2017, 03:31:00 PM EDT By Sheraz Mian, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo It has been the accepted wisdom for a while that it is only a question of time before Amazon mops up the traditional brick-and-mortar retailer's every last sales dollar. I am obviously exaggerating here, but we have been seeing the 'Amazon effect' in a host of retail sub-industries in recent years. Many have been thinking that what happened to Barnes & Noble and other booksellers is the fate of most traditional retailers; we certainly have seen the once-mighty operators like Macy's ( M ) in the department store space and Wal-Mart ( WMT ) in the big-box discounter industry humbled in recent years. You can see this in the stock market performance of these players - Amazon shares are up +37.7% in the past year while Macy's is down -26.7% in that same time period. Wal-Mart shares have done better - they are up +13% over the past year - largely because market participants have come around lately to see its digital strategy as credible. The retail giant has not only been steadily making investments in its online operations, but also strengthening its legacy through investments in employees and cleaner and more organized floor space. This has started showing up in Wal-Mart's earnings results, as we saw in the company's strong Q1 earnings report. But it's safe to say that Wal-Mart still has a long way to go before it can effectively fend off the Amazon challenge. One could argue that what has started working for Wal-Mart should work for Macy's as well. But their brick-and-mortar commonality aside, they are fundamentally different businesses. Wal-Mart may bring in foot traffic through its enormous groceries business, but there is increasingly less reason for consumers to visit Macy's, other department stores or even the malls. We are seeing this issue with a host of other mall-based retailers as well, which is giving rise to the 'death of the mall' narrative. We should be mindful, however, that as weak as the mall-based retail space has been lately, some of these mall-based players have been able to make it work. Strong results from The Children's Place ( PLCE ) and Gap ( GPS ) prove this point. But for every Children's Place winner, you have a host of mall-based Foot Locker ( FL ) losers that are forced to blame everything - from delayed tax refunds and Easter Day placements to the weather - but their inability to respond to changing consumer behavior. On a related note, the Foot Locker disappointment may have read-throughs for Nike ( NKE ) and Under Armour ( UAA ) as well.   Retail Sector Scorecard As of Friday, May 19th, we now have Q1 results from 33 of the 42 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these 33 retailers are up +1.5% from the same period last year on +2.9% higher revenues, with 63.6% beating EPS estimates and 54.5% beating revenue estimates. Please note that we have a stand-alone Retail sector, unlike the official Standard & Poor's placement of this space in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The Zacks Retail sector includes, besides the traditional department stores and other brick-and-mortar retailers, the online vendors like Amazon and restaurant operators. The side-by-side charts below compare the sector's results thus far with what we have seen from the same group of 33 retailers in other recent periods. The aggregate results from the 33 retailers that have reported Q1 results already are tracking below what we had seen from the same companies in other recent periods. This is despite the +41.1% growth in Amazon's earnings on +22.6% higher revenues. On an ex-Amazon basis, the sector's Q1 earnings growth would be flat, as the right-hand chart below shows. A few standout results notwithstanding, the sector's Q1 results have been notably weak in an otherwise strong earnings season. Please note that the proportion of Retail sector companies beating EPS estimates (63.6%) is the third lowest in the entire S&P 500 index, while the proportion of revenue surprises (54.5%) is the fourth lowest of all 16 Zacks sectors.   Q1 Earnings Scorecard As of Friday, May 19th, we have Q1 results from 472 S&P 500 members that combined account for 96.9% of the index's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up +13.7% from the same period last year on +7.2% higher revenues, with 72.5% beating EPS estimates and 65.7% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 51.7%. The table provides the current earnings season scorecard, as of May 19th, 2017. Comparing Q1 Results The chart below provides a comparison of the growth performance thus far with what we have seen from this same group of 472 S&P 500 members in other recent periods. As you can see, the Q1 growth pace is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 472 index members in other recent periods. Importantly, the growth performance is broad-based and not narrowly concentrated. We got the leadership from the Finance space earlier in the reporting cycle, but the baton has since shifted to Tech and host of other areas, including Industrials, Basic Materials, and Energy. Positive Revenue Surprises The chart below compares the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises in Q1 thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 472 index members in other recent periods. The proportion of Q1 companies beating EPS estimates is tracking above historical periods, with positive revenue surprises particularly coming out ahead of what we are used to seeing in the recent past. You can see the same in the chart below that compares the proportion of Q1 companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates with other recent periods. Expectations for Q1 As a Whole Looking at Q1 as whole, combining the actual results from the 472 S&P 500 members that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come 28 index members, total earnings are expected to be up +13.1% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues. This would follow +7.3% earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on +4.7%. The table below shows the summary picture for Q1, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q4. Please note that the Q1 earnings season follows the strong showing on the earnings front in the preceding reporting cycle. Not only did 2016 Q4 growth reach the highest in two years, but total earnings for the quarter also reached a new quarterly record. The strong Q4 performance came after the first positive earnings growth in 2016 Q3, having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters. The strong Q1 showing represents a notable acceleration in the growth momentum. The chart below shows the Q1 earnings growth contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, this growth pace is expected to continue through the rest of the year. Estimates for the current period (2017 Q2) have come down since the start of the quarter, but the magnitude of negative Q2 revisions still compares favorably with the comparable periods over the last two years. In other words, Q2 estimates are falling, but they aren't falling by as much as would typically be expected. Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Key Takeaways From Wal-Mart’s Q1 Earnings Shutterstock photo Wal-Mart ( WMT ) reported mixed fiscal first quarter results on Thursday, as its bottom line beat analyst expectations but revenue missed. On a reported basis, the company’s revenue increased 1.4% year over year (y-o-y) to $117.5 billion, driven by growth in the domestic market due to its marketplace offerings, partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations. The retailer’s consolidated net income declined marginally to $3 billion in the first quarter. Wal-Mart also posted earnings per share of $1.00, up 2% y-o-y, which was near the upper end of its guidance range. Wal-Mart’s e-commerce sales grew an impressive 63% y-o-y, a significant improvement from 29% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. In terms of the company’s segments, Wal-Mart U.S. delivered a strong top line performance with comparable sales of 1.4%, which exceeded the consensus estimates of 1.3%. However, the retailer’s international sales were down 4% y-o-y to $27 billion during the quarter, driven by sales headwinds from the divestment of businesses – Yihaodian in China and Suburbia in Mexico. In addition, Sam’s Club comparable sales grew 1.6% y-o-y (ex. fuel) in the quarter. On the cost side, Wal-Mart’s total operating expenses increased in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing investments in e-commerce and technology. For the first quarter, Wal-Mart generated $5.3 billion in operating cash flow and $3.4 billion of free cash flow, which declined 15% y-o-y. This decline was primarily due to an increase in incentive payments, as well as a comparison against significant working capital changes last year. Wal-Mart U.S. Continues To Grow In Wal-Mart U.S., strong comparable sales growth of 1.4% was driven by a 1.5% increase in customer traffic. However, the average ticket size declined slightly. Overall, all store formats had positive comparable sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment in the first quarter. Additionally, Wal-Mart also reported positive comparable growth in groceries, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food, excluding price investments. In addition, the segment’s operating income increased 0.9% y-o-y during the quarter. E-Commerce : Strong Growth Driver Wal-Mart’s e-commerce division includes all web-initiated transactions, including those through Walmart.com such as ship-to-home, ship-to-store, pick up today, and online grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com. Globally, on a constant currency basis, the company’s e-commerce sales and GMV increased 63% and 69% (including acquisitions), respectively, in this quarter. The majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com, and was likely boosted by the company’s two-day delivery initiatives. From a marketplace perspective, the company covers more than 35 million SKUs to date. Future Outlook For the upcoming quarter, Wal-Mart expects comparable sales growth for Wal-Mart U.S. to range between 1.5% to 2.0%, and Sam’s Club (ex. fuel) comparable sales to range between 1.0% to 1.5%. Additionally, the company also expects earnings per share in the range of $1.00 to $1.08 in the second quarter.

Gray Hall reports during Action News at 5pm on May 19, 2017. (WPVI) WPVI Friday, May 19, 2017 06:18PM QUAKERTOWN, Pa. (WPVI) -- A man is under arrest after he allegedly opened fire on an occupied car in a Walmart parking lot. Brandon Grosso, 32, was arrested late Thursday night at a motel in Milford Township, Bucks County. Police say he shot at a car occupied by a Barb Lavin and her 22-year-old son, Sean, in the parking lot of the Walmart store in Quakertown earlier in the evening. They were not injured. "I called 911 right away," Sean said, "and I said 'I just have been shot at.'" It was a close call. Police say they could have been killed. "The police did tell me that one inch lower, or me moving a little bit differently, the angle of my car, and I would not be here," Barb said. Police say Grosso was first involved in an incident at a Yum Yum bake shop along Broad Street in Quakertown. Investigators wouldn't go into to detail about that incident, but the Lavin family says Grosso was spotted in the area with a gun and people called 911. They encountered him in the parking lot of the nearby Walmart. Things escalated quickly. "I didn't actually realize that he used a gun on the car at first. I thought he threw a rock at my car. Then I asked my son if we were hit, and he said 'yes,' and my back window was all shattered," Barb said. Barb says Grosso was driving aggressively and tried to pass her. She was afraid and sped up. But instead of just driving off, Grosso allegedly followed her, and fired that shot from inside his car. Barb said she had just dropped off her daughter at work. "I am just glad someone up there was watching over me, because clearly they were from the angle where that bullet shot was," said Sean. Just hours after the shooting, police were able to track down Grosso and take him in to custody without incident. "As soon as I found out he was caught, I am like 'Okay, there is relief right there. I don't have to be paranoid anymore." "I hope he gets a lot of help. I truly do. I hope whatever was wrong with him, I hope he gets the help," said Barb. Grosso was being held on $150,000 bail. ---------- Send a breaking news alert Report a correction or typo Learn more about the 6abc apps Related Topics: newspennsylvania newsshooting Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2017 WPVI-TV.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Key Takeaways From Wal-Mart’s Q1 Earnings Shutterstock photo Wal-Mart ( WMT ) reported mixed fiscal first quarter results on Thursday, as its bottom line beat analyst expectations but revenue missed. On a reported basis, the company’s revenue increased 1.4% year over year (y-o-y) to $117.5 billion, driven by growth in the domestic market due to its marketplace offerings, partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations. The retailer’s consolidated net income declined marginally to $3 billion in the first quarter. Wal-Mart also posted earnings per share of $1.00, up 2% y-o-y, which was near the upper end of its guidance range. Wal-Mart’s e-commerce sales grew an impressive 63% y-o-y, a significant improvement from 29% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. In terms of the company’s segments, Wal-Mart U.S. delivered a strong top line performance with comparable sales of 1.4%, which exceeded the consensus estimates of 1.3%. However, the retailer’s international sales were down 4% y-o-y to $27 billion during the quarter, driven by sales headwinds from the divestment of businesses – Yihaodian in China and Suburbia in Mexico. In addition, Sam’s Club comparable sales grew 1.6% y-o-y (ex. fuel) in the quarter. On the cost side, Wal-Mart’s total operating expenses increased in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing investments in e-commerce and technology. For the first quarter, Wal-Mart generated $5.3 billion in operating cash flow and $3.4 billion of free cash flow, which declined 15% y-o-y. This decline was primarily due to an increase in incentive payments, as well as a comparison against significant working capital changes last year. Wal-Mart U.S. Continues To Grow In Wal-Mart U.S., strong comparable sales growth of 1.4% was driven by a 1.5% increase in customer traffic. However, the average ticket size declined slightly. Overall, all store formats had positive comparable sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment in the first quarter. Additionally, Wal-Mart also reported positive comparable growth in groceries, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food, excluding price investments. In addition, the segment’s operating income increased 0.9% y-o-y during the quarter. E-Commerce : Strong Growth Driver Wal-Mart’s e-commerce division includes all web-initiated transactions, including those through Walmart.com such as ship-to-home, ship-to-store, pick up today, and online grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com. Globally, on a constant currency basis, the company’s e-commerce sales and GMV increased 63% and 69% (including acquisitions), respectively, in this quarter. The majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com, and was likely boosted by the company’s two-day delivery initiatives. From a marketplace perspective, the company covers more than 35 million SKUs to date. Future Outlook For the upcoming quarter, Wal-Mart expects comparable sales growth for Wal-Mart U.S. to range between 1.5% to 2.0%, and Sam’s Club (ex. fuel) comparable sales to range between 1.0% to 1.5%. Additionally, the company also expects earnings per share in the range of $1.00 to $1.08 in the second quarter.

In a recent talk before students at St. Johnsbury Academy, Sen. Bernie Sanders declared that although we are living in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, “the nation’s wealth is in the hands of a privileged few,” producing what he called an “unfair and grotesque level of income inequality.” This is a familiar theme for Sanders, who has attacked the unworthy rich in every campaign he has run since 1972. His socialist playbook has always called for a sharp focus on perceived injustices that can motivate people to vote for redistribution of income and wealth from rich to poor. Its strategy is to make the incontestable fact that some people are rich, or just well-to-do, a source of resentment and envy among voters who have little or nothing. Then urge them to put socialists into power to redress this “unfair and grotesque” injustice, at the expense of unworthy others. The premise, of course, is that “the rich(er)” got that way by stealing the “surplus value” created by the labor of the working class. As an example of the unworthy rich, Sanders told the students that “the family who owns Wal-Mart alone possesses more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of all Americans combined.” The company’s stock has been publicly traded since 1970, but it’s certainly true that the heirs of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton (died 1992) have a greater collective net worth than the bottom 42 percent of all Americans combined, only part of which is Wal-Mart stock. Forbes magazine’s latest “Top Four Hundred” wealth ranking includes seven Wal-Mart heirs, who together have a net worth of $134 billion. (There may be others below Forbes’ $4 billion cutoff.) By comparison, the bottom 40 percent of U.S. households have a total net worth on the order of … zero. The Bernie Sanders household alone has a greater net worth than all of their fellow Americans in those two lower quintiles. Sam Walton’s strong principles, honesty, hard work, risk taking, innovation and concern for his co-workers built an astonishingly successful enterprise that has served the needs of millions of consumers, especially those on tight family budgets. And yes, the result was great inequality.   What’s so unfair about this? Let’s do a quick trip through Wal-Mart history. Sam Walton earned his way through college, served in World War II, and worked and saved to buy a Ben Franklin “five and dime” store in Newport, Arkansas (1950 pop. 6,000). After 17 years opening small stores in small towns, Sam hit on the idea of Wal-Mart. He opened the first one in Rogers, Arkansas, in 1962. As it developed over the years, Wal-Mart prospered by offering a wide range of products at prices attractive to rural small town and often lower-income customers. Sam’s innovations included an almost fanatic attention to squeezing out waste, driving hard bargains with suppliers on price, quantity and delivery, and installing a pioneering computerized inventory management system that brought goods to the shelves just before they were purchased by consumers. Sam created his own trucking fleet and regional distribution centers. Over time the company expanded with Sam’s Club, aimed at small business customers, Super Centers that include groceries, and online marketing. Wal-Mart’s motto is “everyday low prices,” and it operates almost entirely without advertising. Wal-Mart early adopted a profit-sharing plan. According to business historians Richard Vedder and Wendell Cox, “while profit sharing was offered partly to help keep out unions, Walton believed that the carrot of building an ownership interest in the company (financed by company contributions) did more to increase loyalty, stimulate innovation, and reduce employee turnover (and therefore training costs) than anything else he did.” Wal-Mart pays competitive retail industry wages in the localities it serves. The company also offers its employees contributions to 401(k) investment plans, tuition assistance, disability insurance, and a health plan that pays on average 75 percent of eligible employee premiums, 100 percent of preventive care costs, and employee-owned health savings accounts funded with $600 company contributions. As a result, Sam Walton’s heirs, and many of their longtime employees, became very wealthy, and make enormous charitable contributions. Last year the Walton Family Foundation announced it would grant $2 billion over the coming five years (in addition to corporate grants) to support environmental, education and community improvement projects. There is a lesson here, that the academy students surely will never hear from Bernie Sanders. Sam Walton’s strong principles, honesty, hard work, risk taking, innovation and concern for his co-workers built an astonishingly successful enterprise that has served the needs of millions of consumers, especially those on tight family budgets. And yes, the result was great inequality. Would a monopoly chain of taxpayer-capitalized, government-owned bureaucratically managed retail stores, created to put an end to “grotesque inequality,” be likely to achieve as much? Students, let’s have a vote: Sanders-Marts, or Wal-Marts? Recent Stories Legislative leaders criticize Gov.

Howard Ires Sam Walton’s heirs can make their enormous “charitable contributions” by paying employees so little they often qualify for government benefits. Bernie Sanders has never advocated for “government-owned bureaucratically managed retail stores,” he has advocated that businesses pay their employees a fair, livable wage so they don’t require food stamps to feed their families. He has advocated for fair, progressive taxation so the “heirs” who collect dividends of millions aren’t paying taxes at a lower rate than the managers who actually run the company. Karen Chickering yes, Howard Ires, and anyone defending Walmart for their wages and benefits needs to include some statistics about the PERCENTAGE of employees who are only allowed to work part-time, which also translates into none of those benefits Mr. McCloughry just praised so highly. I’ll take Bernie’s slant on Walmart any day over the lie of Walmart being an honest and worthy employer. Matt Young “Only allowed to work part time?” Does that mean employees cannot leave Walmart for greener pastures or work an additional job? John Grady Howard Ires “Bernie Sanders has never advocated for “government-owned bureaucratically managed retail stores,” He doesn’t have to because the people who own the businesses, own the government. http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/corporate_community.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlocking_directorate “Network diagram showing interlocks between various U.S. corporations and institutions and the Council on Foreign Relations, in 2004” https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/CFR-Interlocks-2004.jpg 55% of Groceries are sold by Wal-Mart here in Food Stamp Nation. In 25 years they took over the grocery business destroying how many union warehouse and trucking jobs ? Stay tuned for Aldi’s to crush the rest of the full line grocery stores. Limited selection and they don’t even bag peoples groceries. Desperate people working part time McJobs will seek out low cost food. We are being governed by the CFR. You-Tube has a video of Hillary admitting it. Trump was installed in the White House. John Grady I heard he married a bankers daughter and took full advantage of the economic situation created by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker who raised interest rates to 20% putting 10% of the labor force out of jobs so desperate people willing to work for minimum wage and no benefits enabled Sam to undercut existing retailers who had better paid union employee’s in distribution & trucking that had benefits like health insurance and pension plans. In the mid 1980’s I went to Bentonville Arkansas to their warehouse complex which was a bunch of wooden shacks on a former farm ? Pavement, yeah right. Set up like a Army Depot ? Did Sam get a deal from the government ? Truly amazing 3 companies from the back woods of hickville Arkansas took off to dominate industries and crush union jobs like Wal-Mart, J.B. Hunt trucking started by a 6 grade graduate with a loan from Mr Rockefeller and also Tyson Foods that now dominates meat packing after crushing the Meat Packers union by hiring illegal immigrants to become the largest meat packer for beef, pork and chicken. Yes the American Dream in action and just by chance 3 companies in the back woods of Arkansas crushed tons of Union Jobs and Bill Clinton just happened to be Governor and Hillary Clinton just Happened to sit of the Board of Directors of Wal-Mart and Sam’s father in law just happened to be a banker.

Janice Ohlsson I heard too of the many WalMart employees who had to use food stamps. I am not so sure his version of a WalMart employee is as rosey as he portrays. also WalMart gets many things from companies that manufacture outside US (OUS). How is that helping the US economy on a whole? Ray Mainer All Walmart did was to shift manufacturing from the USA to China. Mike Burnham Walmart has no factories Jay Eshelman RE: “Would a monopoly chain of taxpayer-capitalized, government-owned bureaucratically managed retail stores, created to put an end to “grotesque inequality,” be likely to achieve as much?” The problem with Mr. Sander’s point of view is that he compares one unique individual in our society to another unique person, when the more relevant point is to compare the progress of each individual’s standard of living over time. Are you better off today than you were a year ago, or ten years ago, or a generation ago? And why is Wal-Mart always the whipping boy for the envious masses who are unwilling to take the personal risks inherent in entrepreneurial dynamic economies? What about Apple, for example? Apple Inc., the education and social services technology darling, has enough cash on hand ($237 Billion+-, nearly all reportedly held overseas) to hire Wal-Mart’s 2.1 Million employees to sweep Apple’s office floors for a couple of years. Mike Burnham But Apple is progressive and liberal, that’s why. John Snell During Walmart’s huge expansion, especially throughout rural America, I watched as small town after small town dried up and blew away. Not entirely Sam W’s fault, but he was there to make a profit on the millions of small stores he helped close. I like to think even Sam would be horrified by what has come to pass. Personally, I vote for an income cap, maybe a million bucks per person; we could all earn more but it would go into a fund that would then pay for the incredible damage such wealth harvesting does to the planet and humanity. Karen Schwartz Key missing fact: % of part-time employees not eligible for that list of benefits. % of employees eligible for subsidized child care and Medicaid due to low wages. Mike Burnham Walmart did not invent part time jobs or low wages and is not the only business that offers both. John Grady Walmart The High Cost Of Low Price How Many Jobs Do Robots Destroy?

It seems many people in this country live in a fantasy dream world totally oblivious to reality. 4 young people died in the small Vermont town I live in. The media doesn’t cover it so all I can do is guess about suicides & drug overdoses which can also be suicide if that was the real intent. Dead bodies all over southern Vermont and the fantasy dream world people still cling to the make believe world they live in while living in total denial about what is going on here in McJob Nation. It’s surprising more people aren’t going postal. “Is the US facing an epidemic of ‘deaths of despair’? These researchers say yes” https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/28/deaths-of-despair-us-jobs-drugs-alcohol-suicide Insanity is doing the same thing over & over an expecting different results. American society is melting down, the future for the majority of young people & children is horrible looking yet we cling to our failing and obsolete SYSTEMS and defend the status quo instead of reinventing our society for the 21st Century. John Wagner Bernie Sanders is the most popular politician in America, and John McClaughry is… wait, who is he again? Oh yeah, the candidate for public office who has been soundly defeated in elections at every level in Vermont. John — let me also point out that Wal-Mart is the largest dependent on government aid of ANY US corporation; its employees (and therefore the owners) are subsidized by Section 8 housing vouchers (which Wal-Mart openly counsels their employees to use!), as well as food stamp, welfare, and Medicaid. Wal-Mart MAY offer health care to “eligible” employees (notice John’s use of the qualifying term) , but the company does not offer adequate healthcare to it workers at large. It’s nothing short of a crime that a tax provision is not in place to remove the ill-gotten wealth from the Wal-Mart family’s pockets and distribute it, in the form of fair wages and health care insurance, to the people who actually created that wealth. Matt Young If Bernie is the “most popular politician in America” wouldn’t he be our president? And we would all be getting everything for free… Lol Scott Greene There are too many counter points to even begin. Walmart started off with a Made in the USA campaign, and then became the “experts” of the shipping container based rural retail monopoly. They drove up an insane import/export deficit, all the while undermining any attempt at import tariffs. They also created one of the other wealthiest individuals in the world, whose wealth came simply from back hauling all of the left over cardboard. Why Sam Walton??? What about some other libertarian cause; protecting our privacy, resisting the creation of an authoritarian state, conserving our environmental well being, defending states rights………… David Ellenbogen To see how Walmart exploits our tax dollars to provide healthcare for their underpaid part-time employees, watch the film “Walmart – the High Cost of Low Price”. Dave Bellini Walmart or Bernie…… Let me think about that…… Who would be a better employer..??? “LOL” might be an accurate response. Neil Johnson 🙂 What is most sobering, the net worth of 40% of Americans is zero. This is BECAUSE they are on section 8, being tenants FOR life. We in Vermont could have $90k homes. A 4% mortgage at 30 years would be only $429.68 Then people would actually have a net worth. They could get ahead, they could pass on this home to children, who intern would immediately have more disposable income ON MINIUMUM wage than many people earning $60k per year. Why don’t we have it? ZONING and REGULATIONS don’t allow it. Instead our State is promoting tiny homes on landscape trailers, surely the way to economic prosperity. Matt Young Walmart would be a better employer, Bernie would go out of business pretty quickly. John Fairbanks Okay, let’s clarify some things here: First, Mr. Walton borrowed $20K in 1945 from his father-in-law (about $271K today) to purchase that franchise in Newport. While not quite in the same league as the kind of dough Mitt Romney or D.J. Trump got from their fathers, it’s still nice to have seed money to get you started. Second, Wal-Mart’s success is, at least in part, built on the use of child labor, as has been alluded to elsewhere on this thread and was documented in an NBC Dateline report in 1992. Even Mr. Walton admitted the “Made in America” campaign was something less than advertised. Third, income inequality is the product of both market forces (technology, out-sourcing, the transformation to a service economy) and public policy (taxation, for example), and the decline in workers’ power to negotiate, precipitated by the decline in unions, which Wal-Mart fought for decades. Mr. McClaughry’s economic analysis seems to boil down to, “shut up and work harder, peasants.” As a former hard-working peasant, I find that just a wee bit short of convincing. sue prent If I correctly understand your argument, it pretty much boils down to the Gordon Gecko position that “greed is good.” I disagree. Few great human achievements have resulted from greed, but many have been undone by it. Walmart does not have a particularly sterling reputation for treating either its suppliers or its hired help fairly. Many are the American companies that have been destroyed by the ruthless Walmart business model; and many are the Walmart employees who have been denied a living wage, job security, fair representation and reasonable benefits in Walmart’s race to the bottom. The astronomically over-compensated Walton family has built its wealth, not on the hard work of the family members, but on exploitation of a workforce with no other options, and on the captive buying force that they ultimately become for cheaply made goods sold in the “company store.” For the privilege of working at Walmart, this captive customer/workforce must accept low wages, uncertain hours, intimidation when they attempt to organize, and dismissal at the whim of management. The Walton’s interest in keeping the poor poor doesn’t end there. The family has long been heavy contributors in the political effort to end public education. ‘Looks like they may have finally bought their way with the appointment of fellow public education opponent Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary under Donald Trump. You ask: “Would a monopoly chain of taxpayer-capitalized, government owned bureaucratically managed retail stores, created to put an end to ‘grotesque inequality’, be likely to achieve as much?” Do you seriously think that Walmart is NOT a monopoly? The answer is “yes.” ‘Ever heard of the network of commissaries, BX and PX stores that serve the needs of American military families? Glenn Thompson That coming from a person who fought Walmart coming to St. Albans for years! How is that revitalization of downtown St. Albans looking now? Much of that funding came from Walmart….correct? sue prent It’s very pretty, but most of the practical downtown stores have closed. The city had to build a new hardware store in order to coax ACE into staying. We lost our only privately owned drugstore, our book &toy store, all of our clothing stores except second hand, our florist, our only department store, our dollar stores and several others. Glenn Thompson Having worked in Franklin County for 33 years, those stores most likely would have closed anyways with or without Walmart. The issue with Franklin County, a majority of my former colleagues either went on their shopping sprees to Chittenden County or Plattsburgh. Being out of there since 2010, I have no idea if anything has changed since Walmart moved in? I’m not a fan of Walmart period, and that one in St. Albans isn’t much different than the one in Williston. That being said, Franklin County needs to focus on attracting businesses to encourage area residents to shop nearby. The revitalized downtown area is a step in the right direction and should improve over time. If not, then there is something else going on in that community I’m not aware of. Matt Young I think some of the store closings may be more a product of online shopping. John Fairbanks There has been some pretty solid scholarly research in this area, including this, which is, more or less, hot off the presses: http://voxeu.org/article/economic-growth-us-tale-two-countries JohnGreenberg “AS A RESULT, Sam Walton’s heirs, and many of their longtime employees, became very wealthy ….” (Emphasis added) McClaughry’s equation of heirs to workers is incredibly misleading. Employees who became millionaires shared in the profits of the operation after years of hard work. That’s a great story. But Sam Walton’s heirs inherited the BILLIONS that Sam had accumulated without lifting a finger. They chose the right father. Americans believe “all men are created equal:” Each individual should have an equal opportunity to get rich regardless of their birth status. Our founders explicitly rejected the European aristocratic system, which passed wealth from generation to generation by inheritance. The real story of Walton’s heirs concerns individuals born rich beyond imagining because of tax policies which favor those best able to buy Congress, while hundreds of thousands of part-time workers have to receive government subsidies to make enough to live on, DESPITE working hard for the company. Matt Young Those complaining about the type of jobs being offered by Walmart or others should go into business and hire all of the people Walmart and others are treating so “horribly.” Obviously all of these workers would instantly leave Walmart and you would all make a fortune. Make everyone full time employees, pay the highest wages, give lots of paid vacations and the very best benefits. The job being performed and worker experience shouldn’t be considered when hiring. DougHoffer Mr. McClaughry noted Bernie’s “socialist playbook ” and efforts to “motivate people to vote for redistribution of income and wealth from rich to poor.” In the case of WalMart, the wealth moves in the other direction. WalMart’s aggressive tax avoidance schemes “cost state and local governments more than $400 million a year in lost revenue.” Who makes up the difference? http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/sites/default/files/docs/pdf/walmart_shiftingtheburden.pdf Jay Eshelman So it’s Walmart’s tax avoidance schemes, not the State’s excessive and inefficiently spent revenue, …..with no mention of the Walmart Foundation and its more than $1 Billion in annual charitable donations. It’s clear on which side of slice your bread is buttered…and we better not see you shopping at Walmart. David Bell “with no mention of the Walmart Foundation and its more than $1 Billion in annual charitable donations.” So, less than 1% of Walmart’s income…. yeah they just give until it hurts. It’s clear which side of slice your bread is buttered… and we’d better see you driving on those evil paved roads created by evil government. Jay Eshelman Please take the time to review (and understand) Walmart’s financial statements before making grossly inaccurate claims. In 2016, Walmart had $14.7 Billion in net income. The last time I checked my math, the Walmart Foundation’s $1 Billion+ in charitable donations was equal to more than 6.8% of its income….. 7 times more than your incorrect assessment. http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/wmt/financials?query=income-statement DougHoffer Not accurate. The company and the foundation are separate entities. BTW – WalMart Foundation did not give $1 billion in cash. The website says it gave $1.4 billion in 2014, but that $1 billion was in-kind and only $300 million in cash. Jay Eshelman P.S. Government doesn’t create our roads…taxpayers do. JohnGreenberg ‘Government doesn’t create our roads…taxpayers do.” Hunh? Taxpayers may pay the ultimate bills, but they don’t create roads without the intermediation of governments. Jay Eshelman Let’s hit on these equivocations all at once. RE: Intermediation = creation? Who are you kidding? Hard working Individuals and Businesses pay for our roads, period. They pay for the ‘intermediation’ too (politicians skimming their brokerage fees off the top), for what that’s worth. And don’t forget the private engineering and construction companies that actually do the road work? RE: $300 Million in cash and $1.1 Billion in ‘in kind’ contributions? OK. Kind of like donating food to the Food Bank, or clothing to Good Will, or construction materials to Habitat For Humanity…. and to the rest of those ‘worthless’ organizations. By your logic, these charities are just money laundering schemes. RE: “… that $1 billion [sic] was in-kind and only $300 million in cash.” OK, so it was $1.4 Billion in total Walmart charitable contributions. I stand corrected. The Walmart donation was 9.5% of net income, not 7%, and certainly not the paltry ‘less than 1%’ reported at first blush. JohnGreenberg Jay Eshelman: I’m not trying to kid anyone. Without government, there would be only toll roads, assuming they would be built on spec. Call it “intermediation,” “creation,” or even “spaghetti” (if you like), governments get roads built. And just as those “private engineering and construction companies” do their jobs only when they have contracts to be paid, so too government requires taxes to pay for them. Honestly, Jay, I don’t understand what you’re trying to get out. Spell it out for us. Jay Eshelman If you review the thread, you’ll see that I responded to Mr. Bell’s judgment that driving on roads was the same as shopping at Walmart, a perspective as illogical as the claim that ‘intermediation’ is the same as ‘creation’, or Auditor Hoffer’s partisan reference to the assertion that Walmart “cost state and local governments more than $400 million a year in lost revenue”. All pure sophistry. I’m simply taking the opportunity to express an alternate perspective for anyone who may still be reading. Clear enough? John Fairbanks Correct me if I’m wrong, but my understanding is that about $1B in Walton “charitable” giving is to support school choice. That’s political, not charitable. Jay Eshelman “The Walton Family Foundation — which says it has given some $1.3 billion in K-12 education across the country over the last two decades, largely to support charter schools and fuel the “school choice” movement — announced this month that it is committing $1 billion over the next five years to help expand charter and other school choice options across the country.” Your reference is to a pledge over the next five years, not an actual charitable donation. And it’s in addition to the previously referenced annual $1.4 Billion of charitable donations, be it cash or ‘in kind’. Perhaps the misinformation you reference has a logical source after all. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that its the anti-school choice crowd, including elected officials and public sector unions like the National Education Association, AFT, AFSCME, SEIU and others, who derive their money and power from the great government watering trough… otherwise known as the ‘intermediation’ crowd. Matt Young John, anti school choice folks scream that choice will make taxes go up, why on earth would Walmart or anyone else want to pay more taxes? Could it be that there are some smart people at Walmart (I’m guessing there are) that see the many advantages of school choice? Maybe they understand children are more important than the big Ed monopoly. John Grady http://www.oftwominds.com/blogmar17/trickle-down3-17.html Spending funded by debt is the real trickle down economics. McMansion Nation has been funded by $60 trillion dollars of debt over the last 40 years and a few Generations of people believe they earned their bloated standard of living. We are a bigger version of Greece. The wealth of the top 5% or 25% is on paper. Glorified appliance makers like Apple & Tesla aren’t worth $100’s of billions. Wal-Marts customer base of old and poor will flee to Aldi’s to buy groceries as Aldi’s no frills markets expand across the country. Other Wal-Mart shoppers are service industry workers only employed in hospitality jobs as long as the upper middle class benefits from the wealth effect and is spending money eating out, in bars, on entertainment, for vacations and shopping. A major recession will cream service industry jobs only made possible by trickle down economics from a upper middle class that feels secure enough to spend money. $60 trillion of debt over 40 years fueled the economy in Wal-Mart Nation, it was a massive stimulus year after year to pile more and more debt on the national credit card to fund a standard of living beyond what was affordable. Wal-Mart undercut other people and stole the business. It didn’t create jobs, it stole jobs & destroyed jobs. Ames, Caldor’s, Bradlees, Jamesway, K-Mart used to employee tons of people who earned a living. Wal-Mart employees tons of people who require government assistance to live. Edward Letourneau In the comments here I don’t see any evidence that the progressives who love Bernie, want to work like Sam did! John Fairbanks Evidence? I support Bernie. I used to work for Bernie. I started my career as a hardware store stock boy, graduated to running a drop hammer on the second shift ($3.65 an hour), then to throwing 100-lb sacks of flour into boxcars (that got me over $4). Worked more than one job more than once to make ends meet. Lots of people work hard, but they don’t have fathers-in-law to hand them $20,000 (now about $271,000, back then nearly five times the average household income in America) to get started. And I’ll bet Sam never in his life worked as hard as those children who were making the products he sold. Matt Young So a $20,000 loan is all it takes to create one of the biggest business empires in the world? That’s how you credit Walmarts incredible growth and success? Further, by all credible accounts Mr. Walton worked extremely hard. Lots of people sure do hate success. John Fairbanks Don’t hate success at all, and, yeah, $200G can get you off to a flying start. Wal-Mart is a financial success, no argument there; however, it’s important to take into account on whose backs that success was built. But, as noted other places in this thread, this really isn’t the point, if the issue’s inequality (which ends up being bad for business, BTW). The point is, wealth is created by lots of people working to provide goods and services. How much of that gets allotted to whom, and who decides? The fact that someone gets rich, in and of itself, is beside the point. Even how that person got rich, while a consideration for some, isn’t really at the core of the debate about inequality. Inequality, as I have noted elsewhere in this thread, has various causes, but the main thing is who controls the distribution of the wealth created. Back in the 50s, for example, the country was enormously prosperous (there were other problems, but we’re just talking economics here). That prosperity was divided differently–people like me would say better–because labor unions were strong, so workers had leverage in wage negotiations, and taxes were structured differently. Market changes determine how wealth is created. Public policy and worker strength determine how it’s distributed. Matt Young So if someone loans you 200k, you will have a successful business? Sounds a bit naive. It always amazes me that many of the same folks who are advocates for the ridiculous amount of regulations are the same folks that complain about “the rich getting richer.” The wealthy are the only ones who can afford to navigate through all of the anti-everything regs. Someone starting out with very little doesn’t have a shot anymore, roadblocks at every turn put in place by folks who have never created anything. The unions that Mr Fairbanks speaks of have driven more business out of our country by their demands, the self serving teachers unions have done terrible damage to our country. “As far as how much wealth is created and how it is allotted.” Consumer choices and a free market. John Fairbanks BTW, Wal-Mart, post-Sam, has been nailed for tens of millions of dollars in wage theft. Is that “success”? Norm Etkind At once I thank John McClaughry for raising this point while I draw different conclusions. Rich people pay a lot in taxes and many of them do wonderful things with their money. And, for that matter, they can choose to spend their $s however they like. That’s not the issue. What we have seen is the inevitable flow of money to the top due to such things as globalization, computerization, business consolidation, government and tax policy, and automation. The issue is instead: what kind of civilization do we want and how should it be paid for? According to the relevant statistics I’ve seen, all but the lowest and the highest ends of the income spectrum wind up paying nearly the same percentage of income in taxes when all taxes are added in. But that leaves out the biggest tax that is hidden from most of us – – health care. The $25,000 per family cost of health care is a tiny percentage of income for the family with a million dollars in annual income but is about a third of the income for the $75,000 annual income family ($50,000 in pay plus the $25,000 health care cost paid by the employer). To address the dual problem of globalization and automation, we need to reduce the cost of having an employee. The best way is to remove the burden of health care costs from the employer. To be fair, the cost of health care needs to be paid for by general taxes (income and/or consumption) and not by, essentially, a fixed cost per person, often paid by an employer.

Ken Edwards I guess Walton’s success can’t be attributed to being innovate, providing quality valued service that millions of American’s willing paid for over and over again. Ken Edwards To prevent someone from getting wealthy by providing value that people are willing to pay for, perhaps the government should each regulate consumer’s individual spending. Imagine, after an individual spent their maximum limit at Walmart, they would have to shop at their second best option and so on. Think about how many inefficient, lower value businesses would “prosper” and get their fair share of the pie. I’m sorry Mr. Edwards, you can only buy one happy meal here at McDonalds. you’ve reached your spending limit. the rest of your family have to eat at a different business.. unless you’ve reached your spending limit there too. Ray Gonda “Would a monopoly chain of taxpayer-capitalized, government-owned bureaucratically managed retail stores, created to put an end to “grotesque inequality,” be likely to achieve as much?” This is one of the finest examples of creating a straw man to attack I have ever witnessed.

Online sales grew a stunning 63 percent during the quarter, perhaps in response to the company's newly introduced free two-day shipping and its upgraded mobile app. "Inside the company, we can see that we're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping more enjoyable and faster for customers, but we also see plenty of room to improve," CEO Doug McMillon said during the company's quarterly conference call. "We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of -- so that's what we're focused on." Earnings rose to US$1.00 per share during the quarter, a 2 percent increase compared with year-ago earnings. Total revenue rose 1.4 percent to $117.5 billion, while on a constant currency basis revenue rose 2.5 percent to $118.8 billion. Net sales in the U.S. rose 2.9 percent to $75.4 billion from $73.3 billion a year ago. Walmart issued fiscal second-quarter guidance of $1.00 to $1.08 a share, excluding a 5 cents a share benefit from the sale of Suburbia, a Mexican apparel outlet. Same store sales for the 13 weeks ended July 28 are expected to increase 1.5-2 percent for Walmart U.S. and 1-1.5 percent for Sam's Club. Walmart shares rose 3.2 percent to close at $77.54 a share on Thursday, the highest in two years. The stock hit a new high of $79.44 mid-day Friday. Customer Focus Walmart's recent focus has been on improving the customer experience. "I think it comes down to Walmart's leadership," said Paula Rosenblum, managing partner at RSR Research The 63 percent surge in online sails is a "staggering" figure, she told the E-Commerce Times. "I think McMillon has helped them put their focus on the customer and off of expense management," Rosenblum said. Walmart has an advantage over rival big box stores, in that Amazon is playing the same arena that Walmart played in, and the two retailers are directly competitive, noted Rob Gonzales vice president of business development at Salsify. "When retailers have to close stores, it's because they haven't been able to create differentiated experiences," he told the E-Commerce Times. Amazon is a very powerful rival, however. Amazon Prime membership has doubled in two years to 80 million members, and they spend $1,300 per year, on average, while non-Prime customers spend an average of $700 per year, based on data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. In-Store Blend Walmart made several big moves to challenge Amazon's domination of the free shipping business it attracts through booming Prime membership. It also took steps to improve the in-store experience for customers who prefer to shop at Walmart's brick-and-mortar locations. The company earlier this year announced plans to offer free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items in its inventory. It also lowered the minimum purchase total for free shipping to customers' homes from $50 to $35. Walmart also enhanced several features in its mobile app to speed up the process of using its in-store pharmacies and money services desks. The updates meant customers using the app could use express lines for both departments. They also could check pharmacy prices and order refills electronically. Further, the updates allow prefilling of money transfers and other financial services. The company last month moved to save "last mile" delivery costs by using its physical stores as fulfillment centers, offering discounts to customers on certain online-only items if they opted to pick them up at a store. The discounts initially applied to about 10,000 items that normally are purchased online. However, it's expected that more than 1 million items will be eligible for the discounts by next month. Walmart is making strides with its online grocery business, which it operated in 670 locations at the end of the quarter, McMillon noted. The company plans to scale that segment to additional stores both in the U.S. and overseas. Walmart also made several acquisitions, including Modcloth and Moosejaw, and it reportedly is in advanced talks to buy men's retailer Bonobos for $300 million. These all follow the company's $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com last year. However, Walmart said it plans to grow its e-commerce business organically. Overall, its online inventory is huge compared with year ago figures, McMillon said. More than 50 million items, including Walmart-only selections and those form third-party vendors, now are available for purchase from the site.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | May 18, 2017 -- 13:21 GMT (06:21 PDT) | Topic: E-Commerce Image: Walmart Discount retail giant Walmart reported rising comparable sales bolstered by a whopping 63-percent growth in its e-commerce business. The bulk of the online sales growth was organic through Walmart.com. Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity A spotter's guide to the groups that are out to get you Ransomware attack: How a nuisance became a global threat Devastating attacks to public infrastructure 'a matter of when' in the US The Internet of Insecure Things, and why we're still in denial "This is extraordinary growth, and we're pleased with the traction we're generating across our e-commerce offerings," said Walmart CFO Brett Biggs. The world's largest retailer has made major investments in its e-commerce strategy as it tries to compete with Amazon, including its $3 billion acquisition last year of Jet.com. In the first quarter alone, Walmart nixed the membership fee requirement for two-day shipping, and also rolled out pickup discounts, which offers customers reduced prices on online-only items if they opt to pick up their orders in-store. Walmart's e-commerce site now sells more than 50 million different types of items, which is still just a fraction of Amazon's inventory but five times more that it offered just one year ago. Customer traffic at Walmart also increased at a time when other major retailers are seeing declines. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company has worked successfully to combine its digital and physical assets but notes that he wants to scale Walmart's e-commerce business even further. "We're transforming to become more of a digital enterprise," McMillon said. "The change is starting to be visible to our customers as they use online grocery, Walmart Pay, Scan & Go at Sam's Club and our Walmart app. Online grocery also continues to perform well and we're on track to scale the offering to more stores this year in several countries, including the US." As for the numbers, Walmart said Q1 revenue was $117.54 billion with earnings of $1 per share. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $117.63 billion with earnings of 96 cents a share. For its second quarter, Walmart said it expects earnings in the range of $1 to $1.08 a share. Wall Street expects earnings of $1.07 a share.

');//--> } Home Invest with Barry Speaking Book Contact Walmart and Banking: It’s Time to Reconsider May 19, 2017 5:00am by Guest Author Walmart and Banking: It’s Time to Reconsider Money & Banking May 15, 2017 Lawrence J. White     Guest post by Professor Lawrence J. White, NYU Stern School of Business   Overshadowed by the media attention to the proposed repeal of Obamacare, the House Financial Services Committee recently approved substantial changes in financial regulation. The House of Representatives may soon consider the proposed bill—the Financial CHOICE Act—which would make major changes in the Dodd-Frank Act. However, when financial regulation is being discussed, there is a large elephant that isn’t in the room, but really should be: Walmart. Starting in the mid-1990s, Walmart made two separate efforts to enter banking in the United States, but was repelled both times. After its second effort was rebuffed in 2007, Walmart gave up this effort in the United States (but has since entered banking in Canada and in Mexico). One question to ask might be, “Why should Walmart be allowed to enter banking?” But a more relevant question would be, “Why shouldn’t Walmart be allowed to enter banking?” After all, the U.S. economy is generally market-oriented, and entry is generally recognized as potentially beneficial for consumers, as entrants can bring new ideas, innovations, and efficiencies to the market. Of course, incumbents usually don’t like the idea of entrants’ disrupting the status quo; and often those incumbents lobby for regulation and/or legislation that creates barriers to entry. But, for most markets, the presumption in broad U.S. economic policy is that entry should be encouraged—or at least, that policy should be neutral between incumbents and entrants—so that the benefits of entry can be enjoyed by consumers. Of course, banking is special—as the regular readers of this blog are well aware. And how the specialness of banking and the presence of Walmart in banking can be reconciled must be addressed, and will be addressed below. But first, consider what the entry of Walmart into banking might well achieve: Walmart is well known for providing reasonably priced goods to low- and moderate-income households. Its position as the largest company in the United States—as measured by sales and by employment—is a testament to that reputation. But it is exactly this demographic group—low- and moderate-income households—that is most in need of reasonably priced financial services. The percentage of U.S. households that are unbanked (i.e., do not have a bank account) or underbanked (i.e., have an account but rely on non-bank providers for some financial services and products) has been a longstanding policy concern. The most recent data (from a FDIC report that covers 2015) in this regard—based on a survey of more than 36,000 households nationwide—show that 7% of all households were unbanked and an additional 20% of all households were underbanked. Unsurprisingly, the percentages are substantially larger for low- and moderate-income households (see table). Unbanked and underbanked households (Percent of total), 2015 Note: Unbanked households have no bank account. Underbanked households have an account but rely on non-bank providers for some financial services. Source: FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, 2015 (October 20, 2016) Further, since 2009 (when the FDIC first began reporting these data), the percentage of unbanked households has declined only modestly, while the percentage of underbanked households has actually increased. It is worth remembering that these percentages are present in a financial system where (as of year-end 2016) there were over 5,100 commercial banks, another 800 savings institutions, and an additional 5,900 credit unions! And the total number of branch offices of all of these financial institutions exceeded 90,000! So, given Walmart’s general business strategy, it seems likely that the entry of Walmart into banking would lead it to extend more financial services to its primary clientele—and thus improve financial access for an underserved group. It is also important to remember what Walmart is not known for. There have been few (if any) media stories of abusive sales practices toward its customers. And, Walmart has never been accused of predatory pricing: maintaining super-low prices until other retailers go out of business, and then raising its prices to monopoly levels. Accordingly, it seems quite unlikely that the Walmart Bank would engage in such practices in the financial sphere. Given the recent revelations of unsavory practices at Wells Fargo (as well as the continued concerns over practices at payday lenders and mortgage servicers), this is a nontrivial claim. But, as I noted above, banking is special. We expect banks to be operated in a safe-and-sound manner, such that the likelihood that they would fail—and cause losses to their creditor-depositors (or to the deposit insurer that backs them)—should be quite small. And the elaborate system of prudential regulation for banks is a reflection of that expectation. So, how would the entry of Walmart—and, presumably, other non-financial companies that are interested in entering banking—fit into that system of prudential regulation? The crucial concept is that the “Walmart Bank” that would provide banking services to the public would be organized as a separate subsidiary of the parent Walmart company. In essence, the parent Walmart company would be a bank holding company (BHC), which is a common ownership structure for U.S. banks. The Walmart Bank subsidiary would be expected to abide by all prudential regulations—including adequate net worth (capital) requirements—that apply to banks. At the same time, from the perspective of prudential regulation, it makes good sense for the Walmart Bank to be a subsidiary and thus for banking services to not be provided by the parent company. Bank regulators’ prudential tasks would be much harder if they had to assess the overall financial health of the Walmart company and its extensive retail operations alongside its banking activities, rather than focusing specifically on the financial services operations of the Walmart Bank subsidiary. In essence, the assets and activities of a prudentially regulated bank should be “examinable and supervisable.” Bank supervisors should be able to understand these assets and activities and judge whether the bank is well managed and well capitalized. The farther afield from financial services the bank’s activities stray, the harder the task of the prudential regulator. Hence, there is a sensible argument for keeping the financial services of the bank separate (as a subsidiary) from the non-financial activities of the rest of the company. However, because it is relatively easy for the owners (including BHCs) of a bank to drain the bank of its assets—for example, by paying excessive dividends to its owners, or by making loans to the owners that are not repaid, or even by paying excessive prices for any materials that it buys from the owners—it is essential that any transactions between the bank and its owners be on arm’s-length terms. U.S. bank regulators have long been aware of this danger of the draining of a bank by its owners and have rules in place (which are embodied in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act) that insist on this arm’s-length standard. Current U.S. banking policy has much of this story right.  But where policy has gone “off the rails” is the insistence that a BHC cannot be engaged in commerce—that is, in non-financial services activities. This restriction on scope was embodied in the Bank Holding Company Acts of 1956 and 1970 and remains established policy for banks and banking in 2017. Its persistence as policy is more a testament to the lobbying strength of the incumbent bankers (who clearly prefer less competition) rather than to a concern about the economic welfare of consumers. It also yields the economically absurd result that it is okay for a local car dealer to own a bank (so long as the dealer doesn’t form a BHC that involves the car dealership); but it is not okay for AutoNation (a publicly traded company that operates hundreds of car dealerships) to own a bank. Until 1999 there was a potential way around this no-commerce restriction on the activities of a holding company: the holding company of a savings and loan (S&L or thrift) institution faced no such restriction, and at various times companies such as the Ford Motor Company, Fuqua Industries, Weyerhaeuser, ITT, Gulf & Western, Household International, and Sears, Roebuck have owned S&Ls via the formation of thrift holding companies. In the middle of the 1990s, Walmart decided to try to enter banking by becoming a thrift holding company. However, before Walmart was able to become a thrift holding company, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (which was primarily focused on allowing commercial banks—via BHCs—to enter investment banking) forbade the creation of any new thrift holding companies that could engage in commerce. It also restricted the sale of an existing thrift holding company to a non-financial company, such as Walmart. There was a second, more limited way around the “no commercial owner” restriction: a few states—most notably Utah—offered “industrial loan company” (ILC) charters that allowed a commercial firm to own a financial institution that could issue deposits and make loans and thus could function as a bank. But in order to operate, the ILC would need to obtain deposit insurance from the FDIC. Walmart duly obtained a Utah ILC charter and in 2005 applied for FDIC deposit insurance. In 2007 Walmart withdrew its application after it was clear that the FDIC would not grant it deposit insurance. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 placed a three-year moratorium on the granting of deposit insurance to any new (or newly acquired) ILC. Although the moratorium expired in 2013, bank regulators appear to have “gotten the message” that the commerce-finance barrier should remain intact. If this issue of commercial companies’ owning banks were to be re-opened—with Walmart being the “poster child”—incumbent banks would be fiercely opposed (as they were in 2005 to Walmart’s FDIC application). They would make loud claims of “unfair competition,” but the argument above for the examinable-and-supervisable separate subsidiary, supported by Sections 23A and 23B, undercuts such assertions. Further, if it were thought that Walmart would be the beneficiary, the forces of and sympathizers with organized labor, which has never been happy with Walmart’s wages and benefits policies, could again be expected to oppose the granting of such bank charters (as they did in 2005). But—perhaps—the advocates of the Financial CHOICE Act would be able to see the benefits to the wider provision of banking services to businesses and to consumers from the loosening or elimination of this commerce-finance restriction.  And this would be a direct way to bring real financial benefits to low- and moderate-income households without any direct (or indirect) Congressional appropriations. A revisiting of the commerce-finance restriction is surely a worthwhile topic for debate when the full House of Representatives begins its consideration of the Financial CHOICE Act. ~~~ Acknowledgment: We are honored to have as our first guest author our distinguished friend and NYU Stern colleague, Larry White, the Robert Kavesh Professor in Economics.

Today’s notice is markedly vague. But Trump’s NAFTA renegotiation plan that leaked in late March described just what the corporate lobby is demanding: using NAFTA talks to revive parts of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), like expanded investor incentives to offshore jobs that could make NAFTA even worse for working people” [Lori Wallach, Public CItizen]. “The obvious measure of whether NAFTA renegotiation is intended to benefit working people is if Trump makes clear he will eliminate NAFTA’s special investor rights that make it easier to offshore American jobs and attack our laws before tribunals of three corporate lawyers who can award the firms unlimited sums of taxpayer money. If corporate elites are allowed to dictate how NAFTA is renegotiated, the agreement could become more damaging for working families and the environment in the three countries. And modest tweaks will not stop NAFTA’s ongoing damage, much less deliver on Trump’s promises for a deal that will create American jobs and raise wages. Already the 500 corporate trade advisers who got us into the TPP have been consulted on NAFTA renegotiations, while the few labor advisers were shut out of that March meeting. And the public and Congress are being left in the dark about negotiating plans and goals.” “Organizations representing grain, produce, dairy and livestock farmers said NAFTA is largely working for their industries, especially the integrated supply chains that allow goods to move freely across borders. Since NAFTA’s implementation in 1994, U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico have more than quadrupled, growing from $8.9 billion in 1993 to $38.6 billion in 2015, USDA data shows” [Politico]. I’m not sure what the Mexican farmers think about that, though. “Fixing Trade Agreements In Five Simple Steps” [Electronic Frontier Foundation]. “Trade experts agree that without five simple fixes, Americans will continue to reject new trade deals….” No. This is all about process, specifically “transparency,” a favorite neoliberal panacea. Do the experts really think that people won’t reject a transparently bad deal? Politics Policy “While President Trump and Administration officials have not made their intentions clear in regards to the United States remaining in the Paris Agreement, a large faction of well-known companies have made it very clear they want to remain part of it” [Logistics Management], 2020 “Is John Kasich finishing the tour, or just getting started?” [Matt Bai, Yahoo News]. “An enthusiastic, born-again Christian, Kasich criticized an executive order, issued by President Trump the day before, that lifted some restrictions on politicking in places of worship. ‘I don’t believe these religious people ought to be endorsing candidates,’ he said. ”They ought to be figuring out how to clothe the homeless or feed the poor, not all of this political nonsense.'” Especially since government shouldn’t be doing that? 2018 “Paula Swearengin, 42, is an accounting clerk and single mother of four from Coal City, West Virginia. On March 9, she announced that she would challenge Manchin in the Democratic primary. She is a newcomer to politics and an early beneficiary of Brand New Congress, a political action committee founded by former members of Senator Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign” [The New Republic]. Interesting interview: I don’t care if the DNC backs me or not. This is a people-funded campaign. The DNC has failed us in many ways here in West Virginia. They failed us when they nominated one of the biggest-polluting coal barons in West Virginia: Governor Jim Justice, who mines three miles from my house and puts silica dust in my children’s lungs. That’s a failure of the Democratic Party. I hope we rise up and realize that, Democratic or Republican, we all have the same set of values. We all want clean water for our children, clean air for them to breathe, and to not worry about our families getting buried miles deep in a coal mine and suffocating to death. 2017 MT-AL: “In the race for Montana’s at-large House seat, Republican Greg Gianforte led Democratic Rob Quist by six points in a poll conducted by a Democratic super PAC late last month” [Roll Call]. FWIW… MT-AL: “U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ rally Saturday for Rob Quist has been moved to the Adams Center in Missoula, which holds up to 7,500 people” [The Missoulian]. “Quist, the Democratic candidate for Montana’s lone U.S. House seat, was originally set to appear with Sanders, the former Democratic presidential candidate, at the Wilma, which holds 1,400 people with standing-room only.” Health Care “Harkin: O-Care Should Have Been Single-Payer But ‘We Blew It'” [Talking Points Memo (2014)]. “”We had the votes in ’09. We had a huge majority in the House, we had 60 votes in the Senate,” Harkin told The Hill, saying that the first Congress of President Barack Obama’s administration should have passed ‘single-payer right from the get go or at least put a public option (which) would have simplified a lot.'” So when you hear a Democrat loyalist say “We didn’t have the votes” on single payer, you can throw this in their face share this with them. Realignment and Legitimacy “Change Dot Ugh: The Popular Petition Site Profits Off Progressivism” [Paste]. “But the truth is that when you fill out a Change petition, you’re giving your information to a company that sells it to the highest bidder. The popular petition site uses your well-intentioned activism to profile you and sell you sponsored content — and most of its 150 million reported users don’t realize it. Change isn’t interested in change. It’s interested in profit.Billy Penn (DB)]. Stats Watch No Econoday stats today. State Employment and Unemployment Summary: “Unemployment rates were lower in April in 10 states, higher in 1 state, and stable in 39 states and the District of Columbia, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Nineteen states had jobless rate decreases from a year earlier, and 31 states and the District had little or no change. The national unemployment rate, 4.4 percent, was little changed from March but was 0.6 percentage point lower than in April 2016” [Bureau of Labor Statistics]. Rail: If coal and grain are removed from the analysis, rail over the last 6 months been declining around 5% – but this week it IMPROVED 0.6 % (meaning that the predicitive economic elements improved year-over-year). Also consider rail movements are below 2015 levels – even though they are above 2016 levels” [Econintersect], Retail: “While rivals like Target Corp. are reporting sagging sales and declining foot traffic, Wal-Mart’s same-store revenue rose 1.4% in the first quarter…. The gains complement a 63% surge in U.S. e-commerce sales, and indicate that the company’s strategy of investing both in store improvements and online operations is starting to pay off. Those efforts include a campaign to reduce inventory in stores that has placed additional pressures on suppliers. Wal-Mart is also blurring the lines between its e-commerce and brick-and-mortar businesses by encouraging customers to pick up online orders in stores. One problem Wal-Mart hasn’t cracked: how to boost sales without sacrificing margins” [Wall Street Journal]. Retail: “Why predictions of a ‘retail apocalypse’ are overblown” [CNBC]. “Brick-and-mortar is not in fact defunct. Instead, it is evolving, and successful retailers are embracing a shopping experience that blends a variety of platforms and that ultimately creates the engagement necessary for a brand’s success…. As shown by the renewed appeal for showrooming in the apparel retail industry, digital retailing and brick-and-mortar are complementary.” Retail: “How a Lack of Liquidity is Tanking Retail—And Who’s to Blame” [Sourcing Journal]. “The common culprits blamed for the retail flame out are a shift in consumer shopping habits and the rise of e-commerce sales. And while both have done plenty of damage on their own, one additional factor is responsible for making store chains less able to weather the tempest: a glut of leveraged buyouts that too often have become a business distraction and a financial drain….” Real Estate: “Blackstone Group LP, the world’s biggest private equity fund, told investors to dial back their expectations for property returns as the “great run” of the past five years becomes harder to replicate” [Bloomberg]. Shipping: “Uber Freight finally hits the road by launching brokerage services in Texas” [DC Velocity]. “It chose to formally start in Texas because of the state’s large volume of traffic, according to Eric Berdinis, Uber Freight’s senior product manager.” Really? Not regulatory arbitrage? Shipping: “With Uber Freight, Travis Takes on Trucking” [Wired]. “Travis”? WTF, Wired? “Still, Uber holds an advantage when it comes to software and managing data. But, as in its campaign to topple the taxi industry, it all hinges on pricing. Existing brokerages typically take a 12 percent cut on deals they arrange, Petersen says; Uber isn’t revealing its rate, but it has the cash and expertise to do the same job for far less.” “Cash” is a delicate way of saying “squillionaires playing the ponies,” isn’t it? Shipping: “[Uber] it appears happy to burn through its cash, a model which could allow it to take less than the typical 12% cut that truck brokerages take” [The LoadStar]. “[Uber] says it will determine pricing based on market conditions and experience.” And the cash.

Donate $25$50$75$100 00200 This entry was posted in Guest Post, Water Cooler on May 19, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Reply ↓ RUKidding May 19, 2017 at 3:53 pm Same experience here. The usual excuse I get is that the “Obama tried, but Republicans wouldn’t let it happen.” No, in fact, that’s not the case. It’s entirely possible that the Public Option would not have passed, although I think it stood a chance. That said, Obama went behind closed doors and made a deal (for himself) with the Big Three BigInsurance, and ACA is what we got stuck with. I’m really tired of Democratic voters diefying Obama and making excuses for him. At least try to live in reality most of the time, please. Please note: I used to be a Democrat, but I pretty much gave that up after Bill Clinton and the third way b.s., which basically means: We call ourselves “Democrats” (using their fingers as scare quotes), but we run things Just.

Republicans know to use budget reconciliation to get around the filibuster. They need only 50 votes plus Pence if they ever can agree on O-care repeal. Democrats act like they never heard of reconciliation to justify their inaction and strengthen their embrace of victimhood at the hands of the evil Republicans. Reply ↓ RepubAnon May 20, 2017 at 12:23 am There’s rules to the reconciliation process. The big one is it must be revenue neutral, or reduce the deficit. Easy for folks who want to fund tax cuts by gutting the social safety net… but a bit harder for Democrats. Reply ↓ Carolinian May 19, 2017 at 2:46 pm My parents, country Baptists, were imperfect people but I can’t recall either of them ever telling a lie. Lying was considered a sin. While I’m not religious myself I do wonder if changes in the country’s religious landscape have had some effect on its ethics. It may be that an irrational or, if you will, faith based fear of doing wrong is necessary to counter our deep evolutionary instincts to be selfish and greedy and to say whatever is necessary to further those aims. Or not. But all the scoffing at organized religion–much of it justified–tends to ignore the degree to which religion once formed the basis for most of our citizens’ ethics. To be caught out in a lie was considered a disgrace. Now nobody seems to care unless, of course, your name is Trump and most of his supporters don’t care when he does it either. Reply ↓ local to oakland May 19, 2017 at 3:42 pm Thanks for this. In addition to what you wrote, here is a thought. I don’t know whether it matters whether the ethic be rational or faith based, but there may be a developmental window in a child’s life in which it is important to teach and reinforce practical ethical norms to get responsible ethical adult citizens. In the US, public school and church both, I believe, worked at reinforcing such faith based norms until we became aggressively secular. Also too, so did the competing forms of religious schools created by Roman Catholics and Jews. Freedom from religious conformism at school is I think an important development in our tradition of constitutional rights. However, public schools in my limited experience do not treat ethics at all either theoretically or practically. If they do it comes from the initiative of individual teacher or principals. School rules are functional at best, arbitrary at worst, not touching any larger values. So school can become a Lord of the Flies type environment. And unless fortunate in their parental and other influences, many students graduate with an ad hoc ethic with large aspects of either go along to get along, or success at all costs. It seems to me that one part of child development includes a child absorbing ethical norms from their environment much as they do language. I don’t believe the public schools we have today have been designed or implemented with this in mind. Speaking more generally, as you probably already know, such concerns and complaints about declining traditional morals can also be found in Roman literature as the latin speaking elite struggled with the challenges inherent in becoming a polyglot, multicultural empire and bemoaned the lack of traditional virtue and pietas in their children. I wonder whether certain aspects of these challenges of multiculturalism and moral decline are inherent in the process of becoming a large and powerful empire. Both having power and lacking the experience of hardship or struggle shape character in ways that seem to make the development of virtue more difficult. Also, the personal encounter with competing forms of religion and ethics while broadening and fostering tolerance can also create doubt as to the truth, and the importance of any traditional form of religion, whatever it might happen to be. In short, I agree and I think this is an important issue. Reply ↓ Carolinian May 19, 2017 at 4:31 pm Of course religion has formed the basis for endless misbehavior throughout history and as our society has changed so has religion (“prosperity gospel”). But as you say, teaching children to have a sense of right and wrong is not an arbitrary choice but is, in fact, an entirely rational activity for societies to pursue. Perhaps one reason our white collar crime laws are so weak is that it used to be assumed that wealthy people with a reputation to protect would avoid behavior that might lead to disgrace or accusations of dishonesty. Now it’s let the lawyers sort it out. Those who work the system may even boast about their cleverness. Reply ↓ mk May 19, 2017 at 7:34 pm Think of the children attending Catholic churches and schools who are taught right and wrong and then are molested, raped, beaten by their teachers/priests/nuns. Not just Catholics, but they are a very good example. And this is not something that started happening recently, it’s been going on for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Not much change for this religion.

When I worked in a wool scour (factory to wash the lanolin and poop out of the raw wool), we had a foreman who was an unfriendly, bossy prick (His nickname was “Little Stalin”). BUT, when things broke down or if we needed help, “Little Stalin” would dive right in and help us. We never had to ask. Forget about what a person says. How do they live?? How big (GINORMOUS or tiny?) is their carbon footprint? How well do they take care of their friends and family? How have their kids turned out? Are they kind to animals? Are they trustworthy? Do they practice what they preach (their life makes internal sense)? Do they take advantage of the weak? Do they wear a mask (fake)? The older I get, the less weight I place on what is said…… If a notice orders you to, “Report to the town square with 10 kg of luggage.

There are a number of traditional proverbs, never mind scripture texts, that my grandparents would have known by heart, re difference between talk and action, re the relative trustworthiness of silent vs chattering people. By their fruits shall ye know them would be one biblical example. Still waters run deep would be another cultural teaching that is partially relevant to your point. I’m not remembering a more precise example. Simply adding a large dose of traditional folk proverbs, possibly from all influential US cultures, would be one positive step toward adding practical wisdom to the US school curriculum. Anyway, thanks everyone for indulging my rant. Reply ↓ WeakendSquire May 19, 2017 at 4:26 pm It’s got to be more complex than that. Religion has changed, too, with the rise of mega churches and charismatic pastors with slimy ethics. Not to mention the outright hypocrisy of many Roman Catholic priests. In this environment I’m not sure it would make any difference if secular humanists suddenly got religion. ALL institutions are suffering from a legitimacy crisis, which is why they are resorting to more and more authoritarian measures to retain control over people who do not trust them. Reply ↓ IowanX May 19, 2017 at 5:59 pm This is an interesting conversation, and I actually think it’s more important than people know. I’m going to hoist a link from this morning. I’ve run downtown-focused nonprofits for more years than I want to remember, in wealthy cities, poor cities, and small towns. I DO understand how culture has changed, but the causal arrows are hard to aim. As an Iowan, I know how much the Maytag family gave back to Newton, until they got bought out and Fred Maytag III started making beer in San Francisco instead of washers in Iowa. You can’t really participate in “Associations” if you don’t know if you can come to a meeting (or bowling night, or pool league, or book club, or Kiwanis, or prayer group, or whatever) on Tuesday evenings. Precariat employment prevents predictability, (and disposable cash). Predictability (availability to participate) and disposable cash (I can buy a round) is necessary for associations to form, build and grow. TBTB WANT us to be alienated from ANY kind of group action, (even if pool league is harmless fun). Ya can’t tell the good guys with pool cues from the bad guys with pool cues? Just a guess.

OK, perhaps what I really mean is not God’s justice, but God’s punishment, everlasting in Hell. Which I don’t believe in — I think we have the whole enchilada right here, and that is why we have to Do It Right This Time. But I wonder how some people who say they are Godly can behave so wickedly. God’s work? I am reminded of Robertson Davies‘ conclusion, “God is not the only answerer of prayer.” Reply ↓ Huey Long May 19, 2017 at 5:36 pm Excellent post, hat tip to you Carolinian! I’ve been having thoughts on the demise of religion and its effects on society for quite some time now as well. I’ve come to the conclusion that religion has been supplanted by the mass media and modern scientific propaganda techniques as a means for social control. The first nail in the coffin for religion was the invention of the printing press. Folks were finally able to purchase and read the bible in their own language and no longer had to just take the priest’s word for it on Sunday. 200 years and many devastating wars later, the Catholic Church’s monopoly on God was but a memory. The second nail in the coffin was the industrial revolution. All the scientific advances that allowed this event to take place slowly eroded the credibility over time of the church, both Protestant and Catholic. The bible’s stories of creation, once widely regarded as fact were revealed to be nothing more than made up stories. Epidemics were no longer understood to be the wrath of God, but rather the wrath of tiny microbes and curable not by prayer but by man himself. The third and final nail in the coffin was the advent of mass media and Bernaysian propaganda. The invention of radio and television allowed governments and corporations to beam their message into every home in the land every day of the week. The Church, already divided into a thousand pieces and with its credibility in the dumpster never stood a chance; they only had their audience’s ear once a week on Sunday and were stuck with the same ancient propaganda messages written down long ago in the bible. On the other hand, the propagandists crafting the messages broadcast over radio and television had no such restrictions. Their slick, focus grouped propaganda was (and still is) free to appeal the most primal and brutal parts of human nature, and I think that’s where we lost our values. You can see these changes manifest in the relationship between governments and the church now vs the pre-printing press era. Prior to the advent of the printing press, the Church was a high ranking partner of the government that owned vast amounts of land, levied taxes, and even waged war on occasion. Nowadays, government-church collusion is forbidden in the west, and it is the mass media that is government’s social control handmaiden. Proto-propaganda in the form of pamphlets, posters, and whatnot had existed since the dawn of printing, however the mass media really “made their bones” so to speak during WW1 with Eddy Bernays’ Committee on Public Information.

Like everything else you have been taught, except arithmetic, that was a lie, to influence your behavior for the convenience of your parents and teachers. As you grow older, you will see that telling the truth serves others; that is why they tell you to do it. If you observe what they do, not what they say, you will see that everyone around you is lying. And not just in the human world: all animal communication is merely a signal designed to influence behavior; each communication must be considered a manipulation, one to your disadvantage until proven otherwise. The sooner you learn to lie persuasively, the better off you will be.” But every child probably knows this already because they grew up with the internet.

I successfully started 8 year old tomato seeds this year, 10 year old radish seeds last year. 30 years ago 3 year old frozen “beans” would not sprout but a friend started an 18 year old basement stored “bean” last year.

Reply ↓ Shane May 19, 2017 at 5:02 pm I’m an avid food gardener and I think the attitude that you can just freeze it all for now and worry about what to do with it later is a terrible strategy, as shown by the arctic vault flooding. Likewise the attitude that we can grow millions of acres of the same strain of a crop and stuff what little remains of the genetic diversity that used to exist into vaults and pull it out later if we need it. Crops need to be grown regularly to maintain not just the health of the crop, but also the volume of seed needed to grow it on a meaningful scale, and the skills required to handle each strain’s peculiarities. Putting all your eggs in one freezer is a recipe for failure. Modern crops are bred to be hyper-responsive to fertiliser and often irrigation, making them relatively indifferent to local geology and climate. If/when industrial agriculture fails the lack of access to locally adapted land-race staple crops is likely to make a return to subsistence agriculture an even more difficult process that it would otherwise be. Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob May 19, 2017 at 6:17 pm I’ve found peas to be relatively easy to save too and will be trying some Marfax beans that I saved from last season this year. And a side note: evidently saving the seeds in the ground works too. I had tried planting some lettuce in one patch last year that would not grow no matter how many times I re-seeded it. We had very dry weather and by the end of the summer the patch was pretty much dust, despite repeatedly watering it. Did some edging around that patch yesterday to get the garden ready for planting and noticed little lettuce plants coming up all over the place. Sometimes it seems like all the work I put into my tiny garden is completely wasted and I’d be better off just throwing a bunch of seeds around the yard and see what comes up!

Buying valuable and useful true-variety seed from seed companies qualified to maintain it for real and at quality year after year after year. And paying more to buy shinola food from shinola growers who pay more to shinola companies for shinola varieties of seed. Both approaches would help. Reply ↓ ratefink May 19, 2017 at 10:38 pm well, Baker Heirloom has had some really fun and delicious ones that I’ve planted, and I’m really not much of a gardener. Also, they are always looking for locally preserved strains. Reply ↓ Shane May 20, 2017 at 12:00 am This is a good idea but has a couple of complications. Firstly many crops are outcrossing (cucurbits, most grains) so each strain needs to be isolated from others to prevent unwanted crossing, plus require large populations to select next years seed from to maintain quality. Traditionally this was achieved by many neighboring farms growing the same basic strain each year, with crossing happening between farms. Most suburban farmers would struggle to grow a hundred pumpkin plants or influence what their neighbors grow. Secondly even for self pollinating crops (most legumes and solanums) accessing the genetic diversity that remains in the seed vaults is difficult. More difficult is figuring out which variety they should be ideally growing in their location. Even with seed vaults lots of genetic diversity has been lost, and just as importantly the know how about how to grow which crop where is also lost. If the industrialised nations ever had to return to subsistence agriculture it would be a rocky road for these reasons. Reply ↓ different clue May 19, 2017 at 6:46 pm “locally mined coal” . . .

Censorship was performed in two main directions: State secrets were handled by the General Directorate for the Protection of State Secrets in the Press (also known as Glavlit), which was in charge of censoring all publications and broadcasting for state secrets. Censorship, in accordance with the official ideology and politics of the Communist Party was performed by several organizations: Goskomizdat censored all printed matter: fiction, poetry, etc. Goskino, in charge of cinema Gosteleradio, in charge of radio and television broadcasting The First Department in many agencies and institutions, such as the State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), was responsible for assuring that state secrets and other sensitive information only reached authorized hands.” I vote for either Glavit, or Gosrunet, a portmanteau of Gos_____ and runet which is a popular term for the Russophone internet.

Furthermore, they aren’t stupid enough not to know the coal industry is dying, a few hardcore unicorn-riders notwithstanding. Dismissing Swearingen, as I noted earlier, is as hypocritical as those tone-deaf Democrats in the DNC, because doing so plays right into their hands. This is why so many good candidates lose—because people who aren’t on the ground where they are decide they aren’t viable and voice that opinion loudly where it can do the most damage. Gerrymandering “works” because the party in power creates the districts so as to encompass as many people who voted for them in the last election in one bunch. However, that assumes there aren’t more than enough people able to vote who didn’t because they had no one to vote for. Or voted for the party in power because they heard over and over there was no point in doing otherwise. We have to stop chopping ourselves off at the knees before we even get to the starting line. That kind of defeatism, especially when flavored with elitist cynicism, is what got us where we are in the first place.

We’re told that coal defines us. So as a little girl I was proud of my coal heritage. I was proud to be the coal miner’s daughter. But as I watched the progression of what coal did to my family, I wasn’t so proud any more. My grandfather spent 45 years in the coal mines, and I watched him suffocate to death. My father served in the military in Korea, and he was a coal miner, and he had cancer and I watched him suffocate. My step father has heart disease. He’s had open heart surgery. And he gets up every morning and he suffers. But that was only the beginning of what I learned about the suffering in Appalachia… Is there any coal mining family that won’t relate to that? Sen. Sanders won all 55 of West Virginia’s counties in the Democratic primary. At that town hall in March in McDowell County, West Virginia, he was cheered by an audience of almost all Trump voters.

More likely, though, Trump knows that Flynn could sink his son-in-law. I believe that’s why Trump had to fire Comey in an effort to undercut the Flynn investigation. And Rod Rosenstein, the survivor, just picked a partner from the firm of Kushner and Ivanka’s lawyer Jamie Gorelick, Robert Mueller, to take over the investigation into Flynn. Update: Sure enough, Reuters is reporting that Mueller, by design, may not be able to investigate Kushner or Paul Manafort. Within hours of Mueller’s appointment on Wednesday, the White House began reviewing the Code of Federal Regulations, which restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firm’s clients for one year after their hiring, the sources said. An executive order signed by Trump in January extended that period to two years. Mueller’s former law firm, WilmerHale, represents Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who met with a Russian bank executive in December, and the president’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is a subject of a federal investigation. Legal experts said the ethics rule can be waived by the Justice Department, which appointed Mueller. He did not represent Kushner or Manafort directly at his former law firm. If the department did not grant a waiver, Mueller would be barred from investigating Kushner or Manafort, and this could greatly diminish the scope of the probe, experts said.” Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 19, 2017 at 9:03 pm What is the significance of that meeting with a Russian bank executive (presumably not tied to Putin, otherwise, that would have been a major omission by the author)?

If there were a shortage of people, employers could not just reject anyone at will. The situation would look like the Golden Age of capitalism or the tech sector in the 1990s where they would have to pay more and take people on even without as much experience as they liked.

Riding completely by the seat of their pants. There’s a great big hole in the economy through which all our money is flowing. Marx talked about it: Finally, in the same measure in which the capitalists are compelled, by the movement described above, to exploit the already existing gigantic means of production on an ever-increasing scale, and for this purpose to set in motion all the mainsprings of credit, in the same measure do they increase the industrial earthquakes, in the midst of which the commercial world can preserve itself only by sacrificing a portion of its wealth, its products, and even its forces of production, to the gods of the lower world – in short, the crises increase. They become more frequent and more violent, if for no other reason, than for this alone, that in the same measure in which the mass of products grows, and therefore the needs for extensive markets, in the same measure does the world market shrink ever more, and ever fewer markets remain to be exploited, since every previous crisis has subjected to the commerce of the world a hitherto unconquered or but superficially exploited market. Reply ↓ Altandmain May 19, 2017 at 6:22 pm Thanks for the words of encouragement. Agree with the problem of every institution having no money these days. Apart from the rich, who often pay a lower effective tax rate, fewer people have taxable income these days that governments can raise. By extension there’s no money for everything else funded by taxes. Businesses feel the pinch with the decline in demand. Those collapses in the restaurant industry, auto industry, retail, etc I think are all caused by a fall in aggregate demand. The neoliberal order is its own worst enemy. Even for those who don’t agree with Marx’s solutions, I think that his criticisms of capitalism have a very good point. An Eastern European fellow once noted that only after the collapse of the Soviet Union did they realize that Marx had valid criticisms of capitalism.

I think these stories are complete mularky because of how the labor force is defined. From BLS (https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm): What are the basic concepts of employment and unemployment? The basic concepts involved in identifying the employed and unemployed are quite simple: People with jobs are employed. People who are jobless, looking for a job, and available for work are unemployed. The labor force is made up of the employed and the unemployed. People who are neither employed nor unemployed are not in the labor force. The labor force only consists of people with jobs or actively looking. We may have a low unemployment rate according to this metric, but it fails to describe the huge reserve army of labor that exists in this country: Just think of all the housewives and househusbands who are filling those roles because they either can’t get a job or can’t get a job that pays good enough to offset the cost of daycare? Or how about the people out in flyover who had the town factory close down who aren’t on a payroll or looking for a formal job but do some odd jobs for cash to make ends meet? Or the legions of petty drug dealers who are eeking out a living selling dime bags and 20 sacks? They’re not in the labor force either but the minute retail pay exceeds petty drug dealer pay (not much: http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/24/opinion/oe-dubner24) they’ll be looking for jobs too? The bottom line is there is no shortage of warm bodies available to work and I think that is definitely a factor in what’s keeping salaries in the toilet and enabling crapification. Furthermore, I think crapification serves to keep the labor force metric artificially small as it encourages folks to say “eff it, I’m done. I’d rather do some handyman crap and sell some pot on the side to pay my rent rather than suffer in the Tesla factory for slightly more $$$.” As of right now I don’t think the squillionaires have anything to fear from a civil disturbance so long as the lights are on, the people are fed, they control the major propaganda organs and the state security apparatus remains loyal.

A $20 billion loan from the U.S. to deal with capital flight, and not incidentally, rehearse the bailout of American banks by bailing out those in trouble in Mexico. 2. A 34% decline in real income (Source: Ravi Batra’s “Greenspan’s Fraud”). This is saying something in a country where half the population gets by on $4 or less a day. The only comparable decline in the U.S. was in the Great Depression. Of course nobody migrated then….oh wait! One might figure that shipping a bunch of subsidized corn down south would put lots of Mexican subsistence corn farmers out of business. After all, corn is only arguably the most important food crop in the world, and they were keeping the diversity of the corn genome alive, but they weren’t making any money for Monsanto! NAFTA was so unpopular in Mexico that the Harvard-educated Mexican president who proposed it–Carlos Salinas Gotari–retired to Ireland for a few years so the furor would die down, and presumably to be safe from the pitchforks and tar.

just-style home News & insights News US Q1 in brief – Foot Locker, Cato Corp, The Buckle By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 19 May 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent first-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Walmart delivered an encouraging start to the year thanks to higher sales, while Ross Stores booked growth despite market volatility. Kate Spade, meanwhile, saw earnings slump on the back of sales declines, while Hudson's Bay recorded comparable store declines on the back of lower domestic store traffic across all banners.  Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker said its first-quarter was one of the company's most profitable in its history, despite a slip in net income and falling short of its original expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net income was US$180m, compared to $191m in the year-ago period. Total sales meanwhile, increased 0.7% to $2bn, compared with sales of $1.99bn for the corresponding prior-year period. Comparable-store sales were up 0.5%, while gross margin decreased to 34% from 35% a year ago. CEO Richard Johnson said: "The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April. Nonetheless, we believe our banners remain at the centre of a vibrant sneaker culture. We are confident that our customers have not lost their tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and that our position in the industry is stronger than ever." Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping 38% to US$22.2m from $35.9m last year. First-quarter gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 38.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs. Meanwhile, total sales fell to $239.7m, compared to $288m in the year-ago period. Same-store sales were also down, slipping 17%. CEO John Cato said: ""Our negative sales trend persisted throughout the first quarter, impacting margins and earnings as we continued to work through our merchandise missteps," stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "It is taking longer to work through these issues than expected and the remainder of the year will be impacted. We expect earnings for the year to be below last year." The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the first quarter, with the former dropping to US$16.3m from $23.1m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12.8% to $212.3m from net sales of $243.5m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 12.7%. Online sales were down 7.2% to $21.8m for the 13-week period ended 29 April. The Buckle also announced senior vice president of finance and CFO, Karen Rhoads,who joined the company in 1980, will retire later this summer. Rhoads will continue to serve as a member of the company's board of directors. The board has engaged an executive search firm to assist with the search for Rhoads' replacement. The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores widened its net loss to US$57.3m in the first quarter, compared to $37.8m in the year-ago period. The York, Pennsylvania-based company saw total sales fall by 9.3% to $536.1m from $591m in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales decreased 8.8% as compared with the prior year period. Meanwhile, gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate and increased delivery expenses. CEO Kathryn Bufano said: "Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift." Ross Stores Ross Stores booker higher sales and earnings in its first-quarter despite uncertainty and volatility in the market. Earnings reached US$321m from $291m a year earlier. Total sales were up 7% to $3.3bn, while comparable store sales grew 3%. Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded company expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. For the second quarter, the company is forecasting same store sales to be up 1% to 2%, on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76, up from $0.71 in the prior year period. Stage Stores Stage Stores widened its net loss to US$19m from $15.5m in the first quarter as the company incurred after-tax charges primarily associated with the Gordmans acquisition of about $4m. Net sales were also down, falling 7.3% to $308.6m, compared to $332.8m in the prior year. Meanwhile, comparable sales decreased 9.6%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "After a challenging February in which we saw negative double digit comps, we began to gain momentum and our business improved significantly during the combined March and April period. While we expect retail headwinds to continue in the near term, we believe that our selective acquisition of prime Gordmans' assets allows us to diversify with an off-price business model. We expect the acquisition to add scale to our business and be meaningfully accretive to our earnings in 2018." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it was pleased with a "solid start" to fiscal 2018, with top and bottom line results surpassing guidance, reflecting solid growth in its core brands driven by the earlier shipment of Spring merchandise and strong gross margin expansion. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$12.8m, compared to GAAP net income of $14.3m last year. GAAP Gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 37.6%, while adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points. Meanwhile, total sales dropped 7.3% to $242m from $261m last year, but ahead of guidance of $230mto $235 million. The company said the decline reflected a planned decrease in shipments given a reduction of customers' doors and inventory discipline to drive higher margin sales. Walmart Walmart has delivered what analysts say is an encouraging start to the year as sales grew 1.4% in the quarter to US$117.5bn. Excluding currency, sales were up 2.5% to $118.8bn. In its domestic market revenues were up 2.9% to $75.4bn, while international sales climbed 3.5% to $27.1bn. Net earnings, meanwhile, were down 1.3% in the period to $3.04bn. "We delivered a solid first-quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year. We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers," said CEO Doug McMillon. The Children's Place The Children's Place has booked what it says are "outstanding" operating results in the quarter with comparable sales, operating margin and earnings significantly above last year and the high end of its guidance. Net sales increased 4.1% to US$436.7m on the back of a comparable retail sales increased of 6.1%. Operating margin improved 170 basis points to 11.1%, while net income reached $36.2m from $26m a year earlier. American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters booked a mixed first-quarter as earnings slipped but sales increased. For the period ended 29 April, net income fell to US$25.2m from $40.5m last year. Gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 36.5% from 39.2% last year, primarily due to increased promotional activity and higher shipping costs related to a strong digital business. Meanwhile, total net revenue was up 2% to $761.8m, compared to $749.4m in the year-ago period. Consolidated comparable sales were also up 2%, following a 6% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "The first quarter results reflected mall traffic headwinds, especially early in the quarter, with improved trends over Easter and a strong digital business throughout. As we look ahead, we are taking the right steps to improve our results and adjust our business for today's rapidly evolving retail environment." L Brands  L Brands booked a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping to US$94.1m from $152.3m last year. For the three months ended 29 April, net sales fell 7% to $2.44bn compared to $2.61bn in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were also down, falling 9%. L Brands noted the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively. Looking ahead, the company increased its guidance for 2017 full-year earnings per share to $3.10 to $3.40 from $3.05 to $3.35 previously, and issued guidance for second quarter earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45. Target Corp US retail group Target said its first-quarter financial performance was "better" than its expectations, as net earnings rose 7.7% to US$681m from $632m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, sales slipped 1.1% to $16.0bn compared to $16.2bn last year, reflecting a comparable sales decline of 1.3%, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 22% and contributing 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 30.5%, compared with 30.9% in the year-ago period, reflecting increased digital channel fulfilment costs.  CEO Brian Cornell, said: "We are in the early stage of a multi-year effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity." Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters saw net income slip 59.8% in the first quarter, falling to US$11.9m from $29.6m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also down in the period, falling 0.2% to $761.2m compared to $762.6m last year. Total comparable retail segment net sales decreased 3.1%. By brand, comparable sales increased 1.5% at Free People, but decreased 3.1% at Urban Outfitters and 4.4% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by negative retail store comparable net sales. CEO Richard Hayne, said: "During the first quarter we continued to see strong double-digit growth from our direct-to-consumer channel and our wholesale business. We believe we have significant opportunity to continue to grow both of these channels at all of our brands." Dick's Sporting Goods Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said that despite a challenging retail environment, it realised growth across each of its three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear in the first quarter. For the period ended 29 April, net income reached US$58.2m compared to $56.9m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also up, increasing 9.9% to $1.8bn from $1.7bn last year. Looking ahead, CEO Edward Stack said the company will continue to "evaluate and adjust" its business model, and is taking actions to reduce its expense structure in order to fund and develop its longer-term strategic initiatives.

Net sales meanwhile, were up 19% to $40.1m from $33.7m in the prior year period, reflecting a 22% increase in wholesale segment sales and a 9% increase in consumer direct segment sales. The company added the sales increase was primarily due to sales from the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands for the full period. Gross margin fell to 46.4% compared to 48.5%last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans for the full quarter as well as the inclusion of Swims, which carry lower gross margin rates as primarily wholesale businesses. CEO Michael Buckley said the company is "pleased" with the progress it has made during the quarter, especially in its e-commerce business, which saw a 46% sales increase. Dillard's Dillard's has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its first-quarter, with net income falling to US$66.3m from $77.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped to $1.42bn from $1.50bn a year earlier, while gross margin from retail operations improved 65 basis points.

Weyco Weyco saw both sales and earnings slip in its first-quarter in the face of what it called a "challenging" retail environment.

Meanwhile, net sales for the quarter slipped to $69.1m, down 12% from $78.9m last year. CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr said: "The retail environment continues to be challenging, as retailers address reduced foot traffic in their brick and mortar stores.

Net income also reached record levels, up 13% to $36m from $31.8m in the year ago period. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 3%, and net income of between $192m and $199m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our first quarter results provide a good start to a year that presents many challenges, especially in the US, which has been impacted by customer bankruptcies, liquidations and ongoing efforts by US.retailers to rationalise their store fleets and square footage. We were encouraged by the Columbia brand's continued growth in Europe-direct markets during the first quarter and by the Sorel brand's successful launch of an expanded Spring assortment. In addition, our direct-to-consumer businesses were a source of growth in every region. "In the midst of changing consumer shopping patterns, our portfolio of powerful brands and strong balance sheet give us the ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth." Amazon Online retail giant Amazon has booked increases in both sales and earnings in its first-quarter thanks to new product and service launches globally, including seven private apparel brands to Prime members.

Operating margin also decreased, falling 210 basis points to 10.7%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 1.2% to $732.8m, reflecting growth in the company's domestic retail and wholesale sales, which was partially offset by a decline in International sales. CEO Michael Casey, said: "We achieved our sales and earnings objectives in the first quarter. Stronger than planned demand in our wholesale and ecommerce businesses helped to offset the effects of delayed tax refunds to families with young children and a later Easter holiday. "We have seen a meaningful improvement in sales trends in April, driven by Easter holiday shopping, and expect good growth in sales and earnings in the balance of the year."  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it pleased to have started off 2017 with a strong first-quarter, despite delivering a 15.6% drop in earnings. For the three months ended 31 March, net income fell to US$20.2m from $23.7m last year. However, the company said its highlight of the quarter was its Steve Madden women's wholesale footwear division, which enjoyed a period of "outstanding growth in a challenging retail environment". Net sales increased 11.2% to $366.4m, compared to $329.4m in the year-ago period. Gross margin widened to 36.2%, compared to 35.3% last year. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company will take a prudent approach to planning its business in light of retail industry headwinds, but added the strength in its core business "gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to navigate the uncertain environment".  Skechers Despite first-quarter net sales representing a new quarterly record and the first time the company has exceeded US$1bn in quarterly sales, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip in the three months ended 31 March. Sales in the quarter were up 9.6% to $1.07bn on last year, primarily due to a 16.8% increase in the company's international wholesale business and a 12.8% rise in its company-owned global retail business which included comparable same-store sales increases of 2.9%. However, earnings slipped 3.7% to $94m, compared to $97.6m in the year-ago period. CEO David Weinberg said: "We are particularly proud of the growth in the quarter considering the tough comparison to 2016, which included the benefit of an additional day in February and Easter falling in March." Rocky Brands Rocky Brands says it has made a "solid start" to 2017 as it moved to a profit thanks to doubling its military segment sales to a quarterly record US$12m. Net income in the three months ended 31 March amounted to $1.5m from a loss of $0.2m a year earlier. Net sales meanwhile, increased 9.6% to $63.1m, compared to $57.5m in the year-ago period. Wholesale sales declined 2.5% to $39.2m, while retail sales edged up to $11.9m from $11.5m. Gross margin dropped 160 basis points to 31.3%, driven by the increase in military segment sales which carry lower gross margins than its wholesale and retail segments. CEO Mike Brooks said: "The actions we have taken over the past six months to better position the company for profitable growth are clearly gaining traction. While there is still work ahead of us in order to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, we are confident we are heading in the right direction." Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade saw earnings slump to US$1.4m in the three months ended 1 April, from $11.6m a year earlier. The company incurred a $7m of pre-tax store impairment charge and $2m of pre-tax fees and expenses related to its strategic review. Gross margin widened to 63.2% from 61.8%, but net sales dropped 1.2% to $271m. Same-store sales fell 2.4% for the quarter, and were down 8.1% excluding e-commerce.  Direct-to-consumer comparable sales fell 2%. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase in the first quarter, up 4% to US$1.10bn from $1.06bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 26 February, net income slipped to $60m, down 9% from $66m last year. The decline primarily reflected lower gross margins, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 51.2% from 53%. In Europe, net revenues were up 12%, while in the Americas sales dropped by 1% and Asia net revenues declined 2%. "Despite the on-going challenges in the industry, I am pleased that we delivered 5% currency-neutral growth over a strong Q1 last year," said Chip Bergh, president and CEO. "We were able to deliver these solid results despite a declining US wholesale business, because of the breadth of our portfolio. Specifically, we grew in all three regions, with particularly outstanding results in Europe; double digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business; and double digit growth on women's and tops."

Comparable-store sales fell for the fourth consecutive quarter, but the decline was nowhere near as bad as expected and online sales surged 22 percent. "We feel good about the fact that we significantly over-delivered versus expectations in the first quarter," CEO Brian Cornell told reporters during a conference call. "But we have several years of work in front of us and we have to stay very focused on execution each and every day." While growing online sales and rising profits pushed shares up more than 8 percent before the opening bell Wednesday, Cornell still needs to find a way to thrive in the face of intense pressure Amazon.com and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Facing those challenges, Target plans to spend $7 billion over the next three years, more than three times its typical capital expenditure, to remodel more than a third of its 1,800 stores, speed up its expansion of small-format stores, bolster online operations, and launch new brands. The company will also use stores as local distribution hubs — using the backroom storage areas to also house goods bought online directly to homes, or held there to be picked up by shoppers. Target is now using about 1,000 stores for direct shipping in a bid to match Amazon's free, two-day delivery available to its Prime customers. With those measures in place, Target said it expects profits to start growing again in 2019 after taking a hit of $1 billion this year to profit margins. "Things are better, not totally dire," said Edward Jones retail analyst Brian Yarbrough. "But they have a long ways to go to showing (Wall Street) they are on an improvement plan and show same-store sales positive consistently and grow earnings." Cornell had said Target wants to return to more consistent low prices on essentials to deepen loyalty among shoppers, a shift from the temporary discounts it had been promoting. That might look like it's stealing a page from Wal-Mart's playbook. But Cornell said Target is focusing on exclusive brands and the experience customers have in stores as well. All traditional retailers have struggled as Amazon and other online retailers draw shoppers away. Under Cornell, Target had cut costs, revitalized its fashion and home decor sections, tested smaller formats, and expanded online services. But Cornell found those efforts were not paying off. As Target rebuilds, Wal-Mart is expected to post another quarter of rising customer traffic and increased same-store sales Thursday as its efforts to merge online sales with its vast number of stores click. Back in 2015, Wal-Mart warned that stepped-up investments in stores and in its employees would hurt profits. Those investments appear to be paying. Traffic and sales are booming at stores as a renewed emphasis on low prices has lured shoppers back. Target is also testing a program called Restock that lets its REDcard customers order household essentials like laundry detergent, paper towels and peanut butter and have them delivered to their homes the next day. The service, being tested with employees for now, is similar to Amazon Pantry. Target said Wednesday that it earned $681 million or $1.23 per share, for the quarter ended April 29. Earnings, adjusted for pretax gains and to account for discontinued operations, came to $1.21 per share, well below the 91 cents per share that Wall Street had expected according to FactSet. Revenue fell 1.1 percent to $16.02 billion, but still beat out analyst projections of $15.62 billion. Comparable store sales fell 1.3 percent, the fourth consecutive month of declines, but with the company retrenching, it was much better than the 3.7 percent decline that industry analysts had expected. Shares jumped $4.53 to $59.06, but they're still down more than 24 percent for the year. MPR News reporter Martin Moylan contributed to this report.

 Walmart's online sales soar Jonathan Camhi May 19, 2017, 10:43 AM 1,830 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Walmart expands in India Walmart and Target could beat Amazon on drone delivery Target's chief innovation officer leaves This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walmart reported comparable-store sales growth for the 11th straight quarter in Q1 2017, but, even more importantly, the company grew its US e-commerce sales and gross merchandise volume (GMV) by an incredible 63% and 69% year-over-year (YoY), respectively. That digital growth helped the company increase revenue by 1.4% YoY to $117.5 billion for the quarter. Although Walmart has acquired a string of startups in recent months, company executives said most of the online sales growth came through Walmart.com. The acquisitions may have contributed to that growth, though, since Walmart has been listing some merchandise from its newly acquired brands on the flagship site. This could be attracting new customers to Walmart.com, as most of the acquired companies appeal to younger and higher-income consumers than the retailer has traditionally drawn. The growth indicates the company’s overall efforts around digital are paying off. Besides diversifying its product assortment, Walmart’s e-commerce acquisitions have also brought in new talent, including Jet.com founder Marc Lore, who now leads the company’s push to compete with Amazon in digital retail. In addition, it recently rolled out a new two-day, free shipping policy, which prompted Amazon to lower its own free shipping minimum for non-Prime members. Executives attributed some of Walmart.com’s increased traffic and sales to the new policy. Additionally, Walmart recently started discounting online orders that are picked up in-store, rolled out new mobile app features for its pharmacy and money services customers, and opened a new tech incubator in Silicon Valley. However, Walmart is still far from competing on even ground with Amazon in the US e-commerce sector. Walmart doesn’t break out its total online sales numbers, but Internet Retailer estimated its 2015 online sales were $13.7 billion, and its online sales have hovered at around 3% of total sales in recent years. In comparison, Amazon’s online retail revenue topped $90 billion in 2016, when the e-commerce titan took 43% of all US e-commerce sales, according to research firm Slice Intelligence. Even more alarming, Slice estimated that Amazon captured 53% of the growth in the US e-commerce market last year. Walmart clearly started 2017 on a positive note, but it will have to do far more to catch up with Amazon, which shows no signs of slowing down.

Now that stocks of the console are in danger of running out soon, fans who still haven’t got one are desperately waiting for their chance to buy one. But lucky ones should be able to get one from select Walmart and Target stores that still receive a number of units. Walmart And Target Getting New Stocks Everyday Not all branches simultaneously get a few Nintendo NES Classic, but daily, some stocks go to different Walmart and Target stores all around the country. Even GameStop sometimes receives supplies. The best way to know if a store near you has the goods is by setting up alerts from tracking websites such as iStockNow and BrickSeek. These websites notify you when a Walmart, Target, or GameStop store updates their inventory of the NES Classic Edition. They also tell how many units are on hand, and it’s not unusual at all to see only two consoles in stock. Thus, when you receive a notification, it’s best to drop everything and run off to the store if you want to have a chance to get one. Even if you do that, there’s usually another buyer or two standing in line outside the shop before it even opens. [Image by Scott Olson/Getty Images] As of this writing, iStockNow lists 50 Walmart stores in the U.S., two Target, and three GameStop outlets that have the console. You can set up notifications now to get alerted when the list is updated. If you want a couple of tips on how to snag an NES Classic, read more in a previous report by Inquisitr. Get Your NES Classic Edition From Amazon First things first – the NES Classic Edition that’s available on the website isn’t from Amazon itself, so you can expect the price to be much higher than the original tag of $60. But if you’re willing to spend more than thrice of that, then the online retailer is your best friend. There are not that many independent sellers who are still selling the NES Classic unlike a month before. Right now, you can find one that is selling the console for $200 and above. It’s too pricey for a platform that can only play 30 retro games and comes with one controller, but if you don’t want to go through the hassle of waiting for stock updates and then driving for hours just to be the fourth in line when there’s only three in stock, you can splurge just to get it over with. NES Classic And Switch Tops April Console Sales Although the NES Classic Edition has been discontinued last month, it still outsold PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, VentureBeat reports. It’s likely that its discontinuation played a part on the buying frenzy on top of the low price that makes it perfect for gifting. The console was second only to the Nintendo Switch, so you can tell it was a pretty good month for the gaming company. However, despite the obvious demand of the market, Nintendo is still having a hard time producing enough stocks. [Image by forg0t/Shutterstock] As Inquisitr previously reported, the Nintendo Switch is also facing shortages. Many who want to own one have no choice but to wait for stocks in their favorite store. Basically, it’s like the NES Classic Edition case all over again. Again, scalpers are taking advantage of the situation by selling overpriced units on Amazon or eBay. But if you’re patient enough, you can get one for its original price as it is not going anywhere anytime soon unlike the retro console.

Login Search Kelly Services, Investar Holding, Walmart, Target and Amazon.com highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day May 19, 2017, 09:30:49 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - May 19, 2017 - Zacks Equity Research Kelly Services (NASDAQ: KELYA - Free Report ) as the Bull of the Day, Investar Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: ISTR - Free Report ) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart (NYSE: WMT - Free Report ), Target (NYSE: TGT - Free Report ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN - Free Report ). Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Bull of the Day : Good news everyone, the stock market didn't crash Thursday. Even better, it rebounded a bit, rallying off Wednesday's lows. So instead of ducking underneath the desk expecting a thousand aftershocks, it's time to really dig in and look for stocks to buy for the next leg higher. Here I found one I'm naming my Bull of the Day , Kelly Services (NASDAQ: KELYA - Free Report ). Kelly Services, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides workforce solutions to various industries worldwide. The company operates through seven segments: Americas Commercial; Americas Professional and Technical; Europe, Middle East and Africa Commercial; Europe, Middle East and Africa Professional and Technical; Asia Pacific Commercial; Asia Pacific Professional and Technical; and Outsourcing and Consulting Group. Kelly is topping our ranks as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now because of recent earnings estimate revisions coming from analysts. Bullish revisions to current year, next year and current quarter estimates have been made over the last week. The increased EPS estimates have pushed our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current quarter up from 15 cents to 23 cents. Our current year numbers have gone from $1.52 to $1.72, while next year's consensus has shifted from $1.65 to $1.87. The stock is in an industry that ranks in the Top 21% of our Zacks Industry Rank. This year, the staffing industry is up 2.2% while shares of Kelly Services are up 5%. Most of this relative outperformance has happened since mid-April. KELYA shares have rallied 17.5% off the mid-April lows while the rest of the industry is up 1.6% over that same time period. Bear of the Day : During the initial stages of the market's reaction to Donald Trump's surprise Election Day victory small cap stocks were on fire. The Russell 2000 small cap index added 20% in a little over a month. Helping to fuel that rally were regional banks. These banks were at the perfect intersection of expectations for rate hikes and hopes of a reinvigorated US economy. As a result, several regional bank stocks became darlings of the stock market. With the MAGA Trade well in our rearview mirror, it may be time to reconsider a few of these stocks. Or, at the very least, take a look under the hood and perhaps even take some risk off the table. Today's Bear of the Day is one of these regional bank stocks, Investar Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: ISTR - Free Report ) operates as the bank holding company for Investar Bank that provides a range of commercial banking products for individuals and small to medium-sized businesses in South Louisiana. It accepts various deposit products and services, such as savings, checking, money market, NOW, and individual retirement accounts, as well as various certificates of deposit; debit cards; and mobile banking services. The company also offers multifamily, farmland, and commercial real estate loans; loans for the construction of commercial projects, and single family residential and multifamily properties; commercial and industrial loans, including working capital lines of credit and equipment loans; consumer loans comprising secured and unsecured installment and term loans, second mortgages, and home equity loans and lines of credit, as well as auto loans; and one-to-four family residential real estate loans consisting of second and other mortgage loans. Earnings estimates have dropped for the current quarter, next quarter and the current year. Quietly we've seen our Zacks Consensus Estimate come down from 29 cents to 23 cents for the current quarter. Next quarter's estimates have dipped from 33 cents to 29 cents. The current year Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone from $1.25 to $1.12. This quarter, EPS is expected to contract 10% from last year's number. Additional content: Walmart vs. Target: Who Performed Better in Q1? Big-box favorites Walmart (NYSE: WMT - Free Report ) and Target (NYSE: TGT - Free Report ) had surprisingly good quarters as well, with shares of both companies rising as a result. Who performed better in Q1? And who is better-positioned in the long-term? Let's break down Walmart's and Target's results to find out. Walmart Still America's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings of $1.00 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents. Total revenues came in at $117.5 billion, falling just short of our consensus estimate but increasing 1.4% year-over-year. U.S. same-store sales rose 1.4%, beating analyst estimates and marking the 11 th -consecutive period of positive sales in the Walmart's home market; comp traffic improved 1.5%, though average ticket declined 0.1% in Q1. The impact of rising consumer spending was seen in improved traffic during the quarter. Operating income declined 0.7% to $5.24 billion, though this was due to Walmart's continued investments in e-commerce initiatives as it takes on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN - Free Report ). Speaking of online, Walmart noted that its e-commerce business saw gross merchandise volume soar 69%, a sign that last year's $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com may finally be paying off. Walmart now boasts 50 million items on its website, up from 35 million in the last quarter. Target While not the country's biggest retailer, Target may be one of Americans' most preferred. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents. Net revenues came in at $16.02 billion, also beating our consensus estimate but decreasing 1.1% year-over-year. Net income rose to $681 million, while Target said that its same-store sales fell 1.3%, a much narrower decline than the 3.7% analysts were forecasting. The company attributes this to a decline in customer visits and shoppers picking up fewer items on average; sales in its struggling food and beverage business were also down. Target continues to expand its online presence, and Q1 was no exception: comparable digital channel sales grew 22% and contributed 0.8 percentage points to overall same-store sales growth. Target is trying to replicate the kind of shopping experience customers know and love in its stores on its website. We all know these memes about walking into a Target and when getting to the check out, not knowing how you just spent so much money. Target's management is looking to mimic that kind of "impulse purchasing power" in its online store. Who did it better? While Target beat analyst expectations across the board, giving investors renewed hope that its turnaround efforts might be starting to take effect, the company's CEO, Brad Cornell, knows Target can perform better. "We're not doing any high-fives in the room here today," he told analysts and investors on the company's earnings call. "Our first-quarter performance is not what we expect to deliver over time." But Target is taking big steps to improve short- and long-term growth. The company is planning on rolling out 12 original brands over the next two years in hopes of getting more customers back in its stores; the first, called Cloud Island, will debut later in May and features home décor, bedding, and bath items. Target also plans on expanding its smaller-format stores that populate larger metropolitan areas. Target COO John Mulligan said that for the company's 10 most "mature small-format stores, we are seeing double-digit comp increases on average so far this year." The clear winner in this particular match-up, however, is Walmart. Most strikingly, of course, is the retailer's insane online growth. Not only is it giving Amazon a run for its money through its website sales, but Walmart has also been boosting its online acquisition portfolio, scooping up Moosejaw, Modcloth, Shoebuy, and potentially Bonobos, in addition to Jet.com. At the same time, Walmart is taking steps to improve its many brick-and-mortar stores, implementing cleaner aisles and faster checkouts, for example. The company is also doubling down on pricing in its grocery division, making sure its prices are best in comparison to rivals like Kroger and Aldi. Both giants have plans to expand their store count this year, and each of these companies' earnings report is a sign that the Retail sector has some life left in it. Walmart, especially, is impressive, and while its online expansion hasn't come cheap-its expenses grew faster that its sales in Q1-the retail giant is a consistently great example of a company taking on Amazon…and winning?

Fallon/Bloomberg Foot Locker Plunges After Blaming Tax-Refund Lag for Slowdown by Nick Turner @SFNick More stories by Nick Turner May 19, 2017, 7:58 AM EDT May 19, 2017, 10:43 AM EDT Company says it faced ‘unprecedented challenges’ last quarter Retailers ranging from Wal-Mart to L Brands have cited effect Foot Lo cker Inc. suffered its worst stock decline in more than eight years after first-quarter results missed analysts’ estimates, an outcome the retailer blamed in part on slow income-tax refunds. The shares tumbled as much as 17 percent to $58.13, the biggest intraday plunge since the financial crisis was underway in November 2008. Foot Locker was Friday’s biggest decliner in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index by a wide margin. The athletic-shoe chain blamed “unprecedented challenges” last quarter -- especially in February, when same-store sales plummeted by a percentage in the low teens. February is typically one of the biggest months of the year for Foot Locker, but a lag in consumers receiving their tax refunds hampered results, the New York-based company said. Foot Locker joins a long list of retailers blaming the delays. Just this week, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Advance Auto Parts Inc., L Brands Inc. and Ross Stores Inc. cited the effect when reporting quarterly sales. It’s hard to tell how much credence investors lend to the tax-return complaint, but broader concerns about retail have made life hard on chains that miss estimates. Foot Locker reported first-quarter earnings of $1.36 a share, trailing the $1.38 predicted by analysts. Its sales came in at $2 billion in the period, which ended April 29. The average estimate was $2.02 billion. “The first quarter was one of our most profitable quarters ever, but it did fall short of our original expectations,” Chief Executive Officer Dick Johnson said in a statement. “The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income-tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In a news release, Walmart said the company's most recent earnings report shows "continued positive momentum in U.S. sales, customer traffic and customer feedback." U.S. sales accounted for $74.5 billion in the first quarter of the fiscal year. The biggest news is the 2.5 million square-foot distribution center planned for Mobile, which is expected to employ more than 550 full-time employees. But Walmart is also planning: *Multi-million dollar projects to remodel its Northport, Tuscaloosa, Alexander City, Guntersville, Enterprise, Brewton and Mobile locations. *The launch of Walmart Academies in Wetumpka and Fairhope, with plans to launch more this summer. Earlier this year, the company launched a Walmart Academy in Gadsden, which provides two-to-six weeks of training. John Tow, regional general manager for Alabama, said 2017 promises to be "an exciting year" for Walmart. "We've had a sharp focus on making our store experience second to none and our customers are telling us that our plan is working," he said. Last year, Walmart opened five new stores and remodeled nine in Alabama, as well as launched online grocery pickup service in Birmingham, Mobile and Montgomery. Other numbers from the retailers report: *Walmart has hired 4,750 veterans in Alabama since May 2013. *Walmart and the Walmart Foundation invested more than $1.4 billion locally in the 2017 fiscal year, including more than $30 million in cash and in-kind contributions to non-profits in Alabama. *In addition, the company awarded grants from the Walmart State Giving Program, including $50,000 to Alabama Childhood Food Solutions; $50,000 to Children's Hospital of Alabama; $50,000 to Downtown Jimmie Hale Mission, and $25,000 to YMCA of Birmingham. *Donated 16 million pounds of food to local food banks, and donated $560,000 to after school and breakfast classroom programs in Alabama. *Associates volunteered more than 24,000 hours with Alabama non-profits and charitable causes.

Skip to main content Home Store Systems Analytics Digital Commerce Supply Chain / Merchandising Customer Engagement Home Research & Reports Magazine RIS Events RIS Talks Video Contact Us SUBSCRIBE Press enter to search Store Systems Analytics Digital Commerce Supply Chain / Merchandising Customer Engagement Home Research & Reports Magazine RIS Events RIS Talks Video Contact Us Experts Weigh In On Walmart's Next-Gen Stores Press enter to search Experts Weigh In On Walmart's Next-Gen Stores By Jamie Grill-Goodman - 05/19/2017 Walmart is testing six next-gen approaches in two recently opened supercenters in Tomball, TX, and Lake Nona, FL. These stores were fully reimagined from a new layout, to building and environmental enhancements, to added technology that all improve the shopping experience, according to a blog post written by Jeff Muench, senior director of Business Development. "Walmart has always been willing to pioneer in new technology to grow the company, and the focus on in-store technology is telling," says Stuart Aldrige, Principal, Columbus Consulting International. "Amazon may have web hits and clicks, but Walmart has breathtaking footfall numbers and with that they have an opportunity to create a whole new experience for the customer that will change their view on what shopping can be. They have also taken to heart the connection between online and in-store and are trying to blur the lines; largely because that's how the next generation wants to shop. These may only be a couple of prototype stores in a global portfolio of bricks and mortar, but it's as clear an insight as we are likely to see into how Walmart believes it can fend off the online competition." Both new stores feature a reimagined store layout. For example, services like the beauty salon and tech repair are adjacent to relevant merchandise. Health and wellness departments are consolidated to create a single destination. Baby, toys, kids' apparel and kids' shoes form a single destination to "ease mom’s shopping journey." Here's a peak at the six technological advancements the next-gen stores offer:   Scan & Go Scan & Go technology works both on personal smartphones and Walmart-provided handheld devices. Customers are greeted on their way into the store by a large bank of these Scan & Go wands, and new digital produce scales have been added to make scanning weighable items much easier. Scan & Go fast pass checkout lanes allow customers to bypass the traditional checkout process. "Walmart’s offering of smartphone checkout in its next-generation stores points toward a more mobile-focused customer journey, one many merchants have been proactively pursuing for several years with the provision of mobile optimized websites and native smartphone apps, which provide exactly the kind of ideal buying experiences Walmart is looking to create in-store," notes Casey Gannon, VP of Marketing, Shopgate. SmartLife New interactive projection technology allows customers to learn about IoT connected devices (Google Home, Apple TV, Nest, baby monitors and connected thermostats). Images are projected onto tables and walls, and the product details can be updated quickly through the new platform. Integrated Pickup Shoppers can use the outside drive-thru to pick up weekly groceries, prescriptions and Walmart.com orders. Extended Aisles The Tomball Supercenter features interactive screens offering access to an extended curated selection of online-only items in almost 100 categories. Customers can order products, pay with the rest of their basket at checkout and pick up two days later. “Walmart is doing a brilliant job at truly blurring the lines between physical and digital shopping," comments Nick McLean, CEO, OrderDynamics. "Literally, they have brought digital terminals right into the physical store. Whether you are on Wifi doing mobile shopping, or finding your goods on the lookup terminal, doing an online pickup, or putting in an online order from the store, Walmart is making the physical presence a digital destination. Better yet, every store is now an order fulfillment destination. They are catering to the shopper’s preferred buying journey and are leveraging their strengths – namely having both physical and digital locations." Appointment Setting and Ordering Technology Both stores test a new appointment and ordering kiosk system where a shopper places an order, goes shopping, then comes back to pick it up. If the initial test in the deli area goes well, Walmart says the tech could be expanded to the pharmacy, Auto Care Center, beauty salon and more. Next-Gen Call Buttons Shoppers simply press a Wi-Fi-connected call button and wearable GPS-enabled devices alert associates that assistance is needed. Associates wearing these devices are trained in specific store areas and are on call to help in the furniture, paint, fabrics, sporting goods and bikes areas of the store. “Walmart’s deployment of next-gen call buttons and wearables for hourly workers in their two new test stores underscores a key trend in retail today – winning retailers must empower store associates to effectively engage with customers, or else they won’t survive," says Adam Silverman, SVP Marketing, Theatro. "Connected customers have much higher expectations of associates, and new engagement technology must be employed to bolster the role of the greatest asset brick-and-mortar retailers have - their team. " “In the ongoing saga between Amazon and Walmart, this is an obvious move to give consumers an opportunity to experience the omnichannel store of the ‘now,'" says David Buckingham, CEO, Ecrebo. "But Wal-Mart clearly wants to showcase its commitment to long-term customer loyalty and in-store convenience and speed." “Walmart’s test pilot of their next-generation store concept is a clear indicator that the retail industry is gearing up to finally answer the age of consumer-driven retail — one that creates a seamless customer experience throughout all channels and easily integrates responsive and effective technology with all consumer touch points during the purchase journey," says Tushar Patel, CMO, Kibo. "Our recent Consumer Trends research report which surveyed 3,000 consumers indicated that 94% of consumers expect the online and in-store experience to be one connected experience. The digital components will help retailers such as Walmart achieve the convenience and speed consumers want when shopping, while the physical channel will give consumers the experiential portion of the shopping experience by giving them products that they can touch, feel and tryout before the final purchase.”   SHARE YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Supply Chain and Merchandising Strategic Partners Implements NGC’s Fashion PLM Software Supply Chain and Merchandising Walmart Battles Amazon With the One Thing the E-Commerce Giant Lacks E-Commerce Platform Jos.

The world’s largest retailer said Thursday that sales at established stores rose for the eleventh straight quarter, and customer traffic rose for the tenth quarter in a row. That’s a contrast with many rivals that saw both those figures drop. Online sales at Walmart.com rose 63 percent, dramatically up from the 29 percent growth in the previous quarter. Though the company has been buying up smaller internet retailers, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. “We’re transforming to become more of a digital enterprise,” said Doug McMillon, CEO and president of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Wal-Mart’s report stood out amid a largely gloomy environment for retailers, after chains like Macy’s, Kohl’s, J.C. Penney and Target saw declines in comparable-store sales. Even off-price retailer TJX Cos., which has done better than many as customers hunt for bargains, missed forecasts for that sales measure. And it underscores Wal-Mart’s efforts to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon, and widen the distance between itself and other competitors. Retails bankruptcies are setting a record pace this year, and store closures are expected to exceed those of 2008 after the financial crisis. Research firm RetailMetrics, which tracks results from more than a hundred chains, said overall they are expected to record a flat increase in revenue at established stores for the quarter, the worst performance since the third quarter of 2009. Excluding Wal-Mart’s results, there would be a 0.8 percent decline. “Wal-Mart is effectively competing in a tough retail environment, and given its size, scale, and leverage will be able to stay the course on the current strategy,” Stifel analyst Mark S. Astrachan wrote in a note. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company has retooled how it operates online, as customers get used to free shipping and other enticements that add costs and hurt the bottom line. It has also accelerated that shift with its acquisitions. Wal-Mart spent more than $3 billion for Jet.com last year in its bid to lure younger and more affluent customers. With Jet.com founder Marc Lore installed as head of Walmart.com, it bought ShoeBuy.com, outdoor gear seller Moosejaw and trendy clothing seller ModCloth. The clothing sites are operating as stand-alone operators, separate from Walmart.com, and appeal to younger shoppers. The company is still looking for startups to buy. Since Lore joined the company, the number of items available, including on its third-party online marketplace, has risen to more than 50 million. That’s up 10 million from a year ago. Wal-Mart is working to accelerate the integration between Walmart.com and Jet.com, and trying to take advantage of its scale in areas like shipping. McMillon said that while the acquisitions have garnered lots of attention, “the plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success.” “The majority of our growth is and will be organic,” said McMillon. “The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up.” Wal-Mart is aggressively trying to compete with Amazon’s juggernaut Prime membership, scrapping a fee-based shipping program test earlier this year in favor of free, two-day shipping for online orders of its most popular items with a minimum purchase order of $35. Lore told reporters Thursday that Wal-Mart customers are placing more orders and spending more than before. The Amazon Prime program costs $99 a year, but comes with services like streaming music and video. Amazon has countered, lowering the free-shipping minimum purchase price for non-members. In April, Wal-Mart also began offering discounts on thousands of online-only items when customers elect to have them shipped to a store for pickup — cheaper for the company than delivering to people’s homes. Wal-Mart plans to expand the price cuts to more than a million items by the end of June. Even as it goes after Amazon online, Wal-Mart is shoring up its stores, working to make customer service friendlier and faster. It’s also trying to be more aggressive in having lower, consistent prices throughout the store. The company has also invested $2.7 billion in higher wages and training for workers to decrease turnover and make the shopping experience more appealing. For the first quarter, sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.5 percent, at the top end of the company’s estimated range. That was fueled by a customer traffic increase of 1.5 percent. Wal-Mart said its grocery business continued to improve, with food categories delivering the strongest sales performance in more than three years. Grocery is a key category because it drives shoppers frequently to the store and they are then likely to pick up other items. Wal-Mart reported first-quarter profit of $3.04 billion. On a per-share basis, it earned $1. The results beat Wall Street expectations of 96 cents per share, according to a poll by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue was $117.54 billion, just shy of the $117.63 billion analysts had expected. The company expects its per-share earnings to range from $1 to $1.08 for the current quarter. Analysts forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. Shares rose 2.5 percent, or $1.88, to $77. 00 in afternoon trading Thursday. ——— Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio ————— Elements of the story was generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

Minnesota Shopper Wrestles Deer to the Ground in Wal-Mart twitter Tweet email Email Lifestyle Fresh Venison! Minnesota Shopper Wrestles Deer to the Ground in Wal-Mart By Tyler O'Neil 2017-05-18T06:13:23 chat comments Fresh Venison! Minnesota Shopper Wrestles Deer to the Ground in Wal-Mart Around 7:30 p.m. Tuesday afternoon, a deer appeared in the dog food section at a Wal-Mart in Wadena, Minnesota. A brave man wrestled the deer to the ground and helped authorities remove the fresh venison from the store. "It came in through the garden doors, it must have been eating the flowers or something," Stephanie Koljonen, a shopper who photographed the situation, said. The Wadena Police Department confirmed that a deer did wander through the store. Susan Holub Horstmann immortalized the incident on social media, posting "Walmart in Wadena!" with a photo of the deer subdued by a burly man. The brave shopper who subdued the deer was Tom Grasswick, fittingly from Deer Creek. He joked that he was trying to save a few bucks when a little buck jumped right into him. "It felt like I got slugged or something," Grasswick recalled. He said instinct led him to subdue the deer. "I figured I was bigger than the deer so I'd win that wrestling match," he joked. After tackling the young deer, Grasswick and others covered its eyes in order to lead it outside, where it was set free. No one was injured. Horstmann's photo has gotten 144 shares on Facebook, and quite a few great comments. "Fresh venison in the meat department!" quipped commenter Craig Weigel. "The deer really like that Ol Roy dog food," another joked. Deer in Wal-Mart stores have become something of a common occurrence in 2017, as the wildlife make their own protests (against Trump or the liberal media, take your pick). In March, a deer wandered into a store in Pikeville, Kentucky. Local professional wrestler Adam Newsome took a photo of the deer around 8 p.m. on March 19. The deer did not cause any damage, and officials were able to get it out safely. Last November, a man who appeared to be drinking liquor inside a Wal-Mart in Short Pump, Virginia, also pushed a cart with a dead deer inside it. "It's just one of those crazy Walmart pictures," Denise Collier-Bailey, a mother with her teenage daughter who saw the deer in the cart, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "If I hadn't been there to witness it myself, I wouldn't have believed it." Details Emerge About Pet Deer That Was Shot Dead by Kansas Game Warden Collier-Bailey reported seeing the deer carcass around 7:15 p.m., roughly the same time as the deer incidents reported in Minnesota and Kentucky. Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries spokesman Robert Lee Walker Jr. explained that the man might have been trying to check the deer in, as required by state law. "It appears that the hunters were trying to follow the law by checking in the harvested deer but were not at an approved check station," he hypothesized. https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/05/18/fresh-venison-minnesota-shopper-wrestles-deer-to-the-ground-in-wal-mart/ load more facebook Share Fresh Venison!

Dr. Marco Moran, Founder and CEO of the Company, stated, „We have developed a strong relationship with Walmart as we have proven ourselves to be the longest standing relaxation beverage on their shelves in the history of Walmart, despite the fact that other brands in the past had much deeper pockets than us.” Dr. Moran continued, „Our brand is authentic and rooted in a long-standing lifestyle that only grows stronger. Furthermore, we back it up with quality service and merchandizing to all of our major retail partners when others companies tend to lag once they close the deal.” Dewmar International Board Members have discussed the possibilities of undergoing a significant capital raise, from credible sources not perceived to cause financial harm to the Company over the upcoming months to assist with massive marketing and promotions efforts associated with the largest chain retailer distribution expansion project in the history of the Company. Furthermore, the Company shall be enlisting the aid of third party marketing agencies, such as Advantage Solutions, to provide sampling promotions in all applicable stores and to participate in a vast Walmart Retailtainment program over the next 6 to 12 months.

X Fidget spinner craze turns the toy industry on its head Failure of traditional manufacturers to get ahead of trend has created a ‘wild west’ marketplace about 20 hours ago Fidget spinners are wholesaling from Chinese factories for as little as 50 US cent. Photograph: Reuters         When Ryan Weaver was laid off from his job on an Alaskan oil rig last year, he says he turned to God to give him “just one idea” to pay off the $160,000 (€143,000) he owed in student debt. The 26-year-old’s salvation came in the form of a decades-old spinning propeller toy. In October his wife, a special education teacher, asked him to order “fidget” gadgets for her class. Noticing that similar toys, designed to relieve stress, were all across YouTube, he decided to try his luck selling them on Amazon. Now he sells 500 to 1,000 spinners a day for $17.95 a pop. “As soon as I got them in stock they were selling like crazy,” Mr Weaver says. “Literally the whole debt has been paid off now...it was really cool because we love Jesus.” Mr Weaver is one of the earlier enterprising adults to take notice of a viral craze that has shaken the $90 billion global toy industry. When he first listed fidget spinners in December under the company EWR Products, there were only one or two other sellers on Amazon. Four months later Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is scrambling to air freight spinners directly from Chinese factories to get them into stores faster, while street retailers in Ireland and elsewhere take advantage of shortages of the official product. In terms of customer inquiries, the fidget spinners are “the biggest craze” for any product Walmart has seen in the past five years, says Michelle Malashock, a spokeswoman. The company is circumventing its distribution centres, to quickly replenish stock across its 3,500 supercentres. Unlike previous consumer fads, the fidget spinners craze sprang up in the bowels of the internet. The earliest version emerged in 1997 from Catherine Hettinger, an engineer, who let the patent expire on her invention in 2005. After more than a decade-long lull, newer versions of fidget spinners were recently revived into relevance among schoolchildren on YouTube and Instagram, yielding a cottage industry of anonymous individuals and small toy manufacturers that shipped the gadgets from Chinese factories to American corner stores and gas stations. ‘Free-for-all’ “It’s the wild west,” says Josh Loerzel, vice president of marketing at Zing, a toy manufacturer that ships to Walmart and Toys R Us. “The biggest toy I’ve seen in at least 10 years, and it’s been a total free-for-all. It’s not a big-bucks driven, premeditated thing. It blew up the opposite way.”  It is difficult to gauge the size of the market for fidget spinners. NPD, a data group, does not have figures yet because large corporations such as Walmart and Target only in the past few weeks have begun selling them, and most sales have taken place across a fragmented, murkier marketplace. The big retailers do not disclose individual product sales, although one said it was selling 100,000 spinners a week. Zing expects to ship 4 or 5 million fidget spinners this year.  Observers say the buzz surrounding fidget spinners underscores how much the toy industry, and more broadly the world of retail, has changed. Toy industry sales have been growing at a rate of about 3 per cent a year since 2011, although toymakers have been hurt by the ever-shorter life cycles of products - mirroring the rise of the fast fashion sold by H&M and Zara - and the emergence of Amazon as the premier destination for online shopping.  “This really proves the ability for smaller players to have a big financial impact, through Amazon,” says Matt Quint, a marketing professor at Columbia Business School. “It shows the power of platforms like Amazon and YouTube. When there’s consumer demand it doesn’t really matter who the suppliers are.” With spinners wholesaling for $0.50 to $1.50 from Chinese factories, and no patents or licensing fees to be paid, “the margins are astronomical”, says Chris Byrne, a 30-year toy veteran and editor of Toys, Tots, Pets & More, a trade publication. “Right now the toy industry is in full reactive mode because they don’t want to miss out on those sales. They don’t want to cede ground to Amazon.” While storied brands such as Star Wars have held their cache in the toy market, newer ones such as Frozen and Finding Dory have a much shorter shelf life, and internet fads such as fidget spinners present an even larger challenge.  Mr Loerzel says fast-moving trends favour smaller companies that can work more nimbly. “The big giants [Hasbro and Mattel] typically take up 90 to 95 per cent of the business and everyone else is left scrapping. This has flipped the script...it’s about how quickly you can react.” Mr Loerzel says that during recent meetings with Walmart management in Hong Kong, “all anyone was talking about was spinners”, even though the companies were there to plan products for Spring of 2018.  Lead time “Things take a while to get to every Walmart, and toys usually have a longer lead time,” says Ms Malashock. “We’re already planning [the autumn season] at this point. But when these things come up, it’s about going through suppliers to jump on it quickly.” Manufacturers said that the vast majority of supply was coming from Chinese factories, which already produce about two-thirds of the output for industry leaders such as Hasbro and Mattel. Chinese manufacturers that traditionally make smartphone accessories have also jumped on the trend. 7-11 said it sources the spinners from “several suppliers” but declined to comment on which countries they came from. Toys R Us said it ships them by air from China.  The buzz surrounding fidget spinners also highlights the newfound power of YouTube and Instagram over traditional corporate marketing schemes. “In our modern age, an internet meme can become a manufacturing meme,” says Mr Quint. “There’s no famous brand pushing this. This is for a generation that grew up on YouTube. The whole thing is sort of a mystery...it’s a real lesson for retailers and manufacturers.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Catherine Hettinger Matt Quint Columbia Business School Amazon Ewr Products Hasbro Instagram Mattel Mattell Npd Target Toys R Us WalMart YouTube Zing Read More Couche-Tard shifts global roles to Dublin Game on for sports retailers as Ashley arrives in town Boss of Greggs says breakfast deal a ‘compelling offer’ Weak sterling helps prop up Burberry profits UK retail sales beat expectations despite pick-up in inflation Paddy Power Betfair may look again in US after Draft acquisition Lavazza stirred, not shaken, by Starbucks challenge AIB to give cashback on some Visa card purchases Pret A Manger studying options for New York IPO this year Paddy Power buys US sports company for up to $48m  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy EU/ECB criticise Government use of windfall to raise public spending Work Older colleagues can offer emotional intelligence for your digital intelligence Pro12 Home comforts to help Munster clip Ospreys’ wings Manufacturing Accounts show Vita Cortex group had net losses of €2.3m Sponsored Life through a lens: Samsung S8 brings photography to next level The Story of Home: A Kerry mountain retreat Truth serum: how serums won a place in our beauty regimes The Story of Home: A dream of tiny houses Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

(KTRK) AP Friday, May 19, 2017 05:46AM WADENA, Minnesota -- When you go shopping at Walmart, you don't expect to see a wandering deer. A confused white-tailed deer that wandered into a Walmart store in Minnesota ran into a startled customer who tackled the animal to the ground. Shoppers at the store in Wadena, 150 miles northwest of Minneapolis, speculated that the young animal was searching for a snack Tuesday when it entered the store through the garden center doors. Tom Grasswick, who happens to live in Deer Creek, told WDAY-TV that he felt like someone had slugged him when the deer slammed into him. Grasswick says his first instinct was to tackle the animal, bringing it down on a pallet of dog food. Grasswick covered the deer's eyes to calm it down, and he and others took the animal outside and set it free.

just-style home News & insights News US Q1 in brief – Foot Locker, Cato Corp, The Buckle By Michelle Russell and Beth Wright | 19 May 2017 Font size Email Print In the most recent first-quarter filings from US apparel and footwear brands and retailers, Walmart delivered an encouraging start to the year thanks to higher sales, while Ross Stores booked growth despite market volatility. Kate Spade, meanwhile, saw earnings slump on the back of sales declines, while Hudson's Bay recorded comparable store declines on the back of lower domestic store traffic across all banners.  Foot Locker US footwear retailer Foot Locker said its first-quarter was one of the company's most profitable in its history, despite a slip in net income and falling short of its original expectations. For the period ended 29 April, net income was US$180m, compared to $191m in the year-ago period. Total sales meanwhile, increased 0.7% to $2bn, compared with sales of $1.99bn for the corresponding prior-year period. Comparable-store sales were up 0.5%, while gross margin decreased to 34% from 35% a year ago. CEO Richard Johnson said: "The slow start we experienced in February, which we believe was largely due to the delay in income tax refunds, was unfortunately not fully offset by much stronger sales in March and April. Nonetheless, we believe our banners remain at the centre of a vibrant sneaker culture. We are confident that our customers have not lost their tremendous appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and that our position in the industry is stronger than ever." Cato Corp Cato Corp reported a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping 38% to US$22.2m from $35.9m last year. First-quarter gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 38.7%, primarily due to lower merchandise margins and deleveraging of buying and occupancy costs. Meanwhile, total sales fell to $239.7m, compared to $288m in the year-ago period. Same-store sales were also down, slipping 17%. CEO John Cato said: ""Our negative sales trend persisted throughout the first quarter, impacting margins and earnings as we continued to work through our merchandise missteps," stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "It is taking longer to work through these issues than expected and the remainder of the year will be impacted. We expect earnings for the year to be below last year." The Buckle The Buckle booked a drop in both earnings and sales in the first quarter, with the former dropping to US$16.3m from $23.1m a year earlier. Revenues were down 12.8% to $212.3m from net sales of $243.5m for the year-ago period, while comparable sales fell 12.7%. Online sales were down 7.2% to $21.8m for the 13-week period ended 29 April. The Buckle also announced senior vice president of finance and CFO, Karen Rhoads,who joined the company in 1980, will retire later this summer. Rhoads will continue to serve as a member of the company's board of directors. The board has engaged an executive search firm to assist with the search for Rhoads' replacement. The Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores widened its net loss to US$57.3m in the first quarter, compared to $37.8m in the year-ago period. The York, Pennsylvania-based company saw total sales fall by 9.3% to $536.1m from $591m in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales decreased 8.8% as compared with the prior year period. Meanwhile, gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 32.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate and increased delivery expenses. CEO Kathryn Bufano said: "Our first quarter results did not meet our expectations due primarily to weak mall traffic trends, unfavourable weather and marketing challenges associated with the Easter calendar shift." Ross Stores Ross Stores booker higher sales and earnings in its first-quarter despite uncertainty and volatility in the market. Earnings reached US$321m from $291m a year earlier. Total sales were up 7% to $3.3bn, while comparable store sales grew 3%. Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded company expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. For the second quarter, the company is forecasting same store sales to be up 1% to 2%, on top of a 4% gain last year, with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76, up from $0.71 in the prior year period. Stage Stores Stage Stores widened its net loss to US$19m from $15.5m in the first quarter as the company incurred after-tax charges primarily associated with the Gordmans acquisition of about $4m. Net sales were also down, falling 7.3% to $308.6m, compared to $332.8m in the prior year. Meanwhile, comparable sales decreased 9.6%. CEO Michael Glazer, noted: "After a challenging February in which we saw negative double digit comps, we began to gain momentum and our business improved significantly during the combined March and April period. While we expect retail headwinds to continue in the near term, we believe that our selective acquisition of prime Gordmans' assets allows us to diversify with an off-price business model. We expect the acquisition to add scale to our business and be meaningfully accretive to our earnings in 2018." Perry Ellis Perry Ellis said it was pleased with a "solid start" to fiscal 2018, with top and bottom line results surpassing guidance, reflecting solid growth in its core brands driven by the earlier shipment of Spring merchandise and strong gross margin expansion. For the three month period, as reported under GAAP, net income was US$12.8m, compared to GAAP net income of $14.3m last year. GAAP Gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 37.6%, while adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points. Meanwhile, total sales dropped 7.3% to $242m from $261m last year, but ahead of guidance of $230mto $235 million. The company said the decline reflected a planned decrease in shipments given a reduction of customers' doors and inventory discipline to drive higher margin sales. Walmart Walmart has delivered what analysts say is an encouraging start to the year as sales grew 1.4% in the quarter to US$117.5bn. Excluding currency, sales were up 2.5% to $118.8bn. In its domestic market revenues were up 2.9% to $75.4bn, while international sales climbed 3.5% to $27.1bn. Net earnings, meanwhile, were down 1.3% in the period to $3.04bn. "We delivered a solid first-quarter and we're encouraged by the start to the year. We're moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers," said CEO Doug McMillon. The Children's Place The Children's Place has booked what it says are "outstanding" operating results in the quarter with comparable sales, operating margin and earnings significantly above last year and the high end of its guidance. Net sales increased 4.1% to US$436.7m on the back of a comparable retail sales increased of 6.1%. Operating margin improved 170 basis points to 11.1%, while net income reached $36.2m from $26m a year earlier. American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters booked a mixed first-quarter as earnings slipped but sales increased. For the period ended 29 April, net income fell to US$25.2m from $40.5m last year. Gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 36.5% from 39.2% last year, primarily due to increased promotional activity and higher shipping costs related to a strong digital business. Meanwhile, total net revenue was up 2% to $761.8m, compared to $749.4m in the year-ago period. Consolidated comparable sales were also up 2%, following a 6% increase last year. CEO Jay Schottenstein said: "The first quarter results reflected mall traffic headwinds, especially early in the quarter, with improved trends over Easter and a strong digital business throughout. As we look ahead, we are taking the right steps to improve our results and adjust our business for today's rapidly evolving retail environment." L Brands  L Brands booked a fall in both sales and earnings for the first quarter, with net income slipping to US$94.1m from $152.3m last year. For the three months ended 29 April, net sales fell 7% to $2.44bn compared to $2.61bn in the year-ago period. Comparable sales were also down, falling 9%. L Brands noted the exit of the swim and apparel categories had a negative impact of 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points to total company and Victoria's Secret comparable sales, respectively. Looking ahead, the company increased its guidance for 2017 full-year earnings per share to $3.10 to $3.40 from $3.05 to $3.35 previously, and issued guidance for second quarter earnings per share between $0.40 and $0.45. Target Corp US retail group Target said its first-quarter financial performance was "better" than its expectations, as net earnings rose 7.7% to US$681m from $632m in the year-ago period. For the three months ended 29 April, sales slipped 1.1% to $16.0bn compared to $16.2bn last year, reflecting a comparable sales decline of 1.3%, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. Digital channel sales however increased, up by 22% and contributing 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Gross margin narrowed to 30.5%, compared with 30.9% in the year-ago period, reflecting increased digital channel fulfilment costs.  CEO Brian Cornell, said: "We are in the early stage of a multi-year effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity." Urban Outfitters Teen retailer Urban Outfitters saw net income slip 59.8% in the first quarter, falling to US$11.9m from $29.6m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also down in the period, falling 0.2% to $761.2m compared to $762.6m last year. Total comparable retail segment net sales decreased 3.1%. By brand, comparable sales increased 1.5% at Free People, but decreased 3.1% at Urban Outfitters and 4.4% at the Anthropologie Group. The company said comparable sales were driven by strong, double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, but were offset by negative retail store comparable net sales. CEO Richard Hayne, said: "During the first quarter we continued to see strong double-digit growth from our direct-to-consumer channel and our wholesale business. We believe we have significant opportunity to continue to grow both of these channels at all of our brands." Dick's Sporting Goods Omni-channel sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods said that despite a challenging retail environment, it realised growth across each of its three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear in the first quarter. For the period ended 29 April, net income reached US$58.2m compared to $56.9m in the year-ago period. Net sales were also up, increasing 9.9% to $1.8bn from $1.7bn last year. Looking ahead, CEO Edward Stack said the company will continue to "evaluate and adjust" its business model, and is taking actions to reduce its expense structure in order to fund and develop its longer-term strategic initiatives. TJX Companies TJX Companies said it has  great confidence in the continued, successful growth of the company after booking increases in both sales and earnings in the first quarter. For the period ended 29 January, net income reached US$536.3m, compared to $508.3m in the year-ago period. Gross profit margin was 29.0%, up 0.2 percentage points versus the prior year.

Differential Brands Group Differential Brands Group, which owns Robert Graham and Hudson Clothing, narrowed its net loss in the first quarter. For the period ended 31 March, net loss was US$2.4m, compared to $6.5m for the prior year period. Net sales meanwhile, were up 19% to $40.1m from $33.7m in the prior year period, reflecting a 22% increase in wholesale segment sales and a 9% increase in consumer direct segment sales. The company added the sales increase was primarily due to sales from the addition of the Hudson Jeans and Swims brands for the full period. Gross margin fell to 46.4% compared to 48.5%last year, reflecting the inclusion of Hudson Jeans for the full quarter as well as the inclusion of Swims, which carry lower gross margin rates as primarily wholesale businesses. CEO Michael Buckley said the company is "pleased" with the progress it has made during the quarter, especially in its e-commerce business, which saw a 46% sales increase. Dillard's Dillard's has booked a drop in earnings and sales in its first-quarter, with net income falling to US$66.3m from $77.4m in the year-ago period. Net sales dropped to $1.42bn from $1.50bn a year earlier, while gross margin from retail operations improved 65 basis points. CEO William Dillard said that while the company's sales decline weighed heavily onits operating results, it still ended the quarter with $302m of cash, largely due to better cash management.

Sales totalled $5.34bn, a drop of 7.5% on sales of $5.77bn in the same period last year, reflecting, in part, store closures. Comparable sales on an owned basis were down 5.2%.

Wolverine Worldwide Wolverine Worldwide booked what it says was a solid start to the year with earnings and sales that beat expectations and strong progress towards its strategic transformation plan. Revenues dropped 4.8% to US$591.3m due to an additional week of operations in the first quarter of 2017. Underlying revenue declined 2%.

Acting CEO Bruce Smith, said: "We are pleased to report that our improved merchandising strategies are driving better performance, as demonstrated by the increase in our first quarter comparable store sales. After a very slow start to the quarter due to the later disbursement of tax refunds by the Internal Revenue Service, we were able to more than make up February's 21% comparable store sales decline with increases of 13% in March and 18% in April." Weyco Weyco saw both sales and earnings slip in its first-quarter in the face of what it called a "challenging" retail environment. For the three months to 31 March, net earnings attributable to the company fell 17% to US$2.2m from $2.7m in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, net sales for the quarter slipped to $69.1m, down 12% from $78.9m last year. CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr said: "The retail environment continues to be challenging, as retailers address reduced foot traffic in their brick and mortar stores. We continue to seek growth across all trade channels and are working to reduce our costs.  This quarter we saw higher gross margins and reductions in several categories of selling and administrative costs as a result of our efforts."    Hanesbrands US fashion retailer Hanesbrands said it is off to the strong start of 2017 that it sought, despite net income slipping 12% to US$70.6m from $80.3m in the year-ago period. Net sales meanwhile, increased 13.2% to $1.38bn from $1.22bn last year, thanks to acquisition contributions.

Hanesbrands has initiated an internal and external search for his successor.  VF Corp US apparel giant VF Corporation said its first-quarter results were "right in line" with expectations, despite a 2% fall in both sales and earnings for the period. Net income fell to US$209.2m in the three months to March, from $260.3m the year before. As a result of the sale of its licensed sports group business to Fanatics, VF's net loss from discontinued operations was $5.5m the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 50.2% on a reported basis, while total revenues fell to $2.55bn from $2.60bn in the year-ago period.

Net income also reached record levels, up 13% to $36m from $31.8m in the year ago period. For the year ahead, the company expects net sales growth of around 3%, and net income of between $192m and $199m. CEO Tim Boyle said: "Our first quarter results provide a good start to a year that presents many challenges, especially in the US, which has been impacted by customer bankruptcies, liquidations and ongoing efforts by US.retailers to rationalise their store fleets and square footage. We were encouraged by the Columbia brand's continued growth in Europe-direct markets during the first quarter and by the Sorel brand's successful launch of an expanded Spring assortment. In addition, our direct-to-consumer businesses were a source of growth in every region. "In the midst of changing consumer shopping patterns, our portfolio of powerful brands and strong balance sheet give us the ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth." Amazon Online retail giant Amazon has booked increases in both sales and earnings in its first-quarter thanks to new product and service launches globally, including seven private apparel brands to Prime members. Net income reached US$724m from $513m a year prior. Net sales were up 23% to $35.7bn. Excluding a $492m unfavourable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 24%. Under Armour Under Armour's share price has spiked after the athletic wear maker posted a first-quarter loss that was better than analyst expectations and reaffirmed its full-year outlook. The loss for the three months to the end of March amounted to US$2.3m from earnings of $19.2m a year ago. Gross margin dropped 70 basis points to 45.2%. Net sales, however, grew 7% to $1.1bn. "Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we're off to a solid start in 2017," said Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank. "By proactively managing our growth to deliver superior innovative product, continuing to strengthen our connection with consumers and increasing our focus on operational excellence - we have great confidence in our ability to drive toward our full year targets." Carter's Carter's booked a mixed first-quarter, with a slight rise in sales but a 13.6% decrease in net income from US$54m to $46.7m. Operating margin also decreased, falling 210 basis points to 10.7%. Net sales, meanwhile, grew 1.2% to $732.8m, reflecting growth in the company's domestic retail and wholesale sales, which was partially offset by a decline in International sales. CEO Michael Casey, said: "We achieved our sales and earnings objectives in the first quarter. Stronger than planned demand in our wholesale and ecommerce businesses helped to offset the effects of delayed tax refunds to families with young children and a later Easter holiday. "We have seen a meaningful improvement in sales trends in April, driven by Easter holiday shopping, and expect good growth in sales and earnings in the balance of the year."  Steve Madden US footwear and accessories specialist Steve Madden said it pleased to have started off 2017 with a strong first-quarter, despite delivering a 15.6% drop in earnings. For the three months ended 31 March, net income fell to US$20.2m from $23.7m last year. However, the company said its highlight of the quarter was its Steve Madden women's wholesale footwear division, which enjoyed a period of "outstanding growth in a challenging retail environment". Net sales increased 11.2% to $366.4m, compared to $329.4m in the year-ago period. Gross margin widened to 36.2%, compared to 35.3% last year. CEO Edward Rosenfeld said the company will take a prudent approach to planning its business in light of retail industry headwinds, but added the strength in its core business "gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to navigate the uncertain environment".  Skechers Despite first-quarter net sales representing a new quarterly record and the first time the company has exceeded US$1bn in quarterly sales, footwear maker Skechers saw earnings slip in the three months ended 31 March. Sales in the quarter were up 9.6% to $1.07bn on last year, primarily due to a 16.8% increase in the company's international wholesale business and a 12.8% rise in its company-owned global retail business which included comparable same-store sales increases of 2.9%. However, earnings slipped 3.7% to $94m, compared to $97.6m in the year-ago period. CEO David Weinberg said: "We are particularly proud of the growth in the quarter considering the tough comparison to 2016, which included the benefit of an additional day in February and Easter falling in March." Rocky Brands Rocky Brands says it has made a "solid start" to 2017 as it moved to a profit thanks to doubling its military segment sales to a quarterly record US$12m. Net income in the three months ended 31 March amounted to $1.5m from a loss of $0.2m a year earlier. Net sales meanwhile, increased 9.6% to $63.1m, compared to $57.5m in the year-ago period. Wholesale sales declined 2.5% to $39.2m, while retail sales edged up to $11.9m from $11.5m. Gross margin dropped 160 basis points to 31.3%, driven by the increase in military segment sales which carry lower gross margins than its wholesale and retail segments. CEO Mike Brooks said: "The actions we have taken over the past six months to better position the company for profitable growth are clearly gaining traction. While there is still work ahead of us in order to maximise shareholder value over the long-term, we are confident we are heading in the right direction." Kate Spade & Co Kate Spade saw earnings slump to US$1.4m in the three months ended 1 April, from $11.6m a year earlier. The company incurred a $7m of pre-tax store impairment charge and $2m of pre-tax fees and expenses related to its strategic review. Gross margin widened to 63.2% from 61.8%, but net sales dropped 1.2% to $271m. Same-store sales fell 2.4% for the quarter, and were down 8.1% excluding e-commerce.  Direct-to-consumer comparable sales fell 2%. Levi Strauss & Co Jeans giant Levi Strauss & Co saw net sales increase in the first quarter, up 4% to US$1.10bn from $1.06bn in the year-ago period. In the three months ended 26 February, net income slipped to $60m, down 9% from $66m last year. The decline primarily reflected lower gross margins, the San Francisco-based company said. Gross margin narrowed to 51.2% from 53%. In Europe, net revenues were up 12%, while in the Americas sales dropped by 1% and Asia net revenues declined 2%. "Despite the on-going challenges in the industry, I am pleased that we delivered 5% currency-neutral growth over a strong Q1 last year," said Chip Bergh, president and CEO. "We were able to deliver these solid results despite a declining US wholesale business, because of the breadth of our portfolio. Specifically, we grew in all three regions, with particularly outstanding results in Europe; double digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business; and double digit growth on women's and tops."

The company reported net earnings of $1.43 billion, during its fiscal fourth quarter, while revenues came in at $5.61 billion, beating Wall Street expectations of $5.2 billion. On the annual basis, the Chinese e-commerce giant posted a sharp increase in revenues and another jump in net income during the fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues from cloud computing and digital media and entertainment jumped 103% and 234% to $314 million and $571 million, respectively. However, earning per shares missed market expectations of $0.68. Its share prices traded in the red. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported its diluted earnings per share at $1 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, thus beating estimates. The company's US net sales in the first three months of fiscal 2018 rose and stood at $75.44 billion, while Walmart International net sales declined to $27.1 billion. E-commerce sales at Wal-Mart US surged 63% in the first quarter. The company aims to combine its digital and physical assets to make shopping simple and easy for customers. Wal-Mart shares traded in the green area following the positive result. Technology The manufacturer of electronic equipment Sharp Corp. revealed it would back the technology investment vehicle of online business powerhouse SoftBank Group Corp. It opted to contribute a maximum of 1% of the projected $100 billion over five years. Sharp was taken over last year for $3.8 billion by the Taiwanese company, better known as Foxconn Technology Group. Japan's Softbank Vision Fund has received dominant support from Saudi Arabia. The company has set a new direction to expand its businesses aggressively forward and transform itself into one of the world’s top IoT (Internet of Things) companies. The fund aims to invest in IoT and other leading-edge technologies and Sharp expects the fund will forge new business sectors. Automotive Industry General Motors Company will be pulling its Chevrolet vehicles out of India by the end of the year but will continue its production of cars for export in the country. The GM factory in Talegaon in India will continue operating and cars manufactured there will sell in Mexico and South America. The carmaker also stated it in its agreement with Isuzu Motors to sell its South African operations and phase out the Chevrolet brand in the African country. The company also reiterated to work with the PSA Group to "evaluate the future opportunity for the Opel brand" in South Africa. However, General Motors will continue to offer support for existing Chevrolet customers in both countries, as well as Opel customers in South Africa.

Other brick and mortar retailers can only hope to achieve similar success if they commit to changing with the times, one analyst said Friday. "When you talk to brick and mortar retailers, they're really very much stuck in what they used to do. So there isn't much technology being used in the retail scenario," Kenny Yeo, senior industry analyst at Frost & Sullivan, told CNBC's "The Rundown" on Friday. "Having a census and data would enable the brick and mortar retailers to understand the customer better so they can give better customer service," he added. He said, however, that the only pieces of data retailers really have are from the point of sales system, as well as counters where people are walking in and out of the store. Where the data is lacking, he explained, is where customers go once they enter a store. "So frankly, I see that the strategy Wal-Mart is taking is really something that consumers want," he said. Getty Images Customers shop at a Walmart store on January 17, 2017 in Skokie, Illinois. The changing face of retail is mainly due to the rise of e-commerce, and although Wal-Mart's physical stores generated most of its sales, its digital sales increased by 63 percent from the previous year. So as the retail industry veers further towards e-commerce, retailers need to adapt to meet new customer demands. "Today's consumer is really different. When we go to a store, the first thing we do is pop out a phone and check what competitors are charging for the same item," Yeo said. "Habits are changing so much so that you use both online and offline (avenues) at the same time," he added. "Wal-Mart has an interesting strategy where it's embracing both. That's very interesting and is the way forward," he said. According to Yeo, there are three key technological drivers — automation, awareness and immersion — that traditional retailers should focus on. Firstly, automation helps with basic standard tasks, such as stock-taking, which allows for more time for staff to interact with consumers. Awareness allows retailers to use technology such as online trackers to detect both the physical interaction of customers in stores as well as shopping habits on websites. This allows them to understand the consumer's buying behavior. Lastly, immersion gives retailers the power to influence customers' buying habits in store and online by using previously collected information from tracking services. This can happen through the use of apps, location services and even augmented reality. "They know what we're looking at and what we're clicking on, so that they are able to amend and change the page to optimize the experience," he said. The incorporation of technology into bricks and mortar would create a better retail experience for the customer, and "so that in the end, is what the customer wants- better customer service from both digital and in the store itself," Yeo said.

The Street1:09 Sesame Street and SeaWorld plan more joint parks Wochit Business0:32 UP NEXT For so long, it seemed like no company could rival e-commerce colossus Amazon (AMZN), but Jim Cramer thinks one up-and-coming online competitor could give it a run for its money: Wal-Mart (WMT). Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 78.77 +1.23 +1.59% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 959.84 +1.35 +0.14% "You might think this comparison sounds crazy, even after the excellent quarter Wal-Mart just reported [on Thursday], but when you take a step back, it's pretty clear that these two companies have a lot more in common than you might expect," the "Mad Money" host said. Before the rise of Amazon, Wal-Mart's scale and massive array of merchandise shuttered countless smaller stores because they could not compete. "Wal-Mart was the great destroyer of retail, the great disruptor, laying waste to mom and pop stores all over the country by offering more products and undercutting them on price," Cramer explained. Amazon employs a similar strategy, using its scale to sell items online at their lowest available prices. Most retailers cannot compete, but Wal-Mart's breadth and ability to negotiate with its suppliers enable it to keep pace with Amazon's prices. Read more from CNBC's Jim Cramer Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon also set a goal for the company to become a major player in online retail, gaining approval from the Walton family, which owns just over half of the business. With a good balance sheet, the company can afford to spend the money to challenge Amazon, but Cramer said the family's approval was key for moving the process forward. "As long as he's got the backing of the family, he can afford to take some short-term hits in order to grow the company's e-commerce presence. That's a real rarity in this game," Cramer said. "At most publicly traded companies, the shareholders tend to rebel when management starts promising near-term pain. And you better believe that declaring war on Amazon is painful." While Wal-Mart may not unseat Amazon as the top dog in e-commerce, the "Mad Money" host does believe it could become a serious competitor, with its online sales business up 63 percent in the latest quarter. On Wal-Mart's earnings conference call, the company touted its offering of 50 million products, up from 35 million last quarter and 10 million just one year ago. Wal-Mart's come-up in the online space started when the retailer announced plans to restructure in early 2015. The first step was closing 269 underperforming stores. Then, later in the year, McMillon announced a big boost in e-commerce spending — $900 million in 2015 and $1.1 billion for the following year. In response, the stock got pummeled, dropping from the mid-$80s to the mid-$50s, but with the backing of the Walton family, McMillon had permission to continue his agenda. In the summer of 2016, Wal-Mart acquired one of the world's fastest growing online retailers, Jet.com, for $3.3 billion. "The idea behind Jet is that they can offer customers tremendous bargains by giving you extra discounts if you order merchandise from the same distribution centers. Plus, the deal gave Wal-Mart access to a new cohort of wealthy, young, urban shoppers who might not otherwise be Wal-Mart shoppers," Cramer said.© Provided by CNBC After a number of smaller acquisitions that expanded Wal-Mart's online offerings, the company announced in March 2017 it would start its own incubator to invest in ideas and technologies that would change the future of retail, a new venture for the once-traditional company. Finally, there's one area where Wal-Mart does have a leg up over Amazon: fresh food. Ordering most things online is easy, but delivering perishables is more complicated. "Wal-Mart's grocery business is going strong, and once they get you in the door to buy that food, you might make impulse purchases — or if you know you're going there, you can order stuff online, then pick it up in the store [to] save on shipping," Cramer said. "Fresh food is Amazon's Achilles heel, people." At the end of the day, Amazon is still the reigning king of e-commerce, but with 69 percent growth in online gross merchandise volume, Wal-Mart is easily second-best. "Can Wal-Mart beat Amazon? Doubtful. But who says they need to? They just need to go toe-to-toe with Amazon and make money doing it, wipe out everybody else in bricks-and-mortar, and that's entirely likely from what I've seen from this amazing quarter," the "Mad Money" host said. The stocks are completely different animals, however. Amazon's powerful technology and web services arm puts its stock, which trades at 85 times next year's earnings estimates, in a class above the rest. Wal-Mart's stock, a more old-school brick-and-mortar name, sells at only 17 times next year's earnings. "Here's the bottom line: if you like owning high-flying fast growing tech stocks, Amazon's great. OK? It's for you. However, if you want more of a value play, I think Wal-Mart has done an incredible job of expanding online. They're not going to take the lead in e-commerce anytime soon, but for the first time in ages, this business is actually a two-horse race," Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

In a classroom inside the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Shawnee, facilitator Nichole Umscheid, standing left, talks with students in her Wal-Mart Academy class. (Keith Myers / The Kansas City Star) Sarah HalzackWashington Post Privacy Policy Wal-Mart has recently put its foot on the gas in its bid to catch up to Amazon.com in the e-commerce world, most notably by acquiring a collection of smaller shopping sites and rolling out splashy offers such as free two-day shipping on many purchases. Now there are signs that it is paying off: Wal-Mart on Thursday reported a robust 63 percent surge in online sales in the most recent quarter. Importantly, the company said that the majority of the increase came from sales growth at Walmart.com, suggesting fresh momentum at its flagship digital business. "The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success," said Doug McMillion, Wal-Mart's chief executive, in remarks to investors. To be sure, online shopping still comprises only a tiny slice of Wal-Mart's business, and it remains to be seen whether this strong growth is sustainable. But it is an encouraging sign for a company that has spent billions of dollars to trying to step up its game in this arena. Marc Lore, the head of the retailer's online business, said that a key driver of the growth was its move to offer free two-day shipping on millions of items without a membership fee. That model was meant to offer Amazon Prime-like speed without having to pay a membership fee. Wal-Mart said it also helped that it has expanded its assortment online to 50 million items, a five-fold increase from this time last year. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) The company has been trying several new tactics to lure more online shoppers, including offering a discount on certain e-commerce purchases if shoppers pick them at a store instead of having them delivered to their homes. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart's broader U.S. business looked healthy in the quarter. The company reported an increase of 1.4 percent in comparable sales, a measure of its sales online and at stores open more than a year. That marked its eleventh consecutive quarter of growth on this measure. That consistent run of growth stands in contrast to what has been seen lately in the wider retail industry. Target recently reported its fourth consecutive quarter of declining comparable sales. Department stores such as Macy's, J.C. Penney and Kohl's saw their sales slide in the latest quarter. Things are looking grim at several specialty apparel retailers: Ralph Lauren said Thursday that it recorded a 16 percent plunge in quarterly sales. Ascena Retail Group, the parent company of Ann Taylor, Loft and other clothing chains, saw its stock nosedive some 38 percent on Thursday after it lowered its forecasts for the year, citing "unprecedented secular change" in its category of retailing. "Given the current retail landscape, with many retailers experiencing challenges across multiple categories, we believe Wal-Mart will continue to turn up the competitive heat by utilizing its scale and technological advantages to extract increased market share," said Charlie O'Shea, a retail analyst at Moody's, in a research note.

Three people lost their lives when a driver crashed into the retail store. Now the mother of one of the victims is suing Walmart. A man allegedly began choking on coffee as he was driving his pickup truck toward the super-center, and lost consciousness as he drove through the entrance of the store. "my youngest daughter came home. I was babysitting for my grandkids, and she came home and told me that Lindsey was one of the first ones that he had hit," said Kohrs. 29 year-old Lindsey Rietveld worked at the store; her mother still can't believe she's gone. "I can`t believe it. I still wake up thinking I can give her a call, or a text message," said Kohrs. Kohrs is suing Walmart claiming it failed to protect its employees, patrons, and other visitors. "I want justice for Lindsey. I want the parking lots changed; not just at the Walmart in Pella, but everywhere." The lawsuit claims Walmart was negligent when it failed to erect adequate security devices or bollards. "And these were what`s called decorative bollards, which means they weren`t really designed to stop anything," said attorney Jeff Lipman of the Lipman Law Firm in West Des Moines. "They were breakable. They were made of material that was not protective in nature," said Lipman. The suit states "to protect people and property, standard practices for such retail entrances is to erect security bollards at intervals no more than 5 feet apart, such that any vehicle driving toward the entrance will impact more than one bollard and thus increase the crash resistance of the installation."

PELLA, Iowa  —  The family of one of the victims of a fatal crash last December at Wal-Mart in Pella is now suing the store, its builder and the driver who crashed through the front door. On December 1st, 2016 Dennis Mockenhaupt crashed his truck into the store, killing Wal-Mart employees Lindsey Rietveld and Carrie Zugg and customer Ruth Jean DeJong.  Prosecutors ruled that Mockenhaupt suffered a medical incident that caused him to crash into the store.  He was not criminally charged. However a lawsuit filed Thursday by the estate of Lindsey Rietveld accuses Mockenhaupt of driving recklessly.  According to the lawsuit Mockenhaupt says he was choking on coffee, causing him to lose consciousness. The lawsuit also places blame for the crash on Wal-Mart and the architect who designed and built the building.  The lawsuit claims the building did not include enough protective bollards in front of the store and the bollards that were in place were not effective. The lawsuit asks for unspecified damages to compensate the Rietveld family for its loss and to punish Mockenhaupt and Wal-Mart for their alleged roles in Rietveld’s death. Wal-Mart responded to the lawsuit on Thursday with this statement: “We continue offering our prayers to the victims’ families. The safety of our customers and associates is among our top priorities, and we have consultants and engineers who designed this parking lot in accordance with local laws and regulations. While we have not yet been served with this lawsuit, we take this matter seriously and will respond appropriately with the court.” Read the full lawsuit here.   Filed in: News Topics: Pella Wal-Mart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Google Email Reddit Tumblr Popular Severe Storms Are Moving Through Central Iowa Parents Arrested in Connection with Perry Teen’s Death Channel 13’s May Apple A Day Giveaway Latest News Severe Storms Are Moving Through Central Iowa Family Reunited With Cat Found 1,500 Miles Away Perry Community Gathers to Mourn Loss of Teen State Track: Day 2, More winners in the Cold and Rain Guitar Shop Owner Recounts Strange Encounter with Scott Greene News No Charges Filed in Deadly Pella Walmart Crash News Mother of Crash Victim Sues Walmart News DCI Completes Pella Walmart Crash Investigation News Police Looking for Driver Who Left Scene of Thursday Night I-235 Crash News Witnesses Describe Johnson County Plane Crash, Victims Identified News One Person Killed in Friday Evening Mahaska County Crash News Bar Facing Lawsuits Following Wrong-Way Crash that Killed Officers News Pella Student Suffers Minor Injuries After Being Hit by Car Politics Legislation Proposed in Honor of ISU Student Killed in Cyride Crash News Fallen Firefighter Honored After Fatal Car Crash News DUI Suspect Accused of Hitting Family Returning from Disneyland had Been Deported 15 Times News Car Crashes Into High School Marching Band During Alabama Mardi Gras Parade News Bartenders Would Not Have Known Customer was Drunk, Says Lawyer of Bar Facing Lawsuit in Head-On Crash Mobile Apps 13Now News App for iPhone & iPad 13Now News App for Android 13WarnMe Weather App for iPhone & iPad 13WarnMe Weather App for Android Facebook Twitter Instagram About & Contact screenertv Screener Untitled-2Covers Online Public File • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • 1801 Grand Ave. Des Moines, IA 50309 • Copyright © 2017, WHO • A Tribune Broadcasting Station • Powered by WordPress.com VIP × Email Alerts Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Brazil’s Ibovespa Index plunged 8.5 percent in mid-afternoon trading. “Markets will overreact, but the reality is that Brazil is rooting out the corruption that has plagued it for centuries,”James Gulbrandsen, a Rio de Janeiro-based portfolio manager at NCH Capital who holds Brazilian shares, told Bloomberg. “This significantly increases the likelihood of new elections within the coming months.” Meanwhile, Wall Street rebounded, following Wednesday’s declines amid reports that prompted concern US President Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice. In 3.14pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.8 percent. In 2.59pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.6 percent. “This whole bull market is all about panic attacks followed by relief rallies, and this was another one,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research Inc in Brookville, New York, told Bloomberg. “My hunch is that the Trump impeachment panic attack was a one-day wonder and we’ll move on from there.” The Dow rose, led by gains in shares of Wal-Mart Stores and those of Verizon, up 3.1 percent and 2.4 percent respectively. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores climbed after the world’s top retailer posted quarterly results that showed better-than-expected sales both in stores and online. "Wal-Mart's commitment to value pricing is driving traffic and growth in grocery and aggressive online strides are impacting comparable sales," Cowen & Co's senior research analyst Oliver Chen said in a note, Reuters reported. Walmart said US comparable sales rose 1.4 percent in the quarter ended April 28, driven by a traffic increase of 1.5 percent. Its US online sales increased 63 percent in the first quarter, while gross merchandise volume climbed 69 percent, Wal-Mart said, adding that he majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com. “All of a sudden, Wal-Mart is the primary competitor to Amazon, as opposed to a fragmented cluster of people,” Greg Portell, a partner at consulting firm AT Kearney, told Bloomberg. Bucking the trend were shares of Cisco, which plunged 7.8 percent for the largest percentage drop in the Dow. Cisco announced further job cuts and offered an earnings outlook that fell short of expectations. “We saw a significant slowdown in the US public sector, particularly the federal business—which is a pretty significant business for us—due to the uncertainty in budgets," CEO Chuck Robbins told CNBC. In Europe the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a slide of 0.5 percent from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index fell 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index declined 0.5 percent, and the UK’s FTSE 100 Index dropped 0.9 percent.

By Rachel Abrams New York Times  May 18, 2017 Walmart reported a staggering rise in online sales in the first quarter Thursday. But now the question is whether the country’s largest retailer can sustain that growth to become a true competitor to the online juggernaut Amazon. The company said e-commerce sales in the United States had grown 63 percent. That helped lift overall sales 1.4 percent to $117.5 billion. Advertisement The numbers are a sign that Walmart is making headway in its fight to be as dominant online as it is across the American landscape. Walmart’s strategy has several parts: expand the number of products available online; better leverage its huge physical warehouses and distribution centers to reach customers quickly across the country; and aggressively pursue deals for online stores. The company announced the acquisition of bulk e-commerce retailer Jet.com in August, part of a plan to offer customers more products through the Web. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The earnings results gave only hints of about how much the bump in sales is from the acquisitions of the last year, compared with the other changes the company has made. Walmart executives said the “majority” of the company’s online growth was organic — meaning not from the companies it had bought — but did not break out specific numbers. And while they were hesitant to declare that such growth was the new normal, they credited an expanded online assortment for helping to lure more repeat customers willing to open their wallets a little wider. “This is extraordinary growth, and we’re pleased with the traction we’re generating across our e-commerce offerings,” said Brett Biggs, Walmart’s executive vice president and chief financial officer. Advertisement Comparable-store sales, one measure of growth that looks at stores that have been open for at least a year, rose 1.4 percent. That number includes Walmart’s core online business but not items sold through Jet. Walmart completed its purchase of Jet for $3.3 billion in September. Smaller digital acquisitions followed, including ModCloth, a women’s clothing retailer, and the outdoor apparel site Moosejaw. The deal for Jet was also widely seen as a play for its founder, Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur who could help fix Walmart’s online strategy. Lore was put in charge of running Walmart.com after the acquisition, spearheading the faceoff between the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer and its biggest online competitor. Walmart said it now offers 50 million items through its website, up from 35 million in the last quarter and 10 million from the same time last year. There is no doubt, though, that the company still has a ways to go before coming close to Amazon in e-commerce. Activity on Amazon, which recorded about $136 billion in annual sales last year, accounts for more than half of all online shopping in the United States. Walmart provides a growth figure only for its online business and does not specify revenue. “I think it’s fair to say that Walmart is coming from behind online,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of the research firm GlobalData Retail. “It has underperformed in that area, so what we’re seeing now is really a catch-up to where it needs to be in order to more seriously compete with the likes of Amazon.” But Walmart is also trying to improve its physical stores. Bruised by complaints of empty shelves and poor customer service, Walmart pledged to invest in training its in-store associates and revamping its grocery business with services like allowing customers to buy items online and pick them up in a store. It has also cut back on labor costs. Customers at many stores can now make purchases through self-checkouts. The company has begun testing drones to handle inventory at its labyrinthine warehouses. In March, the company received a patent for a process in which drones would transport products between departments in stores. Shares of Walmart were up more than 3 percent Thursday.

(AP Photo/Alan Diaz) — NYBZ403 (Alan Diaz/AP) The unexpected leap in online sales offered the strongest evidence yet that Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer, is making headway in its effort to be as prominent online as it is across the U.S. landscape. Share story By Rachel Abrams The New York Times Wal-Mart has always excelled at selling products in its cavernous stores. It appears to be getting its head around selling online, too. On Thursday, the company said e-commerce sales had grown 63 percent in the United States in the latest quarter. The unexpected leap offered the strongest evidence yet that Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer, is making headway in its effort to be as prominent online as it is across the U.S. landscape. “This is extraordinary growth, and we’re pleased with the traction we’re generating across our e-commerce offerings,” said Brett Biggs, Wal-Mart’s executive vice president and chief financial officer. Now the question is whether the company can sustain that growth to become a fiercer competitor to the online juggernaut Amazon. Wal-Mart has invested heavily in building its online business over the years, but the results have been mixed — and Amazon has surged.

Wal-Mart’s latest strategy, put in place by its current chief executive, Doug McMillon, has several parts: expand the number of products available online, better leverage its huge physical warehouses and distribution centers to reach customers quickly across the country, and aggressively pursue deals for online stores. The biggest of those deals, in which Wal-Mart paid $3.3 billion for the bulk e-commerce retailer Jet.com last year, was part of the plan to offer customers more products through the web. The earnings results Thursday gave only hints of how much the acquisitions gave the company a one-time bump in sales, rather than long-lasting fruit from other changes the company has made. Overall sales rose 1.4 percent, to $117.5 billion, in the latest quarter compared with a year ago. Wal-Mart executives said the “majority” of the company’s online growth was organic — meaning not from the companies it had bought — but did not break out specific numbers. And while they were hesitant to declare that such growth was the new normal, they credited an expanded online assortment for helping to lure more repeat customers willing to open their wallets a little wider. Wal-Mart said it now offers 50 million items through its website, up from 35 million in the last quarter and 10 million from the same time last year. Comparable-store sales, one measure of growth that looks at stores that have been open for at least a year, rose 1.4 percent. That number includes Wal-Mart’s core online business, but not items sold through Jet.com. Wal-Mart completed its purchase of Jet in September. Smaller digital acquisitions followed, including ModCloth, a women’s clothing retailer, and the outdoor apparel site Moosejaw. The deal for Jet was also widely seen as a play for its founder, Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur who could help fix Wal-Mart’s online strategy. Lore was put in charge of running Walmart.com after the acquisition, organizing the faceoff between the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer and its biggest online competitor. There is no doubt, though, that the company still has a way to go before coming close to Amazon in e-commerce. Activity on Amazon, which recorded about $136 billion in annual sales last year, accounts for more than half of all online shopping in the United States. Wal-Mart provides a growth figure only for its online business, and does not specify revenue. “I think it’s fair to say that Wal-Mart is coming from behind online,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of the research firm GlobalData Retail. “It has underperformed in that area, so what we’re seeing now is really a catch-up to where it needs to be in order to more seriously compete with the likes of Amazon.” But Wal-Mart is also trying to improve its physical stores, and the results Thursday indicated that those changes were helping. While profit fell 1.3 percent for the quarter, the uptick in comparable-store sales bucked the troubles many other large retailers have signaled recently. Target, for example, on Wednesday reported a small drop in same-store sales in its most recent quarter compared to the year before. Bruised by complaints of empty shelves and poor customer service, Wal-Mart pledged to invest in training its in-store associates and revamping its grocery business with services like allowing customers to buy items online and pick them up in a store. It has also cut back on labor costs, relying more on automation. Customers at many stores can now make purchases through self-checkouts. The company has begun testing drones to handle inventory at its labyrinthine warehouses. In March, the company received a patent for a process in which drones would transport products between departments in stores. Shares of Wal-Mart stock rose $2.42, or 3.2 percent, to close Thursday at $77.54. Rachel Abrams View Comments No personal attacks or insults, no hate speech, no profanity.

The world’s largest retailer said Thursday that sales at established stores rose for the eleventh straight quarter, and customer traffic rose for the tenth quarter in a row. That’s a contrast with many rivals that saw both those figures drop. Online sales rose 63 percent, dramatically up from the 29 percent growth in the previous quarter. Though the company has been buying up smaller internet retailers, Wal-Mart said a majority of the increase was through Walmart.com and was fueled by changes in its shipping strategy and a discount for shoppers who pick up their online orders. “We’re transforming to become more of a digital enterprise,” said Doug McMillon, CEO and president of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Wal-Mart’s report stood out amid a largely gloomy environment for retailers, after chains such as Macy’s, Kohl’s, J.C. Penney and Target saw declines in comparable-store sales. Even off-price retailer TJX Cos., which has done better than many as customers hunt for bargains, missed forecasts for that sales measure. And it underscores Wal-Mart’s efforts to narrow the gap between itself and online leader Amazon, and widen the distance between itself and other competitors. Retails bankruptcies are setting a record pace this year, and store closures are expected to exceed those of 2008 after the financial crisis. Research firm RetailMetrics, which tracks results from more than a hundred chains, said overall they are expected to record a flat increase in revenue at established stores for the quarter, the worst performance since the third quarter of 2009. Excluding Wal-Mart’s results, there would be a 0.8 percent decline. “Wal-Mart is effectively competing in a tough retail environment, and given its size, scale, and leverage will be able to stay the course on the current strategy,” Stifel analyst Mark S. Astrachan wrote in a note. The Bentonville, Ark.-based company has retooled how it operates online, as customers get used to free shipping and other enticements that add costs and hurt the bottom line. It has also accelerated that shift with its acquisitions. Wal-Mart spent more than $3 billion for Jet.com last year in its bid to lure younger and more affluent customers. With Jet.com founder Marc Lore installed as head of Walmart.com, it bought ShoeBuy.com, outdoor gear seller Moosejaw and trendy clothing seller ModCloth. The clothing sites are operating as stand-alone operators, separate from Walmart.com, and appeal to younger shoppers. The company is still looking for startups to buy. Since Lore joined the company, the number of items available, including on its third-party online marketplace, has risen to more than 50 million. That’s up 10 million from a year ago. Shares rose 2.5 percent, or $1.88, to $77. 00 in afternoon trading Thursday.

Cellairis has stepped up to the challenge, offering fast, affordable repairs on iPhones, iPads and other mobile devices at their many locations across the country. They now have a store in Coventry, in the Walmart on New England Boulevard, giving local residents a convenient place for mobile device and computer repair. In the past, cell phones were often replaced instead of repaired. That has changed with the popularity of smartphones like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. According to a Pew Research Center study in 2015, smartphone use by adults has increased 35% since 2011. It is estimated that about two-thirds of adults with cell phones use a smartphone. Many use their smartphones for their only phone, making it vital to get it repaired or replaced when it is damaged. Since the cost of these phones is high, stores like Cellairis that offer iPhone repairs at an affordable price have become a necessity. Taki Skouras, the co-founder and CEO of Cellairis, is not surprised at how quickly the trend of repairing smartphones has increased over the past few years. He points out, “People want a reasonable option to repair instead of replace expensive phones like the iPhone. We can fix their iPhone or iPad in just a quick trip to our store, keeping them connected without the high cost of buying a new phone.” Skouras also says, “We want to make cell phone and tablet repair quick and convenient. That is why we open stores in locations where our customers already shop, like our new store in the Coventry Walmart.” Coventry residents can now have their iPhones and iPads repaired the same day, or bring their PC or Mac in for a fast repair or data transfer. Cellairis also offers a large selection of popular accessories for mobile devices, right at their new location at the Coventry Walmart. For more information about Cellairis and the device repair franchise, or to find out if a Cellairis repair center is coming to your nearest Walmart store, please email mgann(at)cellairis(dot)com or visit cellairis.com.  About Cellairis Cellairis has franchises throughout the United States including multiple franchises in the greater Coventry area. Their device repair centers are committed to providing fast turnaround times and guaranteed repairs on iPhone, iPad, Samsung Galaxy and other electronic devices. In most instances, mobile devices are repaired the same day, while you wait. From premium fashionable cases and accessories to expert device repair services, Cellairis holds a reputation for exceptional customer service and top quality workmanship. Cellairis also buys and sells used iPhones and iPads for cash.

The Street1:09 Sesame Street and SeaWorld plan more joint parks Wochit Business0:32 UP NEXT When you're hungry for the big savings at the grocery store, you might be tempted to visit your local Target or Walmart to scoop up the latest specials and offers. However, these stores might not be the best places to buy groceries on a budget. Instead, your local grocery chain or supermarket might be dishing up the best prices on everything from organic food to alcohol. "If you were to compare the everyday low pricing of Walmart and similar discount stores, their prices are generally lower than a grocery store's regular price," said Stephanie Nelson of CouponMom.com. "However, grocery stores focus on highlighting a select number of sale items in their weekly ads, which may be 50 percent off the regular price." Typically, grocery store sale items last only a few weeks, which is why "strategic shoppers stock up on grocery store sale items during those weeks and know not to pay full price," said Nelson. Click ahead for a closer look at some of the best grocery store deals that beat tend to beat the prices at Target and Walmart: Produce © Aldi If you aren't making it to the farmers market for your weekly roundup of fresh produce, ALDI needs to be on your radar — not Target or Walmart. "ALDI's fruit and vegetables are usually the lowest price compared to other grocers, and they rate as good quality — especially if you shop early mornings when stock is full to choose from," said Brent Shelton of FatWallet.com. In his experience, Shelton has seen ALDI prices that are roughly 10 percent to 20 percent lower than prices at Walmart, Dollar General, Kroger and Save-A-Lot. Also See: Whole Foods vs. Aldi — Which Store Is Better for Your Money? Organic Food © Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com You might want to make your way to Trader Joe's for organic fare, since the chain typically has better deals on these items than big-box stores like Target. According to data compiled by Get Healthy U, an online health and fitness resource, a 4.4-ounce tub of organic blueberries will run you $4.99 at Target but only $3.99 at Trader Joe's. Organic baby spinach is $3.49 at Target and only $2.29 at Trader Joe's. And organic peanut butter costs $3.49 at Trader Joe's while Target charges $5.99 for a 16-ounce jar. No matter where you shop, however, make sure you truly are getting the best deals. You can do this by knowing which organic foods are worth the money --and which ones are not. Alcohol  © Aldi Whether you're buying a few bottles of wine or a six-pack of beer, you could save money on alcoholic beverages by sticking with your neighborhood grocery store.  For example, it's hard to beat the $2.99 Charles Shaw "Two Buck Chuck" at Trader Joe's, available in red and white varietals. You can also pick up a bottle of pinot grigio for $5.99 or Lambrusco for $4.99 at Trader Joe's. Meanwhile, Walmart's award-winning malbec retails for just under $7, reports Delish. Many grocery stores also run specials on brand-name beers and new arrivals each week, which means you might get a better deal on six-packs or single bottles without the trip to Walmart or Target. For example (at time of writing), a 24-pack of Budweiser, Miller or Coors is on sale for $17.99 at a Georgia Publix store and a 12-pack of Yuengling beer is just $9.99. Since grocery stores are known to rotate items on sale each week, keep an eye out for coupons and in-store offers at grocery and big-box stores to get the best price. Meat © Aldi Whether you're looking for hamburger meat or chicken, pay attention to weekly sales. Nelson suggested using this smart shopping strategy when buying meat: "Boneless chicken breasts may sell at a grocery store for $4 per pound. Walmart's price may be $3 per pound. However, every other week, major grocery stores like Kroger or Safeway feature a brand of boneless chicken breasts for $2 per pound. Strategic shoppers would stock up on chicken during those weeks and only buy it when it was $2 per pound." Is all that price checking worth the effort? "For my family of four, stocking the freezer with $2 chicken — instead of paying the going rate each week — saves $450 per year," said Nelson. Store Brands © Aldi Although both stores offer generic brands for low prices, Target or Walmart might not be the best place to get store-brand items. For example, a large can of Walmart's Great Value chunk chicken breast costs $2.50 while a premium, flavored variety from Kroger can drop to a sale price of $1.89. And if you're on the hunt for the best prices on gluten-free or organic store brands, head back to ALDI, which is much more budget-friendly than your regular grocery store, said Shelton. In addition to ALDI and Kroger, there are quite a few store brands that can save you money. So before you head out to your local grocery, big-box or even warehouse store, compare your generic options. Baked Goods © Caftor / Shutterstock.com When it comes to cookies, cakes and pies, your sweet indulgences might wreck your diet — but they don't have to empty your wallet. Since freshly baked goods have a short shelf life, your neighborhood grocer might be more likely to mark down items for a quick sale a day or two before their "best by" dates. This saves the stores from throwing the items away. Big-box stores, by contrast, might simply toss outdated items or donate them to a local food bank. Grocery store bakeries also tend to offer more low-priced seasonal goods to meet higher demand and run specials to attract more shoppers. Fourth of July cakes, pumpkin-themed cookies Thanksgiving and Halloween cupcakes are just a few items to keep your eye on during celebration seasons. Check weekly fliers for the latest deals. And, if you're looking for packaged goods, keep this insider's secret in mind: "A good majority of ALDI's pre-packed as private-label products are actually brand products, just repackaged," said Shelton. "So [the] quality is high and [the] price is usually lower than the brands available at regular grocers."

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website 9  −   =  7 Once again, the hot-button U.S. minimum wage debate is trending across social media platforms. Protesters stage a sit-in protest, blocking the entrance of a Wal-Mart distribution center at a rally for Warehouse Workers Justice, Oct. 1, 2012. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings this morning (May 18) – reminding many that the United States' largest private sector employer is notorious for paying its workers the lowest-possible wage. But what readers need to know about the minimum wage debate – and what you won't hear from the mainstream media – is this: It's irrelevant. Totally… 100%… irrelevant. That's because something far bigger and badder is about to impact minimum wage workers – and no one is talking about it. Why the Minimum Wage Debate Is Obsolete No one, that is, except Money Morning Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald. He's long followed public discourse on hourly wages and believes the issue, as controversial as it's become, is a red herring. "What people don't understand is the $15 minimum wage argument is irrelevant if a robot has your job," Keith says. According to a January 2017 report from The McKinsey Global Institute entitled "Automation, Employment, and Productivity," the next 20 years are expected to produce a veritable robotics gold rush in America. The report claims the manual labor and customer service industries will be hit especially hard. And because of this shift to workplace robotics, "millions of employees in these sectors could be forced to learn new skills or change career roles entirely over the next two decades," McKinsey claims. Such a shift would wreak havoc on the economy, and Keith predicts that the "robot gold rush" will actually arrive sooner than McKinsey says – much sooner. In fact, one subset of the manual labor sector is already experiencing an automation takeover… The Rise of Big Rig-Driving Robots "Nobody is thinking about all the truck drivers that will be unemployed when there are autonomous trucks," Keith says. "I've been following this information since I've been with Money Map Press. And I think automation-based job losses are only five years away." There's strong evidence to support Keith's robot job-takeover prediction. In fact, the general public saw proof of it last fall… Uber subsidiary Otto’s autonomous driving truck, June 17, 2016. On Oct. 20, 2016, ride-sharing company Uber's subsidiary Otto – a self-driving truck corporation – tested its first-ever autonomous big rig. That day, a driverless semi carried 51,744 cans of Budweiser beer 120 miles across Colorado, from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs, reported Trucks.com. The success of this test prompted Daniel Murray, vice president of research at the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI), to declare: "On Oct. 19, I was one of the biggest detractors of this technology; [on Oct. 20] I drank the Kool-Aid," according to Trucks.com. Murray went on to explain that, thanks to Otto's successful self-driving truck test, he'd moved his "personal [autonomous truck takeover] timeline" from "15 to 20 years up to five." Murray's prediction matches what Keith's been forecasting. The Tech Industry's Next Great Battleground Unlike Murray, Keith isn't limited to trucking; he's been eyeing the entire tech industry. And the sector is, simply put, on the verge of a profit explosion. The catalysts for this explosion will be what Keith considers "make-or-break" moments for emerging innovation companies. These moments involve "the precise instant in time when [a company] will either become a hero or a zero," he says. For example, the success of Otto's big rig test last October was the company's "make" moment. And as far as tech company "break" moments go, take Lily Robotics – would-be maker of autonomous flying camera drones – as a prime example of an ultimately over-hyped startup's early death… On Feb. 1, Business Insider reported that Lily put the cart before the horse, advertising a product that never really existed. After a year of pushing back the release date, the company closed its doors in January for good. And doing so forced the company to refund $34 million dollars' worth of pre-ordered drones. Ouch. Profiting from the robotics trend means knowing which way the chips will fall – whether a company will have a "make" moment or a "break" one. That's where Keith comes in. He has put together a well-researched positioning plan for investors to follow so that they can cash in on the "robot gold rush" too. Have a look… Editor's Note: "Must-have" companies backed by Unstoppable Trends are a cornerstone of Keith's wealth-building strategy. But there's another type of investment he wants Money Morning Members to know about. It's one of his favorites, a kind of "desert island fund" he'd buy if he had to park his money in one place, "retire" from civilization for 20 years, and come back to a pile of money. Click here to learn more… Follow Money Morning on Twitter @moneymorning, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

(Jodie Aakko / Special to the Times) Jodie Aakko had a fun idea for a spring service project for the students at Lighthouse Seventh-Day Adventist Christian School in Fort Morgan. The principal called it a "Baby Care-a-Thon," and it meant having the students visit local grocery stores and ask customers who were there to purchase items for babies and then donate them to the students as they left. "Our students stood at the doors with smiles to greet customers, hand them a cart, and tell them about our Baby Care-A-Thon," Aakko said. "By the end of just one fast hour, our tables were full with baby items." The students were seeking baby food, pacifiers, diapers, baby toys or any other items babies and their parents might need. They gave the customers at Walmart, Safeway and Edwards Right Price Market a small piece of paper explaining the project, and then were at the door by the checkouts to gather any items people were donating. "We are delivering the items to Rising Up, to be distributed to needy families in our community," stated the paper the store customers got from the students. Students in grades one through eight at Lighthouse SDA Christian School participated in the "Baby Care-a-Thon" on May 10, Aakko said. "The excited students broke-up into three teams" and went to the three grocery stores, she said. Advertisement "One customer was in a hurry, so he gave us $30 to buy the baby food," reported sixth-grader Brayan Orona. "Another customer said that they got some baby food for us because they would feel guilty if they didn't. But we were so excited because we also got to meet a Vietnam veteran at the store." Next, the Lighthouse students went to Rising up to drop off "the mountain of baby items, take a tour of the agency, and assemble 'travel packs,'" Aakko said. After hearing Trish Moreno from Rising Up explain what the nonprofit does to support the community, the students toured the Rising Up facility at the United Methodist Church Annex. They then put the travel bags together assembly-line-style and then placed the other baby items on the pantry shelves. "We planned on how we would like to partner with this agency next school year," Aakko said. "It is true... when you help someone, you receive a blessing knowing that you helped the community." The Lighthouse students concluded the service project outing by walking over to Fort Morgan City Park and picking up "any trash they could spy," she said. "This activity was a homerun."

(Nasdaq: AMZN) — has changed the way that people shop. Amazon has been a growing pain in the neck for low-price retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) for some time, but even high-end specialty stores like Ralph Lauren Corp. (NYSE: RL) have struggled now that Amazon has crept into their sector. Now the e-commerce leviathan is tiptoeing into another new arena: healthcare. Amazon Is Setting the Retail Ice Age on U.S. Drugstores Amazon has long invested in the retail healthcare market, offering medical supplies and equipment to its consumers. But according to a May 16 report by CNBC, Amazon has held annual meetings at its Seattle headquarters over the last few years to discuss entering the retail drugstore business… Of course, we don't mean brick-and-mortar pharmacies — we mean drug delivery. Indeed, Amazon often tests new product lines in non-U.S. markets before it assesses whether to roll it out in the domestic market. "A disruptive company like Amazon can turn an industry on its side." So when The Japan Times reported in April that Amazon would be expanding its Prime Now delivery service to include drug sales, U.S. drugstores should have been on high alert. And with the rise of high-deductible plans and more people paying for healthcare, Amazon wants to dive even deeper into the healthcare business than drug delivery. We're talking pharmaceuticals… The Next Market Amazon Could Take Over Indeed, just one month later on May 17, CNBC reported that Amazon is hiring pharmaceutical talent in the United States – a general manager to lead the "consumables" unit and other prospects from the pharmacy sector. Urgent: You could make $1.6 million or more by learning how to extract cash from failing businesses. Find out more… We can't say we're shocked. "There is no such thing as an 'Amazon-Proof' retailer," said Money Morning Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald – who has long been bullish on AMZN stock – to Members on April 10. "A disruptive company like Amazon can turn an industry on its side." Amazon currently has over 310 million active customer accounts, according to the latest report from Statista. That number is expected to skyrocket as the giant continues to devour competitors and expand into new industries … By 2020, RBC Capital Markets predicts Amazon will have over 500 million active customers, according to CNBC on March 10. Video And the healthcare industry is so very tempting. It currently accounts for nearly 18% of U.S. GDP and could reach 25%, wrote Forbes on May 18. Investors are already seeing the writing on the wall. Shares of potential rivals in the retail pharmacy space were spooked by the news on Wednesday (May 18). Both CVS Health Corp. (NYSE: CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (Nasdaq: WBA) were down more than 3% in afternoon trading. At the same time, Amazon was up 1.48% on Wednesday and is currently trading up 0.84%. How to Play Amazon Now There are two ways to play this, according to Keith. "Longer term, there's no question you want to own shares of Amazon," said Keith on April 10. "In fact, Amazon may well be the only company in the world today that you can buy today and expect to hold for the rest of your investing lifetime." However, that comes with a hefty price tag. Amazon currently trades at over $900 a share – and its growing steadily. Over the past three months, AMZN stock has risen over 14% — from $845.07 in February to $966.62 today (May 19). As a second option, "Consider buying just a few shares at a time," recommends Keith. "Heck, buy even one if that's what you can afford. Then, throw away the proverbial key." Editor's Note: "Must-have" companies backed by Unstoppable Trends are a cornerstone of Keith's wealth-building strategy. But there's another type of investment he wants Money Morning Members to know about. It's one of his favorites, a kind of "desert island fund" he'd buy if he had to park his money in one place, "retire" from civilization for 20 years, and come back to a pile of money.

Jan EngorenContact ReporterSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel Boynton facility offers pantry, programs for those in need Privacy Policy Feeding South Florida in Boynton Beach has announced the release of Map the Meal Gap 2017, the latest report by Feeding America on food insecurity and the cost of food at both the county and congressional district level. The report reveals that in the four-county area, food insecurity is highest in Palm Beach County with 14.1 percent of the county population food insecure and 194,260 people not knowing from where they will get their next meal. "Although the total number of people living in food-insecure households has decreased, individual need among people who are food insecure continues to increase," Paco Vélez, president and CEO of Feeding South Florida, said in a statement. "We continue to see a higher cost of living relative to the low-wage paying jobs." Last year, Feeding South Florida opened a 25,644-square-foot facility in Boynton Beach at 4925 Park Ridge Blvd. that is designed to be on the forefront of advocacy efforts and innovative programming, offering computer and financial literacy classes, resume building and work force development in a new life skills center opening this fall. In addition, the agency has eight school pantries in which students and families can come for food items such as apples, cantaloupe, cereal, pasta and raisins. According to Velez, Florida is ranked the 12th state in the United States for food insecurity. Jan Engoren/Forum Publishing Group Paco Velez, CEO of Feeding South Florida in Boynton Beach, recently talked about the latest report detailing the percentage of food-insecure individuals in Palm Beach County. Paco Velez, CEO of Feeding South Florida in Boynton Beach, recently talked about the latest report detailing the percentage of food-insecure individuals in Palm Beach County. (Jan Engoren/Forum Publishing Group) The study also finds that people currently facing hunger are likely falling further behind as they continue to struggle to buy enough food to meet their needs. Food-insecure individuals now face, on average, a food budget shortfall of $19.61 per person each week, up from $19.10 last year. Feeding South Florida rescues and distributes 44 million pounds of food each year through direct-service programs and a network of more than 400 nonprofit partner agencies including Publix, Winn-Dixie, Trader Joe's, Costco and Walmart. Every $1 donated to Feeding South Florida can provide six meals, with an average cost of $3.39 per meal in Palm Beach County. Vélez, who came from the Kitchen Table, a similar client choice food bank in San Antonio, is modeling many of these programs on that prototype. He said it is more than a food pantry, relying on the community's support for its efforts. Publix spokeswoman Nicole Krauss, one of the partner agencies, said, "We're proud of the way we support Feeding South Florida of their efforts to provide food for those without." Publix's Perishable Recovery Program rolled out company wide in 2010. "As a food retailer, it makes sense for us to be in alignment with Feeding South Florida and make an impact through product donations, financial support and staff involvement," she said. "From our back door to families' tables, it's a wonderful way for us to support their efforts and our community's needs." In addition, Walmart has partnered with Feeding South Florida to raise awareness through the Fight Hunger, Spark Change Campaign. Walmart customers can secure either one meal for Feeding America for every purchase of a participating product at Walmart stores, or donate to Feeding America directly at its checkouts in stores and online. Their figures indicate donations of more than 45 million pounds of food, the equivalent of donating 37.5 million meals to Florida families, to food banks throughout the state during fiscal year 2017. The Restoration Bridge food pantry in West Palm Beach receives food from Feeding South Florida and distributes it to those in need in West Palm Beach, Riviera Beach and Lake Worth. Run by Daniel Lee West, the pantry (known as Above the Sea Restaurant) provides meals for 12,000 individuals (4,000 families) each week in addition to a food backpack program designed to feed students who might not have food to eat after they leave school for the day. During the summer, he said, the organization provides three meals a day to 150 children. "So many lives are touched by this generosity," West said. "Feeding South Florida is sowing the seeds and we reap the harvest. "It's a ripple effect," he said. "Our families are encouraged and have hope. They get their self-worth back when they are nourished." He recounted the story of one family in which the father was hit by a car and in a coma. Since he was unable to work and provide for his family, Restoration Bridge provided food essentials for his wife and daughter. "We find out where the greatest need is and help those in need," West said. "Without Feeding South Florida, we wouldn't be able to have the impact on families that we do."

Berry May 19, 2017 4:38 PM SHARE TWEET EMAIL REDDIT EMAIL REDDIT Kevin Winter, Getty Images Travis Scott found himself in a little bit of trouble after he was arrested following his show at the Walmart Amphitheater in Rogers, Ark. last Saturday (May 13). The rapper was charged with inciting a riot, disorderly conduct and endangering the welfare of a minor. Now he’s apparently pled not guilty to all of those misdemeanor charges. The folks at Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported the news earlier today (May 19). Roger police say Travis “encouraged people to rush the stage” at the Walmart Amphitheater last week. A police officer, a security guard and a few others were injured at the show. Travis’ lawyer, Drew Ledbetter, disagrees with the claim—or at least, anyone who would suggest Travis meant to cause any harm. “Travis Scott had no criminal intent,” said Ledbetter, who’s waived Travis’ appearance at a court date set for June 1. “He only intended to put on a good show.” On the bright side, Travis performed his song “Goosebumps” a whopping 14 times in a row, causing people to claim he broke world records for the feat but there’s no confirmation on that yet. Crazy stuff. It’s things like that that give you a window into how one of his concerts could go wrong if just a few things get out of hand. See the video of Travis performing “Goosebumps” for yourself below.

(NYSE: WMT) saw its shares hit a new multiyear high on Friday in the wake of a positive earnings report earlier on in the week. Following the earnings release, investors were very positive on the stock, and shares rose again on Friday after analysts had their say as well. 24/7 Wall St. has taken a look at the earnings report and included a few brief highlights from it, as well as what some analysts are saying afterward. The retailing giant posted adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.00 on total revenues of $117.54 billion, versus consensus estimates that called for EPS of $0.96 and $117.74 billion in revenue. In the same period of last year, Wal-Mart reported EPS of $0.98 on revenues of $115.9 billion. U.S. first-quarter same-store sales rose 1.4% at the company’s supercenter and discount stores. Same-store sales in the company’s Sam’s Club stores were up 1.6% excluding fuel sales and up 3% including fuel. Total U.S. net sales, including fuel, rose 1.5% for the quarter. U.S. traffic in stores was up 1.5% year over year. Consolidated operating income rose 1.3% year over year in the first quarter. U.S. operating income rose 0.9% for the quarter while the company’s international segment saw a quarterly jump of 9%. Operating income at Sam’s Club stores rose 0.2% in the quarter. Wal-Mart guided second-quarter EPS at $1.00 to $1.08, excluding an expected net benefit of $0.05 per share related to the sale of a Mexican subsidiary. Second-quarter same-store sales are expected to rise 1.5% to 2.0% at U.S. stores and 1.0% to 1.5% at Sam’s Club stores, excluding fuel sales. Consensus estimates call for second-quarter EPS of $1.07 and revenues of $122.73 billion. Credit Suisse reiterated an Outperform rating with an $80 price target. The firm also commented in its report: WMT’s momentum continued, as the company reported another quarter of relatively solid top-line performance while delivering its first increase in U.S. earnings in over three years. EPS of $1.00 beat consensus and our estimate of $0.96. While the U.S. comp increase of 1.4% was about as expected, traffic growth of 1.5% (which accelerated on a two and three year basis) and e-commerce growth (an 80 bps contribution) surprised to the upside. Separately, a few other analysts weighed in: Barclays has an Overweight rating and raised its price target to $90 from $82. BMO upgraded it to Market Perform from Underperform and raised its price target to $80 from $63. JPMorgan raised its price target to $80 from $68. RBC raised its price target to $74 from $67. Susquehanna raised its price target to $92 from $80. Shares of Wal-Mart were last seen up 1.6% at $78.75 on Friday, with a consensus analyst price target of $77.49 and a 52-week trading range of $65.28 to $78.90.

The retail giant’s core U.S. business saw 1.4-percent same-store sales growth in the quarter and traffic growth was up 1.5 percent, the best performance since fiscal year 2012. Quarter Print, In Review A key figure from the first quarter was Wal-Mart’s e-commerce performance, which grew a remarkable 63 percent year over year. It appears that the company’s increased emphasis to penetrate the e-commerce world is paying off, following the $3.3 billion Jet.com acquisition Wal-Mart made last year to jumpstart e-commerce and fire back at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). International business was slow, however, growing just 0.8 percent on a constant currency basis, the slowest growth since fiscal year 2010. Analyst Commentary, Justification For Neutral Rating “Overall, we consider this to be a decent set of results for WMT as it works on transforming its business model. The print showed WMT is making good progress. Looking ahead, a key debate will be whether it can keep up its in-store US comp growth, particularly as it grows eComm & competition in grocery intensifies,” said UBS analyst Michael Lasser following the earnings release. UBS maintains a Neutral rating on Wal-Mart with a $73 price target.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint In June 2014, comedian Tracy Morgan was returning to New York from a show in Delaware when the minibus in which he was riding was struck from behind by a Wal-Mart truck. Fellow comic James “Jimmy Mack” McNair was killed; Morgan was hospitalized with broken bones and a brain injury. He was briefly in a coma. Almost two years later, Morgan made his return to the stage with his Picking Up the Pieces tour. An October appearance in Red Bank, N.J., not far from where the accident happened, just started streaming on Netflix, which has been investing in high-profile stand-up specials by comics including Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K. and Amy Schumer. “Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive” begins with a filmed opening, with nods to “Saturday Night Fever,” as Morgan cruises Brooklyn with a Wal-Mart bag full of settlement money; he buys three slices of pizza instead of two, and he eats them piled one on top of another. A gag transports him into a John Travolta white suit and onto the stage, which is set with a table and armchair into which he occasionally collapses. One suspects this may be a matter of necessity, but mostly, he is on his feet and moving, encouragingly, and carrying an hour of material in his head. There is a shape to it; with a few video projections and lighting cues, you could call it a theater piece. Jokes and digressions are threaded on the story of his accident and recovery — in the coma, coming out of the coma, after the coma, on Earth and in heaven: “When I was in that coma, y’all, I saw that white light, but I didn’t go to it, because I thought it was police. I got warrants, man. You can’t get into heaven with priors.” To be sure, the hour is rife with words I can’t write in this paper. Morgan has provoked controversy for his jokes before, including editorial chastisement over remarks about homosexuality (for which he apologized). As with all comedy, mileage varies from listener to listener, and for any given listener, from joke to joke; you don’t decide what to laugh at, after all, you just laugh, or you don’t. I laughed at times, winced at others. But Morgan stays mostly within bounds here; not everyone will like his impression of a joint-rolling Jesus, or his sexual meditations on Caitlyn Jenner, or his taste for breast milk (“and Splenda”). Apart from taking shots at members of his own family (“because of my settlement, they think I’m supposed to pay for everybody’s funeral”), he stays largely positive. Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive Where: Streaming on Netflix. His recovery is not only physical but also spiritual — a pitch for self-acceptance, self-improvement and maturity, relatively speaking. He argues for fidelity, restraint and age-appropriate dancing: “When you get to a certain age, this is dancing,” he says, demonstrating. “Two-stepping, that’s all you got to do, just one move — stomach out, stomach in, stomach out, stomach in.” Morgan allows himself a smile now and again, but mostly, he is intent and intense — which is not to say angry. (“I forgave that driver,” he says of the man who hit him. “I’m not even mad at him,” and notes, “when I was in a wheelchair I still shopped at Wal-Mart — you still can’t beat their prices.”) If comedy concerts don’t always translate well to the screen, there are moments, between lines, when the camera does its work. Moving in close, it gives us a glimpse of the comic as human, even more intimate than his altogether unembarrassed prepared remarks.

By Peter Dreier / The Huffington Post May 19, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: http://www.nickmelvoin.com/meet-nick/ Once Nick Melvoin joins the Los Angeles Unified School District board, he’s going to require all high school civics teachers to add a new lesson plan to their curriculum: “How To Buy An Election.” That’s what happened on Tuesday. Melvoin and his billionaire backers dramatically outspent school board president Steve Zimmer’s campaign, making the District 4 race the most expensive in LAUSD history. Political pundits will spend the next few days and weeks analyzing the Los Angeles school board election, examining exit polls, spilling lots of ink over how different demographic groups — income, race, religious, union membership, gender, party affiliation, and others — voted on Tuesday. But the real winner in the race was not Nick Melvoin, but Big Money. And the real loser was not Steve Zimmer, but democracy – and LA’s children. Melvoin’s backers — particularly billionaires and multi-millionaires who donated directly to his campaign and to several front groups, especially the California Charter School Association (CCSA) — outspent Zimmer’s campaign by $6.6 million to $2.7 million. Melvoin got 30, 696 votes to Zimmer’s 22,766. In other words, Melvoin spent 71% of the money to get 57% of the vote. Here’s another way of looking at the election results: Melvoin spent $215 for each vote he received, while Zimmer spent only $121 per vote. There’s no doubt that if the Zimmer campaign had the same war-chest that Melvoin had, he would have been able to mount an even more formidable grassroots get-out-the-vote campaign and put more money into the TV and radio air war. Under those circumstances, it is likely that Zimmer would have prevailed. Billionaires, many of whom live far from Los Angeles, bought this election for Melvoin. Their money paid for non-stop TV and radio ads, as well as phone calls, mailers and newspaper ads (including a huge wrap-around ad on the front of Sunday’s LA Times). Melvoin’s billionaire backers paid for 44 mailers and at least $1 million on negative TV ads against Zimmer. The so-called “Independent” campaign for Melvoin was funded by big oil, big tobacco, Enron and Walmart, and other out-of-town corporations and billionaires. They paid for Melvoin’s ugly, deceptive, and false attack ads against Zimmer, a former teacher and current school board president. Melvoin is so devoted to the corporate agenda for our schools that during the campaign he said that the school district needed a “hostile takeover.” Among the big donors behind Melvoin and the CCSA were members of the Walton family (Alice Walton, Jim Walton, and Carrie Walton Penner) ― heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune from Arkansas, who’ve donated over $2 million to CCSA. Alice Walton (net worth: $36.9 billion), who lives in Texas, was one of the biggest funders behind Melvoin’s campaign. Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflicks (net worth: $1.9 billion), who lives in Santa Cruz, donated close to $5 million since last September to the CCSA’s political action committee, including $1 million a week before the election. Other moguls behind Melvoin and the CCSA include Doris Fisher (net worth: $2.7 billion), co-founder of The Gap, who lives in San Francisco: Texas resident John Arnold (net worth: $2.9 billion), who made a fortune at Enron before the company collapsed, leaving its employees and stockholders in the lurch, then made another fortune as a hedge fund manager; Jeff Yass, who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs, and runs the Susquahanna group, a hedge fund; Frank Baxter, former CEO of the global investment bank Jefferies and Company that specialized in “junk” bonds; and Michael Bloomberg (net worth: $48.5 billion), the former New York City mayor and charter champion. Eli Broad (net worth: $7.7 billion), who hatched a planto put half of all LAUSD students in charter schools by 2023 — an idea that Zimmer fought — donated $400,000 to CCSA last Friday, on top of $50,000 he gave in November. He made his money in real estate and life insurance. Not surprisingly, most of these billionaires are big backers of conservative Republican candidates and right-wing causes. Several are on the boards of charter school chains. What do the corporate moguls and billionaires want? And what did Steve Zimmer do to make them so upset? They want to turn public schools into educational Wal-marts run on the same corporate model. They want to expand charter schools that compete with each other and with public schools in an educational “market place.” (LA already has more charter schools than any other district in the country). They want to evaluate teachers and students like they evaluate new products — in this case, using the bottom-line of standardized test scores. Most teachers will tell you that over-emphasis on standardized testing turns the classroom into an assembly line, where teachers are pressured to “teach to the test,” and students are taught, robot-like, to define success as answering multiple-choice tests. Not surprisingly, the billionaires want school employees — teachers — to do what they’re told, without having much of a voice in how their workplace functions or what is taught in the classroom. Rather than treat teachers like professionals, they view them as the out-sourced hired help. The corporate big-wigs are part of an effort that they and the media misleadingly call “school reform.” What they’re really after is not “reform” (improving our schools for the sake of students) but “privatization” (business control of public education). They think public schools should be run like corporations, with teachers as compliant workers, students as products, and the school budget as a source of profitable contracts and subsidies for textbook companies, consultants, and others engaged in the big business of education. Like most reasonable educators and education analysts, Zimmer has questioned the efficacy of charter schools as a panacea. When the billionaires unveiled their secret plan to put half of LAUSD students into charter schools within eight years, Zimmer led the opposition. In contrast, Melvoin is a big backer of charter schools and a big critic of the teachers union. Now the billionaires and their charter school operators will have a majority on the school board. LA will become the epicenter of a major experiment in expanding charter schools – with the school children as the guinea pigs. Pundits will have a field day pontificating about the LAUSD election, but in the end it’s about how Big Money hijacked democracy in LA.   Peter Dreier is professor of politics and chair of the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.

Fellow comic James “Jimmy Mack” McNair was killed; Morgan was hospitalized with broken bones and a brain injury. He was briefly in a coma. Almost two years later, Morgan made his return to the stage with his Picking Up the Pieces tour; an October appearance in Red Bank, N.J., not far from where the accident happened, was filmed for Netflix, which has been investing in high-profile stand-up specials by comics including Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Amy Schumer, Maria Bamford and Jim Gaffigan. Morgan’s premiered this week for streaming, under the title “Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive.” The special begins with a filmed opening, with nods to “Saturday Night Fever,” as Morgan cruises Brooklyn with a Wal-Mart bag full of settlement money; he buys three slices of pizza instead of two, and he eats them piled one on top of another. A gag transports him into a John Travolta white suit and onto the stage of the theater, which is set with a table and armchair into which he occasionally collapses. One suspects this may be a matter of necessity, but mostly, he is on his feet and moving, encouragingly, and carrying an hour of material in his head. There is a shape to it; with a few video projections and lighting cues, you could call it a theater piece. Jokes and digressions are threaded on the story of his accident and recovery — in the coma, coming out of the coma, after the coma, on Earth and in heaven: “When I was in that coma, y’all, I saw that white light, but I didn’t go to it, because I thought it was police. I got warrants, man. You can’t get into heaven with priors.” Donna Summer’s “On the Radio” makes a motif. To be sure, the hour is rife with “F” words, “B” words, “P” words and other words I can’t write in this paper and would avoid even if I could. Morgan has provoked controversy for his jokes before, including editorial chastisement over remarks about homosexuality (for which he apologized). As with all comedy, mileage varies, from listener to listener, and for any given listener, from joke to joke; you don’t decide what to laugh at, after all, you just laugh, or you don’t. I laughed at times, winced at others. But Morgan stays mostly within bounds here; not everyone will like his impression of a joint-rolling Jesus, or his sexual meditations on Caitlyn Jenner, or his taste for breast milk (“and Splenda”). Apart from taking shots at members of his own family (“Because of my settlement, they think I’m supposed to pay for everybody’s funeral…. They think I’m supposed to put all their kids in college”), he stays largely positive. His recovery is not only physical but also spiritual — a pitch for self-acceptance, self-improvement and maturity, relatively speaking. He argues for fidelity, restraint and age-appropriate dancing: “When you get to a certain age, this is dancing,” he says demonstrating. “Two-stepping, that’s all you got to do, just one move — stomach out, stomach in, stomach out, stomach in.” Morgan allows himself a smile now and again, but mostly, he is intent and intense — which is not to say angry. (“I forgave that driver,” he says of the man who hit him. “I’m not even mad at him,” and notes, “When I was in a wheelchair I still shopped at Wal-Mart — you still can’t beat their prices.”) If comedy concerts don’t always translate well to the screen — it’s an art best experienced in the room, surrounded by laughter — there are moments, between lines, when the camera does its work. Moving in close, it gives us a glimpse of the comic as human, even more intimate than his altogether unembarrassed prepared remarks.   Previous Article Next Article Loading comment count...

The world’s biggest retailer is accelerating efforts to “combine our digital and physical assets to make our shipping simple and easy for customers,” CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement. “Our customers have choices, and we have to earn their business with every interaction.” Wal-Mart has been pumping funds into improving its in-store experience, upgrading stores and boosting worker pay, at the same time that it has been building out its e-commerce business. The costs of those initiatives have pressured earnings in recent quarters, and the company reported earnings of US$3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, down 1.3 percent from the same period last year. Revenue was up 1.4 percent at US$117.5 billion. However, the initiative has produced gains in comparable store sales in the US, a closely watched benchmark that rose 1.4 percent in the first quarter. E-commerce sales surged 63 percent and merchandise volume saw a 69 percent jump. Analysts at Global Data Retail said Wal-Mart’s sharp focus on keeping prices down in grocery was winning some customers back and described growth in e-commerce as evidence of a business “in the ascendancy.” “Overall, this is an encouraging start to the year for Walmart,” GlobalData Retail said in a research note. “This is one US retailer that is ahead of the curve in responding to the evolving landscape.” Wal-Mart shares gained US$2.42, or 3.2 percent, to close at US$77.54 on Thursday. Wal-Mart has boosted its online offerings to 50 million items, up five-fold from a year ago, Walmart eCommerce US president and CEO Marc Lore said. “There’s more product to buy, you’re able to get the product quicker,” Lore said in a conference call with reporters. “The overall experience is improving.” The gains followed a number of Wal-Mart acquisitions over the past year, although executives described the majority of the growth as “organic.” Wal-Mart’s financial reports do not provide a breakdown of revenue for e-commerce sales. Chief financial officer Brett Biggs said e-commerce is “still fairly small” within Wal-Mart’s US business and there was no immediate plan to disclose more details about the business.

(GuruFocus) Following Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT)'s first-quarter results released Thursday, BMO Capital Markets commented that the company is showing signs of life. Accordingly, the firm upgraded its rating on the company. Little To Quibble About Analyst Wayne Hood said there is little to be critical about the company's 2017 guidance or the first-quarter results, except for the overall expense deleveraged from e-commerce/IT investments. Specifically, the analyst noted same-store sales at its U.S. namesake stores were up 1.4 percent, helped by a 1.5 percent increase in traffic. The analyst is of the view that the same-store sales performance was helped by LSD growth in grocery and health & wellness, improving same-store sales in general merchandise throughout the quarter, increased contribution from e-com, well-managed broader sequential strategic price rollbacks and a 7-percent drop in same-store sales inventory. Even as the increased contribution to growth by e-commerce sales suggested sequential deterioration in U.S store sales, BMO Capital Markets believes strategies driving online sales are behind the deterioration, with transactions rising 1.5 percent. Guidance Achievable In Difficult Period Given the improved same-store sales throughout the first quarter, the firm believes second-quarter same-store sales growth guidance of 1.5–2 percent and earnings per share guidance of $1–$1.09 are achievable in a difficult period. Flattish EBIT Margin Likely The firm believes the company has control over expense growth, resulting in expense leverage as early as the third quarter of 2017. Accordingly, the firm sees potentially moderating erosion or even expansion in EBIT margin rate. However, weighed down by the growth in lower-margin e-commerce and price investments, the firm expects annual EBIT margin rate to remain flattish in the coming year. Stock Unlikely To Underperform "We still see many challenges ahead, including emerging competition from hard discounters and an adverse margin mix from growth in e-commerce, but we see a path of better relative sales and transaction growth over the next 12 months that is unlikely to cause the stock to underperform," the firm said. As such, BMO Capital Markets upgraded shares of Wal-Mart to Market Perform from Underperform and increased its price target to $80 from $78. At the time of writing, Wal-Mart shares were rising 1.7 percent to $78.86.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Delivery and the Future of the Restaurant Industry Initiatives like delivery and mobile ordering are expanding in the burger business. Chris Hill (TMFWizard) May 19, 2017 at 10:10AM On this episode of Market Foolery, Chris Hill and David Kretzmann turn their attention to the latest news from the casual dining segment: Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK) wants to spin off Qdoba; Red Robin (NASDAQ:RRGB) turned in an earnings beat; and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has added a number of big cities to its delivery pilot program. The team also looks at Target (NYSE:TGT) and the big box retailer's prospects in e-commerce, small-format stores, and more. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 17, 2017. Chris Hill: It's Wednesday, May 17th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today, from Rule Breakers and Supernova, David Kretzmann. Happy Wednesday! David Kretzmann: Good to see you, Chris. Hill: Good to see you. It's a happy Wednesday for fans of certain NBA franchises. Kretzmann: Our franchises. It was a good night last night. Hill: If you're a Celtics fan, it was a good night. If you're a Sacramento Kings fan, good news out of the NBA draft lottery. Here's hoping our respective teams don't screw it up. Kretzmann: So far, so good. Hill: I've made this comment before -- one of the things I love about opening day for baseball, one of the things I love about the draft, particularly for the NBA and the NFL, is kind of like investing, hope. Hope springs eternal when it's opening day in baseball and the same for NBA and NFL drafts. Kretzmann: A whole open field of possibilities. Hill: Yes, before ultimately -- Kretzmann: The disappointment continues. Hill: Really kicks in. Kretzmann: Although, your Celtics have done pretty well. Hill: They're doing alright. We have some restaurant earnings we're going to get to, but let's start with Target. Their first quarter profits came in higher than expected, I would say significantly higher than expected. Same-store sales fell a little bit. It wasn't too bad. Management, I love this quote, pleased with Target's performance in light of "a very choppy environment." God, that's putting it mildly when you think about retail over the last 6 to 12 months. Kretzmann: Yeah, it has not been an easy time for retailers or restaurants. Definitely a lot of changes and disruptions happening for companies in those spaces. Comps were still down 1.3% for the quarter, but Wall Street was expecting it to fall closer to 4%, so this really is a case of, it wasn't as bad as we thought, so we won't punish the stock. Hill: And Ron Gross made this comment on Motley Fool Money last week, we were looking at, particularly last week, when you looked at some of the big general retailers, Macy's, Kohl's, J.C. Penney, that sort of thing, and the results were so bad across the board. And Ron made the point that, some of these are going out of business. This is capitalism, not everybody gets a trophy. And it's unfortunate for the people who are going to lose their jobs, but some of these aren't going to survive. I feel like Target is in a position where they can be one of the survivors. I haven't looked too closely at what they're doing in terms of e-commerce lately. But it does seem like they've put up good enough numbers often enough that they're in better shape in general. Kretzmann: Yeah. I think they're better-managed. They don't break out what percentage digital makes up of their overall sales, but for this quarter, digital sales were up 22%. It seems like, pretty consistently over the past year or two, their digital sales have been going between 20% to 30% clip. That's nice to see. It's probably still a pretty small portion of overall revenue. They're also investing $7 billion over the next three years into technology, improving their supply chain. They're remodeling a bunch of stores, they're launching a small format concept where they'll have about 100 of those locations rolled out over the next three years or so. So, they're being more proactive than a lot of retailers, which are just taking the bad news as it comes and not really changing a whole lot in any meaningful way. And Target is still in pretty solid financial shape. They generated almost $5 billion in free cash flow over the last year. So they're not going anywhere. Their dividend and share repurchases will be able to continue. I wouldn't be surprised if Target or Wal-Mart buys someone like Wayfair or something, because I think this e-commerce battle is really going to heat up. And these companies are only going to be able to do so much internally, as far as ramping up that e-commerce strategy. So I think, you'll see more and more companies, like PetSmart recently buying, I forget what the name of it was, but it was the largest e-commerce acquisition ever. It might have been Chewy.com. Essentially an online pet food business. PetSmart spent several billion dollars acquiring them within the past month. I think it's inevitable that you will see Wal-Mart, Target, and some of these other retailers that, despite the troubles, are still generating a lot of cash, and they have cash they can put to work buying some of those pure play online retailers. Hill: I think the smaller footprint locations are going to be interesting to watch. I don't know if they've gone public with where the locations -- I would be curious to actually walk through one of those and see how it differs from the big Target that's a few miles from Fool HQ, and see what they're doing differently, because like you said, done correctly, that could be something that they look to grow even more. Kretzmann: Yeah, they're expecting to build 30 of them this year. I haven't looked into this too much, I would assume it's a similar strategy to what Whole Foods is doing with its small 365 concept, where essentially you're able to get the stores closer to consumers. I think, especially for younger consumers, for the millennials, they value convenience more than anything else, and getting those smaller stores with the key, essential, top selling items closer to consumers, that could be a good way to go. Hill: Red Robin Gourmet Burgers first quarter, I know they lowered guidance coming into this report. But give them credit for crushing the lower guidance. Kretzmann: It worked. Hill: It did work. Stock up 17% this morning. This is a company you know better than I do. How good was this quarter? Kretzmann: The quarter itself was OK. Kind of a similar case to Target, where it wasn't as bad as Wall Street was expecting. And their guidance is promising. And I think this is a company that -- Hill: Guidance for the rest of the year? Kretzmann: Yeah. They raised their guidance a bit with earnings per share. They're expecting earnings per share to come in about $3 this year, which is close to their peak earnings in 2015. So essentially, they're saying things are improving. They especially expect things to improve toward the second half of the year. This is a company that's been proactive despite all the different headlines that have been going on in the restaurant industry over the past couple years. They're really putting a lot of effort into their digital efforts, online ordering, take out, things like that. I think Wall Street recognizes that and is rewarding them for that. A lot of other restaurants, I think, are being left behind. Selim Bassoul, who is the CEO of Middleby, Tom Gardner, co-founder and CEO of The Fool recently interviewed Selim Bassoul, and Selim Bassoul essentially said the restaurants who are going to stick around are the ones who are going to emulate Domino's, the pizza companies that have mastered and integrated that digital, online ordering into their entire operations. Those are the restaurants that will be able to stick around and thrive. And we've seen that with Panera, and I know we'll talk a bit more about that. But I think Wall Street recognizes that Red Robin is putting out the effort there. One of the interesting initiatives here, one of these things is a centralized call center for to-go orders, which just streamlines that whole to-go ordering process. 10% of their corporate-owned stores offer curbside pickup, so essentially, you just drive to the store and they'll bring out your food for you. That will be rolled out in about 25% of their locations this summer. So just, different things like that. They're being more innovative than most casual dining chains. Hill: Also, one of the things they talked about for the conference call at Red Robin was prices ticking up a little bit, and it was one of those things where I looked at that and thought, I think, if you are a shareholder, and certainly if you're the CEO of the company, you're really looking to do that even a little bit more. They raised prices something like 1.2%. That's the sort of thing where, that's better than lowering prices, it's better than discounting. We'll get to discounting at restaurants in a second. But if you can bump that up a little more, if you can do that a couple quarters a year, then it starts to have a meaningful impact on your gross margins. Kretzmann: Yeah, and that offsets the traffic losses that a lot of restaurants, especially casual diners, have been seeing. Given the initiatives that they're doing, I think customers right now value convenience almost more than anything else. They like being able to order online or call in a customized order. And when they do that, they typically order more stuff, too. So it brings yourself to the customer. Then, ideally, as you get more people going through those stores, even if it's virtually, the volume of sales that those stores generate goes up, and your margins really improve. So I think Red Robin is positioning itself in a good place if they can keep that traffic going. Hill: Jack in the Box second quarter profits came in higher than expected, which is fine. That's always nice. But I think what's really pushing the stock up 5% to 6% today is the news that Jack in the Box has hired Morgan Stanley to help explore the potential sale of Qdoba. Jack in the Box is the parent company of Qdoba Mexican Eats. I think they have, and I'm ballparking here, roughly three times as many Jack in the Box burger places as they do Qdoba Mexican restaurants. There are a couple things I don't understand about this. Kretzmann: Me too. Hill: [laughs] I was hoping you were going to have all the answers. Kretzmann: I wish. Hill: Lenny Comma, the CEO at Jack in the Box, when he talked about hiring Morgan Stanley, he said of Qdoba relative to Jack in the Box, they have two different business models. Really? Because they're both restaurants. I understand that they're two different foods. How are they two different business models? Kretzmann: That's a very good question. Yeah, I don't understand the logic there. They have a very loose definition of business model, because yeah, you're selling food. Jack in the Box is more your traditional quick serve restaurant, or fast food restaurant. Qdoba is more the fast-casual restaurant that emulates Chipotle. But at the end of the day, they're both selling food, customers are paying for the food the same way. So I don't see them being different business models as a very good reason to justify looking to spin it out. Hill: If you go back three or four years, the story with Jack in the Box, in terms of whatever their quarterly earnings report was, basically went like this: same store sales at the burger places up 2% to 4%. Same store sales at Qdoba up double digits, anywhere from 10% to, in some cases, closing in on 20% same store sales growth. Qdoba was really carrying the water for this company for a long time. I guess I question the timing of this in part because, yes, same store sales at Qdoba for this quarter and the last couple, not doing as well as Jack in the Box. But wasn't the time for this move a year ago, when Chipotle was on the ropes? If you're Jack in the Box and you're thinking, "OK, what's the maximum value we can get from spinning this off?" I feel like it was a year ago when Chipotle same store sales were falling through the floor. Kretzmann: Yeah. In the CEO comments you mentioned, he said it's become more apparent to them that Jack in the Box's valuation is impacted by having two different business models, and that's just a head-scratcher to me. That implies that Qdoba is bringing down Jack in the Box's value, because they have struggled in the past year. But a lot of restaurants, fast casual in particular, have struggled. But Qdoba's same store sales grew 6% in 2014, almost 10% in 2015. Then, they only grew 1.4% in 2016, and they actually dropped in this most recent quarter. But that isn't out of the ordinary for virtually any restaurant that isn't Domino's. So this really seems like a case where they're ditching it at probably the worst possible time. I just don't understand the logic here. And in general, with a spin off like this, where I don't think the business models are all that different, I think having this kind of diversification is actually a good thing over time because they'll have one concept that does well in certain quarters, like Jack in the Box now, you'll have some that do better like Qdoba a few years ago. It's like Chipotle being spun out of McDonald's worked so well for McDonald's, so let's do the same thing and spin out Qdoba. I have a hard time seeing the logic here, because the implication that Qdoba is pulling down the valuation of the overall business, it's like, a couple years ago, it was probably propping up the valuation when things were going really well. Now, suddenly that things aren't rosy for Qdoba, which isn't a Qdoba-centric problem, this is an industry problem, just makes no sense to have that be the main logic for looking to spin it out. The timing, I think, is really questionable. Hill: And we touched on discounting before. When you look at Qdoba's results, the company talked about how they have been doing some discounting. But I think that goes right in line with what you were saying. When you look at restaurants in general over the last 12 months, it's not like Qdoba is the only one out there doing discounting trying to get people in the door. So, I don't know, it seems like they are ... I don't want to call it a panic move, because I don't have a good enough sense of this CEO and this management team to attribute that. So I'm not calling it a panic move. But it really does seem like they are not going to get the value out of this spin off that they would have gotten if they had done this, or even contemplated doing it, 12 to 18 months ago. Kretzmann: Yeah, this really feels more like selling at the bottom. It's probably not quite panic mode, but yeah, if you were interested in spinning it off, the time to do it is when things are doing well. To McDonald's credit, Chipotle was knocking it out of the park, their growth was phenomenal, their numbers were phenomenal. So McDonald's probably maximized their value, to an extent, with Chipotle. Although I don't know if anyone at McDonald's really thinks that was the best decision, given how Chipotle has succeeded. I think, if anything, if I was Jack in the Box, I would first see, maybe we should shift the management or the strategy with Qdoba, reevaluate that before you jump to spinning it off or selling it as a solution. I think this kind of diversification makes sense. You see restaurants going out of their way to develop new concepts now, whether it's Buffalo Wild Wings, Chipotle, virtually every restaurant you can identify, even Red Robin, they have a fast-casual concept they're developing. So, this seems to be bucking the trend at a bad time, and the strategy doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Hill: I'm glad you mentioned McDonald's, because they're in the news not because of earnings but because of the delivery that they have been testing in a few locations in Florida. They are now rolling out delivery in Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, and Columbus, Ohio. They're doing it through Uber's UberEATS service. I'm curious how you view delivery, and I think to the point you made about Selim Bassoul at Middleby and his comments -- for those unfamiliar with Middleby, they are mainly in the oven business, so chances are, if you've gone out to eat in the United States in 2017, chances are your food was prepared in a Middleby oven. I think he's definitely onto something. I mean, this is an industry he knows very well, so I'm not going to disagree with him about how crucial delivery is going to be. From your standpoint, David, I'm curious if you have a thought on what the better strategy is? In the case of McDonald's, they're partnering with UberEATS. You see some places that are opting to build out this delivery network on their own. GrubHub is essentially a business built on going to restaurants and saying, "Don't worry about delivery, we'll do it for you." And certainly, that stock is having a monster 2017. So do you see any particular strategy, one being better than any other? Or do you just look at it and say, look delivery is important, how you execute is up to you but you'd better have a strategy? Kretzmann: There was some interesting discussion on this in Red Robin's conference call. Up to this point, Red Robin has used three of those third-party delivery providers. So they're not doing it on their own. Hill: Three separate ones? Kretzmann: Three separate ones and about 138 locations. The CEO said, seamless is not exactly how I would describe our experience with those third-party providers, because integrating those third-party providers with their payment system, their ordering system, it's a little clunky. They said the delivery times have often been not as promised, which disappoints the customers, and obviously that's not great for Red Robin's brand. So it seems like right now at Red Robin, they basically said, "We're open to other alternatives, because clearly what we're doing now with these third-party providers isn't working as effectively as we would like." And I contrast that with Panera, which I think is a great example of a company that went from zero delivery and now they're going all in on their own in-house delivery. I really think that's the model that will reward these companies over the long-term the most. You look at how Domino's, which is crushing it quarter after quarter despite the restaurant slow down, I think a huge part of that is because they developed their own point of sale system, essentially their own internal system, to manage payments and orders, their own proprietary system. Panera has started to do the same thing.  And that just makes it a seamless experience for customers, wherever you are in the country or the city. You don't have to order through a separate delivery company, you don't have to change your payment information, especially, have a loyalty program like Panera, which has 25 million members, it makes it so much easier as a consumer when you have that consistent experience wherever you are, and I think it makes it a much stickier experience, too, when everything is done through the company. And that raises repeat orders, which is, at the end of the day, what these restaurants need to bump up their margins and volumes. So I think most companies probably won't go that route initially, because that's the tougher route, because you do have to reinvent yourself, especially if you're a casual diner like Red Robin or more of the fast-casual company like Panera. So I think, initially, you're seeing a lot of companies going with these third-party providers. But at the end of the day, to maintain full control over the brand, the experience, and ideally building a loyalty program, which, as we've seen with Starbucks and Panera and Domino's that's been a huge factor in their ongoing success, despite the restaurant slow down. I think keeping it in house is initially the harder move, but it's the one that makes the most sense. But it will be interesting to see how it shakes out. I'll leave it at that. Hill: As you said, it's definitely the harder move. It also seems like if you do it right, it's the much more rewarding move. Kretzmann: Yeah. If you can pull it off. And it really does require a reinvention. It can't just be a tack-on item to the business. That is one concern I have with Chipotle and some of the other companies that are just relying on these third-party providers. I just don't see that being a consistent experience. The economics of it don't really make a whole lot of sense for the company. Unless you have it going through your own internal system, where you can really promote additional offers or something, you don't want the third-party delivery orders to just be replacing people going into the store. Where delivery gets very profitable is if people say, "I'll buy the salad and the breadsticks in addition to the pizza." That's where you really get additional volume and your margins bump up. But if someone is just buying the same thing they would have gotten if they walked into the store, that's going to cost, because these companies have to pay the third-party providers, who need a cut of that transaction. That's some of the headwinds that Red Robin has run into. They mentioned, the economics of delivery are not that great, on top of everything else with the consistency of the experience, which have not been very consistent. So I like companies like Panera, even though they're few and far between that are deciding to go all in and keep it in house. Hill: David Kretzmann, thanks for being here!

Stephanie Koljonen posted a photo to Facebook showing the man holding the young buck on the floor of the Walmart in Wadena after it wandered into the store and started causing chaos Tuesday night. "We were in the pet aisle when we heard what sounded like shelves falling, then a woman screaming," Koljonen told KARE-TV. "We rushed to help and that's when we saw a deer was on the loose." She said the man gently wrestled the deer to the ground and covered its eyes to keep it calm. Koljonen said the deer apparently wandered in through the Garden Center's motion-sensor doors. Tom Grasswick, the man in the picture snapped by Koljonen, said he reacted on instinct when the deer ran into him. "It felt like i got slugged or something," Grasswick told WDAY-TV. "I figured I was bigger than the deer so I'd win that wrestling match." Grasswick said the uninjured deer was eventually released outside.

View All Posts There’s no denying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of this year’s hottest stocks. In fact, Apple’s 30%-plus returns in 2017 make it one of the top 20 performers in the S&P 500. And while the companies ahead of AAPL stock are all fine companies, all of them were in the right place at the right time, catching a fortuitous headwind. It’s unlikely they’ll sustain their current bullish paces. Source: Shutterstock Regardless, while Apple stock is a trade any stock-picker can appreciate, investors of all ilks — stock jockeys, indexers, value hunters, etc. — absolutely have to recognize that Apple wields a surprisingly large amount of influence on the broad market’s overall results. Ditto for the S&P 500’s overall earnings. Some might even the overall impact of AAPL stock on the market’s health is a little scary. Apple’s Impact on Market Performance As of the latest look, Apple remains the world’s biggest company as measured by market cap. With Apple stock priced near $152, Apple is an $800 billion behemoth. The next-nearest name is Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), but at “only” $655 billion, it clearly has some work to do before catching up with the world’s most recognizable consumer-technology company. For perspective (and take the number with a grain of salt since it can change quite a bit from day to day), the entire combined market cap for the S&P 500 is on the order of $20 trillion thanks to the rally following the election of President Donald Trump. If you can’t do the math in your head, here it is: Apple makes up about 4% of the cap-weighted S&P 500 index, even though it’s only 0.2% of the total companies in the index. Alphabet accounts for 3.3% of the S&P 500. That’s a lot of influence from one — or even two — companies. Thing is, that influence may be underestimated unless you do the math. The math is a bit complicated, by the way. It’s a comparison of two moving targets, akin to shooting a moving airplane from another moving airplane. It’s hard. Fortunately, Standard & Poor’s analyst Howard Silverblatt crunched the numbers and concluded that as of early April, the recent rally from AAPL stock accounted for 11% of the S&P 500’s 2017 progress. Without Apple, the S&P 500 would have been up less than 5% at the time, versus the roughly 6% gain it had made with Apple on board. The numbers have changed since then, but only to add to the impact AAPL had made overall. The S&P 500 is now up 5.7% for the year so far, while Apple’s gain has grown from 24% then to 31% now. Without Apple, it’s conceivable the broad market wouldn’t have made any measurable gain over the course of the past month and a half. Apple’s Influence on S&P 500 Earnings As much of an impact as Apple stock has on the S&P 500’s performance, it makes an even bigger impact on its bottom line. Though the first-quarter numbers are still being sorted out, for the fourth quarter, Apple’s profits made up 6.6% of the $27.90 per share the index earned. That was actually a down quarter. Competition from other smartphone makers heats up and Apple puts more attention on lower-margin goods and services. In the fourth calendar quarter of 2015, Apple’s net income made up 9% of the S&P 500’s bottom line.

At least it used to be a fun place to shop. Customer satisfaction with the total shopping experience at Target has declined for a fourth consecutive period, according to a new survey of 2,500 people done by investment bank Cowen. Declines in customer satisfaction were seen across the board, led by drops in customer service, merchandise selection and product quality. Overall, Cowen says customer satisfaction at Target plunged 383 basis points to 66.7%. It appears unhappy Target shoppers could be taking their business elsewhere. On Wednesday, the discount retailer reported first quarter same-store sales fell 1.3%. While that was better than analyst estimates for a 3.6% drop, it marked the fourth straight quarterly decline in the key retail measure. Walmart's U.S. business, on the other hand, saw same-store sales gain 1.4% in the first quarter on the back of efforts to slash food prices and bolster customer service. Wall Street shrugged off Target's sales choppiness, for now. Target shares rose 0.9% to $55.04 in Wednesday trading as earnings beat forecasts, due mostly to expense timing and other cost savings. Shares gained as much as 2% on Thursday. First quarter adjusted earnings came in at $1.21 a share, hammering projections for 89 cents a share. Total sales clocked in at $16.02 billion, surpassing forecasts for $15.64 billion. The company left its full year profit outlook of $3.80 to $4.20 a share unchanged, but acknowledged the better than expected start to the year may lead it to finish above the range's midpoint. Target CEO Brian Cornell conceded on a conference call that the company has a ways to go before it's back to full health. "We aren't doing any high fives in the room," said Cornell. "Target management understands our fears: physical store comps being down 2.2% driven by declining traffic gives the need to intensify changing customer perception that you can "pay less" at Target as the retailer is likely losing share on everyday essentials, as customers turn to Amazon , Walmart and other places," says Cowen analyst Oliver Chen. "Our view is that the company may need to focus on optimizing customer satisfaction." Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Photo: Stephanie L Koljonen, AP Customer tackles startled deer that wandered into a Minnesota Walmart 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Walmart shoppers in Minnesota got an unexpected surprise when a young deer wandered into the store by accident. People at the store in Wadena believe the animal was searching for something to eat when it entered the store through the garden center doors on Tuesday. UNEXPECTEDLY DANGEROUS: Deer chomps human bone 'like a cigar "It came in through the garden doors, and it must have been eating the flowers or something," photographer Stephanie Koljonen told WDAY-TV. Tom Grasswick, who, ironically, lives in Deer Creek, described to WDAY-TV what it felt like to be hit by a deer. Man tackles deer after it wanders into North Dakota store Media: National Desk US "It felt like I got slugged or something," Grasswick told the station. Grasswick says his first instinct was to tackle the animal, bringing it down on a pallet of dog food. After tackling the animal, Grasswick and a few other customers covered the deer's eyes to calm it down, and he and others took the animal outside and set it free. The store has taken steps to prevent this from happening again. Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.

But Alibaba (BABA) and other China internet stocks rallied on generally upbeat reports. Dow retailers Wal-Mart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) had strong results, but many other retailers are struggling. Dow tech giant Cisco Systems (CSCO) sold off on its weak guidance. D.C. Furor Hits Wall Street An ongoing stream of damaging media reports took their toll on President Trump, raising concerns that he'll be too distracted or too weak to push tax cuts through this year, if at all. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 fell 1.8% on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.6%. But stocks slashed losses on Thursday and Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 off 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.6%. Credit Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and the other FANG+ stocks, along with Alibaba (BABA) and other Chinese internets. Alibaba, China Internet Earnings Strong Alibaba's Q1 EPS rose 37% to 63 cents, but missed the consensus by 3 cents as tax expenses and spending on its entertainment and cloud computing businesses ramped up. Revenue jumped 60% to $5.61 billion, beating views. The Chinese e-commerce giant also OK'd a $6 billion buyback. Shares rose 0.5% Thursday after falling 5% early, then rose to a record high on Friday. On Wednesday, archrival Tencent (TCEHY) reported EPS surged 57% in local currency to 22 cents, beating by a penny, as revenue popped 55% $7.18 billion. Tencent stock hit new highs. On Tuesday, internet portal Sina (SINA) and its majority-owned social messaging site Weibo (WB) reported stronger than expected earnings. Weibo reported daily active users of 154 million, up 28% vs the year earlier. Weibo shares soared 25%, Sina 22%. Specialty online retailer Vipshop (VIPS) reported in-line earnings, better-than-expected revenue and solid guidance, but shares tumbled 10.3%. Baozun (BZUN), an Alibaba-backed provider of e-commerce services for brand partners, reported EPS that just met views. Shares dived 12% on Wednesday, but were up 8.6% for the week. Wal-Mart, Target Beat Target (TGT) earnings fell 6% while sales dipped 1% to $16.02 billion, but those were not as bad as feared. Comps skidded 1.3% but better than the expected 3.7% tumble. Shares rose Wednesday but finished the week up just 0.4%, still close to five-year lows. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Q1 profit unexpectedly ticked up 2% to $1 a share, surprising Street estimates for a 2% dip, though 1.4% sales growth to $117.54 billion just missed. Still, U.S. same-store sales rose, unlike Target and many other retailers. The megastore credited organic growth at Walmart.com for its 63% boost in U.S. online sales, although it also acquired two e-commerce properties, Moosejaw and ModCloth, during the quarter. Wal-Mart shares rose 4.1% to a two-year best. Cisco Guidance Sinks Stock Cisco Systems (CSCO) adjusted fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 5% to 60 cents, beating views by 2 cents. Revenue fell 1% to $11.94 billion, above estimates but the sixth straight year-over-year decline as the networking giant transitions from sluggish switch and router hardware to software and security. Current-quarter revenue guidance was far short of forecasts, in part because of concerns that President Trump's economic and tax agenda has stalled. Cisco shares fell 6.7% for the week. Home Depot Bucks Retail Home Depot (HD) reported first-quarter earnings that beat estimates, making it one of the few retailers that isn't cracking under the weight of e-commerce, discounts, discounters, too many stores and not enough traffic. The home-improvement chain hiked its full-year EPS forecast, which was still below expectations. Home Depot shares hit a record high Tuesday but dipped 0.4% for the week. Rival Lowe's (LOW), which reports next week, lost 0.3%, but in buy range. Chip Gear Maker Applied Materials Beats Q2 Views The semiconductor equipment manufacturer's second-quarter profit rose 132% while sales climbed 45% to $3.55 billion, both better than expected. It was the third straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth for Applied Materials (AMAT). For the current quarter, Applied gave EPS and sales targets above the consensus. Applied Materials jumped early Friday, but closed up just 0.4%. RELATED: Applied Materials Hails 'Tremendous Momentum'; EPS Growth Tops 100% Again Salesforce Earnings Strong Salesforce.com said fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings were 28 cents a share, up 17% vs. a year earlier, with revenue rising 25% to $2.39 billion. Its July quarter billings outlook was light but the cloud-based, on-demand business software pioneer raised its full-year fiscal 2018 revenue outlook by about $100 million. Salesforce shares rose early Friday but reversed for a 0.4% decline. RELATED: Salesforce.com Beats Profit, Revenue Views, Tweaks Full-Year Outlook Off-Price TJX, Ross Report T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods parent TJX (TJX) turned in mixed results, missing on revenue, as same-store sales grew 1%. Guidance was soft. The off-price chain said it is introducing a home-fashions concept to the U.S. this year. Ross Stores (ROST) pulled ahead of estimates with 82 cents in per-share profit and $3.3 billion in sales. Comps grew 3%. But Q2 profit guidance missed, and full-year EPS outlook was a little light. Off-price retailers have typically been gems, but both TJX and Ross are trading below their 50-day moving averages amid a greater retail shudder. TJX shares fell 3.9% for the week. Ross rose Friday, paring its week loss to 2%. CAD Software Firm Autodesk Jumps On Q1 Beat Computer-aided design software firm Autodesk (ADSK) saw its stock surge 14.7% to record levels Friday after it beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter ended April 30. Autodesk lost 16 cents a share excluding items on revenue of $486 million, when analysts were looking for it to lose 24 cents a share ex items on sales of $470.4 million. The San Rafael, Calif.-based company is taking a revenue hit as it continues its business model transition from licensed software to cloud computing services. Another design software firm, Synopsys (SNPS), also posted better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings. It earned 88 cents a share excluding items, up 9%, on sales of $680 million, up 12%. Wall Street was expecting 86 cents and $672 million. But shares fell nearly 4.65% for the week. Jack Eyes Qdoba 'Alternatives' Jack in the Box (JACK) earnings beat Q1 forecasts, and the burger chain said it was looking at "potential alternatives" with regards to Qdoba, its fast-casual Mexican chain. CEO Lenny Comma said that over the past year it "has become apparent" that the company's valuation "is being impacted by having two different business models." Shares nearly hit a record high intraday Wednesday, but pared gains for a 3.75% weekly rsise. As Jack in the Box expands delivery services, so has McDonald's (MCD). The Golden Arches announced the expansion of its delivery service to Los Angeles, Phoenix, Chicago and Columbus, Ohio. Sears Feuds With Supplier Sears Holdings (SHLD) CEO Eddie Lampert said on the corporate blog that speculations on the ailing retailer's potential demise had hurt business. Lampert also said that tool supplier One World, seeking to get out of its contract with Sears, had threatened to sue the retailer and had sought to embarrass them. The CEO said Sears "has paid and continues to make all payments to One World" and that it would defend itself against any legal action. Sears shares sank 17.4%. Will Amazon Target Drug Stores, Wireless? The pharmacy and wireless markets could be the next Amazon (AMZN) next targets. An unconfirmed report that the online giant is seeking to break into the drug-dispensing business weighed on Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), CVS Health (CVS) midweek. But it may not be smooth sailing for the online giant in this competitive space, Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes wrote that the established players have access to discounted drugs that Amazon is unlikely to beat and already offer drug delivery by mail. Plus, the regulatory and infrastructure hurdles to building out a pharmacy business are high. Amazon is also said to be in talks with Dish Network (DISH) over a wireless partnership. Word of a deal is awaited. Autonomous Drive Partnerships Expand The race toward an autonomous driving future continues to heat up. On Tuesday, BMW Group, Intel (INTC) and Mobileye (MBLY) announced a partnership with Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to bring self-driving kits to multiple automakers. BMW, Intel and Mobileye were already working on a self-driving vehicle and Mobileye, being acquired by Intel, had an autonomous system pact with Delphi. On May 14, Alphabet (GOOGL) autonomous driving unit Waymo teamed up with ride-sharing service Lyft. In Brief Ford Motor (F) announced it would cut 1,400, or 10%, of white collar workers in North America and Asia to rein in costs amid slumping demand. General Motors (GM) will stop selling cars in India, South Africa and East Africa. Shares of Ford and GM hit 52-week lows during the week. Urban Outfitters' (URBN) first-quarter earnings per share fell to 13 cents with revenue of $761 million, both below views on weak same-store sales. American Eagle (AEO) had mixed results with EPS of 16 cents missing analyst views by a penny while sales rose 1.7% to $761.8 million, above views. But the teen retailer sees Q2 EPS of only 15 to 17 cents, below views for 23 cents, and continuing gross margin pressures. Both stocks hit multiyear lows. Dick's Sporting Goods' (DKS) first-quarter earnings rose 8% to meet expectations of 54 cents per share but sales rose 10% to $1.83 billion, short of views. Same-store sales only grew 2.4%. Dick's shares tumbled. Hibbett Sporting Goods (HIBB) topped EPS views, though same-store sales fell. Foot Locker missed on earnings, sales and same-store sales early Friday, sending its shares sharply lower. Stratasys (SSYS) reported first-quarter earnings that met forecasts, as shares of the 3D printer maker proceeded to go on a roller-coaster ride on a wobbly outlook, down 6.6% for the week. Hotel search platform Trivago (TRVG) posted better-than-expected sales and earnings for the first quarter, The recent IPO's stock shot up to 21.89, a new all-time high, closing the week up 6.6% at 19.01, but near the low of the weekly range.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

CBS3's Rahel Solomon reports. Matt Coughlin, Frank Warner and Pamela LehmanContact ReportersOf The Morning Call Bucks man charged, police say he fired shotgun at vehicles on Rt. 309 in Richland Twp. A Bucks County man was charged late Thursday with firing a shotgun at a car, with a woman and her son inside, along Route 309 in Richland Township. Brandon Grosso, 32, of Washington Court in Hilltown, was charged shortly before midnight with two counts of aggravated assault and a series of related offenses. District Judge Jean Seaman arraigned Grosso at 11:45 p.m. Thursday and sent him to Bucks County Prison under $150,000 bail. According to court records: Barbara Lavin told police she was driving her car behind the Walmart in the Richland Crossing shopping center with her son, Sean, in the passenger seat around 5:30 p.m. Lavin told police she stopped at the stop sign to turn right when she heard a shot. Frank Warner A man in a Mercedes car fired a shotgun Thursday night at several cars near the Wal-Mart on Route 309 in Richland Township, police and witnesses said. Witnesses said they saw a car with its windows blown out about 5:30 p.m. behind the Wal-Mart, just north of Quakertown, and several police cars... A man in a Mercedes car fired a shotgun Thursday night at several cars near the Wal-Mart on Route 309 in Richland Township, police and witnesses said. Witnesses said they saw a car with its windows blown out about 5:30 p.m. behind the Wal-Mart, just north of Quakertown, and several police cars... (Frank Warner) A Wal-Mart video surveillance camera showed Lavin's car was approached from behind by a car driven by Grosso. "[Grosso] reaches out the window with what appears to be a shotgun and fires at" Lavin's vehicle, police said. The car then sped off. Police found shotgun wadding on the ground, and the window on Lavin's car was shattered with damage "consistent with a slug fired from a shotgun." Police said they were able to identify Grosso because minutes before the shooting, he used his credit card to buy items at a Quakertown doughnut shop. The court records offered no details as to a possible motive in the shooting. — Matt Coughlin, Frank Warner and Pamela Lehman Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The Morning Call Three tractor-trailers burn, 3 people hurt on I-78 in Berks County NAACP president Brooks ousted in board vote Countryside Ice Cream to reopen Monday at Routes 29 and 100 Breaking Obits Prom Sports Arts & Ent Popular Classifieds Video/Photos 63°

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 19 May 2017 | MYT 5:20 PM Wal-Mart sales get boost from online growth, customer visits Wal-Mart's investments to bring more customers into the discount retailer has paid off and a bigger push into e-commerce has boosted online purchases. — Reuters CHICAGO: Wal-Mart Stores Inc on May 18 reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales at established US stores, as investments to bring more customers into the discount retailer paid off and a bigger push into e-commerce boosted online purchases, sending its shares flirting near a 52-week high. Wal-Mart and analysts said the company is benefiting from a US$2.7bil (RM11.68bil) investment to increase entry-level wages and enhance the training of its workforce, which has led to better stocked shelves and cleaner stores. It said store visits rose 1.5%, the tenth consecutive quarterly increase. Earlier in the day, shares of Wal-Mart rose to US$77.40 (RM334.86) – a 52-week high. They were trading at US$77 (RM333.13) in mid-day. Wal-Mart's efforts to close the gap with rival Amazon.com has started gaining momentum even as other retailers like department store chains struggle. Online sales for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer rose 63% in the first quarter, which was higher than 29% growth in the fourth quarter and 20% in the third quarter. Online sales added 0.8 percentage points to the first quarter comparable sales gain. Growth in the business has been picking up after Wal-Mart said in October it would slow down new store openings to focus on expanding its e-commerce business. US e-commerce chief Marc Lore told reporters in a call that online sales growth was boosted by offering free two-day shipping without membership fees, and higher repeat orders. "We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of," said Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. The company said most of the Internet sales growth was from existing online operations rather than from acquisitions. Wal-Mart, which acquired Jet.com in 2016, this year alone has snatched up online retail startups Shoebuy, Moosejaw and Modcloth, and is currently in talks with small online clothing retailer Bonobos. "Wal-Mart's long string of investments in labour and e-commerce, including acquisitions, are enabling modest market share gains," John Zolidis, director equity research with the Buckingham Research Group said. Wal-Mart's performance, along with rival Target's results on May 17, bucked a string of weak results from retailers Macy's Inc and J.C. Penney. Target reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings and sales. Wal-Mart said sales at US stores open at least a year rose 1.4%, excluding fuel price fluctuations, and was the 11th consecutive quarterly increase. Analysts were expecting a 1.3% increase, according to Consensus Metrix. Wal-Mart is aggressively investing in making prices more competitive compared to rivals. It has asked vendors to offer grocery prices that are 15% lower than competitors. Wal-Mart's US Chief Executive Greg Foran said comparable sales in food and grocery improved during the quarter on lower food deflation, without sharing details. Grocery accounts for nearly 53% of overall revenue for the retailer. "Wal-Mart's commitment to value pricing is driving traffic and growth in grocery and aggressive online strides are impacting comparable sales," Cowen & Co's senior research analyst Oliver Chen said in a note. Earnings per share was US$1 (RM4.33) for the quarter ended on April 30, exceeding the analysts' average estimate of US$0.96 (RM4.15), according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Consolidated net income fell to US$3.04bil (RM13.15bil) from US$3.08bil (RM13.33bil) due to a higher tax rate. Quarterly revenue rose 1.4% to US$117.5bil (RM508.34bil), slightly lower than analysts expectations of US$117.7bil (RM509.21bil) due to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales. Revenue grew 2.8% on a currency neutral basis. For the second quarter, Wal-Mart expects an increase of 1.5% to 2% in US same-store sales. It forecast earnings per share of US$1 to US$1.08 (RM4.67), against market expectations of US$1.07 (RM4.63). — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Facebook wins dismissal of US lawsuits linked to terrorism Microsoft to open Africa datacentres to seek edge in cloud push The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Family forced to live under flyover Chong Sin Woon: Sekinchan seat belongs to MCA Call to join biggest travel contest advertisement Latest News Cyberattacks prompt massive security spending surge Smartphones are causing short-sightedness, specialist claims In cashless Sweden, even God now takes collection via an app Can Amazon's latest Fire devices reignite the tablet market?

The device in question is the MediaPad T3 7.0 and it's sold at Walmart. The retailer is offering the tablet for $89. What's, however, worth mentioning is that you can't order the tablet online currently. The device's listing on Walmart's website says: "This item is only sold at a Walmart store."

Walmart heiress and Graduate School of Education alum Carrie Walton Penner ’97 has been elected to a five year term on the Board of Trustees. Penner, who is also chair of the board of directors at the Walton Foundation and an advocate for school choice, will start her term on June 1. “Carrie brings an extensive level of experience and an extraordinary depth of involvement in philanthropic educational organizations,” said Steven Denning MBA ’78, chair of the Board. Denning spoke highly of Penner, saying that she will provide an invaluable perspective. According to the Stanford Report, Penner has focused on education research and philanthropy for more than 20 years with an emphasis on “improving access to high-quality schools for every child, particularly those in low-income communities.” Much of this philanthropic work has directed funds toward charter schools. Penner is currently a board member of the KIPP Foundation and the Charter School Growth Fund, and was formerly a board member of the California Charter Schools Association. She was also a board member of the Alliance for School Choice — the largest U.S. organization supporting school choice, previously headed by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. School choice is an education policy proposal that aims to offer alternatives to the traditional public school system by, in some cases, providing vouchers from tax revenue to families to send their children to private or charter schools. The policy has recently come under scrutiny after the appointment of Secretary DeVos, an avid supporter of school choice. According to the Washington Post, the Walton Foundation donated over $6 million to the Alliance for School Choice in 2013, essentially doubling the organization’s budget. Previous Stanford research published by the Economic Policy Institute has found troubling effects of school choice. Graduate School of Education Professor Martin Carnoy examined research over 25 years across a variety of U.S. cities and states that have used voucher programs and discovered that vouchers not only fail to improve scores, but also do not cost less than traditional public education, as proponents commonly argue. In Milwaukee, for example, where the U.S.’s largest school voucher program has been ongoing for 20 years, black students have continued to rank last and second-to-last in math compared to 13 other urban school districts. (Black students make up 70 percent of the city’s voucher users). Meanwhile, Carnoy found that improvements in scores actually came from public pressure of publicizing the test results, which caused teachers to teach explicitly to the test. “There are many policy changes that are likely to have much higher payoffs than privatization,” Carnoy told Stanford News this February. Penner and her husband, Greg Penner MBA ’97, have also contributed to a variety of political campaigns over the years, including both the Hillary Clinton Victory Fund and Kasich for America, Inc. Elsewhere on campus, Penner is on the advisory council of the Graduate School of Education (GSE) and served on the school’s search committee for a new dean in the 2014-2015 school year. She and her husband are large donors to the Graduate School of Business, Stanford Athletics and the Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program. Penner will join a Board of Trustees that as of February 1 had 33 members. Board membership is limited to 38 individuals, and four more trustees are expected to be announced in the next year. According to the Alumni Association website, the Board makes decisions on topics such as “strategic allocation of resources, land use, academic programs, housing and other facility planning, regulatory responsibilities, federal and public support of education, community relations, minority affairs, audit and financial controls and fundraising planning.” Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Penner was formerly the director of the California Charter Schools Association; this is incorrect as Penner was a member of the board of directors.

Banks also recouped some of their losses. Energy and materials stocks fell. The rally came a day after the market's worst drop since September as political tumult deepened in Washington, stoking worries among investors that President Trump may have trouble enacting tax cuts and other business-friendly policies. "People may be wanting to put money to work in stocks, but the bonds they bought yesterday, they're still going to keep those as a little bit of a hedge, just in case," said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.69 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,365.72. The Dow Jones industrial average added 56.09 points, or 0.3 percent, to 20,663.02. The Nasdaq composite index gained 43.89 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,055.13. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks picked up 5.19 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,361.08. Bond prices slipped. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.23 percent from 2.22 percent. Despite the day's gains, the major stock indexes were still on course to end the week in the red. Stocks appeared headed for another down day early Thursday following sell-offs in Asia and Europe. But better-than-expected quarterly results from Wal-Mart Stores and retailers such as L Brands helped lift the market. Wal-Mart gained $2.42, or 3.2 percent, to $77.54, while L Brands rose $1.29, or 2.7 percent, to $49.69. Traders also welcomed data from the Labor Department showing that applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in nearly three months. Among other big movers: Incyte surged 6.9 percent on growing analyst optimism over the biopharmaceutical company's work developing cancer treatments. The stock gained $8.31 to $128.80. Benchmark U.S. crude oil futures rose 28 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $49.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, climbed 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, to settle at $52.51 a barrel in London. In other futures trading, natural gas fell 1 cent to $3.18 per 1,000 cubic feet. Wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.60 per gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.54 per gallon. In metals trading, the price of gold fell $5.90 to settle at $1,252.80 per ounce. Silver lost 24 cents to $16.67 per ounce. Copper slipped 2 cents to $2.53 per pound.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Original Nintendo NES Classic Controller In Stock At Amazon At Regular Price Posted: May 19 2017, 12:39am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The ultra hard to find Nintendo NES Classic Edition controller surfaces on Amazon in Germany. Weeks after Nintendo discontinued NES Classic Edition the original NES Classic controller surfaces. At some points the original NES controller auctioned off at prices that matched the console. For a while the controller was available for around $50 to $60. Now the German Amazon shop offers the original EU version of the Nintendo NES Classic controller for 12,99 Euro.  Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con in Stock Online The offer is direct from Amazon and not a reseller. This is a great opportunity for NES collectors or NES owners to complete their NES Classic with a second original controller. The difference between the EU version and the US version of the NES controller is only the package design. Officially the NES Classic Edition is history as of end of April, according to a Nintendo statement. A low numbers of stores still received inventory in early May. We have seen Walmart stores and Target stores and even a few GameStop stores receiving new NES Classic shipments in the first days of May. There are still one or two stores reported to have a new NES in stock on iStockNow. It is like winning the lottery at this point to be that lucky to live near a Walmart that received one NES unit. Now the only plausible way to buy a NES Classic console is from a reseller on eBay or Amazon. Reseller prices for the NES Classic have dropped despite the end of the NES. The lowest priced Nintendo NES Classic console sells for $233 plus shipping on amazon.com.  The reseller prices have been over $300 early April, right after the announcement that Nintendo stops making the NES Classic. Find all NES Classic offers and auctions on ebay.com as well as all marketplace offers on amazon.com. NES Classic Edition offers on ebay.com can be found at around $200. Modded NES Classic for over $300. eBay has 2,170 NES Classic offers listed.  The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. On April 13, Nintendo announced to stop production of the NES Classic Edition. Nintendo said that the last shipments of the NES Classic arrive through April. We keep spotting though the $59.99 NES Classic Edition in May. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest hack enables the NES Classic to store 2,500 games. The 80s retro console launched on November 11, 2016. As of Aprl 27, 2017, Nintendo has sold 2.3 million NES Classic Edition.

Revenues were up 1.4 percent at $117.5 billion.  But the initiative has produced gains in comparable store sales in the US, a closely-watched benchmark that rose 1.4 percent in the first quarter.  E-commerce sales surged 63 percent and merchandise volume saw a 69 percent jump.  Analysts at Global Data Retail said Wal-Mart's sharp focus on keeping prices down in grocery was winning some customers back and described growth in e-commerce as evidence of a business "in the ascendancy."  "Overall, this is an encouraging start to the year for Walmart," GlobalData Retail said in a research note. "This is one US retailer that is ahead of the curve in responding to the evolving landscape."  Shares of Wal-Mart rose 1.9 percent to $76.56 in mid-morning trading. In contrast, Macy's, Nordstrom and Dick's Sporting Goods all plunged after their earnings reports.  Wal-Mart has boosted its online offerings to 50 million items, up five fold from a year ago, said Marc Lore, president and CEO, Walmart eCommerce US.  The company introduced free two-day shipping for orders over $35 and discounts on non-store products if a customer picks it up at a store, an effort to exploit its network as it competes with Amazon and others.  "There's more product to buy, you're able to get the product quicker," Lore said on a conference call with reporters. "The overall experience is improving."  The gains followed a number of Wal-Mart acquisitions over the last year, although executives described the majority of the growth as "organic."  Wal-Mart's financial reports do not break out revenues for e-commerce sales.  Chief financial officer Brett Biggs said e-commerce is "still fairly small" within Wal-Mart's US business and there was no immediate plan to disclose more details about the business.    Wal-Mart sees gains in e-commerce, lifting shares Independent Online/AFP Wal-Mart Stores highlighted strong gainsin its e-commerce business that boosted US sales, winning plaudits from WallStreet on Thursday after other retailers released disappointing earnings.

Banks also recouped some of their losses. Energy and materials stocks fell. The rally came a day after the market's worst drop since September as political tumult deepened in Washington, stoking worries among investors that President Donald Trump may have trouble enacting tax cuts and other business-friendly policies. "People may be wanting to put money to work in stocks, but the bonds they bought yesterday, they're still going to keep those as a little bit of a hedge, just in case," said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.69 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,365.72. The Dow Jones industrial average added 56.09 points, or 0.3 percent, to 20,663.02. The Nasdaq composite index gained 43.89 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,055.13. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks picked up 5.19 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,361.08. Bond prices slipped. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.23 percent from 2.22 percent. Despite the day's gains, the major stock indexes were still on course to end the week in the red. Stocks appeared headed for another down day early Thursday after sell-offs in Asia and Europe. But better-than-expected quarterly results from Wal-Mart Stores and retailers such as L Brands helped lift the market. Wal-Mart gained $2.42, or 3.2 percent, to $77.54, while L Brands rose $1.29, or 2.7 percent, to $49.69. Among other big movers: Incyte surged 6.9 percent on growing analyst optimism over the biopharmaceutical company's work developing cancer treatments. The stock gained $8.31 to $128.80. Weak quarterly results from other companies sent those stocks lower. Ascena Retail Group sank 27 percent after the retailer cut its forecast for its fiscal third quarter and full year, citing lagging customer traffic and other challenges. The stock lost 76 cents to $2.06. Benchmark U.S. crude oil futures rose 28 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $49.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, climbed 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, to settle at $52.51 a barrel in London. In other futures trading, natural gas fell 1 cent to $3.18 per 1,000 cubic feet. Wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.60 per gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.54 per gallon. In metals trading, the price of gold fell $5.90 to settle at $1,252.80 per ounce. Silver lost 24 cents to $16.67 per ounce. Copper slipped 2 cents to $2.53 per pound. The euro slipped to $1.1101 from $1.1150 on Wednesday. The dollar strengthened to 111.49 yen from 111.11 yen. Major stock indexes overseas closed lower. In Europe, Germany's DAX was down 0.3 percent, while France's CAC 40 was 0.5 percent lower. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 0.9 percent. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slid 1.3 percent. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.6 percent.

Picture: Contributed martin flanagan Email 07:39 Friday 19 May 2017 Share this article 0 Have your say Supermarket giant Asda has reported another slide in quarterly sales, but its US parent Walmart insisted that the company was heading in the right direction. Asda, the second-largest food retailer in Scotland, saw same-floorspace sales fall 2.8 per cent in its first trading quarter. We are in no way complacent and there is still much for us to do Sean Clarke That marked the 11th quarter running of like-for-like revenue declines, but City analysts noted it was a slight improvement on the previous three months, which saw the retailer’s sales fall by 2.9 per cent. • READ MORE: Asda boss ‘encouraged’ despite fresh slump in sales Sean Clarke, Asda chief executive, said the group was pleased with increasing impetus, but that there remained a great deal to do to restore the its fortunes. He said: “We’re pleased that the momentum of the fourth quarter has continued into the new year with a third consecutive quarter of improvement. We’re delivering more consistently for our customers, ­particularly in fresh food, service and availability, both in stores and online.” But he added: “Despite this progress we are in no way complacent and there is still much for us to do.” Own an innovative start-up? Find out how to win £5,000 for your business Clarke, who replaced Andy Clarke as boss last summer, has slashed the prices of everyday items as he attempts to arrest falling sales. Last August, Asda posted its worst ever sales fall of 7.5 per cent. In response, it announced in September that it was lowering thousands of prices on ­everyday favourites by an average of 15 per cent, with items such as beef, chicken and sausages all becoming cheaper. Like its big three rivals, Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, the company has been fending off strong market share gains by the German discounters Lidl and and Aldi. • READ MORE: Sun shines on high street but outlook is unsettled Clarke has launched a new value campaign, That’s Better, which has seen Asda improve the quality of its own-brand ranges. In a trading update, Walmart said it is confident that Asda is “on the right track”. 200 Voices: find out more about the people who have shaped Scotland Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon said: “We’ve made some progress in the UK and the team is executing their plan. “We are navigating our way back to a position of strength in that highly competitive market. When normalising comp sales for the later Easter and Leap Day, we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket.” Kantar retailing consultancy data out this month showed that Asda’s market share fell to 15.6 per cent in the quarter to 23 April, down from 16 per cent. However, Kantar also said that Asda’s sales rose 0.8 per cent, its first same-floorspace revenues increase since October 2014. Brett Biggs, Walmart’s chief financial officer, told analysts: “When normalising for Leap Day last year and a later Easter this year, we continued to see sequential improvement in the underlying business, including customer traffic and ticket. We’re confident we’re on the right track.” Clarke added: “Participation in our award winning Own Brand ranges has increased as we focus on increasing its value and quality and make sure we are offering the right ranges for our customers. We were pleased to receive industry recognition for these ranges and our online service in recent weeks. “Our colleagues continue to make improvements for our customers and I want to thank them for their hard work.” Click here to ‘Like’ The Scotsman Business on Facebook Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

Seattlepi.com reported the company said Wednesday it will begin offering up to nine flights a day from Everett’s Paine Field. Alaska Airlines said in a news release that the plan would give travelers who live north of Seattle an option to catch flights closer to homes. The Seattle-­Tacoma International Airport is south of Seattle. If approved by the federal government, construction on a new terminal would start in June, with Propeller Airports and Snohomish County coordinating the effort. Flights will be offered on Boeing 737s and Embraer 175s. Alaska said it will announce routes, schedules and start selling tickets early next year, with flights slated to start in the fall. Nation Walmart sees surge both online and in stores BENTONVILLE, Ark. — Walmart saw online sales surge and more shoppers at its stores as well, as retail overall is more competitive. The world’s largest retailer beat Wall Street estimates and delivered another solid gain in sales at established stores. Walmart also saw higher customer traffic, while major retailers like Macy’s and Target had declines. Firm: Women outperform men in investments NEW YORK — Many men and women think men are the better investors. They’re wrong. After checking how 8 million of its customers did during 2016, Fidelity Investments found that women did better than men by an average of 0.4 percentage points. The difference in performance is small, and it’s always dangerous to make big generalizations out of small slices of data. But it slots in with other research that suggests women tend to take a longer-term view of investing.

Facebook launches war on clickbait headlines Facebook on Thursday launched an assault designed to crack down on clickbait headlines, in a push to banish “fake news” from its news feeds. Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook noted that in 2016, the social network updated its news feed to reduce stories from sources that consistently post clickbait headlines that withhold and exaggerate information, Facebook said. “Publishers that rely on clickbait headlines should expect their distribution to decrease,” Facebook stated in the blog post. — News service reports More Business articles »     RG Business Local business news sent to your inbox every Thursday.         Today’s Business stories Business Victims calling hackers’ bluff Business Some states still struggling to recover from recession Business Appeals court rejects drone registration rule Business NAFTA rewrite worries farmers Business Laws aim to ban questions about salary history Business Labor secretary calls for more apprenticeships Business Business Highlights     Local Weather Hot, sunny spell forecast for Willamette Valley for early next week Hot hot hot!

(James Young/CBC) Calgary police have determined that a body found in a silver SUV parked outside the McKenzie Towne Walmart Thursday afternoon is not a suspicious death.  Just before 4:30 p.m., police were called to check on the welfare of a man in a vehicle in the parking lot in the 4700 block of 130th Avenue S.E. When EMS arrived, the man was declared deceased. The scene was cordoned off and the medical examiner called out, as is standard protocol in all death investigations. Police at first called it an "undetermined death" but on Friday said it was not being treated as suspicious.  Police have designated it an 'undetermined death' at this point.

Keep me logged in I forgot my password No Thanks Briefing highlights A noxious mix for markets North Korea: ‘This time it’s different’ Trump triggers NAFTA coundown Wal-Mart comparable sales beat estimates A noxious mix It’s hard to keep track of the fast-moving events in the Washington circus, what with all the elephants, clowns and lions. But one thing is clear: Add North Korea to the turmoil, and it’s a fairly noxious mix for investors. As The Globe and Mail’s Tim Shufelt reports, stocks plunged Wednesday as the word “impeachment” was heard among politicians and market analysts, raising questions about whether investors will ever see the fiscal and economic reforms promised by President Donald Trump’s young administration. “At this point, one could hardly imagine a worse scenario than an eventual Trump impeachment for the markets,” said London Capital Group senior market analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya. Even though it’s obviously too soon to predict what could unfold, “if Donald Trump is impeached, his massive infrastructure spending plans and the colossal tax reforms would never see the daylight,” she added. “Hence, the past six months’ reflation rally would face severe reversal risks. If the markets were to retrace the Trump-reflation gains, this would trigger a decent ‘deflation’ squeeze.” Stocks are down again today in Asia and Europe, though recovering in North America. The Canadian dollar was at about 73.5 cents (U.S.) by mid-morning. “The row between Mr. Trump and the FBI is still on traders’ minds, and while this is hanging over the market I can’t see sentiment changing anytime soon,” said CMC Markets analyst David Madden. “Traders will be reluctant to open up new long positions while there is talk of Trump being impeached. I would classify today as a risk-off session as traders appear to be in wait-and-see mode. There are bargains to be had out there, but dealers would be taking on excessive risk by buying in now.” Here’s what other observers are saying: “We believe that too much of the discussion around the latest disputed events is caught in a political maelstrom and partisan views get meshed into investment recommendations. Thus, we would be careful not to use emotional responses and personal likes and dislikes to arrive at conclusions ... We see the market’s pullback as rational but we would not get overly anxious about it in view of a 2,560 mid-year 2018 S&P 500 target.” Tobias Levkovich, Lorraine Schmitt and Jennifer Stahmer, Citigroup Global Markets “The big question now is whether this turns out to be the start along a road to an impeachment process or whether this is another bump in the road. Depending on how events play out over the next few days, that planned rate rise for the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is due next month, might well have to be put firmly on the back burner.” Michael Hewson, CMC Markets “What we do know is this bout of risk aversion is certainly about a giant push back on the future of tax reform and Trump’s ability to deliver (anything) has been dealt a massive blow given the level and magnitude of controversies in play ... The moves in financial markets have been brutal, not because of the absolute size of the move, but specifically because of the size of the move after a prolonged period of such subdued implied volatility.” Chris Weston, IG More on this topic Follow our Inside the Market blog Tim Shufelt: Deflating the 'hope rally' Joanna Slater, Adrian Morrow: Former FBI chief named to probe links between Trump, Russia Dan Bortolotti: A lesson from Wednesday's plunge Trump asked Comey to shut down Flynn probe: memo Joanna Slater: Trump engulfed by new crisis Watch Pyongyang Investors may be fretting over the chaos in Washington, and with good reason. But they should keep a wary eye on Pyongyang at the same time, also with good reason. As Citigroup Global Markets put it in a report on North Korea and the potential for market turmoil: “This time it’s different.” “Financial markets need to care: It is tough to price anything other than higher volatility in the short term, but there are clear risks to supply chains and to global confidence, as well as implications for capital flows that could upset market equilibria,” said the report led by Joanna Chua, Citi’s head of Asia-Pacific economic analysis, with her colleagues at the big U.S. bank. The Citi team gave four reasons for why the tensions surrounding North Korea and Kim Jong-un are a bigger threat now than in past episodes, and laid out five scenarios, the base case being that everyone shows “restraint.” There are scarier scenarios, as well, given that Kim Jong-un is “likely more insecure and, thus, more unpredictable” than his father. Why it’s different this time The Citi report is lengthy, and the analysis deep, so I can’t do it justice here. But that unpredictability tops the list of the four reasons why. The others: Scariest of all is the reason that goes far beyond the markets: “Technological breakthroughs in North Korea’s ballistic missile program which may be approaching ICBM capabilities.” But there’s also the “more unpredictable foreign policy” of the Trump administration, which means you have unpredictability meeting unpredictability. And finally, according to Citi, China “may be willing to live with a nuclear North Korea rather than risk having a failed state at its doorstep.” The scenarios “We have little faith that diplomacy can succeed in shifting the negotiating positions of different parties,” the Citi analysts said, warning that ongoing tensions are probable. “Tighter sanctions may need be pursued, and the regime may test the resolve of the U.S. and China, instead.” The first scenario, the base case, as noted, would see everyone involved showing restraint, but “with the help of sanctions threats.” The second scenario, which Citi described as a reasonable probability, envisions North Korea launching a sixth nuclear test but that it later “caves in to sanctions pressures.” Actual sanctions don’t work that often, the bank added. Scenario 3 – low probability – sees the Trump administration in “carefully targeted military strikes” as a response to a sixth test. Number 4 – thankfully, very low probability – is for “all-out military conflict, impacting Seoul and/or Tokyo.” The final scenario would see “a return to diplomacy with a multilateral framework.” Potential market fallout “A negative demand shock is unlikely to be contained to North Asia and could spill over globally,” said Ms. Chua and her colleagues. “A global growth or oil shock is possible on any significant escalation.” The first scenario sees little economic impact as “fundamentals continue to remain stable.” As does the fifth scenario. Number 2 could see a “short-term rise in risk aversion,” though investors could grow more troubled than in the past should Washington raise the temperature through rhetoric or if sanctions are too harsh. As Scenario 3 sees an escalation, so too would the fallout be greater, with “a significant blow to confidence and economic performance, especially in South Korea and Japan who bear the brunt of risks from possible North Korean retaliatory strikes.” All bets are off under the fourth scenario. “Any attack on populous civilian centres in either South Korea or Japan would have a significant economic impact, with a recession the likely result for both, and dramatic ripple effects would be seen globally,” Citi said. “Japan and South Korea account for 8.4 per cent of global GDP and 6.9 per cent of global trade, and as any significant conflict will involve the world’s two largest economies, the U.S. and China, given their respective security guarantees with South and North Korea, respectively, a serious geopolitical event in the Korean peninsula will likely be a source of systemic risk globally.” More on this topic South Korea says 'high possibility' of conflict with North North Korea missile program progressing faster than expected: South Korea Trump triggers NAFTA countdown President Donald Trump’s administration has triggered the 90-day countdown to the renegotiation of the North American free-trade agreement, setting the stage for talks to begin in earnest in mid-August, our Washington correspondent Adrian Morrow reports. United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer sent the long-delayed formal notice to Congress that the administration plans to reopen NAFTA on Thursday morning. Now, the administration must wait 90 days before starting formal talks with Canada and Mexico. “Today, President Trump fulfilled one of his key promises to the American people,” he said in a statement. For years, politicians have called for the renegotiation of this agreement, but President Trump is the first to follow through with that promise.

Nandita Bose Chicag — Reuters Published Thursday, May 18, 2017 7:36AM EDT Last updated Thursday, May 18, 2017 1:50PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores, as investments to bring more customers into the discount retailer paid off and a bigger push into e-commerce boosted online purchases, sending its shares flirting near a 52-week high. Wal-Mart and analysts said the company is benefiting from a $2.7-billion investment to increase entry-level wages and enhance the training of its workforce, which has led to better stocked shelves and cleaner stores. It said store visits rose 1.5 per cent, the tenth consecutive quarterly increase. Earlier in the day, shares of Wal-Mart rose to $77.40 – a 52-week high. They were trading at $77 in mid-day. Wal-Mart’s efforts to close the gap with rival Amazon.com has started gaining momentum even as other retailers like department store chains struggle. Online sales for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer rose 63 per cent in the first quarter, which was higher than 29 per cent growth in the fourth quarter and 20 per cent in the third quarter. Online sales added 0.8 percentage points to the first quarter comparable sales gain. Growth in the business has been picking up after Wal-Mart said in October it would slow down new store openings to focus on expanding its e-commerce business. U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore told reporters in a call that online sales growth was boosted by offering free two-day shipping without membership fees, and higher repeat orders. “We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we’re capable of,” said Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon. The company said most of the internet sales growth was from existing online operations rather than from acquisitions. Wal-Mart, which acquired Jet.com in 2016, this year alone has snatched up online retail startups Shoebuy, Moosejaw and Modcloth, and is currently in talks with small online clothing retailer Bonobos. “Wal-Mart’s long string of investments in labor and e-commerce, including acquisitions, are enabling modest market share gains,” John Zolidis, director equity research with the Buckingham Research Group said. Wal-Mart’s performance, along with rival Target’s results on Wednesday, bucked a string of weak results from retailers Macy’s Inc and J.C. Penney. Target reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings and sales. Wal-Mart said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.4 per cent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, and was the 11th consecutive quarterly increase. Analysts were expecting a 1.3 per cent increase, according to Consensus Metrix. Wal-Mart is aggressively investing in making prices more competitive compared to rivals. It has asked vendors to offer grocery prices that are 15 per cent lower than competitors. Wal-Mart’s U.S. Chief Executive Greg Foran said comparable sales in food and grocery improved during the quarter on lower food deflation, without sharing details. Grocery accounts for nearly 53 per cent of overall revenue for the retailer. “Wal-Mart’s commitment to value pricing is driving traffic and growth in grocery and aggressive online strides are impacting comparable sales,” Cowen & Co’s senior research analyst Oliver Chen said in a note. Earnings per share was $1 for the quarter ended on April 30, exceeding the analysts’ average estimate of 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Consolidated net income fell to $3.04-billion from $3.08-billion due to a higher tax rate. Quarterly revenue rose 1.4 per cent to $117.5-billion, slightly lower than analysts expectations of $117.7-billion due to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales. Revenue grew 2.8 per cent on a currency neutral basis. For the second quarter, Wal-Mart expects an increase of 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent in U.S. same-store sales. It forecast earnings per share of $1 to $1.08, against market expectations of $1.07.

(WDRB) – Hundreds of people walk through the doors of the Scottsburg Walmart every day, but it was two specific trips to the store Wednesday that left one family with an uneasy feeling. “In the girl's section by the underwear, there was a gentleman who seemed out of place,” said one Scottsburg mother who asked us not to use her name. She went on to say that what happened to her family member two hours later in a trip back to the store solidified that uneasy feeling. “As she was walking by the baby section where the diapers were, this man was still there and instantly she got chills all over her body,” she said. Both times, the man was seen hanging around children's underwear and diaper sections. “He would kind of take a lap, and he would kind of mosey through, and he really didn't have a purpose," the woman said. "He wasn't looking for something specific. He was just kind of hovering." Other families have made similar complaints of a strange man at that Walmart. One mother said a man offered her daughter candy, and when she told the man no, he got aggressive. Police say the man is believed to have a gold car, and they’ve been given the description of a heavy man with tinted sunglasses. Meanwhile, Walmart says it's taking the reports seriously and sent us this statement: "The safety and security of our associates and customers is a top priority. We are looking into the situation and will work with local law enforcement as necessary." But until it's resolved, Scottsburg mothers are warning everyone to be vigilant. “It does make you feel scared, because you don't know what someone might do,” one mom said. “ And like I said -- mom's intuition. If something sets your alarm off and gives you goosebumps, then there's probably something to it.” If you notice any suspicious activity, you’re asked to call police. Copyright 2017 WDRB Media.

Banks also recouped some of their losses. Energy and materials stocks fell. The rally came a day after the market’s worst drop since September as political tumult deepened in Washington, stoking worries among investors that President Donald Trump may have trouble enacting tax cuts and other business-friendly policies. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 8.69 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,365.72. The Dow Jones industrial average added 56.09 points, or 0.3 percent, to 20,663.02. The Nasdaq composite index gained 43.89 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,055.13. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks picked up 5.19 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,361.08. Bond prices slipped. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.23 percent from 2.22 percent. Despite the day’s gains, the major stock indexes were still on course to end the week in the red. Stocks appeared headed for another down day early Thursday following sell-offs in Asia and Europe. But better-than-expected quarterly results from Wal-Mart Stores and retailers such as L Brands helped lift the market. Wal-Mart gained $2.42, or 3.2 percent, to $77.54, while L Brands rose $1.29, or 2.7 percent, to $49.69. Traders also welcomed data from the Labor Department showing that applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in nearly three months. Among other big movers: Incyte surged 6.9 percent on growing analyst optimism over the biopharmaceutical company’s work developing cancer treatments. The stock gained $8.31 to $128.80. Weak quarterly results from other companies sent those stocks lower. Ascena Retail Group sank 27 percent after the retailer cut its forecast for its fiscal third quarter and full year, citing lagging customer traffic and other challenges. The stock lost 76 cents to $2.06. Cisco Systems fell 7.2 percent a day after the internet gear maker said it expects revenue in its fiscal third quarter to be down from a year earlier. The company also said it was laying off 1,100 workers in addition to the 5,500 job cuts Cisco announced last August. The stock gave up $2.44 to $31.38. Benchmark U.S. crude oil futures rose 28 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $49.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, climbed 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, to settle at $52.51 a barrel in London. In other futures trading, natural gas fell 1 cent to $3.18 per 1,000 cubic feet. Wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.60 per gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.54 per gallon. In metals trading, the price of gold fell $5.90 to settle at $1,252.80 per ounce. Silver lost 24 cents to $16.67 per ounce. Copper slipped 2 cents to $2.53 per pound. The euro slipped to $1.1101 from $1.1150 on Wednesday. The dollar strengthened to 111.49 yen from 111.11 yen. Major stock indexes overseas closed lower. In Europe, Germany’s DAX was down 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC 40 was 0.5 percent lower. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 0.9 percent. In Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index slid 1.3 percent. South Korea’s Kospi lost 0.3 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 0.6 percent.

Stocks are modestly higher in early trading on Wall Street, Thursday, May 18, 2017, as traders were relieved to see some positive results from retailers. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Posted: Thursday, May 18, 2017 4:29 pm | Updated: 6:27 pm, Thu May 18, 2017. Asian shares mostly lower on Trump, Brazil worries Associated Press | 0 comments TOKYO (AP) — Asian stocks were mostly lower Friday as investor worries remained about the U.S. political turmoil over an investigation into possible Russian coordination with President Donald Trump's campaign. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 0.2 percent to 19,510.96 in morning trading. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged down nearly 0.5 percent to 5,711.10. South Korea's Kospi was little changed at 2,287.30. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was virtually unchanged at 25,131.74. The Shanghai Composite slipped nearly 0.1 percent to 3,087.38. BRAZIL FACTOR: Markets are also being shaken by a deepening political crisis in Brazil, where President Michel Temer is facing calls for his resignation amid allegations of corruption. Stocks and the currency have plunged there. U.S. FACTOR: U.S. shares rallied, partly cheered by a positive report jobs data, but it followed the worst drop in eight months. Fears are growing recently Trump may have trouble enacting tax cuts and other business-friendly policies. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.69 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,365.72. The Dow Jones industrial average added 56.09 points, or 0.3 percent, to 20,663.02. The Nasdaq composite index gained 43.89 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,055.13. THE QUOTE: "Given the heightened level of uncertainty, I suspect traders will remain in a kind of Investor Purgatory where risk aversion dominates and fear mounts that the investigation could open up a whole new can of worms which will do little more than compound the markets current panic syndrome," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude oil futures added 32 cents to $49.67 a barrel. It rose 28 cents to $49.35 a barrel in New York Thursday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, climbed 40 cents to $52.91 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The euro slipped to $1.1112 from $1.1153 late Thursday in Asia.

Unsuspecting Walmart customer takes down startled deer May 19, 2017 Updated 2 hrs ago (…) Courtesy of Stephanie L Kolionen Tom Grasswick, a customer at a Walmart store in Wadena, holds onto a confused white-tailed deer that wandered into the store. Grasswick and others managed to remove the animal and set it free outdoors. WADENA, Minn. — A confused white-tailed deer that wandered into a Walmart store in Minnesota ran into a startled customer who tackled the animal to the ground. Shoppers at the store in Wadena, speculated that the young animal was searching for a snack Tuesday when it entered the store through the garden center doors. Tom Grasswick, who happens to live in Deer Creek, said he felt like someone had slugged him when the deer slammed into him. Grasswick said his first instinct was to tackle the animal, bringing it down on a pallet of dog food. "I figured I was bigger than the deer so I'd win that wrestling match," Grasswick said. Grasswick covered the deer's eyes to calm it down, and he and others took the animal outside and set it free. After consulting with local law enforcement it appears Walmart has made some adjustments in its garden center door policies. It appears the deer won't become a repeat customer. What's your reaction?

Josh Chapin, KHOU 10:46 PM. CDT May 19, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST HOUSTON - A local Constable's own wife almost fell victim to a shopping scam. Jennifer Rosen thought she was signing up for a legitimate mystery shopping experience but the instructions she received were not legitimate. In the mail on Friday, she got a check for nearly $3,000 as well as instructions with what to do with that check. "The packaging looks pretty real," said Rosen, wife of Constable Alan Rosen of Harris County Precinct One. "I love to shop so I got kind of curious and I sent my name and address; that's all it requires." Rosen believed she was enrolling in a behind-the-scenes program for WalMart, where the company would pay her to go into a store and then evaluate it on a customer service level before giving them feedback. "I keep getting these emails you know so I thought I'm just going to see what it is, so now I know," she said. She believed the scammers would expect her to take the check, put it into her bank account and transfer money as instructed to various different people. She told her husband, Constable Alan Rosen, about it. "When people receive things that look legitimate and everything looks okay, you have to go the extra mile to verify things," Constable Rosen said. Just to be 100 percent certain, the Rosen family went to a local BBVA Friday to try and cash the check. A teller at the bank told them the check wasn't real. Now, the couple wants to put the word out to warn others.  "No one is sending you a check in the mail that you really didn't know was coming without there being some type of a hook," Constable Rosen said. There are legitimate companies that do mystery shopping but most experts say most legitimate ones ask you to register as an evaluator first. Constable Rosen said he's going to try and track down whoever is responsible for this. He urges everyone to report something like this to law enforcement as soon as possible. © 2017 KHOU-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Officer accused of dismissing tickets in exchange for teen's nude photos 14-year-old arrested for sexual assault FBI raid at hospice on Houston's south side Elderly woman killed by hit-and-run driver in the Heights Police: 1 dead in single-vehicle accident in South Houston Robbery suspects found hiding inside Dekaney HS Strip mall fire kills six-year fire fighter veteran, Scott Deem Man falls over edge at Topgolf in Fort Worth Sexual assault suspect in The Woodlands sought Condolences pour in for softball player in Forney More Stories Woman: Husband beaten, hogtied in violent home invasion May 19, 2017, 11:41 p.m. Wanted sexual assault suspect linked to case from 2013 May 19, 2017, 3:06 p.m. Hit-and-run driver kills 91-year-old woman in the Heights May 19, 2017, 4:43 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Fidget spinners are just the latest dull, mind-numbing toy—a trend caused by economic forces, with consequences for kids Adrian Lee May 4, 2017 Follow @AdrianKLee Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   Fidget spinners. (Revo Toys) Children’s toys are typically not so exciting; they’re often riffs off the latest big movie or TV show, or gussied-up versions of old reliable games and toys. But the latest toy fad might just leave your head spinning. Fidget spinners—a tripartite ball bearing studded with three weights that reels around with a flick of the finger, intended as tools offering relief to those with ADHD—have been co-opted as the latest toy trend, found pinched in the hands of kids around the world. In the last few months, they’ve become ubiquitous among the younger set regardless of attention span, turned into toys as videos of fidget spinner tricks and Reddit communities gain fans in the thousands; they’ve been banned in swaths of schools; studies have been issued and rebutted over whether kids without ADHD playing with fidget spinners are actually productive in increasing focus in classrooms. As of the time of publishing, 19 of the 20 most popular toys on Amazon are fidget toys. FROM TODAY’S PARENT: Why teachers hate fidget toys Let it first be said that the retroactive justifications from parents and scientists that the spinner may improve focus for all kids—that somehow giving a child a toy helps them do one thing easier—feels like someone endorsing weeks-old takeout, just because it didn’t give you food poisoning last time. Let it also be said that trusting kids in their claims that toys help them focus is a child-pushed argument that’s so brazen that 12-year-old me—who would lay out my case to my parents that buying Pokemon cards was actually some kind of fiduciary investment with the potential for high returns on the resale market—can’t help but stand and applaud. But its role as a focus-stealer isn’t the fidget spinner’s true sin. It’s that they are mind-numbingly boring. Ball-bearing tools have been around since ancient Rome. They’re in your boring computers; they’re in your boring engines; they’re in your boring bikes, and your boring kitchen appliances. If we’re co-opting basic tools as toys, we might as well just rebrand them into Riveting Rivets and Ronnie the Wrench so kids can get to work in literal Fun Factories. Even the argument that they are effective productivity devices actually hinges on the idea that they are boring—the physical equivalent of a white noise machine. Here is an adult man, in one of the more popular YouTube videos about fidget spinners, forlornly considering what went wrong with his life to get him to this place. But fidget spinners are really just the latest in a long line of boring toy trends to dominate kids’ minds. Before the spinning whirr came the incessant kerplunk of kids trying to flip plastic bottles with a little water in them so they landed upright; though the bottles were half-full, the spirit of the activity was surely half-empty. Before that, there were hoverboards—massive deceptions, given that they were just non-hovering segways made more dangerous by the deletion of a support pole—and, of course, Hatchimals, lauded by the industry, with awards like the 2017 Innovative Toy Of The Year award at the prestigious New York Toy Fair. But even they were just a massive coup of rebranding, a more irritating Kinder Surprise without any of the pleasures of eating chocolate that basically becomes a Furby. And once it’s born, the Hatchimal just makes needy demands that require disproportionate time and energy. Where’s the fun in that? (On this, parents might feel some common ground.) MORE: The lessons for investors in the hype and fall of Hatchimals But there’s more here than the mere fact that I, an ostensible adult, can’t get behind toys for kids these days. There’s a greater potential cost—one that’s much less an indictment of our children, and says more about the lack of innovation and creativity in the industries helping to shape their young minds. After all, a vast array of studies show that playing—an act that will invariably involve toys—fosters social and cognitive skills, while cultivating creativity and imagination among younger children. And according to a report from Sarah M. Fine, of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, “intellectual playfulness” remains a valuable thing to cultivate for high-school aged students, often the ones playing with water bottles and spinners. “Playful learning in adolescence is certainly not the same thing as playful learning in early childhood … But this does not mean that it is any less important,” she writes. “To the contrary, finding ways to support adolescent learners in learning playfully is more critical because it is less intuitive.” Kids’ toys should meet these needs—to encourage creativity, to focus on play value, to be better. “When I was designing toys, I would either go for something that was emotionally endearing to a child, or have play value—and ideally, I always wanted to have my toys teach kids something,” says Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm, whose own creations include the popular Beauty and the Beast Magic Mirror and who was a leading marketer of Crazy Bones. “Do these spinners teach kids anything? I’m not sure.” The fact that current toys aren’t doing that is a reflection of ongoing shifts in the toy industry, he says. Physical toys are appealing to a narrower slice of children as iPads and apps are introduced to younger and younger kids, says Fromm: “They outgrow the concept of having a physical toy earlier.” That trend hasn’t spurred significant changes to how toys are sold, either; a small concentration of toy creators and distributors is actually working to staunch true toy innovation to meet these evolving terms, much in the way that major movie studios are content to produce sequel after sequel, loath to try new things when comfortable profits are at stake. “I’ve created many toys, and I would take them to the executive panel of Toys R’ Us and Walmart, and if they weren’t going to buy that product, that product wasn’t going to get made—there was no point,” says Fromm. “Doesn’t mean the toy wasn’t good, it just means the big-box stores weren’t going to support it, and now everything has to be vetted by all the big players—Hasbro, Mattel, Spinmaster.” And so, with the industry centralizing into a few massive leaders—a 2013 report found that the top five U.S. toy companies hold more than 50 per cent of the market—companies producing physical toys are now leaning more than ever on the success of a strong few. When Mattel reported declining revenues in 2014, its CEO was clear about why: “We just didn’t sell enough Barbie dolls.” Kelly Ingram reacts while receiving a Hatchimal, a top toy of the season, at Walmart’s Black Friday event in Bentonville, AR on Nov. 24, 2016. (Gunnar Rathbun/AP Images for Walmart) Indeed, the fact that the market remains loaded with toys that are specific to boys and girls—homemaking toys and princess dolls advertised to girls, cars and industrious construction toys for boys—is tied into the forces behind the innovation drain. Despite studies suggesting that targeted toys helps hem boys and girls into prescribed gender roles by influencing career choices, those big-box stores are only now seeing the capitalist value of challenging those stereotypes. Indeed, the first offerings from Debbie Stirling, the founder of GoldieBlox—now one of the industry’s hottest names, selling toys aimed at inspiring an affection for sciences among girls—were rebuffed by bigwigs at the New York Toy Fair, the make-or-break hub and haven for the latest in toy trends. “They said girls don’t like engineering. Girls don’t like building. That’s a boy play pattern. Girls want to be princesses, they want to play fashion. Go look at the pink aisle,” she said in an interview with Public Radio International. There is one upside, perhaps, to at least the fidget spinner and the water-bottle flipping: it seems bad toys are forcing kids to find fun in other ways, like finding water (or in this case, flipped water bottles) in the desert. It feels like an active outgrowth of actual toys failing to make a mark on youth, causing kids to make do with what they have around—empty bottles, cheap ball-bearings—rather than the staid items being marketed at them. And it might be something the toy industry should consider as a warning sign; while toy sales continue to grow—Canada’s sales rose six per cent, to just over $2 billion—the actually number of toys sold are roughly flat, a quiet sign of a deteriorating market. It represents a disruption to the field that could loosen the grip of those big-box retail stores—and make innovation easier to achieve. After all, a non-toy improvisation was the initial inspiration for the original fidget spinner, created by a Florida inventor who was injured while caring for her young daughter. “I couldn’t pick up her toys or play with her much at all, so I started throwing things together with newspaper and tape then other stuff,” she said in The Guardian. “It wasn’t really even prototyping, it was some semblance of something, she’d start playing with it in a different way, I’d repurpose it.” Maybe that’s the best way to spin this latest trend—that children, failed by an unadventurous toy industry, have turned tchotchkes into playthings, so they can play on anyway. And good for them. After all, we must move forward, not backward; upward, and always twirling, twirling, twirling toward innovation.

CAse's President, Tom Dolan, was on hand Friday night at ARM & HAMMER Park to celebrate Pork Roll Night, and announce the River Fest. The annual event, which will be held on September 30 from 12-5 p.m., will feature the Case's Pork Roll Eating Championship, won by Joey Chestnut the last two years. The Thunder and Case's Pork Roll have seen their partnership grow stronger each year. The 2018 season, which will see the Thunder host the Eastern League All-Star Game and Case's sponsor the Home Run Derby, will be a time for both businesses (and the city of Trenton) to shine. "It means the world to us to partner up with such a great organization," Dolan said. "They have been a mainstay here for 24 years. Mayor (Eric) Jackson has just been tremendous with us. Anything we need, he has always been there to help us. "We love Trenton, and we want to stay in Trenton." Mayor Jackson was on hand as well Friday night, and he spoke glowingly about two jewels of the capital city. "Certainly, Case's Pork Roll is critically important to Trenton," Jackson said. "Just today, I had a few young entrepreneurs in the city. I was telling them about the great history of Trenton, how long they have been here, and what they mean to the economic engine of our city. "How they are now continuing to grow and expand, and the work that they do to support the children of our city, similar to the Trenton Thunder. This partnership that they have here continues to do the same. "What Tom is doing, not only to help the city of Trenton, but he is partnering with the Thunder. He is making a difference in the community. We do a Pork Roll Festival in the city, and it is amazing for the people that have not been introduced to pork roll. "But equal to that is the Pork Roll Eating Contest that they have here. I came out last year, and it was phenomenal to see the contestants, but also the number of people that came out to enjoy that event. It goes hand in hand. "They are great partners together. Certainly the city of Trenton is glad to partner with Case's Pork Roll, not only to have that outstanding business in our city, but they help generate additional economic activity in our city, and development as well." Dolan has been involved on the local baseball scene for more than two decades. He was an assistant coach for Nottingham High School, and also with the Bordentown Post 26 American Legion team that broke the stranglehold of Hamilton Post 31 in the Mercer County American Legion League. So becoming so involved with the Thunder was optimal. "It is definitely top of the list," Dolan said. "We have been growing with them, with our sponsorship. It has been a good fit for both Case's Pork Roll and the Trenton Thunder. "The 2018 All-Star game is going to be a showcase event, for Trenton and for Case's Pork Roll too. It is going to be huge to be a part of that, and we are really excited to partner up with the Trenton Thunder. It is going to be great." Mike Ford heads to Triple A Scranton; 5 reasons for the Thunder's hot start Ronald Herrera did not have his best stuff of the season Thursday night, but it was enough to power the Thunder (24-14) to a three-game road sweep of New Hampshire. Herrera (4-0 with a 1.14 ERA on the season in four starts) worked through the 90-plus degree temperatures to go 5.1 innings, before he left the game in the 9-2 Thunder victory. Trenton manager Bobby Mitchell spoke about his fight to get as far into the contest as he could without his best stuff. "He wasn't as sharp as he normally is," Mitchell said. "His breaking ball wasn't as sharp, but he gets by because he is able to command the ball and not walk anybody. So he gave up a two-run homer. "I think he got tired, too, because it was 94. He started to feel the heat a little bit, not pitching as much as the other guys have. Then he just let a curveball get away from him and gave up a two-run homer. "He was a little up in the zone. But he makes adjustments well, and throws strikes. He lets his defense work, and we did. He only gave up the two runs, which is good." *** Friday night, Domingo Acevedo made his Double A debut, as the Thunder hosted Portland in the first of a three-game set. The number 12 prospect in the New York Yankees system has a devastating fastball, which sits anywhere from the upper-90's to 100 miles per hour.  Contact Sean Miller at seanmillertrentontimes@gmail.com. Follow him on Twitter @TheProdigalSean View Comments nj.com About Us About NJ.com Advertise with us Contact Us Jobs at NJ Advance Media Newsletters Frequently Asked Questions More on NJ.com Interact Weather Site map Claim your free business listing Sponsor Content Search Place an ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Post a job Post a free classified ad Apartments & rentals NJ.com Sections N.J.

So, I began. The first newsletter I read from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) would almost have me on the verge of tears. I'm not the one in my family who cries easily. My older sister does, but the EDF article "Trial by fire" brought me very close to angry tears. On a day that usually makes Americans proud and happy, too many of us weren't. - Advertisement - On this day--January 20, 2017--Donald Trump became our president. If that wasn't bad enough, on this same day at high noon, EPA's climate website went dark. What a terrible way to start a presidency by showing contempt for an environmental agency. EDF staffers had been alerted to this happening, and their legal team kicked into gear. They filed a request with the EPA under the Freedom of Information Act to restore public access to data. The Trump administration's attempt to conceal the truth was thwarted by their timely action. This set in motion a legal process to ensure the preservation of health and air-pollution data. General Counsel Vickie Patton observed: "During these extraordinary times, the law is our strongest ally." Then, four days later, rumors spread that there was a plan to permanently take down all climate-related material from the EPA's website. But EDF attorneys Peter Zalzal and Martha Roberts put together a team of over a dozen young attorneys and legal fellows to address this fear. Together they huddled around their laptops in EDF offices in Boulder, CO, and Washington, D.C. They managed to download data sets to ensure that climate information compiled over the years wasn't lost. I believe we owe this group a debt of gratitude. Zalzal observed "This scientific data is the foundation for sound environment and health policy. To eliminate it would be unprecedented." Thankfully, because of their timely work and the work of others, the administration backed off. - Advertisement - It is good to know that we have these environmental lawyers defending the public interest. They oppose any retreat from the Paris Climate Agreement. They even have managed to convince companies like Walmart that environmental protection pays. Walmart has been an EDF partner for more than ten years, and they have pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by one billion tons by 2030. The EDF has also done considerable environmental work in some states. With their help, Illinois passed a law that will double the state's renewable energy by 2030 and cut power-sector carbon pollution by more than half. In Ohio they have succeeded in urging Governor John Kasich to veto a bill that would have gutted energy efficiency and renewable investments in the state and cost at least 80,000 jobs. In New York they helped win approval of a new rate plan for its major electric utility, which will increase energy-efficiency funding and other incentives for electric vehicles. California enacted the clean cars law in 2002 with backing from EDF. In 2006 they passed landmark legislation co-sponsored by EDF that is lowering emissions even as the state's economy flourishes. Yes, my coffee table is still groaning under the weight of too much mail and reading material, but I'm glad that I took the time to learn about the wonderful, needful work of EDF.

Travis Scott — who was arrested for inciting a riot, disorderly conduct, and endangering the welfare of a minor at a “Birds Eye View” concert in Arkansas on Saturday (May 13) — has pled not guilty in the case, according to The Associated Press. He’s been accused of urging fans to “rush the stage” during the concert at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in the city of Rogers, but Scott’s lawyer Drew Ledbetter says he was simply trying to “put on a good show.” Nevertheless, the incident reportedly resulted in multiple injuries. A security guard and police officer were among those hurt by the alleged chaos that ensued at the event. The arrest has also inspired a limited edition T-shirt. The “Free the Rage” tee, which features Travis’ mugshot on the front, is priced at $45 and will only be available for 48 hours, according to his website. FREE THE RAGE TEE https://t.co/gBBgwrgtfx ONLY S COUPLE HOURS LEFT — TRAVIS SCOTT (@trvisXX) May 19, 2017 It’s not the first time Scott’s battled similar accusations.

This year, La Flame reportedly also encouraged fans to jump from a second-level balcony at a concert in New York. One fan jumped from the third level, injuring himself in the process. The fan was hospitalized, but not before Scott gave him a ring off his hand. The show must go on. Scott is performing at Grand Rapids tonight (May 19) before continuing his “Birds Eye View Tour” through July 9. After that, he will embark on Kendrick Lamar’s “The DAMN. Tour” on July 12 in Phoenix.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dow 30 Stock Roundup: Home Depot, Cisco, Wal-Mart Beat on Earnings Shutterstock photo The Dow traversed another tenuous week, marked by key earnings results and political developments which heightened investor concerns. Gains in energy and technology stocks helped the index gain on Monday. However, the Dow inched lower on Tuesday following news that President Trump had shared sensitive information with Russian officials. The index suffered grievous losses on Wednesday following reports of Trump’s interference into the FBI probe regarding Mike Flynn’s involvement with Russian sources. Encouraging earnings from a key component helped the index end with gains on Thursday. Last Week’s Performance The Dow lost 0.1% last Friday, dragged down by declines in bank and retail stocks. Weaker than expected monthly inflation data raised concerns about the possibility of a future rate hike, which eventually affected banks. CPI increased by 0.2% while core CPI gained 0.1%, reversing a 0.1% decline in the previous month. Consumer prices rose unadjusted 2.2% over last year, a decline from a 2.4% increase in March. The blue-chip index lost 0.5% over last week. Last Tuesday, Trump discharged Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), James Comey from office. Comey was accused of injudiciously commenting that „hundreds and thousands” of Clinton’s emails were forwarded by Clinton aide Huma Abedin to former Rep. Anthony Weiner’s personal computer. Investors remained worried that such a dismissal could delay implementation of Trump administration’s pro-growth agenda. The Dow This Week The index advanced 0.4% on Monday, boosted by gains in energy and technology stocks. Energy shares moved north due to an uptick in oil prices after energy ministers from Saudi Arabia and Russia spoke about the need for extending output cuts. The energy ministers discussed the possibility of extending oil production cuts to the end of March next year in an attempt to stabilize the global crude market and reduce global oil inventories to their five-year average level. Meanwhile, Software security stocks moved higher following a cyber-attack on Friday that affected at least 200,000 computers across the world, as per EU law enforcement agency Europol estimates. Cybersecurity stocks gained on expectations that attacks were likely to continue into the current week. The index declined by 2.19 points on Tuesday amid heightened political uncertainty in the U.S following news that President Trump had shared sensitive information with Russian officials. Energy shares declined following a report released by International Energy Agency (IEA). Meanwhile, investors kept a close watch on the housing starts and the industrial production data released on Tuesday. While housing starts for April declined by 2.6%, industrial production recorded a growth of 1% in April, marking its largest increase since February 2014. The Dow lost 1.8% on Wednesday following reports of Trump’s interference into the FBI probe regarding Mike Flynn’s involvement with Russian sources. This development raised concerns regarding the fate of Trump’s pro-growth agenda, including tax cuts and deregulation policies. The Dow declined below its 50-day moving average for first time since April. Stocks finished in the green on Thursday, boosted by gains in technology shares and upbeat jobless claims data. Meanwhile, the Dow increased 0.3%, aided by gains made by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT which moved northward following an encouraging earnings report. However, the controversy relating to investigation into former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn’s involvement with Russian sources kept investors cautious. Components Moving the Index Wal-Mart ‚s first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of $1.00 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents by 4.2% and increased 2.0% from the year-ago earnings of 98 cents on higher comps. Earnings reached the top end of the guided range of 90 cents to $1.00 per share. Total revenue came in at $117.5 billion (including membership and other income). The figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.6 billion by 0.07% but increased 1.4% year over year. Currency impacted sales by approximately $1.21 billion. The decline in the International business was more than offset by growth in sales at Wal-Mart U.S and Sam’s Club divisions. Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated Wal-Mart expects U.S. comp sales growth in the range of 1.5−2.0% for the 13-week period ending Jul 28. Sam’s Club comp sales, without the impact of fuel sales, are expected to increase 1-1.5%. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.00-$1.08 per share. (Read: Wal-Mart Tops Q1 Earnings on Higher Comps & Traffic ) Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 54 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Excluding stock-based compensation, earnings increased 5.3% on a year-over-year basis to 60 cents, which was slightly better than management’s guided range of 57-59 cents. The growth reflected benefits from operational efficiencies that boost operating margin in the quarter. Revenues declined 0.5% year over year to $11.94 billion but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.89 billion. Management had anticipated revenues to decline in the range of 2% or remain flat on a year-over-year basis. However, Cisco’s fourth-quarter outlook was disappointing. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, revenues are expected to decline in the range of 6-4% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be in the range 60-62 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 58 cents on revenue estimates of $12.52 billion. (Read: Cisco Q3 Earnings Beat, Shares Fall on Dim View ) The Home Depot Inc. HD posted fiscal first-quarter earnings of $1.67 per share, which escalated 16% from $1.44 in the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61. Net sales advanced 4.9% to $23,887 million from $22,762 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23,745 million. The company’s overall comparable-store sales (comps) increased 5.5%, while comps in the U.S. grew 6%. Following the robust fiscal first quarter performance, Home Depot raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 while it retained the sales view. The company projects both sales and comps to grow about 4.6% in fiscal 2017. The company now expects diluted earnings per share to increase nearly 11% to $7.15, including share repurchases. Previously, the company had anticipated earnings per share growth of 10.5% to $7.13. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM recently announced its intention to enter the retail fuel market of Mexico. To this end, the company is likely to spend almost $300 million over the next 10 years. The integrated energy company is anticipated to launch its first fuel service station in central Mexico, under the brand name ‚Mobil,’ in the second half of 2017. With this development, motorists in the country will now be able to avail Zacks Rank #3-rated Exxon Mobil’s high-grade Synergy gasoline and diesel fuels. The event signifies the opening of Mexico’s closed retail sales market after Pemex lost its monopoly following the reforms in 2013. (Read: Exxon Mobil to Foray into the Mexican Fuel Market ) JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM is buying an office space in Dublin as part of its efforts to move jobs out of London post-Brexit. This move confirms confidence in the Irish capital at a time when various cities of the European Union are competing to convince financial institutions with large bases in the U.K. to choose them over others to carry out activities previously performed in London. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3. The new building, located in the Capital Dock development in Dublin, covers 130,000 square foot and its construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. The building will be able to accommodate around 1,000 staff members, which is double the number of people already employed by JPMorgan in Dublin. (Read: JPMorgan Buys Dublin Office to Move Jobs Post Brexit ) Johnson & Johnson, Inc. JNJ discussed its future plans and showcased a strong pipeline of transformational medicines at a meeting held on May 17 with industry analysts. Johnson & Johnson intends to seek approval for 10 new products between 2017 and 2021. The company said that each of these products have blockbuster potential. Also, the company is targeting more than 50 line extensions of existing and new drugs. Meanwhile, Zacks Rank #3-rated Johnson & Johnson also said it expects approval and launch of its two pipeline candidates this year — guselkumab for psoriasis and sirukumab for rheumatoid arthritis. (Read: J&J Plans to Seek Approval for 10 New Drugs by 2021 ) Performance of the Top 10 Dow Companies The table given below shows the price movements of the 10 largest components of the Dow, which is a price weighted index, over the last five days and during the last six months. Over the last five trading days, the Dow has lost 1.1%. Ticker Last 5 Day’s Performance 6-Month Performance MMM -0.8% +13.8% GS -4% +1.9% IBM +0.2% -7.4% HD -0.4% +21.4% BA -4.4% +20.7% UNH -1.1% +14% MCD +1% +23% TRV +0.4% +8.1% JNJ +3.1% +10.4% AAPL -2% +36.5% Next Week’s Outlook For the most part, the direction of stocks is being determined by political developments in recent weeks. This week was no different, dogged by controversies over Russia’s involvement with the Trump presidential campaign. Despite such a trend, investors will closely watch FOMC minutes as well home sales data scheduled for release next week. These reports are also likely to have a major impact on the fortunes of stocks in the week ahead.

Lehigh Valley proms: See all our photo galleries LV Business Cycle Retail Last-minute drama puts Movie Tavern back in limbo Southern Theatres/HANDOUT The proposed Movie Tavern in Trexlertown is again in doubt because of a legal formality holding up a closing between the Dallas-based company and Jaindl Land Co. Pictured here is a rendering of another Movie Tavern location. The proposed Movie Tavern in Trexlertown is again in doubt because of a legal formality holding up a closing between the Dallas-based company and Jaindl Land Co. Pictured here is a rendering of another Movie Tavern location. (Southern Theatres/HANDOUT) Andrew WagamanContact ReporterOf The Morning Call Grab some popcorn: Movie Tavern in Trexlertown is once again in limbo Someone write a script already. A last-minute legal formality over a tiny parcel of land has cast the beleaguered Movie Tavern plan in Lower Macungie Township back in limbo. Jaindl Land Co. is one signature away from putting to bed the development plan for Trexler Business Center, which would feature the Lehigh Valley's first cinema-eatery. That signature, of township Board of Commissioners President Doug Brown, would allow developer David Jaindl to record the plan and Movie Tavern to close on its property sale and begin construction. But Lower Macungie will not sign the plan until all right of ways are dedicated to the township with clear title — without any liens, including mortgages. And the release of two mortgages on a 126-square-foot strip of land along a planned Hamilton Boulevard entrance could take more than a month. Movie Tavern, which is scheduled to close on the property sale Thursday, already has delayed the opening until next spring, according to Kade Pittman, the company's director of real estate. It cannot wait any longer. Andrew Wagaman Fast facts about Movie Tavern and the Trexler Business Center: Movie Tavern announced last October it would open its first Lehigh Valley cinema-eatery at a proposed Jaindl Land Co. commercial center on Hamilton Boulevard. The Dallas-based company offers patrons food and drinks served at their seats... Fast facts about Movie Tavern and the Trexler Business Center: Movie Tavern announced last October it would open its first Lehigh Valley cinema-eatery at a proposed Jaindl Land Co. commercial center on Hamilton Boulevard. The Dallas-based company offers patrons food and drinks served at their seats... (Andrew Wagaman) "If we have to wait another six weeks for a mortgage to be released, then we have a big problem," Pittman said Friday. "That could create a situation that's very unfortunate for David." Movie Tavern, which offers patrons food and drinks served at their seats, announced in October 2015 it would open its first cinema-eatery in the Lehigh Valley at Jaindl's proposed site on Hamilton Boulevard east of the Wal-Mart Supercenter and West Valley Marketplace. The 116,000-square-foot retail development would feature four other retail pads plus the existing Bastian Carpet One. The main entrance would be between Bastian and Hamilton Animal Care in the 6100 block of Hamilton Boulevard. The Lower Macungie zoning hearing board granted a variance for a 60-foot tower in July 2016, after earlier rejecting a 65-foot tower.  The Lower Macungie zoning hearing board granted a variance for a 60-foot tower in July 2016, after earlier rejecting a 65-foot tower.  See more videos The township review of the development plan offered a smorgasbord of local government dramas: an effort to save historic sycamore trees, a neighborhood crusade against the proposed height of the theater's tower, fighting words over traffic impact fees and a whole lot of history between the developer and public officials. More than once, Movie Tavern considered walking away. Lower Macungie approved the plan last October. But, according to township solicitor Richard Somach, Jaindl acquired the Hamilton Boulevard right of way from the owners of the Hamilton Animal Care just this month. Before Jaindl can turn around and give the township the right of way, Hamilton Animal Care owners Owen DeVos and Lisa Scibetta must obtain releases of two mortgages from Key Bank National Association. That process could take four to six weeks, Somach told commissioners Thursday. Somach drafted an indemnification agreement that would have enabled Jaindl to record the plan before the official release of the mortgages and would have protected the township from any future legal action. But commissioners rejected the agreement, saying they did not feel the need to get involved in a transaction between two private parties. "This is an issue that should have been taken care of a long time ago," Commissioner Ron W. Beitler said. "I feel for Movie Tavern," he added. "I know they're as frustrated with this developer as we are." Jaindl did not attend the meeting. "Representatives of Jaindl had asked if they needed to be here," Somach told commissioners. "I didn't think it would be any kind of controversial issue." Reached Friday evening, Jaindl said he's worked diligently with Movie Tavern and surrounding neighbors, including the veterinary hospital, to advance the development plan. He called Beitler's comments unfair and said the indemnification agreement should have been a "no-brainer." "They went against the better judgment of their solicitor," Jaindl said. "The risk to the township is zero." The Movie Tavern in Trexlertown would be 46,500 square feet and feature 11 screens. The Dallas company, a subsidiary of VSS-Southern Theatres LLC, introduced a revamped menu this month at its 23 locations. The company also is hoping to bring a Movie Tavern to the eastern end of the Lehigh Valley, Pittman said. He said he's working on finalizing a deal. Pittman hoped to open the Trexlertown Movie Tavern in time for the December release of "Star Wars: The Last Jedi." "It's certainly a disappointment — we hate missing the big films, and the sooner we get open, the sooner we can start serving the market," Pittman said. But he said the company still is committed to the Trexlertown deal and will open next spring — provided Jaindl records the plan and construction can begin in the coming weeks. "We expect to close next week," he said. Jaindl assured that, despite the setback, the Movie Tavern and commercial center would still be built. "This will all happen," he said. "We'll be closing at the earliest date that Movie Tavern is ready to close." awagaman@mcall.com Twitter @andrewwagaman 610-820-6764 MOVIE TAVERN • Headquarters: Dallas • Location: Hamilton Boulevard, Trexlertown section of Lower Macungie Township, next to Wal-Mart Supercenter • Tentative opening: spring 2018 • Originally announced opening: late 2016 • Food and beverage: Casual dining menu, full bar with wine, beer and cocktails • Theater: 11 screens, state-of-the-art sound, digital projection and 3D capability • Amenities: Reserved stadium seating, call button service in all theaters Copyright © 2017, Lehigh Valley Business Cycle Could fate of Movie Tavern finally be determined Thursday?

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news What it would mean if Amazon breaks into pharma The effect it would have on Amazon, pharmaceuticals and other companies in the space Technology trends and news by Steven Loeb May 19, 2017 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/499b Some of the biggest tech companies have been staking their claims in the healthcare space in the last few years. Companies like Google and Apple have been investing for a while, while newer companies like Uber have also begun dipping their toes in the water as well. Now it's Amazon's turn. Earlier this week, it was reported by CNBC that the company is looking to enter a new space: pharmaceuticals. So far, the report, which said that Amazon is hiring a business lead for the space, as well as other recruits from the pharmacy industry, has not been confirmed. However, if it is true, then it would be a potential game changer, for Amazon and for the pharmaceutical space more broadly. Such a move would potentially give Amazon an even bigger advantage over its competitors, and possibly make the pharmaceutical industry more transparent. A game changer for Amazon Taking this step could have a seismic impact in a few different ways, one of which is on Amazon's business. The company, which recently announced that sales in the first quarter were $35.7 billion, with net income of $724 million, is currently the biggest online retailer, by far, with more than half of all online sales in 2016. Nobody can come close to touching it. Getting into pharmaceuticals would only expand its dominance in e-commerce. There are more than 4 billion prescriptions ordered last year. Globally, the pharma market is expected to reach $1.12 trillion by 2022, according to data from market research firm Evaluate Pharma. If Amazon could grab even a percentage of that, it would be a goldmine. "There are some unique characteristics of the pharmaceutical business with which Amazon has little experience, so I expect a steep learning curve, and they may not see great success out of the gate," said David Wu, General Partner at Maveron. "At the same time, no one is better than Amazon at leveraging scale to sell commodity products with little brand differentiation direct to consumers, so I think they could dominate the category in the long term." To Stephen Kraus, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, healthcare is "the natural next place" for Amazon to go. "I just think it makes sense. Amazon, as far as I can see, owns the shopping experience. They are trying to own your consumer wallet in many ways. The things you used to go to mall or the hardware store or the bookstore to get, they want to be the one stop shop on the Internet to provide those goods. And they do it in a very consumer friendly way, through an amazing technology experience," he said.  "They have, very thoughtfully, been systematically taking over consumer purchase behavior and the wallet, but one thing has been missing: healthcare. It's 20 percent to 30 percent of GDP. They were missing exposure to a quarter of the economy." It seems likely that pharma might just be the first step that Amazon will be taking in the healthcare space. The effect on pharma The other major effect will be on the pharma space, and investors like Paul Willard, General Partner at Subtraction Capital, expect to see Amazon bring more transparency to the market. "As a consumer it would be great to see Amazon bring the price transparency and competition that they have brought to so many opaque markets into the pharmaceutical space.  It would be yet another great example of tech finally moving into health, and boy does our country's health delivery system need it," he said. "The ACA got the ball rolling on tech attacking these very large, highly defended markets. In a sense, Amazon entering the fight would be a continued progression of that arc. The battle to fix America's broken health delivery systems and business models would be add another important front." Kraus had a different take. While he does believe that Amazon will be able to drive prices down on generic drugs, much like other retailers, such as Walmart, have done with pharma, and which Amazon has been able to do in other verticals, he told me that he doesn't think the same can be said patent protected drugs, with novel therapeutics, where there's no competition. "I don’t think Amazon will be able to make a dent in drugs with novel therapeutics, like for rare diseases. Things change when there's public outrage over them charging $100,000 a pill, but I'm not sure Amazon will be able to do anything there, since they are patented and there isn't a corollary in the market," said Kraus. One thing it could do is set up a transparent pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies. If Amazon were to go that route, though, Kraus doesn't believe that happen for around 10 years, so he believes that any effect that Amazon would have on drug prices wouldn't be felt for a while.  Competitors beware! Finally, there's one more group that will be rocked by this: the numerous other companies currently operating in the pharma delivery space right now. The effect is most likely to be negative.  There's PillPack, an online pharmacy that has raised over $117 million; Zipdrug, which promises to deliver prescriptions in under an hour, and has raised $2.6 million; ScriptDash, which has raised $6 million; and Nurx, an on-demand birth control delivery company that prescribes contraceptives through its app, which has raised $5.42 million. Kraus believes that Amazon expanding into this new space would have a devastating effect on these smaller companies.  "Amazon has been very aggressive in other industries. They have a tremendous amount of cash, power and strength. They're aggressive when it comes to pricing, and for an entrepreneur or investor in one of those companies, it will be similar to Uber and Lyft. There will be pricing wars and when you get into a pricing battle with a more well armed competitor, it's losing battle for you," said Kraus. The best hope, he said, is for the other companies to be acquired by Amazon.  Not everyone agrees with that, though. Adam Levy, CEO of PopRx, a Canadian mobile pharmacy application, believes that Amazon's move would be beneficial to his company and to the space in general. Amazon entering the the pharmaceutical space "would be wonderful," he told me. Rather than looking at the company has a potential competitor, Levy sees Amazon's move a validation of his company's core philosophy. "If Amazon joined our market, it would be great competition for us and validate that what we have been saying for years: that people don't go to Shoppers Drug Mart or big chains because they love the service. They go for the convenience. Our approach is to destroy them on convenience by offering relationships and personalized service through mobile and online technology," he said. "I think we can all learn from Amazon in this space and if they wanted to work with us on this, it would be a great opportunity to show the incumbents how to do it better really." "We’re a company driven by our mission to improve patient care, and we hope Amazon can contribute to this mission too. One area where Amazon can really help our industry is increasing drug price transparency," Mattieu Gamache-Asselin, Co-founder and CEO at ScriptDash, told me. "It’s a hot topic issue at the moment, and they are well positioned to impact today’s opaque system. It’s a >$400B industry today, and there’s a lot of room for innovative companies to make their mark. We’re excited to see what comes next from Amazon." The future of health tech Ultimately, what this news really might mean is that the big tech companies are finally ready to take the plunge into the digital health space. Many companies have dabbled over the years. Many of Google's so-called "moonshot projects," for example, have had to do with health and well being. That includes a smart contact lens for monitoring diabetes, as well as something called Baseline Study, which will involve the collecting of genetic and molecular information from a group of people. It also bought Lift Labs, the creators of an electronic device that improves the quality of life for those with Parkinson’s and essential tremor, in September of last year.  The company's biggest, and most ambitious, health-related project is Calico, company that was founded by Google just about a year ago, and whose was to take on the aging process. The focus was said to be on health and well-being, particularly when it comes to aging and diseases associated with that process. Apple has launched some health initiatives, including its Health app, as well as CareKit, an open-source software development framework for medical-care app. Apple has also been talking to the FDA for years about developing medical devices, including an app that would help diagnose Parkinson’s disease.  One surprising entry into health has been Uber, which recently hired an outreach team to work with healthcare providers. The company has implemented two pilot programs, including one with Circulation, to help non-emergency medical patients get to their appointments on time, and UberCentral, a service to get patients to and from hospital appointments. However, none of these companies have made health a top priority. At least not yet.  In 2016, there was $4.2 billion put into digital health companies, in 296 deals. If companies like Google, Apple, Facebook and Uber were to get serious, Kraus believes that would drive the space further up.  "There's been a lot of money poured into digital health, but there haven't been a tremendous amount of exits. It's still early days, and the tipping point will come when the big guys, like Amazon, Google and Facebook decide they want to get in. They have tremendous resources to spend, and they will increase the amount of M&A in healthtech," he said.  "Those tech companies have had dibbles and dabbles, and dipped their toe in water, but have never made a big play in healthtech."

The Goosebumps star was handcuffed by police and held responsible for the crowd chaos that ensued after performing at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in Rogers on 13 May (17), when he reportedly "encouraged people to rush the stage". A number of people were injured in the incident, including a member of the venue's security team and a cop. Travis, real name Jacques Webster, Jr., was taken into custody and also booked for endangering the welfare of a minor and disorderly conduct, before being released without bail hours later. Kylie Jenner's new boyfriend had been due to return to Arkansas for arraignment on 13 June (17), but his attorney, Drew Ledbetter, has since waived the appearance and has entered not guilty pleas to all misdemeanours on behalf of his client. "Travis Scott had no criminal intent," Ledbetter told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. "He only intended to put on a good show." Prosecutors have declined to comment on the attorney's remarks. Meanwhile, the rapper is looking to cash in on the legal trouble by using his mug shot on a new T-shirt design. The police photo features in the centre of a plain white T-shirt, and retails online for $45 (£35). It's not the first time Travis has been arrested for causing chaos at a concert - he was busted at the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, Illinois in 2015, after calling on fans to climb over barricades and join him onstage. He pleaded guilty to reckless conduct months later and was ordered to remain under court supervision for a year, according to Rolling Stone. Travis also recently hit headlines for encouraging fans at a gig in New York to jump from balconies.

We need to stop talking about mass incarceration. Every speech, every op-ed, every white paper about criminal justice starts with the same data points: The U.S. has 5% of the world’s population and 25% of the world prisoners, more prisoners than soldiers, more correction officers than marines, more prisons than Walmarts. Yes, the numbers justify calling it “mass.” But that label makes it hard to see the individuals. People experience imprisonment as something quite personal. It’s your father wearing greens. Your sister is “upstate.” Your husband’s time in Rikers, your Mommy cuffed and driving away in the back of a patrol car. When you walk into that visiting room to see your son, you see your son incarcerated, and other parents visiting their sons, not “masses”. We can only see people as the worst thing they have ever done if we don’t actually see them. Plus, it’s not only incarceration that’s mass. Over time the exo-structure that has developed as part of the prison surge has metastasized into a surveillance state that features excessive policing and millions of people under some form of state control, fines, cash bail, electronic bracelets and an endless stream of efforts to privatize and monetize it. And now, many politicians want us to use big data: “scientific risk assessments” created by a for-profit company based on proprietary algorithms that we can’t see, but behind which are humans with the same biases as the rest of us, to predict which of us is dangerous. We talk about mass incarceration but we still view crime as only an individual level phenomenon, blaming it on poor decision-making, bad parenting, and disrespect for law and order. Somehow we ignore the mass, community-wide pressures: institutionalized racial privilege and disadvantage, labor market failures and poverty. We talk about mass incarceration while only proposing individual level solutions—usually punishment— and offer little to promote healing for harm, or treatment for mental illness, for individuals or for communities. Or course we’re all responsible for the choices we make, regardless of circumstances. But if we are being responsible, we have to understand how trauma affects our choices, how the single greatest risk factor for committing a violent crime is having been a victim of violence, and how, even when a person massively transforms his or her life, it doesn’t seem to matter in our punishment paradigm. Nowhere is this clearer than in seeing that the fastest growing group of people in our prisons: older adults. Our elders are noteworthy in part because the cost of their incarceration— especially their medical care —is two or three times the average; and because the rate at which they return to prison when they are released is approximately zero. By 2030, older adults will account for one third of all incarcerated people in the US. They are already 20% of New York’s prison population. More than 1500 individuals over 60 will return to New York City this year, and many will be among the thousands of returning citizens living in its homeless shelters — an especially dangerous outcome for older adults and an especially likely outcome for people whose long sentences have disconnected them from a welcoming home. Perhaps worse is that there are thousands who are not returning because although they have served decades for violent crimes, they are still considered as dangerous as when they went in. Thomas Mott Osborne, a former warden at Sing Sing who founded the prison reform nonprofit The Osborne Association (which I now lead), wrote that “when hanging was replaced with imprisonment, it was more than mere replacing of one form of punishment by another; it brought about the necessity of an absolutely new point of view. The whole question shifted from how to keep men in prison to the question of how to send them out.” That was 100 years ago, now the whole question shifts again: not only how to send them out, but why to send them in, and why to keep them so long. The reason, we are told, is that this is what victims want. If that’s true, it’s probably because it’s all we offered them. Victims want safety, accountability, and support for a healing process. And they should get it. But prison isn’t holding anyone accountable, people can’t work to pay restitution, or support their families, or heal from the harm they experienced as children, or make amends for the harm they caused as adults. Instead of taking about mass incarceration, we need to talk about the individuals, families and communities that are being destroyed by our current prison system, both those who are incarcerated and those who are not.

Earlier, picking up gifts was a simpler affair. People back home would be craving for anything 'foreign' – things like Heads and Shoulders shampoo, Dove soap, Estee Lauder cosmetics, cheap sweat shirts, etc and I would stuff my suitcase with as many of those items as my purse permitted. But gradually with time, with swanky shopping malls in our own cities and with multinational companies spreading their tentacles in the remotest corner of the globe, the idea of picking up those earlier items that everyone craved for is totally lost. Now it is becoming extremely difficult to buy something 'American' for people back home and I realized this most in my trip to the US last month. With China making inroads into the marketing world over the last few years in such an aggressive way, walking into any convenient store or Walmart or Dollar Tree and picking up whatever you want is no longer exciting as everything in your shopping list from A to Z will be 'Made in China.' In this last trip, I had a long list of specific things to be brought back from Uncle Sam's land and then I realized how different things were now. After I had coaxed my son to drive me to the nearest departmental store, he took me there rather reluctantly at nine at night. The store was open till eleven and I had to buy whatever I wanted within the stipulated time of two hours. OK fine. I had to buy a jacket for someone so I rushed to the men's section. The first one I picked was made in Bangladesh. Surely spending my hard earned greenbacks to pick up something from our immediate neighbour was not very exciting. So I tried another aisle. Here were jackets made in Sri Lanka. Again a 'no' from me. After doing away with several countries which did not seem exciting enough, not for the quality of the product but for the tag, I ultimately picked a jacket 'Made in Jordan.' Well at least this west Asian nation was not an immediate neighbour to India and was exotic enough for the person for whom I was buying it. The next item in the list was a tee shirt of XXXL size for a colleague of mine. Again, apart from design, price or colour, the name tag became the more important deciding factor. The first one I picked up was 'Made in India' so it went back to the shelf immediately. After a lot of scouring, the one I ultimately chose was 'Made in Honduras' which I though sounded exotic enough. Now for some bedsheets. One counter in that section had lovely cotton sheets on sale but the 'Made in Pakistan' tag made my patriotic self put it back in the stacks and I struggled hard to ultimately select one that was 'Made in Egypt.' By this time only half an hour was left for the store to close. I still had many more purchase requests left on the list. Loitering around the different aisles listlessly discarding merchandise by looking at the country in which it was produced, I was scolded by my son who had already grown quite impatient. “Why is it taking you so long? If you like the stuff, pick it up and let's go.” “But people back home won't like the idea that I brought them a gift from America that was made in our subcontinent. That too paying in dollars for it,” I replied meekly. “Oh, so you want only gift that has a label “Made in America”? Ma, how stupid you can be at times; OK, here's a good suggestion. Go and pick up some American flags and take home for the rest of your folk.”  “Flags, what will they do with American flags?” “Anything. They can decorate their lounge, use it as a tablecloth or dump it in their chest of drawers and forget about it. Your duty of bringing back an American gift will be over.” Not a bad idea, I mused as I walked towards the shelf selling flags of all sizes. Guess what? The first piece I picked up had a label “Made in Haiti.” The rest of the tale is better left untold. Somdatta Mandal is Professor of English at Visva-Bharati, Santiniketan.

This time, though, a man trying to save a few bucks at the discount supermarket was the centre of attention for all the right reasons. Tom Grasswick of Deer Creek, Minn., bucked the trend when he wrestled a wayward and confused white-tailed deer to the ground at a Walmart in Wadena, preventing the frightened beast from causing havoc and terrorizing the customers. “We were in the pet aisle when we heard what sounded like shelves falling, then a woman screaming,” Stephanie Koljonen told KARE TV in Minneapolis-St. Paul. “We rushed to help and that’s when we saw a deer was on the loose.” Grasswick tackled the deranged deer, who was clearly looking for a bite to eat, after it slammed into him near a pallet of dog food. “I figured I was bigger than the deer so I’d win that wrestling match,” Grasswick told WDAY TV in Fargo, N.D. Grasswick held the deer down, pinning it with his legs, while covering its eyes to keep it calm, before teaming up with other customers to take it outside and release it.

On the CW, DC superheroes rule the network with Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and Supergirl. Now, another DC hero is joining the network. Black Lightning will premiere at midseason, which generally means January 2018. That’s aways off, but we already have the first trailer for the upcoming series. Though it clearly has a different feel from the networks Arrowverse shows, it doesn’t look any less fun. There’s a lot of great-looking superhero action here. If it feels separate from the Arrowverse shows, that may be by design. Though, like the other DC superhero series on the network, Black Lightning is produced by Greg Berlanti, it’s not part of the Arrowverse. According to Deadline, CW president Mark Pedowitz says there are no plans for a five-show crossover involving Black Lightning. Even though they’re all based on DC comics, they won’t take place in the same universe. Keep in mind, this all comes with a big “for now” attached to the end of the sentence. Just because it doesn’t happen in the first season doesn’t mean it’ll never happen. It’s not like traveling between universes is hard on these shows. Of course, Pedowitz did say there will be another big four-show crossover event between Supergirl, Arrow, The Flash and Legends. The alien invasion storyline last November was so much fun, and so popular that another giant crossover was inevitable. It’s still a fun stunt, and we can expect the network to keep doing it as long as we all keep watching. Let’s just hope they can keep the quality of last year’s event. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman (Photo: Screenshot via YouTube/Warner Bros.) Over on the movie side of things, Wonder Woman is only a couple weeks away, and DC Comics is preparing for Diana’s first solo film in a really cool way. The publisher is holding a special event the day after the movie premieres where they’ll give away comics, and guest speakers. The event will be held in bookstores, comic shops, and libraries. Big chains like Walmart, Barnes and Noble, Costco and even Amazon will have special promotions to celebrate the character as well, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The free books include a reprint of Wonder Woman: Rebirth #1 and DC Super Hero Girls Wonder Woman Day Special Edition, which will have an excerpt from an upcoming graphic novel aimed at young kids. The guest speakers will include creators who have written some of Wonder Woman’s most memorable stories, including Greg Rucka, Cliff Chiang, Marc Andreyko, Shea Fontana and Cat Staggs. This will mark the end of DC’s year-long celebration of Wonder Woman’s anniversary. In the week leading up to June 3, DC’s website will put up interviews with comics creators and people involved in the upcoming movie discussing Wonder Woman’s history. There will also be some kind of comics sale on the site, which should come in handy if you aren’t caught up on Wonder Woman’s story in DC’s Rebirth universe yet. That’s not the only cool piece of Wonder Woman news out today. The poster for the China release of the upcoming movie is out, and it looks better than anything we get over here. DC artist Nicola Scott tweeted out the poster that makes the movie look like a Wonder Woman anime. #Countdown2WonderWoman 17 days!! Check out one of the tie-in posters for the Chinese market. ❤️ pic.twitter.com/QBhA3qJHFD — Nicola Scott (@NicolaScottArt) May 15, 2017 Gamespot points out that American movies have a history of getting cool takes on movie posters in Asian countries. Like one for Kong: Skull Island that made it look like a classic kaiju monster movie. As much as I’d love to see this poster in American movie theaters, I can see why it’s not. It could possibly make you think you’re about to watch a Wonder Woman anime. Which… thinking about it, that would be awesome! Hey DC, where’s our Wonder Woman anime series? Finally, even with two DCEU movies right around the corner, some are already thinking about its distant future. Specifically, some are wondering if they’ll ever get around to making a Green Arrow movie, according to Movie Web. Though there’s been no serious talk of one, Charlie Hunnam has said he would like to play the character. The idea was floated to him first in an interview back in March for The Lost City of Z. He wasn’t too excited about it, saying he didn’t grow up with comics and had no real interest in superheroes. Fair enough, but more recently, Hunnam appears to have had a change of heart. Enough fans want to see him as Oliver Queen that he’s opened up to the idea. He still doesn’t know the character at all, but he asked the interviewer if he looks like Green Arrow. The interview told him that he does, in fact, look like the character in the comics. That was enough for him. “Well, come on DC, what’s up? Give me a call; I’m here.” charlie hunnam on playing green arrow…..its not a no ladies and gentlemen pic.twitter.com/911rO0ZWOm — edgelord allan poe (@haarleyquin) May 15, 2017 He could just be being nice, but if Stephen Amell can’t play Green Arrow in the movies, Hunnam wouldn’t be a terrible choice. As the interviewer says, he does look like Oliver Queen a lot, and he’s a good actor. I already think it’s a huge mistake not using the wonderful Arrowverse for the DCEU (particularly the choice to pass over Grant Gustin as The Flash), but the DCEU has made their celebrity-shaped bed on that one. As far as Oliver Queens go, you could do a lot worse than Charlie Hunnam. Now let’s hope this hypothetical/probably inevitable Green Arrow keeps the politics of the character intact. Unlike certain other adaptations.

The e-commerce giant's shares have skyrocketed in recent years, but is it vulnerable to a recession-fueled market downturn? Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) May 19, 2017 at 1:24PM In many ways, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) seems recession-proof. The company's e-commerce operation has a reputation for offering low prices, and its Prime membership program offers significant value for just $99 a year, providing members with free two-day shipping on millions of items as well as video streaming and a slew of other benefits. Since its inception, Amazon has staked its reputation on value, using efficiencies and the flywheel effect to drive it, and customers have bought into the proposition. Its cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services, is also likely to weather a recession as companies need data storage and other cloud services regardless of the economic climate. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon'd business fared well during the recent financial crisis, as revenue grew by 29.2% in 2008 and 28.4% in 2009. While those numbers were slower than the company's revenue growth in the years before and after, they still represent an exceptional growth rate at a time when many retailers were losing sales and overall retail sales were falling. Earnings per share growth was also solid back then, increasing 33% in 2008 and then 37% in 2009. Back then, Amazon's profit margins were better than they are today as the company had yet to make massive investments in fulfillment centers, AWS, and other infrastructure that it has since. In 2009, it had profit margin of 3.7%, much better than the may of its competitors. But what about Amazon's stock during a recession-fueled market downturn? How might it do? Don't get too excited  While Amazon has proven that it can thrive even during a recession, the stock's performance has not always followed suit. Amazon shares lost nearly two-thirds of their value from their peak early in 2008 at $97.43 to their bottom at $34.68 in November 2008, a drop of 64.4%. The S&P 500 fell, by comparison, 56.8%. In other words, despite Amazon's sustained revenue and profit growth during the recession, the market still punished it more than it did the average stock. That's because high-valued growth stocks like Amazon tend to fall more in bear markets as investors flee to safety and dividend payers.   While the broad market plunged through 2008, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) stock actually gained that year as the retail giant is widely perceived to be recession-proof and its stock pays a dividend. Wal-Mart shares ultimately fell during the worst of the sell-off, but only lost 27% from their peak in September 2008 to their nadir in February 2009. Now vs. then  Amazon stock would probably face a similar tumble in a new market downturn as it did in 2008. Despite the e-commerce giant's strong profit growth recently, the stock still trades at a triple-digit price-to-earnings ratio. Amazon's share price has largely soared on the strength of its revenue growth and its evident competitive advantages, as the market expects profits to eventually justify its market cap over $400 billion. Amazon is such a unique company that it's difficult to value the stock, as future profits are highly unpredictable. The stock is particularly volatile for a company of its size, and often swings by double digits on its earnings reports. That means that a bear market would be likely to push Amazon's stock down significantly, as it would with most growth stocks, since it would compress the overall valuation of the market. But the upside of such a move is that it would present an excellent buying opportunity to pick up new shares, as Amazon the business should be able to continue growing even in a down economy. In fact, a recession could even make Amazon stronger as it would likely pressure a number of its retail rivals and force some of them out of business. Though Amazon stock would likely take a hit from a market downturn, over the long term the stock should be even stronger because of it. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

A rapper who was charged with inciting a riot after inviting fans onstage during an Arkansas concert has pleaded not guilty. Police say Travis Scott “encouraged people to rush the stage” during a concert Saturday at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in Rogers, about 200 miles northwest of Little Rock. Investigators say multiple people were injured, including a concert security employee and a police officer. Scott’s attorney, Drew Ledbetter, tells the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Scott “only intended to put on a good show.” Ledbetter says Scott waived his arraignment and pleaded not guilty to the charges, including disorderly conduct and endangering the welfare of a minor. An attorney for the city says she can’t comment on the pending case. Scott, whose legal name is Jacques Webster, is scheduled to perform Friday in Michigan.

Click on the image for larger view. (© FlaglerLive) The latest law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty this year—the 50th in five months—was Deputy Sheriff Mason Moore of the Broadwater County Sheriff’s Office in south-central Montana. It happened Tuesday. It did so as many of these killings do: during a traffic stop. Moore had pulled over a car in a routine stop at 3 a.m. A shootout ensued and he was killed. Two suspects were later arrested. Moore had been a 15-year veteran, was married and had three children. He was the 18th cop to be shot dead this year, the highest proportion of law enforcement deaths in the line of duty. It’s followed by vehicle crashes: 14 deaths. Florida has had two law enforcement deaths in the line of duty, both related to the pursuit of Markeith Lloyd, who was wanted in the death of his pregnant ex-girlfriend. The Orlando Police Department’s Debra Clayton was killed first—shot four times in a Walmart parking lot as she confronted Lloyd. Norman Lewis of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office was involved in the pursuit. His motorcycle struck a car and he was killed. Lloyd was captured eight days later. Scenarios like this can be recounted with numbing familiarity, month after month, year after year, at times coming very close to home, as was the case in Palm Coast on May 1 when Sgt. Phil Reynolds of the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office was twice targeted by a shooter on London Drive but escaped injury. Sheriff Rick Staly noted the incident in his speech Thursday evening as he addressed a crowd that had turned up for the department’s annual commemoration of fallen officers. The Sheriff embraces Sgt. Frank Celico’s mother in front of the memorial to fallen officers during the remembrance ceremony. Click on the image for larger view. (© FlaglerLive)“By the grace of God,” Staly said, “the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office has not lost an officer in the line of duty in 14 years. However, we have come very close. We were reminded just a few days ago just how dangerous our profession is when a violent offender fired a dozen shots at a veteran sergeant responding to a 91 call for help. Sgt. Phil Reynolds narrowly escaped injury and we are blessed that he is standing here with us today.” (Phillip Haire, a 19-year-old resident of the address to which Reynolds was answering a call, was arrested for the shooting.) The last local law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty was Chuck Sease, a young recruit with the Sheriff’s Office who was struck by a car as he put down stop sticks as part of a pursuit at an I-95 exit in 2003.  Sgt. Frank Celico’s name was also added to the memorial to fallen officer when he died of heart failure in 2011. Audio: The Full Ceremony Get the Flash Player to see the wordTube Media Player. The names of Celico, Sease,  Sheriff Perry Hall and Deputy Gregory Durrance  (both killed in 1927), and Sheriff Homer Brooks, also a heart attack victim in 1965, were sounded during Thursday’s ceremony as family members of the fallen joined Staly in front of the memorial for the traditional placement of a red rose in their memory. For the past decade the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office has marked the annual commemoration of fallen officers with a set ceremony, in place—in front of its headquarters on Justice Lane for many years, in front of the courthouse when the new operations center was under construction, and last year, in front of that operations center. This year Staly wanted to do it differently. The ceremony began in front of the courthouse, where some 150 people gathered, among them many sheriff’s deputies and officers and some members of other law enforcement agencies. They were joined by the Knights of Columbus and all received an electronic blue candlelight to turn on and hold during the ceremony. The gathering then was followed by a silent march from the courthouse to the Sheriff’s Operations Center, along State Road 100, with Staly and his wife Debbie leading. Just then the sun was setting. At the intersection with Dr. Carter Boulevard, Staly took the reins of a riderless horse, a symbol of fallen soldiers, and continued the march, turning into the Operations Center at a slow clip, where the Sheriff’s Office’s Mounted Posse had lined up, four horses on each side, to salute the riderless horse as it passed. The ceremony, none of it rehearsed, included numerous subtle, solemn touches, like the silver-like platters with two red roses placed in front of each horse and the large badge shrouded in the customary band that signifies mourning on the hood of the department’s honor vehicle. As each fallen officer’s name was called, the crowd lifted its blue candles. Click on the image for larger view. (© FlaglerLive)The crowd for the first time included children—previous ceremonies had been held in the morning, during school hours—and four judges, including R. Lee Smith of Flagler and three from Volusia County. Palm Coast Mayor Milissa Holland and Flagler Beach Commission Chairperson Jane Mealy were also in the audience, as were County Commissioners Dave Sullivan and Don O’Brien and Clerk of Court Tom Bexley. The march over, the crowd arrayed itself in an arc in front of the Operations Center, with Chief Mark Strobridge, Chief Paul Bovino and Chaplain Juan Schembri leading up to a singing of God Bless America by Cpl. Kenny Gonclaves and Staly’s remarks. “Each and every day, men and women in law enforcement put themselves at risk to keep the communities they protect safe and secure,” Staly said, reading from prepared remarks. “We are here tonight to honor all of our officers, especially our fallen heroes.” Moments later, after the remembrance ceremony, John Donlon, a retired member of the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office, played Taps, and the Coastal Florida Police & Fire Pipes and Drums performed “Amazing Grace.”   There was one more added touch this year: the new “Wall of Heroes,” with portraits of the fallen through the years and set up at the entrance of the Operations Center, above a “Memory Table” that displays a flag, a candle, a rose, a hat and words to the fallen.

(AP) — A rapper who was charged with inciting a riot after inviting fans onstage during an Arkansas concert has pleaded not guilty.

Investigators say multiple people were injured, including a concert security employee and a police officer. Scott’s attorney, Drew Ledbetter, tells the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette (http://bit.ly/2qZQZNh ) Scott “only intended to put on a good show.” Ledbetter says Scott waived his arraignment and pleaded not guilty to the charges, including disorderly conduct and endangering the welfare of a minor.

(Reuters/Mike Segar) Share Written by Oliver Staley May 19, 2017 Etsy, the online marketplace for handcrafted items, offers its employees amenities like yoga and crafting classes, catered meals twice a week, and a “community loom” for weaving projects in its offices in Brooklyn, which was renovated for $40 million and features irrigated walls to grow plants, and an ambitious composting program, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. It’s no surprise that activist investors smelled blood. black-and-white Capital (it spells its name lowercase) began buying shares and, on May 2, swooped in and demanded change, citing a “historical pattern of ill-advised spending.” This week, private-equity giant TPG Capital, as well as Dragoneer Investment Group, also announced they bought stakes in Etsy. The new attention is good for shareholders—Etsy’s stock price soared 23% as investors anticipate the company might be sold—but bad for staff. Eighty employees—about 8% of its workforce— as well as chairman and CEO Chad Dickerson, will lose their jobs as the company looks for “value-enhancing” opportunities, the company said. (Etsy declined to comment.) It’s not just hipster startups like Etsy who feel the wrath of the market. When Walmart said in 2015 money spent on raising wages and training would eat into profits, shares plunged 10%. More recently, analysts excoriated American Airlines for giving its pilots and flight attendants a raise. “This is frustrating,” said one. “Labor is being paid first again. Shareholders get leftovers.” While Etsy has a devoted following of buyers for its knick knacks who generated $2.84 billion in sales last year, and made it the fourth-most trafficked e-commerce site, it is particularly vulnerable because, like Walmart and American, it is a public company, and investors have no patience for what they deem inefficient uses of their capital, particularly when spent on employees. The company struggled with slowing growth after its 2015 IPO, and friction with its thousands of sellers over a clunky search engine and what goods are allowed in its online store. Etsy viewed its office culture and environmentally friendly practices as an extension of its business model, which rests on “individuals with diverse roles but all sharing a collective vision of an economy based on community,” according to its IPO filing. A business based on community that values its employees sounds like a great idea, but it may be a business philosophy only private companies can afford. Otherwise, they find themselves at the mercy of corporate raiders with little patience for composting.

Home Local National Diaspora Entertainment Commentary Sports Style Beauty Health Contests 19 May 2017 Voucher proposals expose rift in school choice movement May 19, 2017 Category: Stateside Posted by: Philadelphia Sun Staff ABOVE CARTOON:  David Fitzsimmons, The Arizona Star associated press For two decades, a loose-knit group that includes some of the country’s wealthiest people has underwritten the political push for school choice, promoting ballot initiatives and candidates who favor competition for traditional public schools. But when a member of this elite group was elevated to education secretary, the appointment opened a philosophical schism that now threatens to shatter the alliance, turn billionaires against each other and possibly lead some school-choice advocates to join with teachers’ unions, their archenemies. Fueling the split is the anticipation of a plan from President Donald Trump’s administration that could offer parents federal dollars to send their children to private schools, including religious and for-profit institutions. “As much as we are aligned on change, we aren’t always aligned on how much change or how. Sometimes we fight,” said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the school-reform group 50CAN. The movement has been cleaved into two camps: those who want to use choice to improve public schools and others, like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who want to go further by allowing tax money to flow to private schools through vouchers, government-funded scholarships or corporate tax credits. The differences that once seemed minor are at the heart of a potential seismic shift in the school-choice movement. School-choice programs were first proposed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist Milton Friedman. Since the beginning of this century, they have grown quickly, although the overwhelming majority of students still attend traditional public schools. Thirty states plus Washington, D.C., have some combination of vouchers, government-subsidized education savings accounts or tax credits that help families afford private-school tuition or encourage private groups to fund scholarships, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group founded by Friedman and his wife. Still, less than 1 percent of children in kindergarten through high school used vouchers to attend private schools in 2015. Just 5 percent of students were in charter schools that year, when charters were operating in more than 40 states. That’s up from about 3 percent in 2008, according to the Department of Education. Charter schools are public, but in several states are not held to the same accountability standards as traditional schools, which in theory gives them more freedom to innovate. When standardized test scores of children who switched to charter schools or used vouchers are compared with those of students who remained in traditional public schools, some results have been promising. Other studies have shown little effect or even worse outcomes. The Biggest Donors Wal-Mart’s Walton family, Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates have been some of the largest political contributors to the school-reform movement, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of campaign-finance records compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics and state campaign-finance regulators. Microsoft’s Bill Gates avoids political contributions. His family’s massive foundation — which his father, Bill Gates Sr., co-chairs — is a major contributor to education-reform nonprofits. The elder Gates contributes personally as well. In the past, contributions have flowed to reform-minded groups regardless of whether they supported public charter schools, vouchers for private schools or a combination. Now those funders are beginning to split into competing camps. Groups such as Stand for Children, which pushes for charter schools among other educational changes, are being more vocal now because “the level of ambition of the efforts to expand vouchers is so high,” said Jonah Edelman, co-founder and chief executive, who called the voucher proposals “a dramatic effort to undermine public education.” Edelman, whose organization receives part of its funding from Walton, Broad and Gates-related charities and family members, said his group will fight any administration effort to promote vouchers nationwide. Stand for Children has worked with teachers unions in the past on state-level measures to provide more money for schools and raise teacher pay. But its calls for more charters often put it at odds with the unions, which are powerful political entities in many states. The American Federation of Teachers has had conversations with some charter school advocates it has opposed in the past about coordinating to fight a national voucher program, said Randi Weingarten, president of the union. To identify those who have shaped the school-choice movement across the country, the AP analyzed the political contributions of 48 individuals and couples who have given at least $100,000 to related statewide ballot measure campaigns. That group accounted for the majority of reported contributions to campaigns favoring school-choice initiatives from 2000 through last year. The donors nearly matched all the measures’ opponents. The group also wields political clout in addition to school-related ballot initiatives. The AP analysis showed that the same wealthy funders contributed a total of more than $200 million from 2007 through last year to candidates and political action committees, some of which are supporters of school choice. The funders are from a variety of industries and regions, with a concentration of investors and tech innovators from Seattle and Silicon Valley. Some give millions more to research centers, legal funds, foundations, charter schools and scholarships that promote pieces of the cause. Political campaigns often are a clash of titans. The nation’s two largest teachers’ unions — the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, which have 4.5 million members combined — contributed $573 million to campaigns and political action committees over the same 10-year period, much of it designed to counter the spending of the wealthy families and their affiliated groups. Both unions and school-choice advocates also made independent political expenditures, which are impossible to tally because the details are not required to be reported in many states. The Heart of the Debate For the past decade, school-choice supporters have split over the merits of private-school vouchers versus public charter schools, according to William Oberndorf, a San Francisco investor, major contributor to the movement and chairman of the American Federation for Children, which was led by DeVos until last year. He urged all school-choice advocates to drop their divisions and support the core belief that choice in any form is a good thing if it lets parents make decisions about what is best for their kids. “Most Americans have that already,” Oberndorf said in an interview. “They have that if they have enough money to move to a good school district or send their kids to private school. It’s really only poor people who don’t have choices.” In a statement to the AP, a representative of the Waltons said the family is concerned about improving education quality for all children. It is not focused so much on how that is done. “There have always been tensions in some quarters over the best ways to offer educational options to families,” said Marc Sternberg, senior education adviser to the Walton family. “School choice is a means to an end and not the end in itself. It is about making sure those options — including schools within traditional school systems — offer the kinds of high quality, diverse educational opportunities so that every child has a real chance to succeed in life.” Other wealthy school-choice funders are adamant about improving the public education system and combatting any effort that would take tax dollars away from it. They object to being grouped with the supporters of private-school vouchers. Nick Hanauer, a Seattle investor who had an early stake in Amazon and who spent $1 million in 2012 to support a successful ballot measure to allow charters in Washington state, called vouchers “a stupid idea.” Consider that in the most elite private schools across the country, tuition runs $30,000 to $40,000 a year, he said. “No voucher program is a $40,000-per-year program. It’s a $10,000-per-year program, or a $6,000-per-year program, which means that voucher advocates aren’t serious about delivering high-quality education,” he said. “They’re simply interested in making it cheaper for people who already send their kids to private school to continue to do this.” DeVos School Debate The schism between wealthy funders over private-school vouchers became visible earlier this year during the confirmation process for DeVos, a billionaire heiress who was nominated by Trump for education secretary despite having no experience as a teacher or school administrator. DeVos attended private religious schools in Michigan. Her children were homeschooled and attended religious schools. Broad, a charter school advocate who has contributed at least $3.7 million since 2007 to political efforts to expand charters, wrote a letter to senators urging them to reject DeVos, calling her “unprepared and unqualified.” With DeVos at the helm of the Education Department, “much of the good work that has been accomplished to improve public education for all of America’s children could be undone,” wrote Broad, who declined to be interviewed by the AP. DeVos was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence cast the vote to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who spent nearly $3 million on a failed 2007 Utah ballot initiative promoting vouchers, said DeVos was an “A-plus.” Venture capitalist Timothy Draper, who put $23 million behind a failed attempt to bring vouchers to California in 2000, also had high praise for her. “Having someone who really understands choice in education and how helpful that can be … is going to be good for education,” Draper said. The sides have been at odds previously, including in Arizona, where in April lawmakers passed and the governor signed a law to expand a voucher program. DeVos’s American Federation for Children made a total of $500,000 in independent political expenditures in 2014 and 2016. The anti-voucher Stand for Children spent $1 million in the state during that span. The Trump administration has not released any details about a voucher plan. But early this month, Trump asked lawmakers to work with him to extend school choice to millions more children, including low-income Hispanics and Blacks “who deserve the same chance as every other child to live out their dreams and fill up their hearts and be educated at the top, top level.” The outline in his budget proposal calls for $1.4 billion in school-choice initiatives, including $250 million to launch a voucher program. That money would come in part from cutting $9 billion from K-12 education, including teacher training and after-school and summer programs. The Trump budget calls for eventually increasing annual school-choice funding by $20 billion. It’s unclear how much support or opposition such a plan will generate, in part because most people don’t know much about the topic. A poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and released this week found that 58 percent of respondents said they knew little or nothing at all about charter schools and two-thirds reported the same about private school voucher programs. In her first major policy address as education secretary, DeVos said allowing parents to decide where their children will be educated is essential, whether they choose homeschooling, traditional schools, magnets, charters, online schools or private schools. “I think that the first and most important measure of accountability to the public is to the parents in general, right?” said DeVos.

The center is owned by DDR Corp. who has been buying more shopping properties in the area. (Kyle Arnold / Orlando Sentinel) Kyle ArnoldContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Growing employment and population is helping fuel demand for retail property. Real estate firm Marcus & Millichap’s second-quarter retail market report forecasted rents to go up 2.9 percent in 2017 from 2016 and the vacancy rate for shopping centers is expected to drop to 4.6 percent. That compares to 5.3 percent in 2016. The growth includes about 900,000 square feet of new retail buildings set for completion in the year in Central Florida. Two of the biggest projects are a 162,000-square-foot Wal-Mart store in the Lake Nona area and the 70,700-square-foot Westside Shoppes plaza on Winter Garden Vineland Road. “I’m seeing a ton of construction,” said Nicholas Ledvora, first vice president investments for Marcus & Millichap. “Maybe not as many of the big projects, but a lot from the smaller developer end.” Rents in the Orlando area average about $16.77 a square foot per year. Even with struggles from some once-dominant retail names such as Macy’s, there are plenty of new tenants to take their place, Ledvora said. Grocery stores, dental offices and salons are still clamoring for space, he said. Ruby Tuesday suit Struggling restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday was sued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Wednesday for discriminating against an older applicant. The chain, which is up for sale and closed 95 restaurants last year, allegedly declined to hire a man with more than 20 years experience for a general manager position in Boca Raton because they were looking for someone that would “maximize longevity,” according to a statement from the EEOC. Ruby Tuesday, based in Maryville, Tenn., has an operations office in Orlando. Ruby Tuesday has about 600 restaurants nationwide. Health inspections Two Asian restaurants and a food truck were among four restaurants closed down in Central Florida during the last two weeks by health inspectors. Caribbean-themed seafood food truck Pinones en Orlando was closed because of its own issues with insect pests and downtown Celebration breakfast spot Market Street Cafe also had to be closed because of roaches. Health reports come from records published by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation. Super Orient Buffet closed for the second time since November with roaches. An inspector on May 9 noted dozens of roaches in the kitchen and food-service areas. It is at 4525 S. Semoran Boulevard. Pho 88 in eastern Orlando at 9728 E. Colonial Drive was shut down by a health inspector May 12 because of roaches in the food preparation and kitchen areas. The restaurant reopened two days later. Those four restaurants did not answer phone calls or respond to requests for comment. Flapjack Johnny’s in Groveland closed for an hour April 26. Manager Jennifer Hood said she had called the health department to get an inspection on a nearby tenant that was causing roach problems.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 19, 2017 10:15am   Comments Share: Earnings season is nearly over, but the end of the week brought a new batch of quarterly reports and strong data that could help distract the market from politics. Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations on both the top and bottom line, a positive sign for the industrial sector and perhaps the economy as a whole. Other companies reporting since yesterday’s close included retailer Gap Inc (NYSE: GPS), which bucked the downward retail trend with better-than-expected results, and Foot Locker (FL), which came in below estimates. The word from DE is positive this time out after several quarters in which it cited soft markets for its products. DE said it saw improving demand for farm and construction goods along with “stabilization” in its key markets. Earnings from DE and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) arguably deserve some extra attention from investors because their farm and construction equipment products are so expensive that they can serve as proxies for the broader economy. If you’re getting one of these products, it’s a big investment, so when DE and CAT are going well, it’s often an indication that the economy is also humming along. Other earnings this week also put a better spin on recent economic performance, with both Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) looking pretty good for the most part, though WMT just missed top-line expectations. The strong performances from TGT and WMT, with major growth in online sales at WMT a particular highlight, could wash away the sour taste from last week’s mostly disappointing department store earnings. They also reinforce ideas that perhaps the department stores are dealing with issues that affect their industry but not so much the economy as a whole. As this turbulent week winds down, it could be interesting to see if people start to lighten up on risk heading into the weekend. One way to evaluate if that’s happening is to watch a few major markets. If gold, VIX, and bonds start to rally late in the day while stock values fall, it could be a sign. Volatility pulled back a little early Friday as VIX fell below 14, but it remains well above recent levels as concerns about leadership in Washington continued to create concern on Wall Street. The anxiety doesn't appear to be so much about the investigations of political figures as it is about the possible effect on policy. The market has really run up not only on the back of strong earnings, but also on expectations for a tax cut. At this point, there are questions about whether that can happen. Financials, which got taken to the woodshed Wednesday in part because financial companies could be among the biggest beneficiaries of tax reform, recovered slightly on Thursday along with the rest of the market. Telecom and info tech led the pack, but almost every sector put in a positive performance as buying interest cropped up starting early in the day (see below).  Almost lost amid the political excitement and yesterday’s rally, economic news maintains a positive tone. Jobless claims yesterday were the lowest in 20 years, and the Philadelphia Fed Index blew away expectations (see below). Despite Wednesday’s steep losses, stocks remain much higher this year, with the S&P 500 Index (SPX) still up nearly 6% and the Nasdaq (COMP) up more than 12%. But markets don’t move in straight lines, and sell-offs do happen, as this week reminded everyone. Freedom in Philly If you’re seeking positive news in this shaky week, look no further than Thursday’s Philadelphia Fed Index for May. Manufacturing in the region perked up big time, with the index rising to 38.8. That was about double the consensus expected by Wall Street analysts, and represented the second highest reading for the index since January 1984, according to Briefing.com. While the data indicate that regional manufacturing firms look for growth to continue, there were some warning signs, as both new orders and prices paid dipped. Most of the strength came from the shipments index. April durable orders data due May 26 is another chance to get a read on the manufacturing sector. Clock Watching As we noted yesterday, it’s important to keep an eye on the first half hour of trading when the market comes back the next day from a big move. Sometimes those early minutes can set the tone for the rest of the session. And sure enough, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) appeared to find some buying interest in the first 30 minutes Thursday after it dipped to near technical support that lies just under 2350. Some sectors that ticked up early in the day included info tech and consumer discretionary, two of the most beaten-down sectors on Wednesday.  Missing Data We’re entering a data lull here, with nothing on the calendar today or Monday. The next economic data point is new home sales on Tuesday. That means there’s not much, other than earnings reports, for the market to hang its hat on. While normally investors might welcome some peace and quiet, the lack of data today and Monday could give people more time to watch for news from Washington. Perhaps it might be quieter there in coming days now that the president is on a foreign trip and a special prosecutor is in place, but trading could be jittery today because there’s simply so little news once the market is opens. With that in mind, investors might want to take a careful approach. Posted-In: JJ Kinahan TD Ameritrade The Ticker TapeEarnings Retail Sales Econ #s Markets © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Well, sort of. After initially igniting on Facebook, the most recent social media venue of choice continues to be Twitter, where Jessica appears to be enjoying the attention she is getting from the “Jenelle Hatters” by spilling tea about the reality star. Meanwhile, Jenelle continues to keep the family drama off of her personal Twitter and Facebook feeds and instead fights back via her @JenelleEvansPR Twitter account. JENELLE N JESSICA FEUD PART 1 JENELLE N JESSICA FEUD PART 2 JENELLE N JESSICA FEUD PART 3 The bullet points in the latest round are as follows: JESSICA SAYS • Her brother David Eason is a hard worker and has his own money, although she concedes that he may be on workmen’s comp because Jenelle “keeps him in hibernation so who knows” • Maryssa did not write that Mother’s Day letter to Jenelle • After Jenelle supposedly cleaned a toilet with Maryssa’s toothbrush, David and Maryssa were leaving when Jenelle “threw her cup of drink at maryssas window!” reminiscent of the time Jenelle “accidentally” threw a mason jar of freshly constructed ice water at Nathan’s girlfriend Jessica • Nothing new on the “weed gummy” JENELLE SAYS • Maryssa did write the Mother’s Day letter and it was filmed • Whitney had sex with “old guys” for money • Whitney abuses drugs and she “lost every job given to her lately because she is nodding out on pills… now david hears its heroin” WHITNEY SAYS • Nothing really because she couldn’t download the Twitter app due to Jenelle blowing up her phone And here’s the full Monty preserved for posterity: JESSICA EASON TWEETER: Quick question for you, how long has your brother been unemployed? Did he quit working after the 1st night? JESSICA: David works his ass off.. Hard worker.. If he and je have plans to go do whatever they do then im sure it doesnt hurt them financially… Thats so petty. He is a welder, pipe fitter, and metal fabricator.. Hes always been a hard worker. He goes w her bc he can. He has his own $ JESSICA: No i dnt look at tht type of material unless i get a notification or someone tells me TWEETER: It was simply a question to clarify another one of Jenelle’s lies. If he isnt working, fine – but Jenelle doesnt need to lie about it. JESSICA: Its a family company.. He isnt gonna get fired if he has other plans or obligations. Business or pleasure. He can go. Then come back and wrk JESSICA: Its pretty simple.. Not tht confusing.. TWEETER: Ok, understandable. So he essentially has the freedom to just not work for as long as he wants, ie, for as long as Jenelle is sugar mama. JESSICA: Ur. Dumb. TWEETER: That was simply a statement that he has freedom to be away from work for extended periods. Only negative part was towards Jenelle, because you damn well know she’s a habitual liar and a fraud, rotten to the core. TWEETER: I’m just wondering why he’s on this show and not back in the bargain bin at Walmart where he belongs. #TeenMomOG [This tweet was in response to a Matt Baier tweet — Jessica wasn’t tagged and I have no idea why she responds] JESSICA: F**k u. Damn the stupidity in here is thick af TWEETER: I think you forgot how to use twitter for a second. That was directed at Grandpa Matt. TWEETER: She told everyone he was off on workmens comp, huge difference if he’s playing the system. JESSICA: He could be… She keeps him in hibernation so who knows JESSICA: Omfg #tea bags errrrryyyy where. Im still on the line… Good lort yall so much effin tea. JESSICA: Im drowning #webouttof*ckab!tchup Lmao JESSICA: Whitney is about to join us…. #itaintaboutthamoney Shes downloading twitter as we speak JESSICA: “Id appreciate it if youd not tell everyone i used maryssa’s toothbrush for the toilet thats all bye” Signed JE JESSICA: And whitneys reaponse to that request from jenelle was, “why? If it aint about tha money?” JESSICA: Someones been textin my girl whitney 2day tellin her to keep her mouth shut.. JESSICA: Like really? Did u really think someone here was on your side? #thisaintnationwide JESSICA: Damn SS had to switch counties when yall moved? That would suck having weekly visits like tht TWEETER: Yeah. Even Jenelle isn’t as stupid as to send a text incriminating herself. JESSICA: Uhhh.. Yeah she is TWEETER: ..this is Whitney messaging you. Where’s a SS of the original conversation between Jenelle and Whitney? TWEETER: … So what does this prove? JESSICA: Jenelle doesnt ppl to knw wht happened tht day. TWEETER: Is there an a missing from your keyboard or are you just abbreviating it bc I’m sure you have a very impressive job to get to JESSICA: U mean missing ‘key’ ? I dont know are u missing one? TWEETER: It proves, that some yokels from bfe thought just bc the tall slow one for on tv that ppl would be interested in what they have to say JESSICA: They are interested u dumb@ss… #focus #whyareyouhere ? TWEETER: Well I’m hear bc someone made a huge production and countdown to some major tea and instead it’s just a bunch of choppy misspelled tweets JESSICA: Ya know what.. Im blockin u.. Bye felicia JESSICA: When david and maryssa went to leave because of the toothbrush deal, JE threw her cup of drink at maryssas window! TWEETER: Well, if something disrespectful was done to his daughter why did David go back? What voodoo does she do on these men?!?!? JESSICA: I guess she apologized JESSICA: Someones child hates JE and did NOT write sh!t! Why would u throw your glass of drink at a childs window? Because she told on u! TWEETER: To clarify: are you saying Maryssa did not write that letter to Jenelle?? JESSICA: She did not write it JESSICA: So if ur child doesnt wanna go around the new GF because she is rude to her, u take their phone away from her before u leave as punishment? JESSICA: Then JE takes, said phone, and starts texting the mom threatening to fight her.. Whitney would whip ur ever lovin ass JESSICA: Jenelle whered u go tough girl? JESSICA: All those staged pics w my niece.. Acting as if she likes u now.. For show.. Then writing a fake ass 2pg essay for her. #fakeassb!tch JESSICA: Duuuudde… What kinda weirdo does that? TWEETER: The bigger ? is why would you brother stay with a female that acts that way toward his child? That’s messed up! JESSICA: I think shes fake to his face. Thick wool from lots of practice JESSICA: Annnnnddd not to bury my own brother.. Im just shocked u thought she wouldnt give me your new number lmao! TWEETER: do you know anything about Jenelles custody case for Jace? JESSICA: No i cant say i do. I know it is currently under way.

When the Obama administration agreed to set the first-ever federal limits on runoff in Florida, environmental groups thought the states waters would finally get clean from a nutrient overdose that spawns algal blooms, suffocates rivers, lakes and streams, and forms byproducts in drinking water that could make people sick. The Florida rule is one of a string of regulations delayed at federal agencies, or at the White House office responsible for reviewing new rules. Together, they highlight the administrations cautiousness in an election year, where it has been increasingly under attack by Republicans and business groups for favoring big government and costly regulations that they allege kill jobs.

Alexander Ciccolo, 25, was arrested July 4, 2015, during an FBI sting when Ciccolo allegedly collected a duffel bag full of weapons from a cooperating witness outside his apartment. An FBI affidavit states Ciccolo, who had adopted the Muslim alias Ali Al Amriki, became enamored with the Islamic State group and was radicalized online. He began collecting explosives and arms for terror attacks he told an unnamed witness he planned to carry out at a college campus, a police station and other public sites, according to court records. He bought a pressure cooker at Wal-Mart, investigators have said, which was among the makeshift weapons of choice in the Boston Marathon bombings. Ciccolo's father is a Boston Police captain and was a first responder at the bombings. Ciccolo was first charged with illegal weapons possession and assault on a prison nurse. He was indicted in 2016 on charges of attempted provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization and attempted use of weapons of mass destruction. He pleaded not guilty to those charges in July wearing a taqiyah, traditional Muslim headwear, and refusing to rise to answer the charges in U.S. District Court in Springfield. Following his arrest, the U.S. attorney's office released a video clip of Ciccolo's voluntary interview with an FBI agent during which he asserts that "ISIS is good" and their public beheadings were "just." When federal agents searched his apartment, they found several partially constructed Molotov cocktails, or incendiary devices filled with shredded foam packing material soaked in motor oil. Law enforcement officials contend Ciccolo said he hoped the mixture would ignite and stick to people's skin. As the case inches toward a potential trial date, prosecutors recently invoked the Classified Information Procedures Act, passed by Congress in 1980 and designed to avoid or delay disclosing sensitive government secrets to criminal defendants in the normal course of discovery. A public filing in the case docket on May 11 states that two assistant U.S. attorneys and a trial lawyer with the U.S. Justice Department's Counterterrorism Section and National Security Division filed a memo under seal with the court for an order sanctioning the move. A previous filing by Ciccolo's attorney, David P. Hoose, states prosecutors have attempted to block the defense from receiving certain evidence they regard as classified, including the names of cooperating government witnesses and certain portions of the "pole camera" surveillance video. However, the government later agreed to provide the defense with an unredacted version of the video, according to filings. An April 18 letter filed with the court by Hoose argues that getting what would otherwise be standard disclosures from the government during a criminal prosecution has been more of an uphill battle given the national security element of Ciccolo's case. "We continue to insist that the Government provide us with monikers, and the true names used by the 'confidential human sources' and the undercover agents that have previously only been named by number," Hoose said, after noting that the pole camera had been installed outside his client's home for six months. Hoose also asked for the name of any prospective expert witnesses on the Islamic State. In addition, the defense attorney wrote that he believes Ciccolo never had any contact with "any actual person known to be connected with the Islamic State" and requested evidence to the contrary. A trial date has yet to be set in the case. Ciccolo faces 25 years in prison if convicted.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch Dock Set Released Posted: May 19 2017, 5:04am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The new Nintendo Switch Dock Set accessory is shipping. Nintendo announced a bunch of new accessories for the Nintendo Switch a couple weeks ago. One of the new accessories is the Nintendo Switch Dock Set. The Nintendo Switch Dock Set is released and is shipping from online retailers. Nintendo Switch owners should also be able to find the Dock Set in stores today. Amazon.com has not got any Dock Set inventory for some reason. Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con in Stock Online The Nintendo Switch Dock Set retails for $89.99. Several shops including Best Buy are selling the Nintendo Dock Set.  The Nintendo Dock Set gives Switch owner the convenience to dock their Switch unit at two locations without having to haul around the dock. Includes a Nintendo Switch Dock, Nintendo Switch AC Adapter, and High Speed HDMI an HDMI Cable. Most Nintendo accessories are easy to find in stock, but that is not true for the console itself. The only option to buy a Nintendo Switch console online today is through one of the three Nintendo Switch bundles GameStop is offering.  For the current Nintendo Switch stock availability read our daily market report. With the new The Tracker app consumers can get notified when the Nintendo Switch is in stock online at major retailers. There are still more announced Nintendo accessories coming. On June 16, Nintendo will release the new funky Neon Yellow Joy-Con controller. The Switch consoles supports to connect up to 8 Joy-Con controllers. A pair of Switch Joy-Con controllers retails for $79.99, making controller sales a great add-on business for the Japanese video game maker. The Neon Yellow Joy-Con controllers will sell out for sure, as the Neon Red and Neon Blue Joy-Con pair are already difficult to find in stock. Reseller prices are $40 above the MSRP for these Joy-Con controllers. The $79.99 Neon Yellow Joy-Con controllers are available for pre-order at Best Buy, GameStop and Walmart. Nintendo will start to ship these new Joy-Con controllers on June 16. Also available on June 16 will be the fitting $7.99 Neon Yellow Joy-Con Strap. Also to be released on June 16 are the Nintendo Joy‑Con (L) and Joy‑Con (R) AA Battery Pack. This $34.99 Switch accessory allows gamers to extend the battery life of their Joy-Con controllers. The Joy-Con AA Battery Packs are available for pre-order at Best Buy, GameStop and Walmart. Walmart is expected to sell the Nintendo Switch again on Friday. The giant retailer is offering the Switch in flash sales on Fridays at 5pm ET. Download our new online stock tracker app The Tracker to get notified about new Nintendo Switch inventory. ToysRUs restocks the Nintendo Switch Friday morning in stores around the nation. Lining up before the stores open is required. Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The only number the company made official is the production volume over the next 12 months. 10 million Switch consoles are planned to enter retail channels until end of April 2018. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories.

BENTONVILLE -- Rapper Travis Scott will not have to make a return trip to Rogers next month for a court appearance, according to the attorney who represents him. Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, was arrested Saturday night after his concert at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in Rogers. He is charged with inciting a riot, disorderly conduct and endangering the welfare of a minor, according to a Facebook post by the Rogers Police Department. Fayetteville attorney Drew Ledbetter, who represents Scott, said he already waived Scott's appearance and entered a plea of innocent to the charges, all misdemeanors. Scott's arraignment was scheduled for 1 p.m. June 13 in Rogers District Court. Ledbetter said it is a normal for attorneys to waive their clients' appearances for arraignments in district court. Police stated on Facebook that Scott "encouraged people to rush the stage" during the show. Multiple people were injured, including a concert security employee and a police officer, authorities said. The injured people were treated at the scene, police said. "Travis Scott had no criminal intent," Ledbetter said. "He only intended to put on a good show." [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] Scott was taken to the Benton County jail and was released on citation a short time later. Jennifer Waymack, senior staff attorney for the city, said she could not comment on the case. The citation functions as the charging document in district courts, Waymack said. Scott was arrested by Chicago police in August 2015 after he encouraged Lollapalooza attendees to climb over security barricades and storm the stage, according to a Rolling Stone story. His performance lasted just five minutes before being shut down after dozens of fans joined him on the stage, according to Rolling Stone. Scott pleaded guilty to reckless conduct in December 2015, Billboard reported. A judge ordered Scott to remain under court supervision for a year, according to Rolling Stone. Brian Crowne, vice president of the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion , said 9,000 people attended the concert. Concert attendance at the music pavilion can range from 3,000 to 10,000 depending on the act, Crowne said. Many large format concerts and other events have taken place at the pavilion without any problems, Crowne said.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch Neon Bundle Deals Gone Posted: May 19 2017, 1:30am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     The video game retailer GameStop and Target are selling the Nintendo Switch online. The Nintendo Switch continues to be hard to find online and in stores. Customers who are ready to get games and accessories with the initial purchase of the Nintendo Switch could chose between four Nintendo Switch bundles offered online. Now only two bundles are left, only featuring the Switch with Gray Joy-Con. Don't Miss: Find Rare Products in Stock Online with The Tracker GameStop has been selling Switch bundles online for the past weeks. GameStop offers the Switch console is now down to only one bundle. The three bundles offered last week had been replaced by three new new Switch bundles on the weekend. Two of them featured the more popular Switch with Neon Joy-Con. The bundles with the Switch with Neon Joy-Con have sold out.  The remaining Nintendo Switch Gray Joy-Con Bundle selling for $484.99 includes the Nintendo Switch Console with Gray Joy-Con, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Physical Game), Has-Been Heroes (Digital Game), Switch Racing Wheel Accessory 2-Pack, Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, and Snipperclips (Digital Game).  The new Nintendo Switch bundles at GameStop.com are more attractive than the previous three, but have a release date of May 26. The bundles available last week shipped within 24 hours. On Monday Target also started to offer a Nintendo Switch bundle. The $499.99 Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Starter Bundle contains Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Nintendo Pro controller and a Switch bag. Target has their bundle still in stock. Shoppers have more options on Friday, May 19 to buy a Nintendo Switch. ToysRUs restocks the Nintendo Switch console in stores this morning. Walmart is expected to sell the Nintendo Switch again online at 5pm ET. Shoppers can track the availability of the three new Nintendo Switch bundles at GameStop with the The Tracker. Check the availability of the Nintendo Switch Neon Joy-Con Digital Bundle, Nintendo Switch Gray Joy-Con Bundle, Nintendo Switch Neon Joy-Con Physical Bundle and the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con Starter Bundle. The Nintendo Switch reseller markups keep steady and range today between $85 to $100 for the Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy-Con and $99 to $130 for the Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con on amazon.com. Getting a bundle from an official store makes sense as long as customers wanted to by the bundle games anyway.  Besides GameStop the only known online shop that sells the Nintendo Switch online is Walmart. The giant retailer is offering the Switch in flash sales on Fridays at 5pm ET. Download our new online stock tracker app The Tracker to get notified about new Nintendo Switch inventory. Nintendo is ramping up the production for the Nintendo Switch, but has not disclosed what the current production capacity per month is. The only number the company made official is the production volume over the next 12 months. 10 million Switch consoles are planned to enter retail channels until end of April 2018. The demand for the Nintendo Switch will spike during the Holiday Shopping season 2017. Nintendo will set aside a large part of the Switch production during the next months for November and December. This stock piling will keep the Nintendo Switch in short supply during the next 5 months. As Nintendo coordinated new Switch console shipment with the launch of Mario Kart 8, we expect the company to do the same for the next major Switch game launches. This means the next big wave of new Switch consoles comes in mid-June for the release of ARMS. There are also several new accessories coming on the market from Nintendo in the next weeks. See the full list of new Nintendo Switch accessories.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Nintendo Switch ToysRUs Restock Sale Event Updates Posted: May 19 2017, 10:12am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: May 19 2017, 10:17am CDT, in News | Technology News   Photo Credit: Getty Images Gallery 1 images   The Nintendo Switch is back in stock at ToysRUs on Friday, May 19. Updated. Nintendo delivered a new shipment of Nintendo Switch this week. Amazon restocked the Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch is available as bundle deals online at GameStop and Target. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com To find a $299.99 Nintendo Switch console in stock is impossible online and rather difficult in stores. This is different today. On Friday, May 19, ToysRUs restocks the $299.99 Nintendo Switch in limited quantities. ToysRUs recommends that customers get in line before doors open on Friday morning for a chance to purchase, the toy retailer told I4U News in a statement.  ToysRUs stores open at 10am local time on Friday. Lines will start hours before, depending how popular the ToysRUs location is. We predict that each ToySRUs retail location has not more than a dozen Switch consoles in stock. There are 875 ToysRUs and BabiesRUs locations around the Nation. We estimate that ToysRUs received shipment of about 5,000 Switch units that will be spread out across all stores. Updates: 11am ET: East Coast ToysRUs opened their doors. Customers report that stores had 10 to 15 Switch console on hand. Lines range from a handful to a more than a dozen people. Lines are not crazy and lining up at around 8am local time could be enough, depending on the popularity of the TRU location. 7am ET: The first shoppers are in line at the East Coast. Some TRU stores have up to 20 Switch consoles in stock, according to people who have called their local store.  We collect feedback from the lines to get some insight on how many Switch consoles are in stock. Please leave a comment below when TRU employees inform the line how many Switch are available. The ToysRUs stores feature special Switch decoration to welcome shoppers. This photo shows a ToysRUs store in Michigan prepared for Friday's Switch sale. A table is decked out with Switch accessories. The demand for the Switch is not as crazy anymore as it has been a couple weeks ago, but there will be people that line up 3 to four hours before the stores open. The market prices for the Nintendo Switch are still about $100 above retail, which keeps the Nintendo Switch interesting for scalpers. Friday is a big day to score the Nintendo Switch. Shoppers who lose out on the ToysRUs Switch sale can try to buy the Nintendo Switch at 5pm online at the Walmart Online shop. The last time ToysRUs restocked the Nintendo Switch was on Friday, April 28. To find your local ToysRUs store visit toysrus.com. ToysRUs is not going to sell the Nintendo Switch online on Friday. Nintendo sold 280,000 Nintendo Switch consoles in April, making it top the video game hardware charts for the second month in a row. If Nintendo would be able to satisfy demand, the sales numbers would be considerably higher. Besides ToysRUs, Walmart is expected to sell the Nintendo Switch again on Friday. The giant retailer is offering the Switch in flash sales on Fridays at 5pm ET. Download our new online stock tracker app The Tracker to get notified about new Nintendo Switch inventory.

Note the 36h pattern of sell-offs and recoveries that could confirm a bullish inverse Head & Shoulders reversal. Bulls are thus looking for a break above 7480 to open the door for a 90pt advance and fresh record highs. Bears are merely looking for a breach of overnight lows and retrace to yesterday’s low. Watch levels: Bullish 7480, Bearish 7455. A positive opening call comes after US bourses found their mojo last night, recovering some of their recent losses. Asian investors have also largely progressed overnight, but sentiment still retains a cautious bias in response to recent political turbulence, not just on the UK but in Brazil too. How equities close today will be telling as to investor confidence about holding risk over the weekend. Japan’s Nikkei is higher thanks to Yen weakness and gains for Sharp. Australia’s ASX is the lone loser despite commodities pointing back north, especially oil and precious metals, boosted by positive production cut rhetoric and a resumption of USD weakness. Both FX and commodities still a major driver. US equity markets stage a minor recovery on Thursday as political tensions came off the boil, allowing all three major bourses to close higher. Mixed results for Dow Jones components saw Wal-Mart lead the index higher, offsetting losses for Cisco, while Telecoms led 8 other sectors higher on the S&P 500 as Energy lagged behind the wider market. The Tech-focused Nasdaq once again returned to outperformance, benefiting from investor bargain hunting. Crude Oil prices have risen overnight as Russia’s Rosneft, the country’s largest oil producer, is the latest name in the market to lend its support to extending OPEC-led production cuts. This latest seal of approval has pushed both Brent and US benchmarks to test resistance levels of $53 and $50 dollars respectively, the latest hurdles in the commodity’s recovery from early May’s 5-month lows. Having been subject to profit taking on Thursday, Gold has recovered from support overnight to trade back above $1250. Long standing intersecting resistance at $1262 will likely remain a hurdle should US dollar weakness help the precious metal to rally, with $1272 the next target, whilst continued profit taking could bring shallow 1-week rising lows support at $1248 into question for a return to January rising lows support at $1220. In focus today, amid a very light sprinkle of macro-economic prints, will be the busy roster of speakers throughout the day, and global political developments from the US to Brazil to the UK. This morning we kick off with the EU’s Dombrovskis (9am), Chancellor Merkel and ECB Chief Economist Praet (10am; panel on “How to address the still low level of banking integration?” at the ECB/EC conference on Financial Market Integration). This afternoon sees the ECB’s Coeuré (12pm; conf. on world economy by International Center for Monetary & Banking Studies) and Constancio (1pm; “Banking union and capital markets union: interaction & synergies” at ECB/EC conf. on Financial Market Integration) followed by the Fed’s Bullard (2.15pm; "U.S. Economy & Monetary Policy") and Williams (6.40pm; “view from a policy maker”). Data includes UK CBI trends (11am; forecast unchanged), Eurozone Consumer confidence (3pm; small improvement forecast) and the weekly Baker Hughes Rig Count (6pm) for the latest update on what is widely accepted rising US production at odds with struggling OPEC-led cuts.

By elizabeth l., as told to Samantha Lefave May 19, 2017 My daughter, Kassidy, is a picky eater. I'm just going to get that out of the way immediately. She definitely likes more interesting foods than your typical four-year-old — she's really into sushi, for instance — but she's gone through her fair share of loving a food one day, then refusing to touch it with a 10-foot-pole the next. She also has a lot of allergies, so I have to be cognizant of what ingredients are in certain foods. Otherwise, within a few minutes, she'll break out in hives on her hands, cheeks, and chest. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Still, for the most part, she eats what the family eats. For dinner, that means a protein, vegetable, and a small serving of carbs. If I make peas or corn, she devours it with no argument. Zucchini, though, is a major no-go. Chicken and steak are winners, but pork and seafood are 100 percent out in her mind. Most of the time, I cook. We don't order out a lot, and I try to stay away from packaged foods when I can. But I'm not going to pretend I'm some superhero mom. Sometimes there's just not enough time. Like now, for instance: As soon as my daughter's home from school, we have play dates, then housework, and somewhere in between I have to throw together a quick meal before heading off to T-ball. So she may very well get a sandwich and carrot sticks before we're out the door. That's why, when I was asked if I would feed her frozen dinners for a week, I was intrigued. I was skeptical, too — with her allergies, could she even eat these foods? Would the dinners be loaded with sodium and ingredients I couldn't pronounce? Would she even pick up the fork for a bite? But I was also hopeful. Maybe, just maybe, we would find something that clicked. A quickie dinner that I felt good about serving her, and a meal that she would actually eat and enjoy. Grocery shopping was really tough. While scouring the frozen section of Walmart, I realized just how difficult it was to find meals that had at least one vegetable in them while still being kid-friendly. It was nearly impossible. So I ended up with Weight Watchers Smart Ones Pizza for one night, knowing I'd serve baby carrots alongside it. The next store had better options. I'd seen the Kidfresh brand mentioned in a mommy Facebook group discussing how to get picky eaters to eat vegetables, and apparently they puree the vegetables and hide them in the food. So I grabbed the mac 'n' cheese variety, one of her favorite dinners, and crossed my fingers that she wouldn't notice the difference. I also tossed Michelina's chicken fried rice into the cart, as the chicken, rice, and peas are all pretty child-friendly. But I will admit, I wasn't super impressed with the nutrition label. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Finally, a third grocery store had the rest of my options. (Seriously, I had to go to three stores. No way that'll happen on a regular basis.) I grabbed a Lean Cuisine alfredo pasta — I know she won't be excited about the broccoli, but the noodles and chicken may win her over. And a Kid Cuisine mini corn dogs box went into the cart because there's a serving of vegetables with each meal, and the corn dogs are made out of turkey, making them a slightly healthier option. I'm not a fan of how much of this meal is bad (3/4 of the items are unhealthy), but I remember eating them as a kid myself, and I know the kid-friendly set-up will be a hit with my daughter. As soon as we sat down for night one, I could tell this week would be interesting. Night One Meal: Kid Cuisine Mini Corn Dogs Going into this experiment, I wanted to drum up as much excitement as I could so she wouldn't put up too much of a fight when it was time for dinner. So each day, I let her choose which frozen meal she got to have. Tonight, she went for the corn dog, telling me she liked the penguin on the box. As soon as she started eating, she told me she thought the corn was supposed to be mac 'n' cheese, but it was OK, so she would still eat it. (Thanks for letting me know, child.) Of course she liked the corn dog, and she was excited for the brownie at the end. I was impressed that she ate the whole thing; she only needed one reminder that she didn't get the brownie if she didn't eat the corn first. So this one was definitely kid-approved — but at 490 calories, 15g of fat, and 760mg of sodium, it definitely wasn't mom-approved. I did understand the convenience of frozen meals, though: It was T-ball night, and it was hella hard to get out of the house on time even without her fighting over food.

Night Two Meal: Weight Watchers Smart Ones Thin Crust Pepperoni Pizza Once Kassidy piled into the car after school, all she talked about was dinner. "I'm going to have pizza, mom," she said over and over again. Clearly, being in charge of picking dinner is a hit. That, or the idea of having pizza is the real winner. Probably a little of both, if I'm being totally honest. Unfortunately, though, this one was a big miss. The first thing she did was pick the pepperoni off (because she's four and picky), and after a few bites, she gave me a thumbs down. When I asked her why, because she's eaten any other pizza she's ever been given, she told me, "The ends (crust) are good, but the middle is gross. That sauce is disgusting." Oh well — at least the carrots were a hit. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Rating: 1 out of 5 stars courtesy of Elizabeth L. Night Three Meal: Kidfresh Wagon Wheels Mac + Cheese This is the one meal that I've been excited for Kassidy to try. Seriously, I watched her put the fork to her mouth and realized I was holding my breath as she ate. "Why are you being weird?" she asked. Alright, kid, I can take a hint. Anyway, my fingers were crossed because she decided that she hates cooked carrots this week, and although she couldn't see any veggies, there were pureed carrots mixed into the cheese sauce. And at only 270 calories, 12g of protein, and a mere 4g of sugar, I wouldn't feel bad about keeping a few on hand. Verdict: She liked it! Her favorite part was that the noodles were shaped like "snowflakes," and she finished the whole thing without any complaint. I'm deeming this one a major win.

Night Four Meal: Lean Cuisine Alfredo Pasta With Chicken & Broccoli Once she took a bite of the noodles, the first thing Kassidy said was, "This kind of tastes like mac 'n' cheese, and I like mac 'n' cheese." Thinking this could be a back-to-back success, I encouraged her to eat more; this time with some of the sauce. That's where things went downhill. She quickly changed her opinion of the meal, deeming it "yucky." After a few more bites, she said she was done and asked for strawberries instead. Le sigh. Rating: 2 out of 5 stars courtesy of Elizabeth L. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Night Five Meal: Michelina's Chicken Fried Rice From the very beginning, Kassidy was not a fan of this dinner. So clearly the whole thought process behind me choosing a meal with ingredients she usually likes — chicken, rice, and peas — was dead wrong. She told me the rice was no good, the peas tasted like "rotten apples," and the chicken was gross. Oh, and because she apparently hates cooked carrots now, that was a bust, too. Lovely. I can't say I'm too upset, though. Just one serving has 1,140mg of sodium and 11g of fat. I like that it has 12g of protein, but with the other nutrition facts I wouldn't serve this to her again. Rating: 1 out of 5 stars courtesy of Elizabeth L. At the end of the week, I asked Kassidy what she thought about her meals. She said some were good — the corn dogs, unsurprisingly, were her favorite, and the mac 'n' cheese was a win, so I'd be willing to try more from the Kidfresh line as we juggle T-ball, school, and the 101 other things on the calendar. But when I asked if she wanted to keep eating frozen meals or if she likes it better when I cook dinner, she immediately said, "I want you to cook for me." Guess I'm doing something right in the mom department. Follow Redbook on Facebook.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Weird World Man wrestles deer that wandered into Minnesota Walmart store Shoppers speculated that the animal was in search of a snack when it entered the store. By Karen Noronha May 19, 2017 07:49 BST The deer caused commotion when it galloped down the aisles of Minnesota Walmart - representational imageREUTERS/Mike Segar UNITED STATE - Tags: ENVIRONMENT CITYSCAPE ANIMALS TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY A deer that wandered into the pet aisle of a Walmart store in central Minnesota was tackled by a shopper on Tuesday (May 16). Tom Grasswick held the animal down until it could be carried outside and set free, authorities said. The confused white-tailed deer entered the store at around 7.30pm local time in the big-box store in Wadena, 150 miles northwest of Minneapolis, police said, causing commotion as it galloped down the aisles. Shoppers at the store speculated that the young animal was in search of a snack when it entered the store through the garden centre doors. The picture of the man pinning down the deer went viral on Facebook. Grasswick, who happens to live in Deer Creek told WDAY, "I figured I was bigger than the deer, so I'd win that wrestling match." His first instinct was to tackle the animal and to bring it down on a pallet of dog food, he said. Stephanie Koljonen, a witness said, "We were in the pet food aisle and hear what sounds like a shelf falling onto a woman, because a woman screamed who the deer had run into." She said that the deer was slipping and sliding on the floor of the store until a man "slid into" the deer and held it. "Tom was just holding her gently but securely so no one including the deer would get injured," she said. Koljonen posted the photo of the deer whisperer covering the animal's eyes in an effort to keep it from resisting. Once the animal calmed down enough, the store employees used a dog leash to tie the animal. It was later carried outside and freed, according to the police, who added that neither the deer nor its human rescuers appeared hurt in the commotion.

Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 959.84 +1.35 +0.14% Graham Holdings Co GHC ▲ 600.40 +8.90 +1.50% Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.A ▲ 244,910.00 +2,400.00 +0.99% Skeptics of Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder, have spent the better part of the past two decades second-guessing and vilifying him: He has been described as “a monopolist,” “literary enemy No. 1,” “a notorious international tax dodger,” impossible, a ruthless boss and — more than once — “Lex Luthor.” His company used to routinely be described as Amazon.con. But you know what? Here we are, 20 years later, and Mr. Bezos has an authentic, legitimate claim on having changed the way we live. He has changed the way we shop. He has changed the way companies use computers, by moving much of their information and systems to cloud services. He’s even changed the way we interact with computers by voice: “Alexa!” Along the way, he has bought — and fixed — The Washington Post, one of the nation’s premier journalistic institutions. And through his aerospace company, Blue Origin, he has invested billions of dollars in the race to space, a onetime hobby that, if successful, could change the world much more profoundly than free one-day shipping. Even Warren Buffett was skeptical of Amazon way back when. “I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen,” he admitted at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting this month. “I’ve admired Jeff, and I’ve admired him for a long, long time. But I did not think he was going to succeed on the scale that he has.” Load Error Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter Mr. Buffett added, “We missed it entirely.” He called Mr. Bezos’ work “a remarkable business achievement,” saying, “One person has built an extraordinary economic machine in two pretty different industries almost simultaneously, from a standing start at zero, with competitors with lots of capital and everything else.” Mr. Buffett’s partner, Charles T. Munger, put it this way: “Jeff Bezos is a different species.” Today, Amazon’s valuation is $464 billion — twice the value of Walmart. If you had invested $10,000 at the I.P.O., you’d have nearly $5 million today. Sometimes praise is due. And he is clearly having a moment.© Andrew Kelly/Reuters Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, was able to find investors willing to trust him enough to invest in the company even as it racked up loss after loss. Perhaps the most surprising thing Mr. Bezos was able to accomplish, despite his detractors, was to find investors willing to trust him enough to invest in Amazon even as it racked up losses after losses. That’s not to say investors were always happy with Mr. Bezos — they would frequently punish his stock, making it seem like a volatile investment. Then, every so often, he would surprise investors with profits, as if to suggest, “Yes, we can make money whenever we want, if we don’t want to invest in the future.” Most executives are worried about the next quarter, but Mr. Bezos is worried about what will happen years from now. That is a competitive advantage that many chief executives could learn from. “If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you’re competing against a lot of people,” Mr. Bezos told Wired in 2011. Here, he was expressing the view that some chief executives think in three-year cycles — a relatively generous assessment, given that most top executives don’t last many more years than that. “But,” he continued, “if you’re willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you’re now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that.” To Mr. Bezos’ credit, he was always upfront with his ambitions and long-term approach. “Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh trade-offs differently than some companies,” he wrote in his first letter to shareholders in 1997. “We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the ‘right’ investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.” None of this is meant to suggest that Mr. Bezos is perfect. Far from it. He has repeatedly failed — remember his ill-fated foray into mobile phones? — but he has succeeded enough to outweigh his failures. And along the way, he is likely to fail again, something he says he embraces. Is Mr. Bezos an easy boss? Hardly. He is unbelievably demanding. But it is difficult to believe that the creative new products Amazon has incubated and introduced could have been born if he were a professional soul-crusher. As an author, I’m supposed to hate Mr. Bezos. After all, he has pressured publishers, cut their margins and practically put old-school bookstores out of business. As if to rub it in, he’s now introducing bricks-and-mortar Amazon bookstores. But to take that view would be to misunderstand what innovation looks like. It upends industries — witness the current carnage in the retail industry, which has been outmoded by Amazon and all the companies trying to copy it. “Amazon is not happening to book selling,” Mr. Bezos explained, defending his role in a 2013 interview with Charlie Rose. “The future is happening to book selling.” And the future is now happening to retail stores and even supermarkets — Mr. Bezos’ next conquest. And the future is clearly happening to enterprise computing. Mr. Bezos has a famous laugh; look it up on YouTube. He has every right to be laughing right now.

Michael Aaron, KYTX 8:14 PM. CDT May 18, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST VAN ZANDT COUNTY - The family of an East Texas woman is pleading for answers one week after she was shot and killed while driving down a highway. According to the Van Zandt County Sheriff's Office, Sherry Banks, 62, of Edom died after crashing her car in a wooded area on FM 279, near the Van Zandt-Smith County line  Investigators say the crash occurred between 8 p.m. on Thursday, May 11 and 10 a.m. on May 12 after someone outside the vehicle shot Banks through the window. A driver saw Banks' vehicle crashed in the woods and called 911 Friday, alerting authorities.   The victim's son, Richard Banks, said it appears the shooting happened as his mom drove home to Edom after picking up medicine at Wal-Mart on Highway 64 in Tyler. "The scenario is so implausible and so crazy," he said. "It's either the craziest accident that ever happened or someone killed my mom for no apparent reason. I'm just hoping they'll come forward and fess up to what they did." Detectives have not identified a suspect or possible motive and are seeking the public's help, according to Sgt. Jacob Smith with the Van Zandt County Sheriff's Office. Richard described his mom as a sweet person who powered through tough times. They moved to East Texas from California seven years ago. "She was tough sometimes, and we butted heads so many times," he said. "If you look back, my mom was a really great mom and she did the best she could, and I'm forever thankful for that." Ms. Banks worked as a caretaker for elderly individuals. Her son said she also loved animals and spending time outdoors. Courtesy: Richard Banks   Just as his mom loved adventure, so does Richard, who hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 2014. On May 4, he began a hike up the Appalachian Trail -- which runs 2190 miles from Georgia to Maine. "My mom was so happy and proud that I was doing that and experiencing life, and she wished she could go more than anything," he said. 130 miles into his journey last Friday, Sherry's only son received news of her passing and flew to Texas as soon as possible. "I'm hoping that I can get her cremated and maybe take a piece of her with me and finish my journey with her, Richard said, adding that cremation was among Sherry's wishes. "I think that'd be really important and she would really love that." Sherry Banks and her son Richard (Courtesy: Richard Banks)   Meanwhile, he and other loved ones are left wondering about the person and the motive behind her death. "[It's] just a ruthless, unanswerable death that makes no sense whatsoever," said Richard. "I wish that on no one. No one deserves that." He asks anyone who thinks they might know something about the case to come forward. "If it was an accident for whatever reason, you need to be brought to justice," Richard said. "You need to at least accept what you did. If it was an accident, I'm a very forgiving person and things happen, but I need to know and my family needs to know who killed my mom and why. If it wasn't an accident I ask 'why' because she was the sweetest lady in the world." People with information about the death of Sherry Banks are asked to call the Van Zandt County Sheriff's Office at 903-567-4133 ext. 495 or Crime Stoppers at 903-567-7867 © 2017 KYTX-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Officer accused of dismissing tickets in exchange for teen's nude photos 14-year-old arrested for sexual assault FBI raid at hospice on Houston's south side Elderly woman killed by hit-and-run driver in the Heights Police: 1 dead in single-vehicle accident in South Houston Robbery suspects found hiding inside Dekaney HS Strip mall fire kills six-year fire fighter veteran, Scott Deem Man falls over edge at Topgolf in Fort Worth Sexual assault suspect in The Woodlands sought Condolences pour in for softball player in Forney More Stories Woman: Husband beaten, hogtied in violent home invasion May 19, 2017, 11:41 p.m. Wanted sexual assault suspect linked to case from 2013 May 19, 2017, 3:06 p.m. Hit-and-run driver kills 91-year-old woman in the Heights May 19, 2017, 4:43 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

I don’t even have a day planner Hamilton Spectator By Paul Benedetti We got the good news the way you seem to get pretty much everything now. On our phones. My wife got the first message from our son Matt's partner, Laura. "I GOT INTO MIDWIFERY! followed by three "Grinning Face with Smiling Eyes" emojis. Matt followed up by texting a GIF of a young Hans Solo saying, "Yahoo!" As an adult I thought I should phone and officially congratulate her and make some sage comments about the future. Instead I texted "Yipppeeeee!!" followed by four Grinning Face Emojis. I figure if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. But I worry about really important things being transmitted in this way. I can see a day when your phone buzzes with a text that says: "Impending sun explosion. World end. Bummer," with four Crying Faces and a GIF ad for an extreme sunblock sale at Walmart. Anyway, it was great news and a bit of a relief, really. Now we knew the path that Matt and Laura would be on for the next four years. Just the day before I had sat with our daughter, Ella, back from school, talking about a summer job, and next year and graduation and the rest of her life and, and …"Ahhhhhh!" That's actually me yelling, not her. All the talk about GPAs and job markets and LSATS and grad school made me feel suddenly faint. I thought it was caused by all the blood draining out of my head, but more likely it was the thought of all the money draining out of my wallet. It's fascinating and fun and scary watching the kids make their way in life: James with his new job and new apartment, Matt and Laura with a house and more school ahead, and Ella, momentarily confused, with a dozen ideas swirling in her head. And all of that made me think about myself at their age. Early twenties, finished school, a strapping confident young man heading out into the world. Too bad that wasn't me. I was unemployed, confused, and living at home. I had made some headway — my mom stopped walking me to school some years earlier and I had recently learned how to make myself coffee. Instant. I didn't really have a five-year plan. In fact, I didn't have any plan at all. I had a vague notion that typing might be a bit easier than, say, construction. I talked to my father. "I know a family," he said. "The Sicolis. Their daughter works at The Hamilton Spectator. Maybe you should talk to her." So, with more temerity than sense, I walked into the Spec newsroom one afternoon and met Florence Sicoli. She was very nice and introduced me to the city editor, John Gibson, a gruff but gentle Scotsman. He asked: "What do you know about hard news?" I knew a bit about hard rock and hard candy. "Uh, nothing," I said. "Ack. Go down to Entertainment and talk to Bill Muir," he said, waving me away. So I did. Bill was a lovely guy and I told him I liked arts and entertainment and would write whatever he wanted. He gave me an assignment — the Mum Show. I didn't even really know what a mum was, but I took it. That day was, in a lot of ways, the beginning of the rest of my life and it had all the planning of a summer rain shower. Since then, I've never really had any plan. And I thought, in an odd way, that I had found myself — in my sixties and wondering about the upcoming years — in pretty much the same boat as my kids. Last week, I wrote an email to my son, James, and said: "It struck me that, I'm kind of back at square one, where I was in my 20s (and where you are) trying to figure out what to do with 'my life.'" He wrote back: "I would like to think answers are granted to all of us somehow, but maybe part of it is creating our own. ... It really is a lifelong journey eh?" He's a pretty smart kid. And he's right. And so, I thought, you stand here, after all these years, asking yourself, and the world, the same question you did a long time ago. What's next?

The 5K event is sponsored by Target, PeachState, Wal-Mart and Kroger. As one of the signature events for  LHTYF, the Unite for Healthy Kids 5K is a fundraising initiative to support programs such as Gardens are for Kids and the Pinnacle Youth Scholarship Fund. "We hold this event at this time of year because May is National Physical Fitness and Sports month so we want to encourage families to exercise together and stay healthy together. We know that not only are we subject to be influenced by our peers, we're also influenced by our families, so execising together is a way to develop healthier family habits," said Lori A. Manns founder and president of Live Healthy & Thrive Youth Foundaton. According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Midcourse Report: Strategies to Increase Physical Activities Among Youth, youth need 60 minutes or more of physical activity each day where they live, learn, and play. Furthermore, research shows that active kids do better in school. The Unite for Healthy Kids 5K Walk/Run features a 5K race for the adults and a  kids race for children. This incorporates both young and old in the family structure." We wanted to include something for everyone at our 5K  event," said Manns. The actual race event will begin at 9 a.m. in parking lot C of the GSU  Decatur campus and end at approximately 11:30 a.m. Participants may register on-line for a fee of $30 which includes a souvenir T-shirt, gift bag and complimentary healthy snacks and beverages. Runners also have the opportunity to enter a drawing to win a Fit Bit,  gift card provided by Phidippides and Atlanta Braves home game tickets. The Atlanta Braves have partnered with Live Healthy & Thrive Youth Foundation for the 7th year in a row to offer free home games tickets compliments of the "Reach Out Be Our Guest" program for the participants who raise the most in donations for the Unite for Healthy Kids 5K Walk/Run. Local radio station WAMJ's midday on-air personality Maria More will be on hand to host the event and get participants warmed up to walk or run.
