(Mary Altaffer/Associated Press) The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to an oven near you. Hostess is launching packaged "Deep Fried Twinkies" that mark its first foray into frozen foods. By ANNE D’INNOCENZIO, Associated Press Published: August 12, 2016, 3:59 PM A   A NEW YORK — The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, launched packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” on Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain President Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Mo., headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, N.Y., who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said.

Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged "Deep Fried Twinkies" starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They'll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. ___ Tepid retail sales lower expectations for US economic growth WASHINGTON (AP) -- A sluggish month of retail spending has tempered expectations for the U.S. economy's growth in the coming months. Consumers pulled back on shopping and eating out in July after three straight solid monthly gains, the government said Friday. Those declines were offset by increases in auto sales and online and catalog sales. Many economists credited the surge in online and catalog spending, which rose 1.3 percent, mainly to deals offered during Amazon's "Prime Day" on July 12. Amazon said its sales rose 60 percent on Prime Day compared with a year earlier. ___ US stock indexes edge mostly lower; oil rises Wall Street capped a record-setting week with a day of mostly listless trading Friday that left the three major U.S. stock indexes essentially flat. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index closed slightly lower. The Nasdaq composite eked out a tiny gain, giving the tech-heavy index its fourth record-high close in a week. Investors mostly focused on the latest batch of company earnings from retailers and other companies, as well as new data indicating that U.S. retail sales in July were more sluggish than expected. ___ J.C. Penney reports smaller quarterly loss as sales improve NEW YORK (AP) -- After a tough start to the year, J.C. Penney's business enjoyed a bounce in the second quarter, fueled by efforts to bring back appliances and spruce up other sections of the store. The Plano, Texas-based department store chain reported a smaller loss for the second quarter compared to a year earlier as sales improved. CEO Marvin Ellison believes the company can maintain the momentum with a slew of new brands and other enticements coming in the next few months. In addition to its own efforts, Penney is benefiting from store closings by Macy's and Sears Holdings Inc. Ellison told analysts Friday the company has seen sales improve in malls where its rivals shuttered their stores. ___ 3 years into nation's hemp experiment, crop's future is hazy PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) -- Three years into the nation's hemp experiment, a 20-acre farm in southern Colorado exemplifies the crop's hazy potential. Hemp could be enormously profitable, but right now there are just as many questions as answers for Will and Ally Cabaniss, two Florida natives who moved to southern Colorado to embark on the hemp business. "Every day brings something new and different," said Will Cabaniss, holding up a red plastic cup containing a hemp seedling awaiting planting. "Right now we're just building data for the industry, seeing what works and what doesn't." ___ Fox News names Abernethy, Shine as co-presidents NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox News Channel founder Rupert Murdoch on Friday appointed two longtime Fox executives as the new co-presidents of the news network as it restructures after last month's departure of Roger Ailes following sexual harassment allegations. Both Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine were with Fox News when it started in 1996. Shine, who had been one of Ailes' top deputies, will run the editorial operations for Fox News and its sister Fox Business Network. Abernethy had left the news channel to run Fox's stable of 28 local stations and he'll keep that job, while overseeing the business operations of the two networks. Both will report to Murdoch, who will continue to oversee things as executive chairman. The moves sent a signal to Fox News viewers that despite a scandal that has widened since Ailes' resignation, they shouldn't worry that their favorite network is abandoning them. ___ Chinese auto sales accelerate in July BEIJING (AP) -- China's auto sales growth accelerated in July, an industry group said Friday, while General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. reported record demand for the month. Sales in the world's biggest auto market rose 26.3 percent to 1.6 million units, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said. Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, rose 23 percent to 1.8 million units. Sales of SUVs, whose explosive popularity has helped to buoy demand as other categories sagged, soared 47.4 percent to 580,000 vehicles. ___ South Korea to review toxins data disclosure process SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea plans to review if there was any negligence in the government's handling of sick workers' inquiries about workplace toxins, after an Associated Press investigation found the government repeatedly withheld such information following requests from Samsung. Ko Dong-woo, a director at the Labor Ministry, said Friday that the ministry took the AP report seriously and would ensure officials properly evaluate information requests from workers seeking government compensation for work-related illnesses. ___ China reports weaker July activity but says economy stable BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese factory output and other economic activity weakened in July, data showed Friday, but an official tried to reassure companies and investors growth is stable. Growth in retail sales, factory output and investment all decelerated from June levels, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Private sector analysts have warned economic growth, which held steady at 6.7 percent for the three months ending in June, was showing signs of weakening heading into the current quarter. The data indicate "the third quarter has started off on a weak footing," said Brian Jackson of IHS Markit in a report. ___ Smiley faces at small company making popular emoji apps Mobile apps that allow users to create their own emojis or share the stylized images of NBA star Stephen Curry and other celebrities are paying off for a small upstate New York company. Moji Maker— with its mix-and-match menu of happy, angry or goofy faces — was the No. 2 paid app on the iTunes chart as of Friday morning. The company that made it, Moji, recently scored big with its Curry app and is following up with similarly styled apps for two Olympic athletes who won gold this week: swimmer Michael Phelps and gymnast Simone Biles. ___ Security experts: Remotes are hackable on many vehicles FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A group of computer security experts say they figured out how to hack the keyless entry systems used on millions of cars, meaning that thieves could in theory break and steal items without leaving a broken window. The experts say that remote entry systems on millions of cars made by Volkswagen since 1995 can be cloned to permit unauthorized access to the car's interior. The same experts say another system used by other brands including Ford, General Motor's Opel and Chevrolet and Renault can also be defeated. ___ The Dow fell 37.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,576.47. The S&P 500 index lost 1.74 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,184.05. The Nasdaq bucked the trend, adding 4.50 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,232.89. Benchmark U.S. crude was rose $1, or 2.3 percent, to close at $44.49 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 93 cents, or 2 percent, to close at $46.97 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline added a penny to $1.37 a gallon, while heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.41 a gallon. Natural gas gained 3 cents to $2.58 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Mary Altaffer/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of It used to be that you could regret eating deep-fried Twinkies just a few times a year, whenever you went to a fair. Now, you can regret eating them every day. On Friday, Hostess unveiled a pre-battered, partially fried version of the treat that can be frozen for baking at home with a few minutes in the toaster oven or frying pan, reported the Associated Press. The snack, which comes with vanilla or chocolate cream, is the product of a yearlong collaboration with Wal-Mart, and for the first three months, the latter will have exclusive rights to its distribution. Hostess has debuted a number of products for the health-conscious recently, in line with a growing trend among consumers. But with nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the deep-fried Twinkie – like the carnivals and boardwalks where they remain a staple – is being branded more as a throwback to an earlier time when Americans thought less about their waistlines than about the passions of their palettes.

Take our quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 The deep-fried Twinkie is part of a push by Wal-Mart to collaborate with food suppliers on new products themselves – or new twists on old products. In June, the company opened a new food-innovation laboratory at its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters for that purpose. Michael Hicks, a distinguished professor of economics at Ball State University, who has studied the impact of Wal-Mart on local economies, tells The Christian Science Monitor that the lab would likely try to appeal to customers already in Wal-Mart stores. “They are also worried about keeping costs low, which probably means that they are experimenting not only with taste, but packaging and presentation,” he says. In a June interview with Talk Business and Politics, Charles Redfield, the head of Wal-Mart’s US food division, suggested that the new lab was a way of keeping down promotional costs. “On our own turf, we can go deep down into the product ingredients and better control the process of dead net cost [when vendor rebates are subtracted from the price up front],” he said, “and the result of that is that we can become better food experts.... It’s an education facility for us and our suppliers.” The site is part kitchen, part market-research incubator , where the company surveys customers and employees on the qualities of a food or drink. And with Wal-Mart continuing its reign as the nation’s largest food retailer, what goes on in the lab may have significant implications for Americans’ health. Robert Lawrence, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and founding director of the Center for a Livable Future, says the lab is also one of several that trace their origin to universities and corporations. “There are a few university-based food labs looking at promoting nutritional quality, then there are a whole raft of food labs doing the opposite, trying to get us to succumb to even more highly processed food,” he tells the Monitor. “Wal-Mart falls, I think, in that last category.” Many of those labs are spending lots of time on the science of gratification. Dr. Lawrence recalls being amazed by a presentation at a Google food lab from one group of scientists who described fitting taste-testers with microphones attached to the outside of their cheeks as they sampled new varieties of chips, to measure how different levels of crunchiness corresponded to consumers’ satisfaction. Food retailers, he said, “all have well-trained food scientists that understand things about taste and gratification and so forth that make it a big challenge for public health community to steer people toward a better diet.” “From a public health perspective, it’s very worrisome if someone as powerful as Wal-Mart’s grocery business is making an even more appealing snack food.” Next up Test your knowledge Are you a real foodie?

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Aug 12, 2016 at 3:30PM Both the cable and retail industries have entered a state of massive upheaval. Retail has been struggling for years against Amazon, which has changed the rules of the game. It's no longer enough to be convenient with just an OK price. The bar has been raised. Cable faces a similar problem, even if it's earlier in the game. Consumers have begun to slowly reject the current distribution model, which involves paying cable companies for access to more content than they actually want. In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, host Vincent Shen is joined by Motley Fool contributor Daniel Kline to discuss Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) decision to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion, and Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX) reasons for paying $583 million for a 10% stake in Hulu. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Aug. 9, 2016. Vincent Shen: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market each day. I'm Vincent Shen, your host. It is Tuesday, August 9th. Joining via Skype from Connecticut this time around. Right, Dan? Daniel Kline: I believe it's the third state I've done this podcast from. Shen: Yes, and that's all within the past couple of weeks, too, not like over a few months. How goes it, Dan? Kline: It's crazy. This is actually the last thing I do in my house before getting in the car and driving to West Palm Beach for "a permanent move." Shen: I have to say thanks again for joining us, because I know you have this and then a nice long, long, long drive ahead of you. I've done that drive before. Kline: I'm pumped up on cold brew, and one of the other Fools in our Slack board told me about caffeinated gum, so I think I'm ready for the journey. Shen: Getting to our topics today for the listeners, we have some M&A, or merger and acquisitions related topics on tap. Before we dive into that first story Dan, and this is relevant, I promise to listeners, I want to ask you this, what is your preferred streaming video service? Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)? Amazon? Hulu? Maybe Sling TV? Kline: The funny thing is ... So, I use Netflix. I pay for all three. I have Hulu and I have Amazon Prime, but I'm one of those people that got Amazon Prime because I buy things from Amazon. I can't say I've used their video service at all. I got Hulu to watch The Mindy Project six months ago and still have never used it because I'm halfway through the second season of Daredevil. I've traditionally been a big regular television full cable subscriber. I'm actually, when we move, going to give Sony's PlayStation Vue a try. I've also tested Sling TV. What I don't like about Sling TV is it's limited. It's a skinny bundle. It's a great price, but the Sony package for -- I don't know, $49, it varies based on market -- you get about a hundred channels, and it hits most of the things I would want. I'm going to be losing out on some of the regional sports and other things I would have paid for on cable, but when it comes to the pure streaming, that seems a good bet. And Netflix, the originals, it just has so much more stuff than anybody else does. Shen: You are still a traditional cable subscriber? Kline: I am until tomorrow technically. Shen: Okay. I've wanted to ask this, and I find it was really interesting because with our first story, and here's the lead-in, this news came out last week: Time Warner taking over a minority stake in Hulu. We're kind of seeing these worlds blend together. In just the example you gave with your own personal experience, you are a traditional cable subscriber, but you had these other streaming services, and all of this is kind of coming together for your personal experience and personal consumption of all this content, too. Time Warner we've covered from several different angles over the past few episodes. They announced last week taking a 10% ownership position in Hulu for prices about, I think it was $580 million, so that values--- Kline: Yeah, $550, $580, somewhere around there. Shen: Hulu valuation coming in at about $6 billion. For anyone who isn't familiar with Hulu, just some quick backstory, the service started in 2008. It's a joint venture started by some media and entertainment heavy-hitters. Think Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast, NBCUniversal, and now of course Time Warner. At the moment, Hulu has three offerings, but even that will be changing -- we can touch on that later -- has basically a free streaming option where you get to watch a full slate of ads with that. You have a $7.99 per month subscription option with limited ads. Then if you want to pay full price, it's $11.99 completely ad-free. The thing is, the key development with this Time Warner buyout, it seems to me at least, is the live-streaming service that Hulu plans to offer in 2017. Dan, how are these two companies, the joint venture owners thinking about this deal and the new service? Kline: It's important to note that Time Warner is buying in only for the live-streaming service. Time Warner has a big issue with the way Hulu operates now, which is they make current episodes of recent shows from its partners, not all shows because of ownership on the individual shows, but most Fox shows, most ABC shows, most NBC shows, you get 24 hours after a show airs, you can watch it and the last three or four episodes, maybe four or five in some cases on the $7.99 service, and in some cases on the free service. Time Warner thinks that's undervaluing its programming, especially because the numbers are not big enough that it's a major advertising source. Time Warner will not be contributing to that part of the service. What they're paying for is distribution. They see the amount of homes that have cable slowly getting smaller. Cable is dying, but it's going to take a long time at the current pace. What you have happening is they're paying this money so five years from now, when these types of services, Sling and PlayStation Vue, and the various cable networks, cable services not offering boxes but actually having pure digital, I think what you're going to see is by owning a piece of this, they guarantee themselves a place at the table. They're not going to have the contentious negotiations they have with the satellite providers over Sling or with Comcast every time rights to TBS and TNT and CNN come up. This is really just buying them access to homes as the cable role changes. Shen: Hulu, next year -- just to clarify what exactly they're going to be offering and Time Warner is buying into -- is a live streaming service that will actually include live television, which is a little bit different from what it currently does, which is more similar to Netflix. Kline: Basically, they're copying Sling, except because some of their partners are networks, Sling does not have any traditional broadcast networks. It sort of the most popular cable channels for younger people. What's happening here with Hulu is they're going to have some of the Fox, NBC, ABC programming. Maybe my mom can get it, and she'll still get the Nightly News. I don't think my mom watches the Nightly News, but if her mom was still alive, she would watch the Nightly News and maybe would have to get this type of product. Shen: There's not as many details as I was hoping there would be otherwise for the Hulu services coming out next year, but I think it's helpful for listeners just to give some context in terms of how far Hulu has come since it started back in 2008. Compare just for some basic contexts, Netflix, the leader here, has about 40 or over 40 million domestic subscribers that generate about $6.8 billion of revenue in 2015. The most recent numbers I could find for Hulu, for example, over 10 million subscribers, so a smaller base for sure, generated revenue of $1 billion in 2013. That grew pretty quickly to about $1.6 or $1.7 billion last year. The thing is, both of these companies, and this includes Amazon, too, all these streaming services fighting for content, they've been spending a lot of money for not only their original programming that all three have become known for, but also $5-$6 billion spent by Netflix in 2016 expected. The most recent number I could find for Hulu is about $1.5 billion in 2015. Kline: A lot of that is going to Seinfeld. Shen: Yes, I think it was like $700,000 or $1 million per episode for that. Kline: I think that's the differentiator between the two. Netflix is a service aimed at people in their 20s and 30s who maybe never had cable. Whereas Hulu, the content is really the stuff you would watch if you had a cable subscription a couple of days later, 24 hours later plus a few originals that feel like network shows. It's not groundbreaking in the way that Netflix is. It's sort of a familiar angle. It's when an older generation says, "You know what? I'm not paying $150 to Comcast anymore, but I still want to watch Law & Order. Hulu is trying to keep that model, and the challenge is not pushing cable subscribers away -- that's the last thing Comcast would want -- but also keeping as many of them that were going to leave anyway on the one that they own. You'll do better as Time Warner being a partner in Hulu than licensing your content to DISH or to Sony or the 20 other services like this that are going to start in the next few months. Shen: There's an interesting dynamic here because, as we mentioned, the joint venture owners for Hulu are the really big companies like Disney, you mentioned Comcast, NBC, Universal. This news just came out yesterday, actually, where I mentioned that first service is free to access Hulu content or some of the Hulu library, but it's supported by ads. They're actually getting rid of that entirely. Kline: The interesting thing is they're actually just moving it to Yahoo!. They announced a partnership deal. They're "unconfusing" the Hulu brand. Basically, Hulu is going to have two products. It's going to have a subscription product where you get access to next-day content from the original partners and not Time Warner, and then it's going to have a live-streaming television service. Having the free product on top of it, which inflated their viewer numbers by another 40 million, but didn't really make them a lot of money because it's really difficult to sell ads on three people watching a Seinfeld from 15 years ago and 17 people watching Family Guy. It becomes a very tough model to prove to advertisers that there's value. They're sort of just shunting that off and taking it off the Hulu brand, which makes sense. It will make it a lot easier for them to sell their two services that make sense. Shen: Stepping back now and looking at this in terms of some of the changes that are obviously happening to the industry, big picture, what do you think is going to be happening maybe next year, or with these developments as deals like these between Time Warner, Hulu, and Hulu service coming out next year? What do you think that's going to mean? Kline: I think it's the wild west. It think you're going to see every major cable company start a service that doesn't require a cable box in order to keep broadband customers. What's going to happen is you're going to have two or three years where there's 15 choices, and then you'll see consolidation again. There's no need for there to be Sling and Vue and whatever they call super Hulu. If Amazon enters that space, if Apple enters that space -- a lot of players are going to come here. Eventually, you're going to see it's just going to be like cable, where it doesn't really matter if you have Frontier or you have Comcast, pretty much you're getting the same offer. Maybe it becomes priced in customer service, but there's going to be a lot of announcements and a lot of new companies, or existing companies going into the space because the cable box is slowly going away. Shen: All right. Thanks a lot, Dan! I want to move onto our second segment now, which is related at least in that this is another industry that's kind of going through a lot of transition, some growing pains. It has had, I guess, quite a bit of disruptive innovation -- people like to use that term -- and that's retail. This week, it was confirmed that Walmart is pivoting its e-commerce strategy once again by acquiring Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Let me stop right there and provide background again for Jet, because this is one where in my, I guess, unscientific sampling of friends and fellow Fools, not everyone is really familiar with this company, frankly. It makes sense considering how young it is. It's only just over a year old at this point, and it's been scooped up for a pretty hefty price, there, I think one of the biggest e-commerce start-up price tags in history. Kline: They have crazy multiple on sales. They do about $1 billion in sales and they sold for $3.3 billion. You don't see money-losing companies get that kind of deal very often. Shen: That billion dollars is gross merchandise volume. Basically, the value of everything they sell on the site, but their revenue is actually just a piece of that, too, so it's a bit crazier than that. Kline: To finish what you were saying, Jet.com was built as an Amazon competitor. What Walmart is buying is partly their CEO, a guy named Marc Lore, who also started the company that owned Diapers.com, which Amazon bought. Jet.com used sort of a different method than what Amazon does. As a customer on Jet, you would build your order, and the more things you bought, the cheaper your price would get because it would be cheaper for them to deliver it to you. It's worth noting that Amazon does that after a fashion with add-on items. I think even Target and Walmart do it a little bit. The idea is to get you to go on and not just impulsively buy something, but to really do your shopping and build up your orders. It's a fledgling company, but they have been adding, I think the number is 400,000 shoppers a month? Shen: Yes, that's the number. Kline: It's growing, but this has to be the biggest gap. Walmart is No. 2 when it comes to online retailers. I believe the numbers are about $100 billion for Amazon and about $13 billion for Walmart? This is Coke and Pepsi, except Pepsi is Royal Crown soda. It's a very small player in the space comparatively. Shen: I think this is an interesting deal, and we can get in more detail what Walmart is getting here with this acquisition. I think the CEO or the co-founder of Jet.com, Marc Lore, who you mentioned, he's a big part of the story, he's going to be joining Walmart following the acquisition. He's going to lead Walmart's e-commerce efforts going forward, and Jet.com and Walmart.com will still operate separately at that. Kline: We joked about this before, but one: I think Walmart is lighting money on fire, here. I don't think there's anything that they couldn't have duplicated in the six months for $0.5 billion. They're spending a huge amount of money to get a guy. I get it, Marc Lore has been successful, he's been one of the few that has been able to compete with Amazon, but I don't see why Walmart is buying it. I look at it, say, 18 months from now, there's going to be the inevitable press conference where Marc Lore stands up and says, "We've decided to eliminate the Jet.com brand and just focus on our core brand of Walmart.com, but of course we're going to be integrating the technology." It doesn't seem like these deals ever end up with one company operating two distinct products in the same space. Shen: I love the fact that if you see Amazon as the arch rival to Walmart, it's going to be as Lore, you mentioned the company that he started previously, Quidsi, which owned a portfolio of stores like Diapers.com and Soap.com, that guy got bought by Amazon for about $550 million in 2010. Lore was actually at Amazon for two years, then he left, kicked out Jet.com, and now lo and behold, he's going to be end up at Walmart. Kline: He's really good at raising money, but he hasn't shown that he's really good at building sales. That's what troubles me about this. Shen: To touch on that specifically from what I could find, Jet.com has raised about $800 million through various rounds of funding and financing from a lot of actually investors from his previous ventures. He obviously has a strong track record. Something just to keep in mind is the fact that they have their smart card where the more you buy, the cheaper it can be for shoppers. I think there have been quite a few analyses and studies from some industry followers and from shoppers themselves that have found it. A lot of Jet.com prices are competitive and better than Amazon, which is usually seen as the price leader. That was the strategy that base has used to claim so much market share and to develop such a leadership position. Basically, it comes down to the fulfillment in the logistics, and the way they tie the shipping, and how much you buy. You take Walmart, and they have this huge network of stores and warehouses. They can basically take that technology and leverage it to Walmart scale. Kline: The challenge for Walmart has always been that fulfilling what a store needs versus an individual order is a massive change. This probably speeds that up, but there's going to be huge growing pains. I don't see how they're buying enough customers to have this make sense. If they had paid Mark Lore's investors back at a 25% premium and then given him a huge deal to come in and run their digital, this would have made sense, but they're buying a brand most people haven't heard of. The second people realize  Jet.com is a Walmart brand, it loses some its cache. I think it's fair to say there's a Target and Amazon customer that looks at Walmart and goes, "Ugh, I don't want anything to do with Walmart." I think that's going to taint the sort of hip, millennial brand. It's very hard to stay cool when you're associated with Walmart. Shen: That's a very good point, because I think previously, with Lore's older venture with Quidsi, for example, I think a really loyal shopper following that he had was among younger urban shoppers. Then with Jet.com, they've been spending like $20 or $25 million a month advertising. A lot of that's targeting not only millennials, but they're trying to basically generate more repeat shoppers. I think I have some data from Slice and BI Intelligence dating back to February that indicated Jet.com was having a hard time generating repeat business -- over two-thirds of their sales were coming from new customers. You mentioned the 400,000 people signing up, or essentially shopping with them with each month. It's just interesting to kind of see that dynamic there. Kline: The problem they come up against is Amazon has, and I don't know the recent number, but it's roughly 225 million credit cards on file. However, [something like 63 million] Prime members, they don't share the numbers, so it's always a guess. They've made the process so easy, that I buy on Amazon from my phone, I can buy things verbally from my Echo. As an Amazon customer, why would I switch? Because diapers are $0.02 less, I don't need diapers. Any device I was going to buy, anything, if Amazon is within the ballpark, I'm not going to shop around. Maybe I'll jump on Jet.com and buy a TV because it's $100 cheaper, but I'm probably not going to switch. That's a very, very difficult behavior for any new company to win over. I would think that an awful lot of Amazon customers just find it a little bit cooler to buy from Amazon than to buy from Walmart. They can be No. 2. If they're trying to be No. 2, they can be a bigger No. 2, but this is like me challenging for the heavy weight championship -- it's not going to work out well. Shen: With all that in mind, I'm a little skeptical, as you are, just based on the price tag. $300 million in cash, $30 million in Walmart stock, and I think a lot of that is going to be dedicated, it's basically incentives for management. $300 million, sorry about that. Kline: In stock. Shen: Yeah, in stock. Kline: And three billion in cash. Shen: Exactly. For Walmart, their e-commerce efforts in their physical year 2015 they were seeing some pretty strong progress. Year over year, quarterly growth was anywhere from 21% to 27%. Then the following year, so last year, in their fiscal 2016, it kind of started to fall from the high teens to below 10%. In the most recent quarter, it came in at just 7% globally. That deceleration definitely has people concerned because it's lagging even the broad economy, where e-commerce is, I think, still growing double-digit rates every quarter. Kline: They need to catch up to Amazon in terms of fulfillment. If you buy anything from Amazon, it is going to show up in two days, including on Sunday. Walmart doesn't even promise that. I think they'll sell it to you for an extra price. The days when you place an order and it takes three to five shipping days, Amazon has created a new standard, and people have proven willing. I'll buy batteries from Amazon because I could wait 48 hours with my remote control not working. I'm not going to wait a week. That's really where Walmart has to catch up, and Jet can help with that. This will make the Walmart customer have a better experience on Walmart.com and on Jet.com after six months, a year of integration, but I don't see it winning over new business. This may help them as they lose sales in the store to their own website fulfill and keep those customers happy. That is an important step. Shen: Something else that I wanted to mention too is I'm curious to see how they blend, how it really impacts Walmart because I know they I think it's called their shipping pass where you basically pay a flat fee for the year and you get two-day shipping, and this is really just very similar to Prime to be more competitive with Amazon with those really incredible fulfillment speeds, and how they kind of blend that with the fact that Jet.com has some of this infrastructure, some of this technology in terms of optimizing and making as cheap as possible for their shoppers and the smart card and everything. Kline: That's why I say it ultimately has to be one brand. It seems crazy to me that you would make Jet.com the online version of Walmart, so that's not going to happen. Eventually, this will become a Walmart.com powered by Jet, and then Jet will be down in the corner, and then Jet won't exist anymore. Hopefully, they can integrate the technology because if they do, they have to get faster. Walmart has an incredible network. Amazon has its warehouses, but Walmart has a store in most of the country, something like every five miles. Their ability to ship to stores, to ship to you from a store, if they can figure that out, and obviously there's a lot of programming and algorithms, we've talked before about how Amazon knows what you're going to buy in a local warehouse before you order it, if Walmart can figure that out and Jet helps them, then maybe they bridge some of that shipping divide, and that will at least stop them from bleeding customers just because Amazon can get things faster. Shen: I have to say, I just have to admit that I'm a little curious, too, to see, you have this small upstart company just hitting about $1 billion in their gross merchandise volume in their first, they've launched July 2015, so just about a year of existence, has Amazon kind of been paying attention, at the very least. Walmart jumps in, huge resources. I'm really curious to see where things go, even if the price tag may be a little high. Maybe hopes are a little too high, but overall, definitely an interesting deal. Kline: It's definitely possible that this gets Walmart back on the growth path from ramping down to ramping up, but I think Amazon is watching this and laughing. This is not a competitor. This is my little league team challenging the Red Socks. It's not going to do that, but they can become a better No. 2. The other thing they can do is crowd out some of the other players. If I'm Amazon, I'm not worried. If I'm Target, I'm a little bit nervous. If I'm Kohl's, maybe I'm nervous. This is sort of Walmart saying, "We're in second place, let's consolidate." And almost any price is worth it to do that. Shen: Thanks a lot, Dan, for your input here, and good luck with your drive for today. Kline: I appreciate it, thank you. Shen: Yeah, no problem.

Tech Meetup, won the New Business of the Year award in it's hometown of Hoboken, N.J. During my speech accepting the award I talked about Hoboken as being uniquely positioned to be home to the next Google, Facebook or Amazon. We have a great standard of living, a lower cost of business than NYC, an excellent university (Stevens) in town, a vibrant tech community and obviously, a ridiculous proximity to NYC which makes recruitment and bizdev very attractive. I noticed that the mostly old-school room of business owners seemed dismissive to the reality and impact of what I was suggesting. Just a couple of years later, Jet.com set up shop in town and almost became that anchor tenant. Today it was announced that they were acquired for $3 billion by Walmart. While it seems this will provide a reasonable investor gain and some individual wealth, it’s not the outcome I was hoping for. I worry that in just a few years time Jet will be a blip on the tech radar that becomes a rounding error for Walmart with stalled innovation at that sleek three letter URL. Related: Jet.com's Founder Marc Lore: 3 Things You Need to Know About the Man Taking on Amazon Keep in mind -- in 2015, Amazon generated $107 billion in annual revenue and has a market cap of $363 billion. Facebook’s market cap is $360 billion. Google is $550 billion. GroupOn is $3.4 billion. WayFair is $4.1 billion. Walmart is, notably, $230 billion. The market Jet is attacking is still shockingly ripe for innovation. Ecommerce represents just 7.8 percent of retail sales. Think about that -- if you’re like me ecommerce is probably 90+ percent of your retail shopping. Yet, around the country 92.2 percent of retail still happens offline. That’s part of the market that Marc and team at Jet were aiming for. And, with the dynamic shopping engine Jet built around smart logistics, Marc was betting that the savings to customers would help expedite some of that offline to online growth and attract enough people away from the competition that growth would skyrocket. Jet.com Recruiting Bar & Lounge at Propeller Innovation Festival 2016, Pier A Hoboken, N.J. $3 billion isn’t the rocket they intended to build. While a $3 billion sale of a few year old company is a great headline, it’s hard to imagine that’s what Marc was gunning for when he raised over $600 million. Imagine if they instead grew to a $100 billion company, acquired other innovative companies over the years and grew into a long term leader in tech and ecommerce in the NYC region. That’s a very different story. Related: Why Wal-Mart Will Welcome 'Greeters' Back Into Its Stores I’ve had a chance to get to know Marc a bit and have enormous respect for him. Through the N.J. Tech Meetup and with Propeller I’ve had a chance to get to know many of the very fine employees who’ve joined the Jet mission. I’m thrilled they have had a chance to get to know NJ as something other than a turnpike and a TV show. However, for N.J. and the NYC region as a whole, I’m having a hard time deeming this acquisition as a big win. What this says to me is that Amazon rules. Armed with nearly unlimited resources establishing a massive new ecommerce business with long term viability is almost impossible. Related: 6 Deals That Are the Lowest Price We've Seen I have dreamed of Hoboken transforming around companies like Jet. A tech ecosystem is not built around any one entity. Here, the N.J. Tech Meetup is an important leg of the stool. As is Stevens Institute of Technology, the Mission 50 coworking space and Jet.com. We are lacking in solid press coverage and a strong investor ecosystem, areas where my friends across the Hudson shine. Had Jet grown into the $100+ billion company we all hoped it would, Hoboken and New Jersey at large would have a modern anchor tenant that could spawn dozens of other innovators. I hope that Walmart will allow Jet to continue to innovate and push the product much further along. I hope they will allow Jet’s entrepreneurial spirit to live and encourage free thinking and boundary breaking in the way that Marc and many at Jet embody. I hope they will allow this company to thrive in a way that it will still entice people who live in Brooklyn to come to Hoboken to work inspired for Walmart, as many do for Jet, now. In the meantime, Hoboken will look for it’s next anchor tech tenant. I’m sure that among our attendees at the NJ Tech Meetup and Propeller, another Jet.com will soon be born, and perhaps decide to make it’s HQ in town too.

Hostess says the Twinkie is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012.      For Wal-Mart, it's part of a strategy of working with suppliers to come up with twists on existing foods or developing new ones. The company, which gets more than half its sales from food, opened a food lab in June as it aims to get products to the shelves faster. (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)   HOW IT'S MADE: A regular Twinkie is coated with a cake funnel batter and then proceeds through an oil bath to ensure the batter adheres. The Twinkies are immediately frozen and packaged. HOME PREPARATION: Pull it out of the freezer and bake it for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for two-and-a-half to three minutes. THE PRICE: $4.76 per box of seven. For comparison, New York-based hot-dog joint Papaya King sells its own fresh deep-fried treats for $3 each, excluding tax. DISTRIBUTION: The Deep Fried Twinkies will be available starting Friday, Aug. 12, at Wal-Mart only for three months. After that, they will be available at other stores. Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, says the treat could be marketed abroad. NUTRITION: The vanilla-cream version has 220 calories, nine grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. A regular Twinkie has 130 calories, four grams of fat and 14 grams of sugar. In comparison, a Starbucks Carmel Frappuccino has 420 calories, 15 grams of fat and 66 grams of sugar. WORKING IT OFF: A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to run for 20 minutes at 10 mph, take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride, says Amy Gorin, a Jersey City, New Jersey-based registered dietitian-nutritionist. LIMITED-TIME TWINKIES: In December, Hostess teamed up with Wal-Mart on a limited-time mint-chocolate flavored cake. In June, it worked with the retailer on a tie-in for the new "Ghostbusters" movie, creating Key Lime Slime Twinkies for a short-term sale. ____ Follow Anne D'Innocenzio on Twitter at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio WTRF 96 16th Street Wheeling, WV 26003 Main (304) 232-7777 Fax (304) 233-5822 Can't Find Something?

Tech Meetup, won the New Business of the Year award in it's hometown of Hoboken, N.J. During my speech accepting the award I talked about Hoboken as being uniquely positioned to be home to the next Google, Facebook or Amazon. We have a great standard of living, a lower cost of business than NYC, an excellent university (Stevens) in town, a vibrant tech community and obviously, a ridiculous proximity to NYC which makes recruitment and bizdev very attractive. I noticed that the mostly old-school room of business owners seemed dismissive to the reality and impact of what I was suggesting. Just a couple of years later, Jet.com set up shop in town and almost became that anchor tenant. Today it was announced that they were acquired for $3 billion by Walmart. While it seems this will provide a reasonable investor gain and some individual wealth, it’s not the outcome I was hoping for. I worry that in just a few years time Jet will be a blip on the tech radar that becomes a rounding error for Walmart with stalled innovation at that sleek three letter URL. Related: Jet.com's Founder Marc Lore: 3 Things You Need to Know About the Man Taking on Amazon Keep in mind -- in 2015, Amazon generated $107 billion in annual revenue and has a market cap of $363 billion. Facebook’s market cap is $360 billion. Google is $550 billion. GroupOn is $3.4 billion. WayFair is $4.1 billion. Walmart is, notably, $230 billion. The market Jet is attacking is still shockingly ripe for innovation. Ecommerce represents just 7.8 percent of retail sales. Think about that -- if you’re like me ecommerce is probably 90+ percent of your retail shopping. Yet, around the country 92.2 percent of retail still happens offline. That’s part of the market that Marc and team at Jet were aiming for. And, with the dynamic shopping engine Jet built around smart logistics, Marc was betting that the savings to customers would help expedite some of that offline to online growth and attract enough people away from the competition that growth would skyrocket. Jet.com Recruiting Bar & Lounge at Propeller Innovation Festival 2016, Pier A Hoboken, N.J. $3 billion isn’t the rocket they intended to build. While a $3 billion sale of a few year old company is a great headline, it’s hard to imagine that’s what Marc was gunning for when he raised over $600 million. Imagine if they instead grew to a $100 billion company, acquired other innovative companies over the years and grew into a long term leader in tech and ecommerce in the NYC region. That’s a very different story. Related: Why Wal-Mart Will Welcome 'Greeters' Back Into Its Stores I’ve had a chance to get to know Marc a bit and have enormous respect for him. Through the N.J. Tech Meetup and with Propeller I’ve had a chance to get to know many of the very fine employees who’ve joined the Jet mission. I’m thrilled they have had a chance to get to know NJ as something other than a turnpike and a TV show. However, for N.J. and the NYC region as a whole, I’m having a hard time deeming this acquisition as a big win. What this says to me is that Amazon rules. Armed with nearly unlimited resources establishing a massive new ecommerce business with long term viability is almost impossible. Related: 6 Deals That Are the Lowest Price We've Seen I have dreamed of Hoboken transforming around companies like Jet. A tech ecosystem is not built around any one entity. Here, the N.J. Tech Meetup is an important leg of the stool. As is Stevens Institute of Technology, the Mission 50 coworking space and Jet.com. We are lacking in solid press coverage and a strong investor ecosystem, areas where my friends across the Hudson shine. Had Jet grown into the $100+ billion company we all hoped it would, Hoboken and New Jersey at large would have a modern anchor tenant that could spawn dozens of other innovators. I hope that Walmart will allow Jet to continue to innovate and push the product much further along. I hope they will allow Jet’s entrepreneurial spirit to live and encourage free thinking and boundary breaking in the way that Marc and many at Jet embody. I hope they will allow this company to thrive in a way that it will still entice people who live in Brooklyn to come to Hoboken to work inspired for Walmart, as many do for Jet, now. In the meantime, Hoboken will look for it’s next anchor tech tenant. I’m sure that among our attendees at the NJ Tech Meetup and Propeller, another Jet.com will soon be born, and perhaps decide to make it’s HQ in town too.

(Reuters/Jim Young)More Previous elections have given us “the silent majority,” “Reagan Democrats” and “NASCAR dads.” But pundits and pollsters have identified a new group to watch, and it is one you might not expect: “Walmart moms.” Political strategists are increasingly thinking about these voters, who make up an estimated 14 to 17 percent of the electorate in the 2016 presidential race. “Walmart moms” are defined by pollsters as the sort of voters who have children under the age of 18 and a household income hovering around the nationwide average. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake told Yahoo News that these parents are less concerned with the back and forth of the presidential race than the hard details about how candidates could help them support their family, keep their children safe and keep the prices of household staples low. A “Walmart mom” is “still struggling in the economy, she feels the political system failed her and believes the economic system caters to the well-off,” Lake said. “She is threatened by terrorism and [her] own economic insecurity. Even more so, they are worried they can’t offer a better life to their children.” To track the opinions of this burgeoning group, two polling firms, Republican-leaning Public Opinion Strategies and Democratic-leaning Momentum Analysis, conducted periodic focus groups with the mothers. The groups, which have been run since 2010, are commissioned by Walmart but have found a broader use in understanding the group’s political orientation. The focus groups have found that the 2016 election has caused concern among these voters, with the women particularly apprehensive about both Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. A new focus group conducted this week provided further evidence of the dissatisfaction that these voters are feeling in their own lives and toward the political arena. The panel was conducted with two dozen “Walmart moms” in Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix, Ariz., and remotely observed by a group of journalists and pollsters, including Yahoo News. “No matter which way you choose, we’re going to lose,” Gidget, a customer service manager from Columbus, said in the group. “You have to give up something. But no one is talking about the issues. … I feel like [the candidates] are so far extreme on both sides, we’re going to have to give up something either way.” Clinton is viewed as untrustworthy and lacking warmth, with one woman calling her a “stone-cold b****” for her demeanor in the face of controversy. “I think they are all liars, but I feel like she gets caught a lot,” Julie, a Columbus office worker, said. The overwhelming majority pegged the scandals surrounding Clinton, especially her use of a private email server while secretary of state, as their biggest reservation about her candidacy. But despite this discontent, the women viewed a potential Trump presidency with even more scorn. While there is some appeal in the business mogul’s financial experience and outsider credentials, most are shocked by his “big mouth” and volcanic temperament. “He acts like a 2-year-old,” Deanna, a Phoenix mother of four, said. “I have a 2-year-old. I see the similarities.” View photos Donald Trump applauds during a campaign rally in Wilmington, N.C. (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)More Lake said this sentiment fits with the women’s roles as leaders in their households. “Women want respect, they are the disciplinarians in their homes,” she said. “They hold things together in tough times. They don’t let their families behave like Donald Trump, and they don’t get to behave like Donald Trump.” While some of the women said they would vote for Trump in the hope that he would tone down some of his rhetoric, others called him “risky” and “dangerous.” Other women, who made up a slight majority of focus group members, said they would reluctantly vote for Clinton or Libertarian Gary Johnson. Many voters described being fearful about the fate of the country, however, a sentiment that has existed since the primaries. In an April focus group of suburban mothers from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, “Walmart moms” continually expressed a lack of enthusiasm for any of the candidates, according to the pollsters running the group. They were nervous about what the future had in store and put off by the “circus” atmosphere of the primary season. “Using words like ‘chaos,’ ‘horrific,’ ‘terrible’ and ‘vulnerable,’ these women are overwhelmingly pessimistic about the direction of the country,” the analysis of the April focus group read. “This time, however, the Presidential campaign’s tone is almost as worrying as the economy or their own financial situations.” But how did this subgroup become such an important target for political campaigns? Lake said the group has become much more pliable in the past 20 years as the women have taken on a different societal role. “Married women didn’t used to be a swing [demographic],” Lake said. “They used to just vote like their husbands. But over time they have gotten more and more independent.” Lake noted that the gap between how women and their spouses vote has been growing, and that we could see a record discrepancy in November. President Obama won “Walmart moms” in 2008 and 2012, according to polling conducted after the elections. Then, the key issues for these women revolved around the Great Recession, putting food on the table and national security, according to focus groups conducted at the time. Anger was widespread among these women about how America’s economic recovery did not reach their families. “These women are frustrated,” Neil Newhouse of Public Opinion Strategies said in 2011. “They see Wall Street getting bailed out. There’s a resentment there that they see a government activism that doesn’t impact them directly. They want their share.” But despite frustration at the slow recovery from the Great Recession, the “Walmart moms” were not wholly pessimistic — they trusted the candidates to lead them back. “These voters don’t seem like they have given up on Obama,” Newhouse said after a focus group conducted shortly before the 2012 election. “They are losing patience with Washington, but it seemed like Obama doesn’t come out that bad.” The women followed through, narrowly supporting Obama in his victory over Republican Mitt Romney. An election night poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and Momentum Analysis showed Obama pulled 50 percent of the “Walmart moms” surveyed, compared with 48 percent for Romney. This narrow edge played a part in Obama’s reelection. “As we talked with Walmart moms around the country this year, we heard loud and clear from them that they were torn over their vote decision,” Alex Bratty and Margie Omero wrote in an analysis of the 2012 poll. “They didn’t always blame Obama for the current economic crisis, but they felt very acutely that recovery was not reaching them quickly enough. And, while they thought Governor Romney might be better on the economy, they also had reservations about switching course. … These election night results demonstrate how tight the race was and how women, and these Walmart moms, helped determine Obama’s victory.” How can Trump or Clinton better orient themselves to the group to copy Obama’s success? Women were more positive when they felt they were getting a personal view of the candidates. Despite not placing much weight on either convention, focus group members cited speeches from both nominees’ children as moments that affected their views in a positive manner. View photos Hillary Clinton speaks during a rally in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo: Chris Keane/Reuters)More “One thing that is important is that the personal is political for these women,” Lake said. “They know the candidates well but also don’t. For Clinton, they may see her as a mother or grandmother but don’t know much about her in those roles. Finding out more about that goes a long way toward making her more likable and trustworthy.” Even though chaos has reigned during the unconventional 2016 election season, “Walmart moms” are still one of the most critical swing demographics, according to Lake and other pollsters. However, there was pessimism in the focus group as to whether the election would ultimately improve their lives. “My biggest issue is what is going on in my city and my community,” Dana, a food service worker from Columbus, said. “I obviously would like a candidate who is qualified to take us in the right direction. But honestly, that isn’t going to matter on the home front for me.” Another participant put it more succinctly: “My opinion doesn’t matter.”       Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next There's something distinctive in the way Trump talks about the alt-right Business Insider The best Black Friday TV deals from Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, and more The Verge Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz Saturday Night Live’s Colin Jost Criticized for Trans-Insensitive Weekend Update Joke Vulture Secessionists formally launch quest for California's independence Los Angeles Times ‘Are y’all ready to die?’ Chattanooga bus driver reportedly asked children before crash Yahoo News Trump taps S.C.

(Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) NEW YORK — The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” today. It is the company's first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost around $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. Related: Did we ever really warm to Macy's?

And it’s fun.” Related: Williamston woman led a coffee creamer crusade The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. Related: Walt Disney World pulling plug on famed Electrical Parade For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals.

Hostess is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” that mark its first foray into frozen foods.  (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Mo., headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said. 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2bnKsEo More Stories Rochester's Chapman House brings sophistication to the table Nov. 23, 2016, 12:42 a.m. Husband’s stalling on kids backs her into corner Nov. 22, 2016, 11:24 p.m. Demanding boss expects work mid-crisis Nov. 22, 2016, 11:24 p.m.

(File/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS) Anne D'Innocenzio, The Associated Press Published Friday, August 12, 2016 1:48PM EDT NEW YORK -- Walmart opened a 12,000-square-foot culinary and innovation centre at its headquarters in June as a place where the nation's largest food retailer can work with major suppliers to come up with new food ideas, and develop ideas on its own to bolster its store-brand selection. Here's a peek at the food lab: WHAT IT IS: The centre has 10 test kitchens including a studio-style chef's kitchen and replicas of the bakery and deli kitchens found in most of its stores. It has stoves, ovens and microwaves so the staff can cook the same ways customers do at home. There's also a sensory lab where Walmart can collect feedback from customers and employees, who answer questions about the texture, saltiness or sweetness of a food or beverage. The facility follows a similar lab at the company's Sam's Club headquarters, which opened a few years ago. WHY IT MATTERS: Walmart derives 56 per cent of its total sales from food and other grocery items. The company also accounts for about 25 per cent of the overall U.S. grocery business. Since customers might shop for food several times a week, it's critical to get food items right to build loyalty. In the past, Walmart had tested products at kitchens throughout its headquarters, but that effort was limited and the feedback it provided was fairly general. Now, Walmart gets specific feedback from customers that it can share with suppliers to help decide if an item is ready or needs changes. That collaboration saves money and cuts several months off a product launch, which can last a year from idea to an item landing on store shelves. WHAT'S NEXT: Walmart is testing frozen stuffed doughnut bites as well as new flavours for its Clear American Ice store brand sparkling water and Paleo meals that are vacuum-packed. The Clear American Ice pineapple-orange flavour arrives in stores in September. The Paleo meals and the doughnut bites will be in the stores in October.

"We are thrilled to provide the Springfield Rescue Mission with a $25,000 check and very happy to support the organization," Walmart's New England Director of Communications Chris Buchanan said. The contribution will fund the rescue center's clothing giveaway center, Operation Sunshine homelessness program and emergency shelter on Taylor Street, Springfield Rescue Mission Chairman Robert Blakeslee said. Blakeslee and Mayor Domenic Sarno thanked Walmart for the donation and posed for photographs with the oversized check at the press conference. The mission has operated for 124 years  typically spends about $2.3 million each year, in addition to receiving about $2 million worth of in-kind donations like clothing, shoes and toiletries. The donation will go exclusively to services, and not toward funding the unexpected tax bill that led the mission to take out a six-figure loan earlier this year, according to Blakeslee. The tax-exempt nonprofit, which provides services for the poor and homeless, was hit with a one-time tax bill after acquiring its new headquarters on Mill Street last year. Because the building was on the tax rolls last year before the Rescue Mission took possession of it the organization became responsible for a $150,000 share of its tax bill -- an amount which surprised the operators of the charity after they closed on the property in October. In April, the rescue mission paid off the bill, using a loan from Berkshire Bank. The charity had appealed for donors to help cover the unexpected costs, and donors responded with $110,000 in contributions, The Republican reported today. The Rescue Mission attempted to fight its new home's assessment, filing for an abatement after paying its first bill in February. But the city denied its request on April 28. The mission has appealed to the state, and the case is still pending. The mission moved from its old location on Bliss Street, within the footprint of the MGM Springfield casino project, to its new renovated site provided in exchange for the Bliss Street site by MGM for its $950 million casino project. The Rescue Mission took ownership of the Mill Street site, the former Orr Cadillac property, on Oct. 31, 2015, after MGM completed major renovations. Under state law, a nonprofit organization that acquires a property during a tax year does not have the right to tax exempt status during that fiscal year, Martin told The Republican in April. MGM had owned the property for the first four months of the fiscal year, and the Rescue Mission is the owner for the final eight months, with each owner responsible for its appropriate share, Martin said.

Source: Wikipedia Fans of the staple fair food can pick up a pack of seven Deep Fried Twinkies at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) locations across the United States. The product costs $4.76 and is available in both vanilla and chocolate variants. Walmart said that it will have Deep Fried Twinkies available at more than 4,000 of its stores by Aug. 16. The retail chain has an exclusive market on the frozen treat for the first three months it’s available. Walmart worked directly with Hostess to develop the Deep Fried Twinkies now found in the frozen section. Walmart buyer John Pearson said the company was interested in the frozen treats to help fill out its dessert offerings. He noted that it took several tests before the the new product was ready to be sold on store shelves. While Deep Fried Twinkies are sure to satisfy the indulgent individuals among us, they won’t likely draw in customers concerned about healthy eating. The new product from Hostess contains 9 grams of fat and 220 calories per Twinkie. This is roughly double the amount of fat that non-deep fried versions contain. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” Darren Seifer, one of NPD Group Inc’s food industry analysts, told the Associated Press. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Ellen Copaken, Hostess vice president of marketing, said that the company decided to start selling Deep Fried Twinkies in stores after seeing how popular the item was at fairs and in restaurants, USA Today notes.

Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Missouri, headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 12, 2016 11:39am   Comments Share: Related WMT Can't Wait For Black Friday? These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food (Investor's Business Daily) The ongoing trend towards healthy eating and fresh ingredients could be pushed aside and ignored for a special treat of deep-fried Twinkies. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) said in a blog post it has teamed up with Hostess Brands, the maker of Twinkies, to bring a frozen, ready-to-heat version of the deep fried treat to more than 4,000 stores nationwide by August 16. Wal-Mart's senior buyer of frozen foods John Pearson, the executive who penned the blog post, said there has always been a desire to "push the envelope on the products we offer." @Benzinga We choose both. #CatchEmAll — Hostess Snacks (@Hostess_Snacks) August 12, 2016 "So when I heard rumblings that Hostess was considering a deep-fried Twinkie, I was intrigued," Pearson said. "Not only was it something different for the frozen aisle – it filled a need, too, as we were looking to add more dessert choices to our mostly savory assortment." Pearson went on to detail the meetings with Hostess to discuss the potential of supplying the deep-fried snack. A first prototype was developed, which was a "far cry" from the final product but the "potential was evident." No one gave up and after much effort a final version is now arriving in Wal-Mart's stores. "Shopping isn't only about prices; it should also be a fun experience to try new things," Pearson concluded. "And what's more exciting than a product that was previously only available at state fairs once a year, now being up for enjoyment anytime from your freezer?"

Thats not the case anymore with The Ranch and several other businesses in the area of 1550 E. Crossroads Blvd. When we opened, it was us and a church and another business, said Loveland resident Bobbie Moyer, who has worked at the distribution center since it opened. Now, its hard to find us. The distribution center is one of two in Colorado and 147 nationwide. The state has 59 Supercenters, including two in Loveland, and nine discount stores, as well as 15 Sams Clubs. Moyer started and remained in the position of data processing systems operator, staying with the company because she liked the benefits and the companys stability, she said. Walmart trains you from the minute you walk in the door. You dont have to have any prior experience, Moyer said. Laura Bahlmann, also of Loveland, has been with the distribution center since its opening and, like Moyer, remained in the same position, that of distribution receiving. She works on the receiving dock, unloading, processing and labeling the freight that comes into the building. Ive always known where I stood with Walmart, Bahlmann said, adding that she likes the work she does. Its a nice stable job. ... Its nice to wake up in the morning knowing that a job is stable and there for you. Bahlmann and Moyer are among the more than 1,000 associates who work at Walmart Distribution Center 6019. Advertisement The center started with 350 associates, of which 65 still remain with the company. Why Loveland? Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which was founded in 1962, chose Loveland for the distribution center at a time when the company had no distribution centers and few stores in the western United States, said Dan Speed, general manager of the Loveland distribution center. The city stood out for its welcoming business environment and sense of community, along with its access to north-south and east-west highways for moving freight, Speed said. On its first day of business, Tuesday, Sept. 11, 1990, the Loveland distribution center shipped out 50,000 cases of products, Speed said, explaining that cases range from the size of a shoe box up to the size of a big-screen television set, he said. Today, the distribution center ships out an average of 150,000 cases a day, 24 hours a day, except for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Day. The Distribution Process Each day, the center receives truckloads of cases at the loading dock from vendors such as Tide and Proctor and Gamble. Employees scan the bar codes on the cases, 60 percent of which will be immediately shipped to the 85 stores the center serves, or shipped out the next day. The remaining 40 percent of the cases are put into inventory. The cases, which are labeled with where they are headed, are moved through the center by conveyer belt, which, if stretched out, would extend nine miles, Speed said. The cases that are shipped out fill orders the center received the night before to ensure there are no empty shelves in the Supercenters and discount centers that the distribution center serves. The Loveland center covers the general merchandise side of stores in most of Colorado and Montana, all of Wyoming and a few in Nebraska and South Dakota. It really is a competitive advantage for the company, said Dan Fogleman, spokesman for Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark. Part of the role of distribution centers is to get products to customers. We dont want merchandise in the warehouse. The distribution center conducts three operations, that of receiving and order filling, followed by shipping. Employees load the labeled products onto trucks to deliver to 21 or 22 stores at a time. The stores are organized into a batch, so that there are four batches of deliveries a day. The majority of products are in the boxes theyre received in. Some are broken down from the case, Speed said. There are certain products a store wouldnt sell a whole case of. Never Had a Layoff The distribution center has never had a layoff since it opened, has low turnover and has not had to run a help-wanted ad in more than five years, Speed said. Sixty to seventy percent of the management team came from the ranks of hourly associates, Fogleman said.

Kaiser Health News: Should Big Insurance Become Like Walmart To Lower Health Costs? Retail titan Walmart uses its market dominance to inflict “ruthless,” “brutal” and “relentless” pressure on prices charged by suppliers, business writers frequently report. What if huge health insurance companies could push down prices charged by hospitals and doctors in the same way? The idea is getting new attention as already painful health costs accelerate and major medical insurers seek to merge into three enormous firms. (Hancock, 8/11) Kaiser Health News: More Small, Midsized Firms Choose To Pay Workers’ Medical Costs Directly Instead of buying a health insurance policy to cover their workers, a growing number of small and midsized companies are opting to pay their employees’ medical claims directly, a potentially riskier practice financially called self-insuring, a recent study found. Between 2013 and 2015, the proportion of midsized companies with 100 to 499 employees that were self-insured increased 19 percent, to 30.1 percent, according to the analysis published in July by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The percentage of small firms with fewer than 100 employees that self-funded their health plans grew 7 percent, to 14.2 percent, the study found. Meanwhile, self-funding by large companies declined slightly, to 80.4 percent. (Andrews, 8/12) KQED: Fed Up With Insurance, Doctors Bolt The System To Get More Patient TimeKQED Future Of You KQED Science She’s one of a growing number of doctors who have cut loose from what she calls the “assembly-line, volume approach” and is now using a health care delivery model called direct primary care. She has scaled back the number of patients she sees and takes longer with the ones she does. She doesn’t take insurance and deals mostly in cash; she charges each time she sees a patient, but most direct primary care doctors charge a monthly fee for unlimited visits. In her previous practice, (Lorraine) Page says, the pressure to see more patients in less time wore her down, as did the need for an army of support staff to process the copious paperwork required by insurance companies. (Gorn, 8/11) Houston Chronicle: Tyler Hospital Fight With Blue Cross And Blue Shield Appears Resolved  The long and bitter fight between a struggling rural health care system and Texas' largest insurer appears over as the flagship hospital in Tyler will now be included in the carrier's in-network group plans, both parties confirmed Thursday. East Texas Medical Center captured national attention when it took the extraordinary step of suing Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas and its Chicago-based parent company last summer in state court alleging that the insurer had plunged it into financial ruin and put patients with specialized needs at risk by shutting the main hospital in Tyler out of the most common and popular group health insurance network.

Oreo makes a new flavor: Swedish Fish Oreo NEW YORK (AP)–The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Missouri, headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump supporter Shawn Behnken, left, and a protester confront one another outside of a rally for Trump, Friday, Aug. 5, 2016, in Des Moines, Iowa. (Michael Zamora / AP) Heather Wilhelm Are you depressed about the presidential election? Do Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton astound you with their weapons-grade yet quasi-comical awfulness? When you read the news of the day, do you fight an insistent urge to throw your computer out the window, chop off your hair, don some scary-looking face paint and disappear into the desert wilderness like the crabby late 19th-century writer Ambrose Bierce? Well, join the club. The Washington Post recently highlighted the despair of the nation's "Wal-Mart moms," as revealed in what may have been the most depressing focus groups in the history of mankind. Gathered in Ohio and Arizona, the participants — "most of them in their 30s and 40s, from diverse backgrounds and with household incomes mirroring the overall electorate" — compared this year's election to, among other things, "choosing which arm to cut off." The Wal-Mart moms are rightly despondent, along with the many fine Americans trying to figure out what to do in this nightmarish political year. Parents of small children, it turns out, are particularly peeved. "What can this election possibly teach our kids?" they ask. "What conclusions about the world can they possibly draw? How can I tell my children I voted for someone terrible?" Take heart: This is a hidden opportunity! Understood properly, the election of 2016 can impart some crucial life lessons to kids of all ages — and perhaps it will even deliver those same lessons to the adults who somehow missed them the first time around. (This is wildly optimistic, I know.) Read on: 10 things you might not know about Fox News Mark Jacob A sexual harassment lawsuit by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson has set off an outpouring of similar accusations against network founder Roger Ailes, leading to his ouster as CEO.

A sexual harassment lawsuit by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson has set off an outpouring of similar accusations against network founder Roger Ailes, leading to his ouster as CEO. Fox News has been the cable news viewership leader since 2002, but are its best days behind it? We report, you... (Mark Jacob) Truth can be stranger than fiction. I spent Tuesday afternoon unplugged from the news. When I logged back in at cocktail hour, I discovered that one presidential candidate had a rally featuring the grinning father of a terrorist sitting in the audience directly behind her podium, which was weird. This was quickly eclipsed, however, by the fact that another presidential candidate jokingly implied that maybe someone who likes the Second Amendment might assassinate the other presidential candidate. This is real life. It is not made up. Who says the world isn't full of mystery? It is not a good idea to joke about assassinations or people dying. "I heard about this Second Amendment joke," Paul Ryan told the press earlier this week. (Note to Ryan: Everyone has heard about Donald Trump's Second Amendment joke. EVERYONE. It was terrible, and Trump will probably ensure that it lives on for 16 more news cycles, but more on that later.) "You should never joke about something like that," Ryan continued. Well, yeah, no kidding. Most people learn this when they're around 4 years old, but it bears repeating, apparently. Meanwhile, recent footage of Ted Strickland, the Ohio Democratic Senate nominee, shows him joking that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's death "happened at a good time." Life lesson: Please don't do this. It's not that hard. Don't assume all women will cast a knee-jerk vote for Hillary Clinton Diana Sroka Rickert If you're going to vote for Hillary Clinton for president, don't do it because she's a woman. In fact, ask yourself: If a man had the same policy platform, track record and resume as Clinton, would you vote for him? There. I said it. Cue the onslaught of outrage from actress Lena Dunham, homemaking... If you're going to vote for Hillary Clinton for president, don't do it because she's a woman. In fact, ask yourself: If a man had the same policy platform, track record and resume as Clinton, would you vote for him? There. I said it. Cue the onslaught of outrage from actress Lena Dunham, homemaking... (Diana Sroka Rickert) Sometimes, it's best just to say "Sorry." Can we have a special dedication go out to all those exhausted, overworked news cycles that refused to die because Trump refused to say "sorry"? As Trump told "The Tonight Show" host Jimmy Fallon last September, "I fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong." For her part, Clinton seems to believe that merely pretending certain things didn't happen — like, say, sending classified emails from a vulnerable rogue server — substitutes for expressing regret. Attention, kids: Do not try this at home. In life, you will frequently be wrong. A little self-reflection — and an occasional, honest "I'm sorry" — will get you a long way. If you're an 11-year-old and you defend Trump's use of bad words, you'll get to appear on CNN with your mom! OK, nevermind. Please don't teach your kids this. But it did happen to young Matthew Schricker, a robust Trump supporter who also managed to heckle Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, at a North Carolina rally. If past trends regarding child political prognosticators hold true, a hemp-wearing Matthew will passionately lead the world's largest Bernie Sanders/Occupy Wall Street rally to date in downtown Seattle in the spring of 2021. There is no man — or woman! — behind the curtain. "Fortunately," as singer Willie Nelson once said, "we are not in control." Herein lies one of the weirdest discoveries a young person can make: The world may be run by grown-ups, but many of them are just as clueless as kids! There is no vastly competent "man behind the curtain." Most of us are winging it; some adults are just better at hiding that fact than others. If our hapless leading presidential candidates don't bring that point home — along with the importance of limiting the power of government and politicians — I don't know who will.

Hostess Brands, the maker of lunch box treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged "Deep Fried Twinkies" starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a year-long collaboration between Hostess and Walmart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They'll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Walmart. It has a "retro cool factor," says Ellen Copaken, Hostess' vice-president of marketing. "It plays into the comfort food trend. And it's fun." The Twinkie, long one of Hostess' largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Walmart approached them last summer. For Walmart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice-president of food at Walmart. The food lab at the company's Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavours for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. "Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier," Redfield said. "But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don't taste good don't do well." Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavours and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavour of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. "We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content," said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. "But there is still room for indulgence." Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company's financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hotdog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they're faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. "We wanted to do a sweet and savoury combo," Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. "The Twinkies seem to be the most popular." Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn't easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Missouri, headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Walmart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart's headquarters in Arkansas, came to Walmart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. "The original samples were pretty good," said John Pearson, Wal-Mart's senior buyer for frozen foods. "But the batter was a little lumpy." Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Walmart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren't an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. "It's really good. It's delicious," said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn't excited after trying it. "I like the original Twinkie," she said. "This is a step too far." What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. "We eliminated the hard work and prep," she said.

Uproar began brewing a week ago, when a man posted in a community Facebook group saying he wanted to know if the story he heard about the officer was a rumor. The responses to the man's post poured in, with some saying they saw it happen. Later, a friend of the officer joined the thread to say it was true.

Similar to the Scottish favorite the deep-fried Mars bar, this latest vanilla-cream offering has nine grams of fat and 220 calories compared to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie.  A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride to work off the snack, according to Amy Gorin, a New Jersey-based nutritionist. Hostess is launching Deep Fried Twinkies for the first time today at $4.76 for a box of seven. Pictured, chef Wayne Rosenbaum spreads chocolate sauce on a freshly deep-fried Twinkie he makes at his store in New York Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan.  It has a 'retro cool factor,' says Ellen Copaken, Hostess' vice president of marketing. 'It plays into the comfort food trend. And it's fun.' The Twinkie, long one of Hostess' largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next What a guy! Head chef at a $240-a-head fine dining... 'It's inhumane': Workers at Tyson Foods plants caught on... Share this article Share Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer.  The Wal-Mart food lab at the company's Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time.   'Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,' said Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart.  Similar to the Scottish favorite the deep-fried Mars bar, this latest vanilla-cream offering has nine grams of fat and 220 calories compared to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride to work off the snack, according to Amy Gorin, a New Jersey-based nutritionist 'But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don't taste good don't do well.'  Twinkies were invented in 1930 by Illinois baker James Alexander Dewar, but the Hostess brand has not always been secure.  Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. UK expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs.  Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells their own version for $3 each, excluding tax. EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW TWINKIE  NUTRITION: The vanilla-cream version has 220 calories, nine grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. A regular Twinkie has 130 calories, four grams of fat and 14 grams of sugar.   WORKING IT OFF: A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to run for 20 minutes at 10 mph, take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride, says Amy Gorin, a Jersey City, New Jersey-based registered dietitian-nutritionist. HOW IT IS MADE: A regular Twinkie is coated with a cake funnel batter and then proceeds through an oil bath to ensure the batter adheres. The Twinkies are immediately frozen and packaged. HOME PREPARATION: Pull it out of the freezer and bake it for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for two-and-a-half to three minutes.  THE PRICE: $4.76 per box of seven. For comparison, New York-based hot-dog joint Papaya King sells its own fresh deep-fried treats for $3 each, excluding tax. DISTRIBUTION: The Deep Fried Twinkies will be available starting Friday, August 12, at Wal-Mart only for three months. After that, they will be available at other stores. Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, says the treat could be marketed abroad. Twinkies were invented in 1930 by Illinois baker James Alexander Dewar, but the Hostess brand has not always been secure  Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million 'We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,' Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. 'The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.'  'The original samples were pretty good,' said John Pearson, Wal-Mart's senior buyer for frozen foods. 'But the batter was a little lumpy.'  'It's really good. It's delicious,' said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, was not excited after trying it.  'I like the original Twinkie,' she said. 'This is a step too far.'  Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells the snacks for $3 each, excluding tax, and they are faring better than the deep-fried Oreos Share or comment on this article e-mail 120 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

PART: 1 2 3 4 Part 2 Walmart to Acquire Jet.com: Will It Be Enough to Beat Amazon? PART 2 OF 4 Is Walmart Paying Too Much for Jet? By Adrian Stevens  | Aug 11, 2016 4:21 pm EST Why price doesn’t matter much to Walmart Walmart (WMT) has been criticized for overpaying for the one-year-old startup, Jet.com. Although Walmart didn’t share any details about Jet’s revenues or profitability, we do know that Jet is one of the fastest-growing e-commerce companies and is gaining a foothold among urban and Millennial customers in the United States (IVV). The combination of Walmart’s retail expertise and Jet’s offerings could certainly strengthen Walmart’s competitive positioning against Amazon (AMZN) and other brick-and-mortar rivals, including Target (TGT), Costco (COST), and Macy’s (M). As you can see in the graph below, e-commerce sales in the United States are expected to rise. Through this new acquisition, Walmart is clearly looking to leverage the huge US retail e-commerce market. Fundamentally, Walmart overpaid for Jet Jet is yet to prove its business model, especially in the absence of profits. The company’s CEO (chief executive officer) Marc Lore expects the company to be profitable by 2020. The company has also burned a substantial amount of cash on marketing. Jet also failed to deliver on its earlier promises. It dropped its annual membership fee of $50 in order to stay competitive and attract buyers. The strategy led the company to lose out on shipping while lowering the discounts it offers. One of Jet’s key differentiators is its lower prices, which could be a threat to Amazon.

Ben Sun, an early Jet investor, writes about his optimism for the e-commerce site's sale to Walmart by Ben Sun Aug 11, 2016, 8:00am EDT tweet share Linkedin Marc Lore, CEO of e-commerce site Jet.com, which was recently acquired by Walmart. We were thrilled to wake up to Monday’s headlines announcing Walmart’s $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com — the largest U.S. e-commerce transaction to date, but a small price to pay, given Walmart’s $230 billion market cap and drive to secure a toehold against its main rival, Amazon. Jet.com is an attractive buy for Walmart — the company has made a huge dent in the online retail market in just one year’s time, and it’s a great differentiator for Walmart. It’s no surprise that Jet.com is an attractive buy for Walmart; led by Marc Lore, co-founder of Quidsi (parent of Diapers.com), the company has made a huge dent in the online retail market in just one year’s time, and it’s a great differentiator for Walmart, which has been playing catch-up to Amazon’s e-commerce domination for years. As the only New York-based seed fund in Jet’s first round (we invested alongside New Enterprise Associates, Accel, Bain Capital Ventures and MentorTech), Primary Venture Partners has long believed in the company’s strategic vision. With Lore at the helm — he’s a repeat entrepreneur looking to make huge waves in a pool he knows so well — this investment decision was one that we immediately jumped at when we were given the chance two short years ago. The balance that’s hard to beat First, a bit about the titan that Jet has been challenging. Amazon has built a successful $240 billion business by leveraging its scale to find the right balance of price, selection and convenience. Finding that right balance enables consumers to buy anything they want, whenever they want, with just the few clicks of a button, and at prices that rival any brick-and-mortar store. It has shaped the way we think, the way we shop and the way we demand, and it’s largely responsible for our dwindling patience when it comes to waiting in lines. Amazon has come closest to finding that balance with Amazon Prime, which gives users free one- or two-day shipping on most items for just $99 per year (or $10.99 per month, for the commitment-phobic). The offering makes up the majority of Amazon’s gross merchandise volume, and Prime subscribers are increasing by leaps and bounds (the Prime customer base grew from 19 million to 63 million in the last year). Moreover, subscribers making twice as many purchases and spending more than double, on average, than non-Prime customers. With market share of 42 percent of the ecommerce market, and more than 7 percent of total retail sales occurring online, there’s no one who can beat Amazon at its own game in the foreseeable future. There’s one inherent weakness to the Prime offering and its encouragement of the single-unit purchase mentality — it is extremely expensive and logistically complex for the supplier Prime is a great deal for consumers, to be sure, enabling them to make impulse purchases with nary a thought to back-end shipping costs and logistics. But there’s one inherent weakness to the Prime offering and its encouragement of the single-unit purchase mentality. With Prime, Amazon has made itself an indispensable way of life for consumers who want to log on and quickly purchase any item they need, whenever they need it — be it a few sticks of deodorant or a flat-panel TV — without any consideration for shipping costs. This way of shopping, while attractive from the consumer side, is extremely expensive and logistically complex for the supplier. Amazon has attempted to streamline fulfillment through programs like Vendor Flex, which it launched in 2013 in an attempt to ship goods faster and cheaper by co-locating an Amazon fulfillment center within a manufacturer’s warehouse. The arrangement has eliminated many overhead and shipping costs, enabling Amazon to sell diapers and other items cheaper than its competitors. Amazon building a warehouse next to where P&G stores its Pampers allows the company to sell a pack of Pampers at the lowest price. However, if a customer wants to add to that purchase a small bottle of California Baby Lotion (which is not owned by P&G), that item will be shipped from a different warehouse, which means that the additional costs of shipping ultimately fall to the customer. However, if a supplier could combine the two items into one box, it could pass those shipping savings onto the customer and offer a better price. It was this notion that Marc Lore and the Jet team went after, knowing that they couldn’t compete with Amazon for single-unit orders. Fighting back with a price-first approach In his time at Quidsi, Lore had a front-row seat as Amazon snowballed and gained more and more traction. He realized that he could never beat Amazon at its own game, but he observed the structural weakness of the single-unit purchase consumer mentality, and found his angle of attack. He launched Jet as the anti-single-unit marketplace, and its value proposition lies in incentivizing consumers to purchase multiple items at once by discounting prices. So while Amazon tinkers with finding the perfect balance between price, selection and convenience, Jet prioritizes price, in hopes of being the go-to e-commerce platform for those that value price (which are a lot of people).. Marc Lore launched Jet as the anti-single-unit marketplace, and its value proposition lies in incentivizing consumers to purchase multiple items at once by discounting prices. From his years in ecommerce, Lore understands better than most that designing a site experience and back-end fulfillment infrastructure to support multiple-unit orders is very different than the processes involved in single-unit orders. He built Jet from the ground up with the specific customer experience, marketing, technology, supply chain, fulfillment logistics and infrastructure processes to encourage and support multi-unit purchases. Lore realized that if he got this right, it’s a model that Amazon wouldn’t be able to easily (if ever) replicate with its existing infrastructure that’s so squarely focused on single-unit purchases. We’ve seen this same price versus multi-unit purchase battle between Costco and Walmart. Seemingly after a similar customer, the discount retailers are vying for market share with two vastly different business models: Walmart via sheer scale and enormous selection of goods (it carries 120,000 SKUs and boasts a $230 market cap), and Costco via a warehouse model that makes most of its revenue on annual membership fees. Costco’s membership fee offers a big advantage for customers, as it enables Costco to sell its wares at the lowest prices without having to sweat its negligible profit margins. Those low prices, in turn, encourage customers to purchase more items at once — an approach that has resulted in an average Costco order of almost $400. So despite having fewer retail stores than Walmart and only 4,000 SKUs, Costco has been able to claim a meaningful position in the market, with a $75 billion market cap to boot. The moral of the story? With a differentiated merchandising strategy and the right infrastructure in place, a meaningful portion of the consumer population can be trained to value price over selection and convenience. Jet’s strategy offers Walmart a critical toehold Jet is chipping away at Amazon’s e-commerce dominance in the same way, and its success just 12 months out of the gate has proven that the battle for the e-commerce kingdom is far from over. The company has already hit a $1 billion run-rate gross merchandise value. It’s no wonder, then, that Jet is such an attractive buy for Walmart, which has been modeling its e-commerce strategy on Amazon’s for years. That mimicry hasn’t gotten the company very far, however, with Amazon far outpacing it in every facet of the digital game. Walmart now realizes that its path to success lies in fighting back in a nontraditional way, and has chosen Jet as its key differentiator. Jet gives Walmart a smart, alternative model for competing with Amazon. Rather than struggling to find that same balance of price, convenience and selection that Amazon has nearly perfected with Prime, Jet strives to gain loyal customers by valuing price above all. Lore and his founding team of repeat entrepreneurs are playing their own game by their own rules, and in Jet they’ve built an operation that’s already claimed a meaningful share of the ecommerce market. Backed by Walmart’s supplier clout, customer reach, and balance sheet strength, we expect Team Jet to be upping their game radically in the months and years to come.

Bedding Today Furniture Everyday Mattress Math Formalized Curiosity An Inside Look #MattressTags CONFERENCES Leadership Conference HFMSE All Conferences EVENTS DESIGNERS TODAY   Furniture Everyday Bill McLoughlin Is Walmart's Jet.com acquisition a threat to the furniture industry? August 11, 2016 If you ever had any doubt that e-commerce was critical to the future of your business the announcement that Walmart is going to pay $3.3 billion for two-year-old e-commerce site Jet.com should dispel it. The nation’s largest retailer is so concerned about the existential threat posed by Amazon.com that it’s willing to pay three times more than Jet’s expected 2016 gross sales, largely to get access to Jet.com CEO Marc Lore and his team. The hope apparently, is they can reverse Walmart’s declining e-com performance. Last year Walmart’s e-commerce business grew by 7%, respectable in brick-and-mortar terms but less than half overall e-commerce growth of 15%. What that means is despite massive investment and a strategic focus on e-commerce, Walmart.com actually lost share last year. By comparison, Amazon grew 31% in the most recent quarter. In case you missed the story in the Aug.8 edition of Furniture/Today, Amazon.com took a showroom at the Las Vegas Market this month and had more than 50 people walking the market looking to attract furniture suppliers to its platform. The question is no longer “if” Amazon becomes a dominant force in the full-size furniture business but when. And let’s not forget Wayfair, which is already a major furniture player and growing stronger every day. And don’t comfort yourself with the “but they don’t turn a profit” trope. People said the same thing about Amazon for 20 years, and it’s pretty clear at this point how that turned out.   The old adage, “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em,” has never seemed more appropriate.  Getting a share of the rapidly growing e-commerce pie is going to be critical for furniture retailers looking to remain relevant in the coming years. And whether that means investing in a meaningful e-commerce platform and/or forming an alliance with Wayfair, Amazon or Walmart/Jet.com, the ability to get in front of these massive-and-rapidly-growing online audiences is going to be critical in the coming years. Equally critical is the ability to handle the inventory and delivery expectations of consumers being trained to expect shorter and shorter delivery times. When Jeff Bezos goes on TV and talks about drones, he’s setting a consumer expectation, regardless of whether it will be fully realized in the short term or not. When Amazon opens up local warehousing to deliver a selection of household consumables within an hour, it’s not only creating an expectation but building an infrastructure. Maybe it’s a year, two years, 10 years, but the know-how and infrastructure to layer in other product categories is being built. None of this is to say that brick and mortar is going away. It simply is to say that historical paradigms for the distribution and marketing of consumer goods are changing — significantly, irreversibly and quickly. You can play now or pay later, but one way or another these changes are happening. It’s time to login to the future of retail.   advertisement Sponsored Content Sponsored Links F/T's "Top 100 Furniture Stores" F/T's "Fastest Growing Furniture Stores" F/T's "Retail Giants of Bedding" F/T's "Top 15 Bedding Producers" F/T's "Key Sources for U.S. Market" F/T's "2016 Imports/Export Report" F/T's "Consumer Health & Wellness" F/T's "Economic Roundup" Author Posts A heritage to build on 7 things I am thankful for this Thanksgiving Are there business lessons to be learned from this election? 4 reasons you might not have had a good High Point Market You want to know how High Point Market went?

(Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP) 86 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK - The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged “Deep Fried Twinkies” starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They’ll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. It has a “retro cool factor,” says Ellen Copaken, Hostess’ vice president of marketing. “It plays into the comfort food trend. And it’s fun.” The Twinkie, long one of Hostess’ largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. The food lab at the company’s Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. “Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,” Redfield said. “But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don’t taste good don’t do well.” Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. “We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,” said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. “But there is still room for indulgence.” Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company’s financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they’re faring better than the deep-fried Oreos.  (Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP) “We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,” Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. “The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.” Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn’t easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Missouri, headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart’s headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. “The original samples were pretty good,” said John Pearson, Wal-Mart’s senior buyer for frozen foods. “But the batter was a little lumpy.” Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren’t an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. “It’s really good. It’s delicious,” said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn’t excited after trying it. “I like the original Twinkie,” she said. “This is a step too far.” What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. “We eliminated the hard work and prep,” she said. A look at Hostess’ new “Deep Fried Twinkies” NEW YORK - A look at Hostess’ “Deep Fried Twinkies”: HOW IT’S MADE: A regular Twinkie is coated with a cake funnel batter and then proceeds through an oil bath to ensure the batter adheres. The Twinkies are immediately frozen and packaged. HOME PREPARATION: Pull it out of the freezer and bake it for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for two-and-a-half to three minutes. THE PRICE: $4.76 per box of seven. For comparison, New York-based hot-dog joint Papaya King sells its own fresh deep-fried treats for $3 each, excluding tax. DISTRIBUTION: The Deep Fried Twinkies will be available starting Friday, Aug. 12, at Wal-Mart only for three months. After that, they will be available at other stores. Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, says the treat could be marketed abroad. NUTRITION: The vanilla-cream version has 220 calories, nine grams of fat and 16 grams of sugar. A regular Twinkie has 130 calories, four grams of fat and 14 grams of sugar. In comparison, a Starbucks Carmel Frappuccino has 420 calories, 15 grams of fat and 66 grams of sugar. WORKING IT OFF: A person who weighs about 150 pounds would need to run for 20 minutes at 10 mph, take a 40-minute spin class or do a 50-minute bike ride, says Amy Gorin, a Jersey City, New Jersey-based registered dietitian-nutritionist. LIMITED-TIME TWINKIES: In December, Hostess teamed up with Wal-Mart on a limited-time mint-chocolate flavored cake. In June, it worked with the retailer on a tie-in for the new “Ghostbusters” movie, creating Key Lime Slime Twinkies for a short-term sale. 86 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) NEW YORK, N.Y. - Wal-Mart opened a 12,000-square-foot culinary and innovation centre at its headquarters in June as a place where the nation's largest food retailer can work with major suppliers to come up with new food ideas, and develop ideas on its own to bolster its store-brand selection. Here's a peek at the food lab: WHAT IT IS: The centre has 10 test kitchens including a studio-style chef's kitchen and replicas of the bakery and deli kitchens found in most of its stores. It has stoves, ovens and microwaves so the staff can cook the same ways customers do at home. There's also a sensory lab where Wal-Mart can collect feedback from customers and employees, who answer questions about the texture, saltiness or sweetness of a food or beverage. The facility follows a similar lab at the company's Sam's Club headquarters, which opened a few years ago. WHY IT MATTERS: Wal-Mart derives 56 per cent of its total sales from food and other grocery items. The company also accounts for about 25 per cent of the overall U.S. grocery business. Since customers might shop for food several times a week, it's critical to get food items right to build loyalty. In the past, Wal-Mart had tested products at kitchens throughout its headquarters, but that effort was limited and the feedback it provided was fairly general. Now, Wal-Mart gets specific feedback from customers that it can share with suppliers to help decide if an item is ready or needs changes. That collaboration saves money and cuts several months off a product launch, which can last a year from idea to an item landing on store shelves. WHAT'S NEXT: Wal-Mart is testing frozen stuffed doughnut bites as well as new flavours for its Clear American Ice store brand sparkling water and Paleo meals that are vacuum-packed. The Clear American Ice pineapple-orange flavour arrives in stores in September. The Paleo meals and the doughnut bites will be in the stores in October.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       In this Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2016, photo, Papaya King president Wayne Rosenbaum spreads chocolate sauce on a freshly deep-fried Twinkie at the flagship store in New York.

USA TODAY A sign hangs on the side of a Macy's at Upper Valley Mall in Springfield, OH on February 4, 2015. (Photo: Maddie McGarvey for USA TODAY) Retailers continue to face a challenging environment in 2016, with Macy's becoming only the latest top name to announce a wave of store closings this year. Macy's (M) said it will close 100 of its 675 full-line locations amid falling profitability. The department-store chain is only one in a list that ranges widely from specialty apparel to sporting goods. USA TODAY Macy's to close 100 stores as big-box retailer shrinks further Among the top retailers closing stores in 2016 so far: Sports Authority: 460 stores shutting down The struggling sporting goods store chain is in the process of closing all of its 460 stores. The retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March and originally planned to close about 140 stores, but is now completely folding after attempting to restructure debt. No offers were made at an auction from buyers willing to keep any stores open. Dick's Sporting Goods bought Sports Authority's intellectual property and some leases for $15 million. Sports Authority launched a massive going-out of business sale that is expected to be completed this month, according to documents. Sports Authority cited online competition as a key factor in its demise. USA TODAY Sports Authority shutting down with giant going-out-of-business sale Walmart: Closing 269 stores, including 154 U.S. locations  The world's largest retailer said in January that it was closing 269 stores around the world as it refocuses on its supercenters and e-commerce business. The closures include 154 U.S. locations and all of its Express format stores that are smaller and designed to compete against so called dollar stores. The closures were decided based on financial performance and how well the locations fit with Walmart's broader strategy, the company said. Walmart has nearly 11,600 stores worldwide and plans to open more than 300 stores in the fiscal year. Walmart (WMT) is attempting to aggressively grow its e-commerce business and compete with Amazon.com. The retailer announced this week that is was buying thee-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3 billion. USA TODAY List of the 154 U.S. stores Walmart is closing Aeropostale: 154 stores closing The apparel retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May and announced it was closing 113 of its 739 U.S. stores and all 41 of its stores in Canada. Aeropostale said 117 of the stores set to close are not profitable and were responsible for $17 million in losses in 2015, according to a court filing. The retailer was facing intense competition in the teen retail environment by the likes of fast-fashion brands H&M and Forever 21. USA TODAY Will your Aeropostale close? Here's the list Kmart/Sears: 78 stores closing Sears Holdings (SHLD) announced in April that it will close 68 Kmart stores and 10 Sears stores this summer as the struggling retailer continues to weed out unprofitable locations. The April announcement came after the company accelerated  the closure of 50 stores at the start of the year. The retailer faces multiple challenges from home-improvement chains like Lowe's and Home Depot continue to chip away at appliance sales and Target and other fast-fashion brands when it comes to apparel. And the closings come amid the backdrop of Amazon.com dominating online sales. Critics claim many Kmart and Sears stores are dated and uninspiring in this hyper-competitive retail environment. USA TODAY List: 78 Sears, Kmart stores closing Ralph Lauren: Closing at least 50 stores  The retailer founded by fashion icon Ralph Lauren said in June that is plans to close at least 50 stores and cut about 1,000 employees as it attempts to cut costs and create a leaner business. Ralph Lauren (RL) stores have been suffering from falling sales and profits as it struggles to keep up with fast-changing retail trends and new style preferences. 7194 CONNECTTWEET 889 LINKEDIN 47 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2b8w7rY

For the largest retailer on the planet, even this multi-billion dollar acquisition might not be enough to restore momentum to the company's e-commerce strategy. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Aug 11, 2016 at 5:32PM Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shocked the retail world when it announced that it had acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion. The deal gives the big box store access to new technology, as well as the upstart online retailer's CEO Marc Lore, who will take over the company's complete e-commerce operation. It's a move that makes the No. 1 physical retailer the clear No. 2 in the online space. That said, Wal-Mart was already second to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and this move may not actually bring it much closer to the top. On this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Vincent Shen is joined by Fool.com contributor Daniel Kline as they discuss whether Marc Lore and the innovative technology at Jet.com will be enough to tip the scales for a company with annual revenue approaching half a trillion dollars. They also cover the drivers behind the deal and the stalling momentum of Wal-Mart's previous e-commerce efforts. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Aug. 9, 2016. Vincent Shen: Previously, with Lore's older venture with Quidsi, for example, I think a really loyal shopper following that he had was among younger urban shoppers. Then with Jet.com, they've been spending, like, $20 or $25 million a month advertising. A lot of that's targeting not only millennials, but they're trying to basically generate more repeat shoppers. I think I have some data from Slice and BI Intelligence dating back to February that indicated Jet.com was having a hard time generating repeat business -- over two-thirds of their sales were coming from new customers. You mentioned the 400,000 people signing up, or essentially shopping with them, with each month. It's just interesting to kind of see that dynamic there. Daniel Kline: The problem they come up against is Amazon has -- and I don't know the recent number -- but it's roughly 225 million credit cards on file. However, many 63 -- something like that -- million Prime members, they don't share the numbers, so it's always a guess. They've made the process so easy that I buy on Amazon from my phone; I can buy things verbally from my Echo. As an Amazon customer, why would I switch? Because diapers are $0.02 less? I don't need diapers. Any device I was going to buy, anything, if Amazon is within the ballpark, I'm not going to shop around. Maybe I'll jump on Jet.com and buy a TV because it's $100 cheaper, but I'm probably not going to switch. That's a very, very difficult behavior for any new company to win over. I would think that an awful lot of Amazon customers just find it a little bit cooler to buy from Amazon than to buy from Walmart. They can be No. 2. If they're trying to be No. 2, they can be a bigger No. 2, but this is like me challenging for the heavyweight championship; it's not going to work out well. Shen: With all that in mind, I'm a little skeptical as you are just based on the price tag. Three hundred million dollars in cash, $30 million in Walmart stock, and I think a lot of that is going to be dedicated -- it's basically incentives for management. Three-hundred million; sorry about that. Kline: In stock. Shen: Yeah, in stock. Kline: And three billion in cash. Shen: Exactly. For Walmart, their e-commerce efforts in their physical year 2015, they were seeing some pretty strong progress. Year over year, quarterly growth was anywhere from 21% to 27%. Then the following year, so last year, in their fiscal 2016, it kind of started to fall from the high teens to below 10%. In the most-recent quarter, it came in at just 7% globally. That deceleration definitely has people concerned because it's lagging even the broad economy, where e-commerce is, I think, still growing double-digit rates every quarter. Kline: They need to catch up to Amazon in terms of fulfillment. If you buy anything from Amazon, it is going to show up in two days, including on Sunday. Walmart doesn't even promise that. I think they'll sell it to you for an extra price. The days when you place an order and it takes three-to-five shipping days, Amazon has created a new standard, and people have proven willing. I'll buy batteries from Amazon because I could wait 48 hours with my remote control not working. I'm not going to wait a week. That's really where Walmart has to catch up, and Jet can help with that. This will make the Walmart customer have a better experience on Walmart.com and on Jet.com after six months, a year of integration, but I don't see it winning over new business. This may help them as they lose sales in the store to their own website fulfill, and keep those customers happy. That is an important step. Shen: Something else that I wanted to mention, too, is I'm curious to see how they blend, how it really impacts Walmart, because I know they -- I think it's called their shipping pass where you basically pay a flat fee for the year and you get two-day shipping -- and this is really just very similar to Prime to be more competitive with Amazon with those really incredible fulfillment speeds, and how they kind of blend that with the fact that Jet.com has some of this infrastructure, some of this technology in terms of optimizing and making as cheap as possible for their shoppers and the smart cart and everything. Kline: That's why I say, it ultimately has to be one brand. It seems crazy to me that you would make Jet.com the online version of Walmart, so that's not going to happen. Eventually, this will become a Walmart.com powered by Jet, and then Jet will be down in the corner -- and then Jet won't exist anymore. Hopefully, they can integrate the technology because if they do, they have to get faster. Walmart has an incredible network. Amazon has its warehouses, but Walmart has a store in most of the country, something like every five miles. Their ability to ship to stores, to ship to you from a store, if they can figure that out, and obviously there's a lot of programming and algorithms, we've talked before about how Amazon knows what you're going to buy in a local warehouse before you order it. If Walmart can figure that out and Jet helps them, then maybe they bridge some of that shipping divide, and that will at least stop them from bleeding customers just because Amazon can get things faster. Shen: I have to say, I just have to admit that I'm a little curious, too, to see you have this small upstart company just hitting about $1 billion in their gross merchandise volume in their first, they've launched July 2015, so just about a year of existence, has Amazon kind of paying attention, at the very least. Walmart jumps in -- huge resources. I'm really curious to see where things go even if the price tag may be a little high. Maybe hopes are a little too high; but overall, definitely an interesting deal. Kline: It's definitely possible that this gets Walmart back on the growth path from ramping down to ramping up, but I think Amazon is watching this and laughing. This is not a competitor. This is my little league team challenging the Red Sox. It's not going to do that, but they can become a better No. 2. The other thing they can do is crowd out some of the other players. If I'm Amazon, I'm not worried. If I'm Target, I'm a little bit nervous. If I'm Kohl's, maybe I'm nervous. This is sort of Walmart saying, "We're in second place, let's consolidate." And almost any price is worth it to do that. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

In a press release, CVS officially announced CVS Pay, a barcode-based solution to paying for goods and prescriptions in the company’s retail locations. CVS Pay is very similar to Walmart Pay, namely in that it is operated entirely through the recently updated CVS app. Once a user adds their debit or credit card(s) to the CVS app, they present the cashier with a barcode or a pickup number displayed in the app. Once the barcode has been scanned, users can choose a card to pay with, initiate the process, and ultimately sign for the purchase if required. One benefit of CVS Pay that the company is touting is its support for Heath Savings Account and Flex Spending Account cards. Because so much of the business CVS does is prescriptions, many users would need to use one of those cards to checkout. There’s also support for MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover, so if a user needs to split a prescription purchase from the rest of their purchase, they can do just that. CVS’s ExtraCare loyalty rewards is also built directly into the new CVS app. The ultimate goal of CVS Pay, the company says, is to “use digital tools to drive convenience.” CVS Pay is the latest solution from CVS Health that uses digital tools to drive convenience, as the company continues to develop and invest in new ways to make healthy lifestyles easier and more accessible for customers nationwide. Shortly after the launch of Apple Pay in 2014, CVS began disabling NFC terminals in stores in favor of the CurrentC mobile payments solution, which has since seen better days itself. Apple responded to CVS and other retailers shutting off NFC terminals, explaining the early success of Apple Pay and the response from users. Since then, some of the MCX/CurrentC retailers have started supporting Apple Pay, including Best Buy and Rite Aid, but Walmart and CVS have instead decided to launch their own services. CVS Pay can be accessed via the CVS app, which is available on the App Store now. CVS Pay is currently supported at locations in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, with a nationwide rollout expected by the end of this year. The full press release is below: CVS Pharmacy Launches Breakthrough, End-to-End Mobile Payment Experience WOONSOCKET, R.I., Aug. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) today announced the launch of CVS Pay , a new, end-to-end mobile payment solution at CVS Pharmacy. CVS Pay now part of the CVS Pharmacy mobile app integrates payment, prescription pickup and the ExtraCare loyalty program all in one quick scan at checkout. CVS Pay is the latest solution from CVS Health that uses digital tools to drive convenience, as the company continues to develop and invest in new ways to make healthy lifestyles easier and more accessible for customers nationwide. “Over the past year, our digital team has brought to market numerous new digital tools like CVS Pay that make shopping at CVS Pharmacy easier and more convenient,” said Brian Tilzer, Senior Vice President and Chief Digital Officer, CVS Health. “We’ve been excited by the level of customer adoption of these digital solutions, and we will continue our quick pace of innovation and deployment to make our customers’ health care experience even easier.” CVS Pay offers more than just a payment solution: customers can now use their CVS Pharmacy mobile app to streamline their checkout experience at the store combining multiple steps into one easy scan. For customers picking up a prescription, CVS Pay offers a simple, private and end-to-end pharmacy experience. Customers will have the ability to refill, manage multiple prescriptions and get alerts when prescriptions are ready, all within the app and then pick up and pay using a single barcode. Customers can also link their ExtraCare card with CVS Pay, meaning a single scan at checkout will process all ExtraCare deals, earn new rewards and handle payment for the transaction. To use CVS Pay, customers simply add any of their credit or debit cards in the CVS Pharmacy app. When they are ready to check out at a CVS Pharmacy store, they’ll show the store associate the barcode in their app. (At the drive-thru, they’ll share their pickup number.) The associate will scan the barcode, ring up the purchases, let the customer choose a payment method from those stored in the app, and then process the payment. All verifications for prescriptions and payment like name/birthdate, signature, and PIN take place directly in the app, so transactions are hassle free. Once complete, the customer will receive a confirmation of payment in the app. CVS Pay is currently available in select markets, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware and a nationwide rollout is expected to kick off later this year. The solution is available on iOS and Android devices the same platforms the CVS Pharmacy app is available on today and works with all major credit (MasterCard, Visa, Discover, American Express), debit, Health Savings Account, and Flexible Spending Account cards. About CVS Pharmacy CVS Pharmacy, the retail division of CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), is America’s leading retail pharmacy with over 9,600 locations.

Yes, that’s right — there’s yet another way for you to pay with your phone. But CVS’ method, like that of Walmart Pay and Starbucks, is a mobile payment solution that uses a barcode. So unlike the top dogs — Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay — it’s not using near field communication or Magnetic Secure Transmission — you have to open the CVS Pharmacy app, add your credit card information, pull up your barcode at the register, and have the clerk scan your phone. You then choose one of the payment methods you have added and that’s it, your order has been processed and you’ll see confirmation in the app. If you’re at a CVS drive-thru, you only need to share a pickup number, and for prescriptions, you’ll need to verify your identity through the app before orders are processed. Related: Walmart Pay is here to enhance your Walmart shopping experience If you’re a CVS ExtraCare customer, you can link your ExtraCare card to CVS Pay so that you only need to use your phone to access all ExtraCare deals and rewards, and handle payment.

There are some federal funding sources that should kick in after year two, but program officials said they are also looking for endowment funds to ensure the program is sustainable long term. “The Walmart Foundation aims to enhance the lives of families in northwest Arkansas and understands the importance of job training and education when it comes to recruiting and retaining top medical talent,” said Julie Gehrki, senior director of the Walmart Foundation. “We are very proud to support this partnership and help advance great physicians seeking a meaningful career in healthcare.” Mercy Health System Northwest, Veterans Health Care of the Ozarks and the Little Rock-based University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences are partnering in the new program that began with its first eight resident physicians at the end of June. The program is based at the UAMS campus in Fayetteville. Five of the physicians are serving their residencies at Mercy Health System Northwest Arkansas in Rogers, while the other three are at the Veterans Health Center of the Ozarks in Fayetteville. All eight will practice at both locations as well as the residency continuity clinic on the UAMS campus in Fayetteville. The program is expected to grow over the next two years until there are 24 residents by 2018. The program is a step to solving the major shortage of residency programs across the state and particularly in Northwest Arkansas. The doctors said Northwest Arkansas is short about 148 residents which equates to about 3,700 missed appointments a day for those needing to see a doctor. Gehrki said the missed appointments were a staggering statistic that resonated with the Foundation because the missed appointments are likely among the underserved by healthcare. “We are thrilled to partner with the Walmart Foundation to bring more talented physicians to train – and, hopefully, stay – in Northwest Arkansas,” said program director Dr. Thomas Schulz, an associate professor in the UAMS College of Medicine’s Department of Internal Medicine. He said the program received accreditation in September 2015 from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. “We received 237 applications and we selected 35 for interview and we ended up with a class of eight. We wanted those doctors with a pioneer sort of spirit because this is a brand new program. We ended up with a very special inaugural class,” Dr. Shulz said. Residents are trained in a variety of internal medicine subspecialties including critical care medicine, cardiology, emergency medicine, geriatric medicine, gastroenterology, oncology and pulmonary disease. The residency program is important to the region’s effort to address its doctor shortage, especially with regard to primary care doctors who treat adults and the elderly, said Dr. Steve Goss, president of Mercy Clinic Northwest Arkansas. The number of students graduating from schools of medicine and osteopathy is growing, but the number of residencies lags, he said. Mercy wants to do its part to help educate the next generation of doctors by giving them an intensive clinical experience. Mercy also wants to be part of building northwest Arkansas as a destination for great health care, and the residency program is part of that, Goss said. “We believe if we train them here, many of them will stay here. It’s another way to attract great physicians,” he said. “The field for these residents is highly competitive. Imagine going through the expense of completing your medical degree and then not being able to find a place to do your residency. There is very little a doctor can do until they complete their residency program.” Earlier this year Goss told Talk Business & Politics that as the local region continues to expand and health care providers open more clinics to bring care closer to home, the shortage of doctors and other advanced practitioners has worsened. Mercy Hospital in Rogers announced plans to recruit and hire 100 new doctors as part of their 5-year $247 million expansion plan. Goss said it’s getting a little easier to recruit doctors to the region, but they hope to also build a pipeline of new resident doctors with the new internal residency program. He said the program also gives the hospital a three-year trial period with the residents and hopefully they will be able to retain many of these doctors once they finish their residency. The first eight residents in the new program include doctors from near and far away. • Dr. Sonia Chaudhary, University Medical College Faisalabad in Faisalabad, Pakistan • Dr. Chris Finlay, UAMS • Dr. Nhanmy Huynh, St. George’s University School of Medicine, Grenada, West Indies • Dr. Naveen Kallarackal, Ross University School of Medicine, Portsmouth, Dominica • Dr. Matthew Neoh, UAMS • Dr. Mark Shelnutt, UAMS • Dr. Kristopher Stepps, UAMS • Dr. Michelle Valentine, Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Parker, Colo. “We are excited at Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks for this opportunity to partner with UAMS for the internal medicine residency program,” said Bryan Matthews, medical center director. “Through its partnerships with affiliated academic institutions, VA conducts the largest education and training effort for health professionals in the nation. Our affiliation with UAMS will continue this effort, and ensure that medical professionals are well trained to meet the unique needs of veterans.” Author Bio: See latest posts Comments 17shares Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Opinion Ken Smith What will a Trump presidency mean for Arkansas’ advanced energy economy?

It will use some of those resources to double down on its digital operations.  As plans go, it isn't a bad one — that's what Walmart, after all, is doing. Earlier this year, Walmart announced plans to close 269 stores, with 154 in the US. It still is willing to invest in new stores in strategic markets — it has plans to open more than 300 stores for this fiscal year — but it is determined to crack the online sales nut. Just this week it announced it was investing $3.3 billion to acquire Jet.com. The playbook, in other words, is a familiar one in these post-Amazon days. Integrate online sales with the brick-and-mortar operation so it is one seamless entity for consumers who don’t want to be limited to one channel. To be sure, the solution is not as straightforward as all that. In Macy's case, many of its stores represent valuable real estate that the company is better off monetizing. At least that has been the argument of its activist shareholders for a while. Can Macy's Get It Right? But leaving such complexities aside, why can't retailers get the main point right — that is, deliver a worthwhile omnichannel solution. More urgently, can Macy's finally get this formula right? One sign that it really does intend to shake up the house was the announcement in June that CEO Terry Lundgren was stepping down. A luminary among retail executives, Lundgren was responsible for putting Macy's on the retail map back in the day. Unfortunately, he is also a strong — and some might say stubborn — supporter of the brick-and-mortar department store model.  Transparent Pricing This could be just how Lundgren came up in the industry, but there are other reasons why Macy’s and retailers in general are not enthusiastic fans of online sales: they make pricing just a wee bit too transparent. In the first quarter, Macy's lowered its guidance for margin in part because price transparency was increasing online, according to comments made by CFO Karen Hoguet. Specifically, she said this in response to a question about her view of longer term consolidated gross margin: "Well, I think the transparency is in part why we've lowered the guidance for margin. When we release the fourth quarter we had talked about the gross margin being up this year and we no longer think that will be the case. So I think that's where that came into play." Macy's Is Big on Retail Tech The irony is, Macy's has been a fervent believer in investing in retail technology as can be been in this CMSWire interview with Yasir Anwar, head of Digital Technology and Group Vice President at Macy's. Anwar is also the founder of Macy's Labs, which is focused on experimental digital initiatives. "We have built an organizational DNA that allows us to innovate frequently," Anwar told us in February 2016. "We are able to easily build something and experiment and make changes quickly so the shape of the product we are creating is defined by the customers." One example, he said, was m by Macy's, an experimental mobile optimized website in which curated deals are offered in various categories. More recently — just last month in fact — Macy's announced the pilot of "Macy's On Call," a mobile web tool that uses IBM Watson to answer natural language questions about a store's product line up. Tweaking the Experience But it may be that Macy’s would be better off focusing on that original formula — the omnichannel experience, Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, told CMSWire. "There are simple things Macy’s can do to marry online shopping, the retail experience and shipping," he said. Based on Macy's statements about its store closure plans, the retailer plans to invest some of the savings in back office operations, better logistics and its private label stock. All of this, Caporaso said, can be woven into an omnichannel plan. If, that is, Macy's really wants to do so.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds E-Edition log in Lake Wales police rescue child from locked car Thursday Aug 11, 2016 at 2:41 PM The father and grandmother of a 3-year-old girl face charges of child neglect without bodily harm after they left her in an SUV on Wednesday with only a vent cracked when they went into a Wal-Mart. By Marilyn Meyer The Ledger LAKE WALES — The father and grandmother of a 3-year-old girl face charges of child neglect without bodily harm after they left her in an SUV on Wednesday with only a vent cracked when they went into a Wal-Mart. The child was treated and released from Lake Wales Medical Center and suffered no apparent injuries, Lake Wales police Lt. David Black said in a news release. Timothy Adams, 28, and Anna Adams, 57, both of 1495 Meadowlark Trail, Frostproof, were booked into the Polk County Jail. Each told investigators they thought the other adult had taken the child out of the SUV. Shortly after 4 p.m. Wednesday, a customer notified Wal-Mart employees that a child was alone in a vehicle with the windows rolled up, according to a news release. When police officers arrived, they found a Honda Element not running, the windows up except for rear vents that were cracked open and a child who appeared to be crying. The little girl was communicating with the officers but was sweating, her hair stuck to her forehead and her cheeks red. Officer Matt Rhoden broke a front passenger window and Sgt. Bruce Yoxall pulled her out of the vehicle. “The child clung to Sgt. Yoxall, wrapping her arms around his neck and laying her head on his shoulder,” Black said. The temperature at the time was 86 degrees, partially cloudy, with humidity at 74 percent and a feels-like temperature of 95 degrees, Black said. The child was in the car for more than 20 minutes, he said. Temperatures in an enclosed car rise rapidly, putting anyone inside, whether child or pet, in danger of sunstroke and eventual death. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, when the outside temperature is 85 degrees, the air inside an enclosed car can reach 104 degrees in 10 minutes, 114 degrees in 20 minutes, and 128 degrees in an hour. Video shows the Honda Element being parked at 3:44 p.m. Four minutes later, Timothy Adams gets out of the SUV and takes his 6-year-old daughter from the rear passenger seat and pushes her in a shopping cart toward the store. Anna Adams gets out of the driver's door and follows about 20 feet behind, Black said. “She appeared to look back at the vehicle on several occasions as she is passing it and walking away from it,” Black said. The Wards returned to the vehicle after they were paged in the store, Black said. Officers worked with the Florida Department of Children and Families to find a safe place for the children. — Marilyn Meyer can be reached at marilyn.meyer@theledger.com or 863-802-7558.

Walmart Acquisition Could Mean Most Jet Customers Have To Pay Sales Tax Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Acquisition Could Mean Most Jet Customers Have To Pay Sales Tax Image courtesy of Mike Mozart August 11, 2016 1:28 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup wal-jet walmart jet acquisitions mergers and acquisitions sales tax E-commerce companies don’t have to collect sales tax from customers who live in states where they have no physical presence, which could be anything from their headquarters to a distribution center. That’s been one of the advantages that Jet has had in the marketplace over its chief rival Amazon, which has facilities in 28 states, including the most populous ones. Jet customers in most states don’t have to pay sales tax. However, that could change soon, after Walmart’s acquisition of the young e-commerce company. The Wall Street Journal explains that Jet has physical presences (distribution centers or offices) in seven states, so only shoppers in Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Utah have to pay sales tax on purchases from the site. Walmart, on the other hand, has a physical presence in all 50 states. While integrating Walmart’s inventory on the Jet site would expand its offerings and create all sorts of exciting savings using the company’s cart-building algorithm, integrating with Walmart to that extent would mean losing its advantage in states that have a sales tax. Jet founder Marc Lore sold his previous company, Quidsi (Diapers.com, Soap.com, and Wag.com), to Amazon, and it operates independently from Amazon’s distribution network. So does Zappos. However, shoppers at both sites have to pay sales tax in states where Amazon has a physical presence. Which rules apply will depend on how the alliance between Walmart and Jet is structured, but it would mean Jet losing its main advantage for consumers over shopping on Amazon.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Back-to-School Sale: Walmart vs. Target Deals on School Supplies By Jennifer Riley Aug 11, 2016 | 1:16 PM Frenzied parents towing their children to Walmart, Target and other big box stores for back-to-school supplies in August, is an annual tradition that is as much exciting for kids as it is exhausting for parents. To save parents some time and energy, we've done the research to see whether Walmart or Target has the better deal on popular items on school supply lists. Check out the deals below and see which store you should go to and save a trip. Markers Perennial favorite Crayola Markers which boasts "Preferred by Teachers!" on its cover is the same price at Walmart as it is at Target. A pack of 10 classic color Crayola Markers is $0.97 at both stores, but Target notes that the regular price is $0.99 and the $0.97 is the sale price. Also Target has the bonus that patrons who spend $30 on school supplies will get a $5 giftcard. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Wide-Ruled Loosed Leaf Paper 150 sheets of wide-ruled filler paper comes in at a cool $0.82 at Walmart and 125 sheets of similar filler paper at Target is $0.75 a pack. Walmart is the better deal here. Crayons A set of 24 Crayola Classic Color Pack of Crayons, 24 count, is only $0.50 at Walmart while at Target a comparable set but with the benefit of being labeled nontoxic is $1.37 #2 pencils Walmart has cheaper #2 pencils, with a 20 pack being sold for only $0.97 while at Target a pack of 24 #2 pencils from the generic store brand up&up is $3.94 – that's a big difference. Glue Another school favorite, Elmer's washable school glue, sells for just $0.50 for a 4 fl oz bottle at Walmart while the exact same glue sells for $1.03 at Target – that's more than double the price! School Box Both Walmart and Target carry the Advantus clear pencil box but at Walmart it's $2.00 while at Target it's $2.04. Overall it seems like Walmart beats Target when price are compared on an individual basis, but if you expect to spend over $30 on supplies, you may find that Target's spend $30 and get $5 giftcard more rewarding.

Skip to content People Crime News Courts & Trials Cold Cases Crime Underground Meth Lab 'Stumbled Upon' Beneath a Wal-Mart Parking Lot, N.Y. Police Say By Harriet Sokmensuer•@hgsokmensuer Posted on August 11, 2016 at 10:45am EST Share Tweet Email Pinterest YouTube Authorities say they are investigating an underground meth lab that was “stumbled upon” earlier this week beneath a Wal-Mart parking lot in western New York, PEOPLE confirms. Police discovered the lab while conducting a separate investigation of the area, in a culvert near the parking lot of an Amherst Wal-Mart on Monday afternoon, Amherst police detective Lt. JoAnn DiNoto tells PEOPLE. (Other businesses share the Wal-Mart parking lot, DiNoto says.) DiNoto calls the lab’s discovery “strange” since the town does not deal with many meth-related crimes. “[Meth] is becoming more common but certainly not commonplace,” she says. Soon after the discovery, members of the New York State Police Contaminated Crime Scene Evidence Recovery Team, which deals with meth labs and dangerous chemical situations, arrived at the scene, DiNoto says. The parking lot was not evacuated during the search – the area was not believed to be dangerous, DiNoto tells PEOPLE. She says the lab was small and included a pair of goggles and a makeshift table made out of a piece of wood on an old tire. Investigators wore Hazmat suits as they cleared evidence, including spray cans and various chemicals believed to be methamphetamine, from the underground lab, DiNoto says. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

However, they do believe the suspects entered the underground lab through the culvert, which opens up behind the Wal-Mart. There are no known suspects at this time, DiNoto says, but officials are hoping to identify the lab operators using Wal-Mart surveillance footage. “We were shocked when we found out about this,” Erica Jones, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, tells PEOPLE in a statement. “It’s upsetting and unacceptable.

August 11, 2016 Why did Walmart take the unusual step to tackle chemicals? Michelle Mauthe Harvey Director, Supply Chain Environmental Defense Fund Related Stories Mars Drinks’ Single Serve Packaging Redesign Cuts Carbon Footprint by 31% Building an Effective Data Acquisition Strategy: Acquiring Product Material and Compliance Data Addressing Supply Chain Risk, Sustainability in Strategic Plans Co-op, Nestle, Sainsbury’s to Cut Supply Chain Carbon Footprint Manufacturers: Sustainability is Everyone’s Responsibility Related Topics All EL Stories Guest Column Products & Planning Sustainability Sustainable Facilities Sustainable Packaging & Paper Sustainable Strategy & Leadership Walmart recently announced progress on its groundbreaking Sustainable Chemistry Policy, a 2013 plan that set the stage for some 700 suppliers to rethink how they make more than 90,000 home and personal care products. Result: The world’s largest retailer drove out more than 11,000 tons – 23 million pounds, or 95 percent by weight – of prioritized chemicals from that group of products in less than 30 months. A lot still remains to be done. But this story is a good one and Walmart’s leadership, sustainability team and buyers – deserve credit for what they accomplished. What’s perhaps equally extraordinary is that they chose to do so at all. Sustainability wins are typically also economic wins. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and your energy expenses drop. Address water use in drought-prone areas, and you avoid costly supply chain disruptions that cause price spikes and make customers unhappy. But chemicals? The business case can be thin to none. Changing chemicals is difficult and risky Even when the science says it’s time to make a change because one or more legal ingredients we once believed to be safe turn out not to be – changing a product formula without changing the product can be difficult. It also takes time: on average 18 to 24 months. Product ingredients are the smell, the feel and the way a product cleans or softens or does whatever it’s supposed to do. Change it, and you risk sales if customers reject the alternative. There are few-to-no marketing wins here, either. Despite the fact that pretty much everything and everybody is a chemical mixture, people don’t want “better” chemistry. They want no chemistry, and keep looking for chemical-free products that don’t exist. Walmart decided to tackle ingredient chemistry anyway. It begs the question: Even with years of persistent nudging from Environmental Defense Fund, why would Walmart do this? Three plausible business reasons One answer is that customers – along with scientists, advocates and bloggers – were really starting to voice concerns over chemicals in products, so it made good business sense to respond. Another is that the timing was right. A lot of companies were already making formulation changes, so a request for improvements could be achievable. Also important to note is that Walmart and other retailers have paid hefty fines over improper product disposal. So eliminating regulated substances from product ingredients could reduce the risk of more penalties. All three are plausible business reasons. You’ll have to ask Walmart why to get their answer. But what I’ve experienced – and the reason I’ve stayed in Bentonville for almost 10 years – is what’s stated in Walmart’s sustainable chemistry policy itself: “Walmart and Sam’s Club believe that customers/members should not have to choose between products that they can afford and products that are better for them and the environment.” The people with whom I’ve worked at Walmart, especially on product chemistry, live by that statement. Idea rippled through industry When Walmart released its policy, the company didn’t just call for the ouster of the high-priority chemicals. Walmart took a leadership stance. Walmart committed to making the product ingredients transparent to customers. The company embraced informed substitution, which means it’s intent on making sure that ingredients targeted by the new policy are replaced with better ones. And for its private brand products, Walmart set its sights onSafer Choice, a voluntary labeling program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that requires every ingredient to be as safe as possible. Target’s chemicals initiative was announced shortly afterwards. The ripple effect spread across the personal-care products industry, with companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive following with their own chemicals-focused efforts. So let’s stop a moment and give credit where credit is due – to the people who chose to make things better, whatever their reasons.  This story has been republished with permission by the Environmental Defense Fund Mars Drinks’ Single Serve Packaging Redesign Cuts Carbon Footprint by 31% Building an Effective Data Acquisition Strategy: Acquiring Product Material and Compliance Data Addressing Supply Chain Risk, Sustainability in Strategic Plans Co-op, Nestle, Sainsbury’s to Cut Supply Chain Carbon Footprint Manufacturers: Sustainability is Everyone’s Responsibility Reader Comments There are no comments for this story.   Name (required) Mail (will not be published) (required) Website Energy Manager News Energy Performance Contracts Facilitate Big Changes for CA School District NextEra, TVA Launch Largest Solar Project in Alabama Trane Introduces Water-Cooled Chiller In Antitrust Filing, Sierra Club Alleges NEXUS Pipeline Would Raise Retail Rates Excessively Public Service Co. of Oklahoma Requests Extra Time for $75M Rate Refund IKEA Builds Sustainability, Energy Savings Naperville, IL, Almost Ready for Consumer Energy Management Miramar FAA Location Taps Solar NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

By buying Jet.com, a shopping website, Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, has joined the ranks of investors betting on so-called “unicorns”, or private startups valued at over $1 billion. The acquisition is the most expensive deal ever for an American e-commerce startup, and a sign of just how worried Walmart executives are by the rise of Amazon. It’s also an admission that despite heavy internal investment, the Bentonville giant’s own site, Walmart.com, is nowhere near enough. Walmart still accounts for a tenth of American retail sales, but that has declined from 11.6% in 2009, according to Cowen Group, a financial-services firm. Amazon’s share is about half of Walmart’s, but it is growing fast. Moreover, last year, of every $10 that American shoppers dispensed on goods, $1 was spent online. Even the Walmart faithful are beginning to use Amazon. Last year just over a tenth of Walmart’s customers shopped on Amazon too.   Online, where the future battle lies, the news for Walmart is scarcely better. Last year its global e-commerce sales increased by 12% to $13.7 billion, compared with a 20% jump to $107 billion of sales at Amazon. At the start of the year Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth slowed to 7%. For its chief executive, Doug McMillon, this may have been a trigger to make a quick acquisition. Amazon’s fast and efficient shipping through Amazon Prime has also proven hard to match, as has its range of products (Amazon is said to offer well over 200m different items, while Walmart.com serves up around 11m). Buying Jet.com is unlikely to change the dynamic between the two giants. In technology circles, some view the shopping website as an ugly foal masquerading as a unicorn. It is believed to lose around 30 cents for every dollar of sales it makes (it does not release the figures), because of its alluringly low prices. The more it sells to its customers, the more it loses. Its investors will be glad of the generously priced exit offered by Walmart. One attraction is Jet.com’s real-time pricing algorithm, which tempts customers with lower prices if they add more items to their basket. The algorithm also identifies which of Jet.com’s vendors is closest to the consumer, helping to minimise shipping costs and allowing them to offer discounts. Walmart plans to integrate the software with its own. Buying this platform makes more sense than trying to develop it internally, says Charles O’Shea of Moody’s, a rating agency. Walmart is also buying talent. Jet.com chief executive Marc Lore has e-commerce pedigree. He co-founded Quidsi, the parent company of Diapers.com and Soap.com, among others, which Amazon itself snapped up for $545m six years ago. Mr Lore will now run both Jet.com and Walmart.com. Walmart also desperately hopes that Jet.com will help it attract millennials, a demographic it wants to do better with. Jet.com boasts a base of millennial shoppers which Walmart claims is growing by around 400,000 per month. Yet buying online-only Jet.com does not solve another problem that Walmart has, which is how to fuse its e-commerce business with its big-box stores. Nine out of ten Americans live within ten miles of one of its ubiquitous boxes, meaning the firm’s online shoppers can collect their purchases nearby. Walmart says that shoppers who spend both online and in physical stores end up buying more than those who keep to bricks and mortar. But the firm faces two hard truths. First, building an e-commerce business is horribly expensive. Second, as more people shift to shopping online, they may shun Walmart’s vast, neon-lit boxes. This may make the titan of efficiency less profitable and force it to close more stores. It is not unlike the scenario that, not so long ago, Walmart inflicted on small chains of local shops. twitter icon facebook icon more iconMore linkedin icon googleplus icon mail icon print icon purchase-rights icon View comments (11) Editors’ picks Protest and lose your passportTo silence dissidents, Gulf states are revoking their citizenship Many are left stateless as a result Britain’s youngAre they screwed?

Solo climber sets new record conquering Yosemite's El Capitan Iran to US: honor nuclear deal, or else Modes of thought In focus groups, Wal-Mart moms were downright brutal toward Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. But they showed surprising optimism about the economy.  By Linda Feldmann, Staff writer August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved A Walmart store in La Habra, Calif. Jae C. Hong/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Washington — Ask a bunch of moms about their emotions around the 2016 presidential campaign, and a torrent of negativity comes flooding out. Start with “frustrated,” “divided,” and “worried.” Then the longer explanations emerge. “There’s a lot of name-calling rather than getting to the point,” says Donna G., a clinic manager in Columbus, Ohio.

Test Your KnowledgeCould you pass a US citizenship test? Find out. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 “No matter who wins, the country will be so divided it will be hard to get anything done,” says Connie M. of Phoenix, a caregiver for her parents. These are all “Wal-Mart moms” – regular Wal-Mart shoppers with children at home, who make up between 14 percent and 17 percent of the electorate. Since 2008, they have voted with the winning party in every election except 2014, making them a bellwether voting bloc. Their comments, made in focus groups Tuesday evening in Columbus and Phoenix, provide insight into voter choices in November. But all was not gloom and doom for the 20 women, who varied in age, race, income, and education level. Most extraordinary, perhaps, was their take on the economy – overall, not bad. “It’s the economy, stupid” is a campaign staple, and this year is no exception. Republican Donald Trump has zeroed in on the anxieties of working-class white voters, targeting immigration and international trade as culprits. Democrat Hillary Clinton has pledged to continue the economic recovery that started under President Obama but has left some workers feeling insecure amid stagnant wages and slow economic growth. When each focus group was asked to weigh in on the economy, nearly everyone reported that they were at least holding their own, if not getting ahead. “In some aspects, I feel like we’re moving forward with the economy,” said Africa C., a business operations manager in Phoenix. “I’m looking at the price of gas, for example. We’re hitting bottom.” Representatives of the focus groups’ sponsors – Democratic pollsters Penn Schoen Berland and Republican pollsters Public Opinion Strategies – pointed out to reporters watching the sessions remotely via videolink that both Phoenix and Columbus are strong markets. Still, it’s rare to get a group of Wal-Mart moms together, and not hear an outpouring of concern about personal finances. Whether this is good news for Mrs. Clinton – who is running, in some ways, for a third Obama term – is a matter of conjecture. Focus groups are not scientific, though they do add substance to the dry numbers of opinion polls. Current measures of whether the nation is heading in the “right direction” are dismal – only 28 percent of Americans say “yes,” to 65 percent “no.” Usually, such a big “wrong track” number would refer to a bad economy. But in their questionnaires, the Wal-Mart moms mostly listed other issues as their top concerns, such as terrorism, racism, and health care.   Such a big “wrong track” number would also normally spell trouble for the party in power. But 2016 is no normal cycle, with the two major-party candidates held in such low regard by the public. The Wal-Mart moms are no exception, and in the two focus groups, the views of Clinton and Mr. Trump were downright brutal. When asked for single words to describe candidate Clinton, “cold,” liar,” and “untrustworthy” were typical responses. “I think she’s emotionless, especially compared to Trump,” said Julie B., an office administrator in Columbus. “People have been tearing her apart forever,” and so “she has an extremely hard shell around her.” “That’s a strength,” another woman responded. The women were also asked who they would rather have over for a cookout; most said Trump. “Personally he’d be more fun than Hillary in her suit sitting next to me,” said Donna G. of Columbus. When asked to describe a President Hillary Clinton, some assessments improved. “Confident,” said one woman. “Experienced,” said others. Others noted she would be the first woman president. But when the Columbus group was asked if the “woman thing” made a difference, a chorus came back: no. One woman begged to differ. “I have two daughters,” said Dana W., a food service worker in Columbus. “It would be a big step for women, but that’s the only positive about Hillary.” Trump didn’t fare any better with the Wal-Mart moms. One-word descriptors were “joke,” “loud,” and “combative.” “I have a feeling the whole world would be laughing at us” if Trump were elected, said Julie B. of Columbus. Even women who were leaning toward Trump had serious reservations. “If Hillary was elected, we’d get more terrorism, but I think Trump would get us into World War III,” said Stephanie C. of Phoenix. When asked who they thought would win the election (not whom they personally support), nearly all the women in both groups said Clinton – but they didn’t rule out the possibility that Trump could be elected. As for their personal choices, the women were selected for the focus groups because they were either undecided or had not fully decided on whom to support. With three months to go before Election Day, seven of the 20 women said they were leaning toward Clinton, five leaned toward Trump, and eight were undecided. Ohio, in particular, is a major battleground; Arizona is a red state that the Clinton campaign sees as increasingly winnable. Other aspects of the campaign, aside from the candidates, came in for harsh criticism – starting with the news media. “It seems like the focus is just on the individuals and how crazy things can get, rather than … what are the important things that we should be dealing with or talking about,” said Gidget B., a customer service manager in Columbus. The kerfuffle over Trump’s comment Tuesday on “Second Amendment people” is the latest example. The episode had just taken place when the focus groups convened, and it was impossible to ignore. When the moderator in Columbus brought it up, one woman said, “He could be more well-spoken,” alluding to the ambiguity of Trump’s statement. Julie B. offered her interpretation: “Sounds like he’s saying basically, take her out.” Some women blamed social media for sowing discord among voters. It used to be that, in polite company, one should avoid discussing religion and politics, said one woman. Now, with social media, it’s all out in the open. “It’s actually an insight into people’s minds,” said Ivania L., a radiation safety officer in Columbus. But “it also leaves a little bad taste in your mouth…. I never expected how ugly it’s getting. People are losing friends and acquaintances. You’re just being de-friended completely.” Social media has also provided a platform for racism, said Dana W. of Columbus. “I’ve seen a lot of what Donald Trump has brought to the table,” she said.   Some women wished out loud that the third-party candidates got more media coverage, and a few said they were considering voting for the Libertarian nominee, Gary Johnson. But they also acknowledged the reality that the Democrats and Republicans dominate American politics, and that the choice is between Clinton and Trump. Said one woman: “I wish we could start all over.” Next up Trump economic speech: first step to unifying GOP (+video) Trump's unraveling GOP: How we reached this point Together, Obama and Bush seek national unity in Dallas (+video) Are Pennsylvania voters ready for a woman president?

Are you depressed about the presidential election? Do Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton astound you with their weapons-grade yet quasi-comical awfulness? When you read the news of the day, do you fight an insistent urge to throw your computer out the window, chop off your hair, don some scary-looking face paint, and disappear into the desert wilderness like the crabby late 19th-century writer Ambrose Bierce? Well, join the club. On Wednesday, RealClearPolitics' Alexis Simendinger highlighted the despair of the nation’s “Wal-Mart moms,” as revealed in what may have been the most depressing focus groups in the history of mankind. Gathered in Ohio and Arizona, the participants compared this year’s election to, as a Washington Post report put it, “choosing which arm to cut off.” The Wal-Mart moms are rightly despondent, along with the many fine Americans trying to figure out what to do in this nightmarish political year. Parents of small children, it turns out, are particularly peeved. “What can this election possibly teach our kids?” they ask. “What conclusions about the world can they possibly draw? How can I tell my children I voted for someone terrible?” Take heart: This is a hidden opportunity! Understood properly, the election of 2016 can impart some crucial life lessons to kids of all ages—and perhaps it will even deliver those same lessons to the adults who somehow missed them the first time around. (This is wildly optimistic, I know.) Read on: Truth can be stranger than fiction. I spent Tuesday afternoon unplugged from the news. When I logged back in at cocktail hour, I discovered that one presidential candidate had a rally featuring the grinning father of a terrorist sitting in the audience directly behind her podium, which was weird. This was quickly eclipsed, however, by the fact that another presidential candidate jokingly implied that maybe someone who likes the Second Amendment might assassinate the other presidential candidate. This is real life. It is not made up. Who says the world isn’t full of mystery? It is not a good idea to joke about assassinations or people dying. “I heard about this Second Amendment joke,” Paul Ryan told the press on Wednesday. (Note to Paul Ryan: Everyone has heard about Donald Trump’s Second Amendment joke. EVERYONE. It was terrible, and Trump will probably ensure that it lives on for 16 more news cycles, but more on that later.) “You should never joke about something like that,” Ryan continued. Well, yeah, no kidding. Most people learn this when they’re around 4 years old, but it bears repeating, apparently. Meanwhile, recent footage of Ted Strickland, the Ohio Democratic Senate nominee, shows him joking that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s death “happened at a good time.” Life lesson: Please don’t do this. It’s not that hard. Sometimes, it’s best just to say “Sorry.” Can we have a special dedication go out to all those exhausted, overworked news cycles that refused to die because Donald Trump refused to say “sorry”? As Trump told “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon last September, “I fully think apologizing is a great thing, but you have to be wrong.” For her part, Hillary Clinton seems to believe that merely pretending certain things didn’t happen—like, say, sending classified emails from a vulnerable rogue server—substitutes for expressing regret. Attention, kids: Do not try this at home. In life, you will frequently be wrong. A little self-reflection—and an occasional, honest “I’m sorry”—will get you a long way. If you’re an 11-year-old and you defend Trump’s use of bad words, you’ll get to appear on CNN with your mom! OK, never mind. Please don’t teach your kids this. But it did happen to young Matthew Schricker, a robust Trump supporter who also managed to heckle Mike Pence at a North Carolina rally. If past trends regarding child political prognosticators hold true, a hemp-wearing Matthew will passionately lead the world’s largest Bernie Sanders/Occupy Wall Street rally to date in downtown Seattle in the spring of 2021. There is no man—or woman!—behind the curtain. “Fortunately,” as Willie Nelson once said, “we are not in control.” Herein lies one of the weirdest discoveries a young person can make: The world may be run by grown-ups, but many of them are just as clueless as kids! There is no vastly competent “man behind the curtain.” Most of us are winging it; some adults are just better at hiding that fact than others. If our hapless leading presidential candidates don’t bring that point home—along with the importance of limiting the power of government and politicians—I don’t know who will.

High-Def Digest Blu-ray Ultra HD Gaming Blu-ray Gaming HD Gear Blu-ray Ultra HD Gaming HD Gear Blu-ray Ultra HD Games Blu-ray Ultra HD Games Home News Walmart Set to Acquire Jet.com for $3 Billion Walmart Set to Acquire Jet.com for $3 Billion Posted Mon Aug 8, 2016 at 09:30 AM PDT by Steven Cohen The retail giant is buying the e-commerce company.   Walmart has announced plans to acquire Jet.com for approximately $3 billion. The deal is poised to help expand Walmart's e-commerce growth and customer reach. "We're looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that's what our customers want," said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. "We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we're pursuing will happen quicker, and we'll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time. Our customers will win. It's another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart." As part of the deal, Jet and Walmart will remain separate brands, allowing Walmart.com to continue its extension of the company's retail stores while Jet.com will continue to provide its own unique customer experience. Led by co-founder and CEO Marc Lore, along with fellow co-founders Mike Hanrahan and Nate Faust, Jet.com has positioned itself as one of the fastest growing e-commerce websites in the US. Here are a few of the company's key features and accomplishments per the press release: - Demonstrated ability to scale with speed, reaching $1 billion in run-rate Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and offering 12 million SKUs in its first year. - A growing customer base of urban and millennial customers with more than 400,000 new shoppers added monthly and an average of 25,000 daily processed orders. - Best-in-class technology that rewards customers in real time with savings on items that are bought and shipped together, thereby reducing the supply-chain and logistics costs often buried in the price of goods. - A select group of more than 2,400 retailer and brand partners tailored to create an attractive and distinctive assortment for consumers. The deal has been approved by the Boards of Directors for both companies but is still subject to regulatory approval. Walmart expects the acquisition to close this calendar year.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-edition Classifieds Jobs Homes Public Notices Suspected meth lab beneath Walmart lot stumps police Wednesday Aug 10, 2016 at 11:51 AM A giant, graffiti-filled storm sewer beneath a Walmart parking lot in upstate New York may have housed a shocking setup: An underground laboratory used for making methamphetamine, police said. By LINDSEY BEVERThe Washington Post A giant, graffiti-filled storm sewer beneath a Walmart parking lot in upstate New York may have housed a shocking setup: An underground laboratory used for making methamphetamine, police said. Authorities in Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo, have opened an investigation into the suspected meth lab some 12 feet under the superstore parking lot, along a busy thoroughfare that leads to the town’s shops, according to local news reports. "I was completely astounded," Amherst Highway Superintendent Patrick Lucey told the Buffalo News. "It’s like, are you kidding me? It’s just not something you run across. I’m sure it can happen. "Anywhere at any time somewhere where there’s the opportunity and the motive, it can happen. But this was definitely something new." Amherst police, assisted by state law enforcement, made the discovery beneath the parking lot Monday afternoon during a "preventative patrol," according to CBS affiliate WIVB. "Routine patrol, that’s what we do every day," Amherst Police Capt. Scott Chamberlin told the station, adding: "We check in various areas that people who might be up to no good, might be using for no good." Crews in hazmat suits were seen climbing from a manhole, pulling out wooden pallets that, police said, were used to stand above the water flowing through a culvert that leads to a main drainage line in town. Shoppers gathered nearby to watch investigators sort through evidence pulled from the lab, which was deep inside the storm sewage tunnel. Chamberlin said crews fished out aerosol spray paint cans, plastic soda bottles and various chemicals — including "a liquid we believe is methamphetamine." But police said the contents posed no immediate safety threats, according to WIVB. "We’ll talk to the proper authorities to figure out what we need to do to make sure that’s not accessible anymore," Chamberlin told the station. "We were shocked when we found out about this," Erica Jones, a Walmart spokeswoman, told The Washington Post in a statement Wednesday. "It’s upsetting and unacceptable. We’re glad the police have responded and we’ll continue to help them with their investigation. Anyone who has information that can help should reach out to police." Investigators plan to see whether Walmart’s surveillance video shows people accessing the sewer, according to The Associated Press. No arrests have been made. The New York State Intelligence Center, which tracks meth labs across New York State, has released warnings about such "clandestine laboratories." It states: "A clandestine laboratory is an unlawful operation consisting of laboratory equipment and chemicals that are used to illegally produce controlled substances such as methamphetamine. Chemicals found in clandestine laboratories can be hazardous. Exposure to these can damage the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Some of the chemicals can produce a fire or explosion. Immediately leave the scene and contact your local law enforcement agency if you encounter what you believe is a clandestine laboratory. Inform law enforcement if you believe children are present." Erie County District Attorney’s Drug Task Force, which investigates drug crimes in Amherst, says on its website that meth labs are "highly explosive and flammable threatening nearby properties" and that the chemicals used in them are "extremely toxic." "A Meth lab can be located anywhere," it states. "The house next door, hotels, motels, RV’s, campers, trailers, public storage facilities, the highway, forests." According to data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the only other known clandestine meth lab in Amherst was found in 2009, about four miles from Walmart. "It’s a concern; I mean it’s unbelievable in this area, this isn’t a bad area," Steve Harding, an area resident, told WIVB after the recent discovery, adding: "This isn’t the kind of thing you’d expect in a place like this, that’s the bottom line." Town workers were surveying the apparent crime scene Tuesday. Lucey, the highway superintendent, told the Buffalo News that the suspected meth-makers traveled some 800 feet from the culvert’s opening to get to the apparent lab. Police said it was tall enough for people to stand up and walk through. "They did have a working surface. They just weren’t playing in the water, basically," Lucey told the newspaper, referring to the pallets pulled from the drain. He added: "They must have had their own lighting system, too, because, as I look in here now, it’s dark." Had authorities not discovered it, he said it could have been disastrous. "It could have been very dangerous. It was very dangerous," Lucey told the Buffalo News. "Forget cooking and making their lab, just the gases themselves and the environment that they were working in was a very dangerous situation." "Certainly, they weren’t thinking," he added.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Mexican unit said it has agreed to sell its Suburbia clothing chain to El Puerto De Liverpool for about USD 852 million as the world's largest retailer streamlines operations in its largest non-US market. Wal-Mart De Mexico y Centroamerica , also known as Walmex, will sell Suburbia with its 119 stores and real estate for 15.7 billion pesos (USD 852 million) including debt of 1.4 billion pesos. Walmex will also receive an additional 3.3 billion pesos in items including declared dividends after the deal closes, it said in a statement. In January, the retailer said it was looking to sell Suburbia without giving a timeframe for completing the sale. Some Mexican media outlets had speculated the sale could fetch as much as USD 2 billion. Liverpool is one of Mexico's department store operators, with more than 100 outlets. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment. Wal-Mart has been looking to double sales in Mexico by 2024 by boosting its core business of running discount retail and membership stores, and expanding its fresh food business. The divestiture is part of Wal-Mart's strategy, announced in 2013, to streamline and sell businesses not central to its overseas operations. Wal-Mart's international division, which contributes roughly one-third of the company's total annual sales of nearly USD 480 billion, has divested some non-core businesses across Chile, Mexico and Canada in the past two years. In Mexico over the past three years, Walmex has sold its Vips restaurant chain to fast-food operator Alsea SAB for USD 626 million, and its Banco Walmart unit to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa for about USD 247 million. Wal-Mart acquired Suburbia's parent supermarket chain Cifra in 1997. Suburbia has 119 stores in 46 cities and is popular with urban shoppers, ranking among Mexico's top five department stores, according to analysts. Suburbia, which is profitable, contributed 3 percent to Walmex's overall revenue in 2015. Walmex, Mexico's biggest private sector employer and the country's largest retailer, posted sales of about USD 26.35 billion in 2015. At the company's shareholder's meeting in June, David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's overseas division, singled out the Mexican market as a top priority. Mexico has Wal-Mart's largest number of stores outside the United States. Wal-Mart has struggled in overseas markets, including Britain and China, but Walmex has remained a bright spot with second-quarter revenue growing 11.5 percent to about USD 6.93 billion.

The retail giant made the biggest acquisition in e-commerce start-up history earlier this week. Here's what it could mean for the company and investors. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Aug 10, 2016 at 6:52PM Image Source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) completed the biggest acquisition of an e-commerce start-up in history earlier this week, buying Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart will pay $3 billion in cash and $300 million in stock over the next five years for the year-old company that was launched as a challenger to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for online retail supremacy. Since news of the deal broke, Wal-Mart has been criticized by several corners of the media for overpaying for the start-up, but there are plenty of reasons why it could prove to be a smart move. 1. Wal-Mart could use the help Jet.com may only be a year old, but the company has already reached an annual run rate of $1 billion in sales, something that took Amazon four years to accomplish. Jet's marketplace model, however, means that it generates significantly less than that as actual revenue. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has seen its e-commerce growth rate slow each quarter over the last two years, falling to just 7% in its most recent report. E-commerce has taken on growing importance as same-store sales have slowed, Wal-Mart stores have saturated the country, and Amazon and other competitors have taken market share. The company has struggled to gain traction in online retail despite intensified efforts in the space, including increased capital spending, launching a competitor to Amazon Prime called ShippingPass, rolling out online grocery pickup, and making several smaller acquisitions in the past. With the Jet buyout, Wal-Mart gets much more than an additional $1 billion in sales. It gets access to the millions of names in Jet's customer base, which include a large number of urban and millennial customers that Wal-Mart has historically had trouble courting. It also gets access to Jet's proprietary infrastructure and technology. Its "Smart Cart", for example, features an algorithm that lowers prices as customers add more items to their order or give up returns. Finally, Wal-Mart will add Jet.com founder and CEO Marc Lore, one of the leading minds in e-commerce, to its ranks. Lore's first company, Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com and Soap.com, was sold to Amazon for $550 million in a bidding war with Wal-Mart. After spending two years inside the e-commerce leader, Lore departed to found Jet, the most ambitious company to challenge Amazon in several years. Lore will run Jet as well as Wal-Mart's e-commerce division once the deal closes. 2. $3.3 billion isn't that much for Wal-Mart It's difficult to value some acquisitions. Jet doesn't disclose revenue, but some analysts estimate its price-to-sales valuation is about six times, or about double that of Amazon. Though that may be expensive for an unprofitable and not-yet-proven company, it could be worth much more than that to Wal-mart if it allows the retailer to unlock increased e-commerce growth. Past big-ticket acquisitions like Facebook's purchase of Instagram and Google's takeover of YouTube were questioned by industry followers at the time, but both now look like steals, as they have become core components of each company. And Wal-Mart isn't poor either. The $3.3 billion price is less than it generates in profit in an average quarter. The company spends most of that income on returning capital to shareholders. Last year, it returned more than $12 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks, money that in no way helps its competitive position. For a company now struggling to grow, it's clear that e-commerce is a bigger priority than share repurchases, if not the company's single most important mission. Notably, Amazon has also made big acquisitions on its way to e-commerce domination, spending more than $2 billion combined on Zappos, Kiva Technologies, and Lore's old company, Quidsi. If Wal-Mart had made those acquisitions instead, perhaps it would find itself in a different position today. 3. Wal-Mart is still the best positioned company to challenge Amazon Wal-Mart's profits, in addition to justifying the Jet acquisition, are also a key advantage against Amazon, and the retailer should be able to outbid Amazon on any company or asset they both value. It actually did top Amazon's bid for Quidsi, but at that point, the start-up had already signaled that it would sell to Amazon. More importantly, the company has assets that no other retailer, online or off, can match. Those include a network of more than 4,000 stores across the nation, giving the company a location within five miles of 70% of the U.S. population. While Amazon is busy trying to build up its own shipping fleet to complement traditional logistics providers, Wal-Mart has one of the largest private trucking fleets in the country, with about 6,000 tractor-trailers that it will start using to support e-commerce operations. The tech know-how, strategy, and innovation from Jet should also boost Wal-Mart's prospects, and its own logistics and economies of scale should benefit Jet. Investors should remember that Wal-Mart doesn't have to beat Amazon in order to win -- it just has to accelerate growth in e-commerce to return the overall company to growth. In fact, the Jet acquisition offers evidence that Wal-Mart and Amazon may be moving in different directions. Long a champion of low prices, Amazon has shifted from that strategy in recent years with its Prime membership program, which places an emphasis on convenience over price. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, has branded itself on "always low prices", and Jet's pricing algorithm puts a similar emphasis on low prices. In fact, the company promised to be the cheapest retailer on the internet. What could ensue, then, is a bifurcation in e-commerce as Wal-Mart targets more price-conscious customers and Amazon ramps up services for its Prime members, such as Prime Now, which promises delivery in under an hour, and Prime Fresh, the grocery delivery service. Beyond the acquisition, the key for Wal-Mart will be to successfully integrate Jet, execute on an enhanced e-commerce platform, and grow demand. Wal-Mart's fortunes won't change overnight, but the acquisition is a sign the company's priorities are in the right place.  With $27 billion in annual operating cash flow, the company has plenty more firepower to pour into e-commerce if it chooses.

The transaction, which involved 119 stores, is subject to regulatory approval, Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB and Liverpool said in statements Wednesday after markets closed. Liverpool will pay 15.7 billion pesos, assume 1.4 billion pesos of debt and distribute an additional 3.3 billion pesos to shareholders after the deal is completed. As part of the deal, Liverpool will also pay rent to Walmex for all 34 store locations where Suburbia stores stand alongside Wal-Mart stores. The deal lets Walmex get out of a business it no longer considers part of its core operation of discount retail and grocery stores, which are riding a wave of growth in consumer spending. Walmex, a publicly traded unit of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant, announced last week that July sales rose 12.1 per cent from a year ago at stores open at least a year, almost double the 6.8 per cent rise in the previous month. “We are totally focused on our main business and our target is to double our total sales by 2024,” Walmex chief executive officer Guilherme Loureiro said in the statement sent to the Mexican stock exchange. This is the second purchase this year by Mexico City-based Liverpool, a high-end department store chain that’s seeking to diversify.

 There is a hidden risk in Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet.com Jamal Carnette, The Motley Fool Aug. 11, 2016, 10:03 PM 3,991 facebook linkedin twitter email print A shopper walks down an aisle in a newly opened Walmart Neighborhood Market in Chicago in this Sept. 21, 2011 file photo. Reuters/Jim Young This week, the United States' largest retailer, Wal-Mart, confirmed earlier rumors by buying upstart e-commerce company Jet.com. The Wall Street Journal reports Wal-Mart acquired the company for a total of $3.3 billion -- $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Wal-Mart stock. Overall, this is a small sum for the Arkansas-based retailer; as a point of comparison, the $3.3 billion figure is approximately half of what the company paid in dividends last fiscal year. On the surface, it makes sense for Wal-Mart. Perhaps the biggest shift in the history of retailing, and certainly within the past decade or so, is the rapid growth of e-commerce. In that time, e-commerce sales have grown from a paltry 3.5% of total retail sales to 7.7% in preliminary estimates of Q1 2016. Overall, e-commerce has grown at a clip of 15% over the last two years, versus the overall real GDP growth of 2% to 3% during this period. Overall, Wal-Mart's purchase of Jet is a small bet on a growing market the company clumsily conceded to the likes of Amazon.com decades ago. The real risk to this deal is unlikely to show up in either company's balance sheet. The culture could not be more different between Jet and Wal-Mart A large-scale study from Big-Four accounting company KPMG found that 83% of all mergers failed to boost shareholder returns. There are many theories why shareholder value does not materialize: paying too much for the acquired company, synergies figures that fail to materialize, and poor due diligence. However, the biggest reason generally given is a mismatch in corporate culture. By all accounts, the cultural differences between Wal-Mart and Jet could not be more different. Wal-Mart, an established retailer, is mostly worried about their bottom-line results, paying billions for share buybacks in an attempt to boost their earnings-per-share figures. Jet has continued to act like an aggressive start-up, more concerned with transactions and user growth at the expense of profits. The Wall Street Journal article notes that the company has been adding 400,000 shoppers monthly and was on pace to sell $1 billion in merchandise annually. However, the company is unprofitable, and its goal of undercutting Amazon's prices would make it hard to grow margins. Last year, the company abandoned its goal of a $50 subscription fee, much like Amazon's Prime service, in an attempt to expand its shopper base. It appears Jet has sacrificed profit for growth. Jet has continued to act like an aggressive start-up, more concerned with transactions and user growth at the expense of profits. Business Insider Earlier this year, Wal-Mart did the exact opposite, choosing higher profit margins over revenue by closing 269 worldwide stores, many of which were the company's smaller Walmart Express concept and underperforming stores in Brazil. For Wal-Mart, buying Jet was the easy part There are potential benefits to the merger. Jet now has the buying power of the world's largest retailer and will most likely increase its already enviable 12-million SKU figure. What Jet brings is an Internet-focused and growth-first mentality. The downsides are obvious: If Wal-Mart applies its ruthless cost-cutting culture, it's likely Jet's growth will slow as marketing is pared back in favor of profit. Although the two will remain separate brands, there's an additional risk Jet becomes defined by Wal-Mart, which is the exact opposite of what a high-flying technology-based company would want to happen. In addition to the obvious financial loss in the event the acquisition fails, which is negligible in Wal-Mart's case, the company faces additional costs to combine distribution and potentially falling margins in the event Jet's razor-thin margin operations become a larger part of Wal-Mart's revenue haul. Overall, this was an aggressive move for a company continuing to fall behind in e-commerce. However, paying for Jet was the easy part; successfully integrating both companies is where this battle will be won or lost.    Read the original article on The Motley Fool. Copyright 2016.

A baby was found dead Friday afternoon in a vehicle after being left there for several hours in the parking lot of a Walmart in Helotes in a possible heat-related death, the Helotes Police Department confirmed Friday. HPD Capt. Anthony Burgess said the 6-month-old boy was discovered when the father, a Wal-Mart employee who reported to work at 6:15 a.m., went to his vehicle in the employee parking area. Temperatures in Helotes around the time of the discovery was in the low 100s. RELATED: 10 charged in synthetic marijuana ring in Austin Witnesses flagged down two officers in a cul-de-sac down the street at about the same time 911 calls began coming in from others at about 3:12 p.m, Burgess said. Officers saw the father was visibly upset as he was leaning over the infant, who firefighters confirmed was deceased. The father told investigators he was supposed to have taken his son to day care before work.

No more trips to the state fair, no more pots of hot oil on the stove. The company is partnering with Walmart to debut frozen Deep Fried Twinkies this Monday, August 15. Just grab one out of the freezer, throw it in the oven, and voila: a cream-filled, deep-fried gut bomb. We may be doomed as a society. Walmart has announced it will exclusively carry an "Original Golden" version of the sugar-packed snack for three to six months, and it will offer a chocolate version for a year. The Twinkies will be available at more than 4,000 of the company's stores across the country. What once was perhaps a rare treat is about to become an everyday snack for many Americans. When people are bored on the couch, they'll be able to mindlessly eat a Deep Fried Twinkie. Walmart boasts as much in a post on its official blog. "And what's more exciting than a product that was previously only available at state fairs once a year, now being up for enjoyment anytime from your freezer?" Yet another advancement in junk food technology. Hopefully the exercise and health care industries can keep up. • Sweet!

For the first three months, they’re available only at Walmart. 3 down, 47 to go Zenefits CEO David Sacks tweeted Friday that his company, which makes human resources software and sells insurance to businesses, had resolved its licensing problems with South Carolina and Delaware. It’s paying $29,500 to South Carolina and nothing in Delaware; last month, it paid $62,500 to Tennessee, the first state it settled with. Sacks said the San Francisco company is now fully compliant but is working through “historical violations.” Pharma Bro meets the press Martin Shkreli, the former Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO arrested on securities fraud charges in December, held court with reporters at Guy Fieri’s American Kitchen & Bar in New York Friday. The impromptu meetup came after an email bearing Shkreli’s name was sent early in the morning to 450 journalists, Mashable reported, generating 100 reply-all responses. The original email was fake, Shkreli said — but he asked to be added to the thread, and eventually proposed the Midtown drinkfest, which several reporters broadcast live on Facebook and Periscope. Shkreli is known for sharing outrageous opinions on Twitter — including defending the high drug prices that got him labeled the “Pharma Bro.” The Daily Briefing is compiled from San Francisco Chronicle staff and news services.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us CVS Pay mobile payment service added to the CVS Pharmacy app By R Padla - August 12, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We already knew of the idea that the CVS Pharmacy would be launching its own mobile payment service. We heard it would utilize mainly Apple Pay but this week, the company finally unveiled CVS Pay and no, it won’t be related to anything from Apple or Google. Instead of integration with any existing payment service available, CVS is introducing its own. CVS Pay is yet another mobile payments platform that will be exclusive to payments for CVS Pharmacy transactions much like Walmart Pay is to Walmart. If you may remember not so long ago, CVS once dropped the idea of NFC mobile payments not because they cause problems but because they were part of the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX). Back then, the latter was once believed to be developing its own mobile payment system called CurrentC. CurrentC has been on beta for quite a while now but it has seen a number of issues. Meanwhile, the new CVS Pay won’t exactly launch as a standalone app but will be part of the already available CVS Pharmacy app. This payment feature adds up to the prescription pickup tools and loyalty program integrated into the app. CVS Pay works similarly with the same services from Android, Walmart, and Apple. Customers need to add their credit or debits cards to the system. A barcode will be shown and then be used to pay for the items and finally finish transaction after some verification measure which can be a signature or a passcode. The CVS Pharmacy app won’t be changed at all. It will only be updated with the addition of the CVS Pay feature. CVS Pay on the CVS Pharmacy app is now available in only a few markets like New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. More states are expected to receive the feature in the coming months or before 2016 ends. What’s good about CVS Pay is that it works on both Android and iOS versions of the CVS Pharmacy app. Credit and debit cards supported include Visa, Discover, MasterCard, and American Express.

Discount chain Giant Tiger is expanding its footprint and revamping its image Linda Nguyen, The Canadian Press || August 12, 2016 Topics Consumer Trends, Branding Print Email Comment Share: A newly-renovated Giant Tiger store in Ottawa. Photo: Fred Chartrand/CP For 55 years, Giant Tiger’s smiling feline mascot has beckoned shoppers in small towns and those driving up to the cottage. But after years of operating under the radar amid intense competition against rivals like Walmart and the now defunct Target Canada, the company is setting its sights on becoming a household name. The Ottawa-based retailer, with its trademark yellow branding, currently operates 220 stores and has a goal of opening 10 to 15 new stores every year for the next three to five years. The company also has plans to revamp the design of its locations and increase its product offerings in order to build a better shopping experience. Growing its e-commerce business has also been a top priority. MORE TARGET CANADA: 5 Things to Learn From The Last Days of Target » Selling everything from groceries to big-screen TVs, the national discount chain credits the key to its survival and more importantly, its success over the last half-century, to delivering value to shoppers in the know.  “Giant Tiger is Canada’s best-kept secret,” touts Thomas Haig, president and chief operating officer at the privately-owned company. But in growing its footprint, Haig says it will not lose sight of what has kept it sitting pretty: its local franchise owners who know their customers and knows what works for their specific community. “These store managers live in the area, (have) lived there for several years and understand the clientele and understand the needs and wants of the community,” he said. For instance, some locations carry hunting and cottage supplies if they’re serving rural areas, while others may sell medical uniforms if they’re close to a hospital. MORE AREA KNOWLEDGE: 3 Ways to Unlock the Lucrative “Local” Market »  As part of its expansion, the company says it’s looking for sites between 18,000 to 25,000 square feet in communities where there’s demand for Giant Tiger—including areas where there’s already a location. Recent openings have included stores in Bathurst, N.B., Sudbury, Ont., and Wetaskiwin, Alta. The company also recently announced a new store in Peterborough, Ont., scheduled to open next April. For the past few years, Giant Tiger has been working on transforming its sleepy image in order to stay relevant to customers who want one-stop shopping for household items and groceries. One of the biggest priorities the company has is the task of reorganizing store layouts so customers can navigate faster and easier as opposed to rivals who operate warehouse-sized locations that force customers to walk around aimlessly. “(Our customers) are looking for a simplified shopping experience,” says Karen Sterling, vice-president of marketing at Giant Tiger. MORE LAYOUTS: 3 Lessons from Real Estate Limbo » Their target customer continues to be women between 30 to 55 years old, with two kids, who are the “CFO (chief financial officer)” of their families and looking for value from their purchases. Sterling says their customers’ time constraints have also motivated the company to include more product selection, so a weekly shop for toilet paper, frozen pizza, workout clothes or back-to-school supplies can all be done under one roof. “The smaller store size is a competitive advantage,” she said. Along with updating its store look, the company has also been increasing its e-commerce presence. It currently has about 6,000 products online, with the option of shipping some of them to home or a local store for pickup. Retail analyst Sandy Silva, who is with market research firm NPD Group, says part of Giant Tiger’s success comes from customers who like the idea of supporting a Canadian business. But where the company can really make its mark is how it proceeds with online shopping.Silva noted that some challenges for the retailer will be meeting expectations when it comes to home delivery times and product availability because the majority of their customers live in rural areas. “E-commerce is going to be crucial to them,” she said.

Hostess has collaborated with Walmart to make the treat which will hit stores on Monday, August 15th. They come frozen and you can cook them yourself in the oven, according to the company’s website. This solves what was formerly the chief problem with a deep-fried Twinkie: you had to walk to get one. 4,000 Wal-Mart locations will carry an “Original Golden” version of the snack as well as a chocolate one, lest you get board of eating the same flavor of deep-fried Twinkie all the time.

Gun violence and misuse has now been attributed to the loss of well over 60 Americans so far this summer.[1] Last month, Augusta residents experienced first-hand exactly how deep this problem runs when a dispute turned violent in a Walmart parking lot. A group of drug traffickers from New York allegedly became invested in a narcotic-related argument in which a firearm was shot off attempting to injure one of the people involved. Thankfully, the scene was de-escalated before any fatal injuries could have occurred. Unfortunately, this is not always how incidents involving gun violence end. Prior to the altercation in Augusta, the nation was still mourning the losses from the shootings of June and July which claimed over sixty innocent victims and is now gravely considered one of the bloodiest summers in modern U.S history. This is an issue we have seen repeated ten fold throughout the last decade. According to the Congressional Research Service, between 2000 and 2013, there was a total of 671 reported casualties due to mass public shootings. Further, there was an estimated 607 casualties attributed to gun violence from 1999 to 2013.[2] This year alone has presented us with some of the largest public body counts in our modern history. The Gun Violence Archive states that there has been 28,435 reported incidents involving a firearm this year alone. This is close to 150 firearm incidents per day. One hundred seventy five of these incidents resulted in the injury or death of a reporting officer and 984 resulted in instances in which a suspect was injured or killed at the hands of law enforcement. According to The Guardian, a total of 586 people have lost their lives due to police brutality or misconduct this year alone.[3] Through an international perspective, the U.S is the number one provider and exporter of firearms, controlling over fifty percent of the global weaponry market.[4] According to TIME Magazine, American arms sales jumped 35 percent, reaching a total of $36.2 billion in 2014 due in part to a high international weapons demand from South Korea, Iraq, and Brazil. Further, roughly 46 per cent of small arms sellers rely on some amount of American demand from the U.S-Mexico border.[5] As if this was not enough, the United States is the leader in the number of firearms per capita in the world, totaling 88 for every 100.[6] Jayman. “Guns & Violence…Again.” The UNZ Review. June 11, 2014. After a surge in favor of stricter background check policies and public campaigns against firearms, the demand for firearms in the United States has increased, peaking soon after the incidents of Sandyhook, Orlando, and the Dallas shootings.[7] One of the most interesting facts about this is that gun sales actually increased not only because of the shootings, but also because of the controversy that followed the attacks. The result has been quite lucrative and positive for firearms manufacturers. It seems that the more society attacks each other the better business gets. Ever since crime rates due to firearms began to rise in the nation, cases have been made searching for someone to fault. Non gun-owners blame weapons, the NRA blames perpetrators, and society chooses to blame the conscience, or lack thereof, of the person who commits these hateful crimes. Americans on the side of gun opposition and control look at all the devastations in Orlando, Dallas, and Sandy Hook as proof and justification for the implementation of stricter laws surrounding gun control. Some imagine that the blanket prohibition of gun sales could quickly diminish gun violence and crime in general. This has not worked in the past and will not work now. Prohibition in the 1920s did not diminish the consumption of alcoholic across our society; it made it even worse. The outcome then was an increase in alcoholism, drug use, and the strengthening and empowerment of organized crime. Just like it was as easy to make the argument that alcohol had caused crimes, it is just as easy to say that guns kill people. But, the truth is that the physical presence of alcohol was not responsible for alcoholism prior to prohibition, and the existence of firearms in and of themselves is not solely responsible for the tragedies as of late. That said, there are certain measures which have been shown to reduce gun deaths.  Giving into the nation’s gun-frenzied culture, lawmakers in Missouri ended a program which required background checks on private gun sales, which make up about 40% of the market.  Multiple studies have shown that the years following the repeal of universal background checks saw a rise in gun deaths in the state.  In contrast, Connecticut saw a reduction in gun deaths when they instituted broader background checks.[8]  In total, eighteen states have set into place laws which expand background checks.  In those states, 46% fewer women are shot to death by their intimate partners in domestic violence cases.  The prevalence of gun trafficking and gun suicides is also diminished.  This November, Maine has an opportunity to become the nineteenth state to pass expanded background check legislation with Question Three on the ballot.[9] Common sense gun measures would save lives, but they would only be a first step toward a more peaceful world. The recent public shootings have not only devastated our society, they have also succeeded in dividing our nation. The American public now faces a difficult decision regarding gun control that seems to make only slight progress after every national horror involving firearms. It’s irrational to believe that we can eradicate crime by abolishing guns. The truth is that these acts of violence stem from hate and prejudice, not because the person who committed the crimes had access to a weapon. Those who want to commit acts of evil, will do so by any means necessary. Instead of placing the blame on weapons, we should consider that the root of these atrocious crimes is social inequality. It is injudicious to reject the existence of social stratification in our culture. The U.S. is a democratic-republic whose foundation was tragically built upon racial stratification. The hard truth is that some people experience more privilege than others due to a variety of reasons, including race, gender, income or social class. Thus, birthed the institution that we now recognize as social inequality. This is the leading cause of hate and prejudice which is a major motive for crime in our culture. There is an infinite amount of documented hate crimes that can be traced to the root of social inequality; or instead, the feeling of resentment directed at social inequality and systemic privilege. Have we lost all sense of morality as a society? Has the U.S. lost touch with its value system? Popular culture may be the true culprit behind our violent tendencies. American culture has evolved to become centered on violence and intrigue, because as we know it, these topics are top of the market. For instance, television programs such as NCIS, Major Crimes, or even Dexter, have gained major popularity in the entertainment industry because these shows exhibit major “selling points” in the market. All of these shows include storylines of the most heinous crimes that are committed in our society. These shows take advantage of the greatest tragedies of our lives, and consequently, we can suppose they actually inspire more crime to occur. So, maybe the real person to blame isn’t a person but a collective culture. When we take a step back and analyze the development of our own society and culture, we are the ones at fault. We have created a culture focused on violence and hate and social inequality. As aforementioned, we are and have always been a democratic-republic, a nation that encourages individualism and guarantees prosperity for those who put in work. However, that reality simply doesn’t exist for everybody, it did not exist then and it does not exist today. All people are equal; this is a universal concept. But not all people are born into equal situations, and therefore, are not able to access like opportunities. This systemic inequality plays a large part in not only global crime, but also acts as a huge influencer of crime in general. This problem is not a frivolous debate about whether guns kill people, or if they should be banned in the U.S. The root of the issue at hand, is our society. Once we accept this truth, we will be able to find solutions to finally reduce violence due to systemic hate and injustice, and therefore find solace for the countless lives lost due to violence. “Violence: A Cultural Problem” was written by Nina Mahaleris, undergraduate student in journalism, communications and international affairs at the University of Maine and volunteer for the Peace and Justice Center of Eastern Maine.

Target Manikandan Raman , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} August 12, 2016 1:30pm   Comments Share: Related TGT Can't Wait For Black Friday? These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue Elation Selling (Seeking Alpha) Related WMT Can't Wait For Black Friday? These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food (Investor's Business Daily) Jefferies sees Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT)'s second quarter same-store sales ahead of the Street and in-line on EPS, while maintaining its sales and EPS estimates for Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT). Wal-Mart Wal-Mart is expected to announce its second quarter results on August 18, while Target reports on August 17. Street expects EPS/revenue of $1.02/$120.34 billion for Wal-Mart and $1.12/$16.17 billion for Target. For Wal-Mart, Jefferies thinks the U.S. comp stores sales momentum was carried over from the first quarter to the second quarter. The brokerage maintained its estimate for a 1.5 percent increase, modestly ahead of guidance for +1.0 percent. The EPS is expected to be in line with the consensus. "Our local retail store checks continued to show strong execution with consistency across the market," analyst Daniel Binder wrote in a note. Meanwhile, the analyst expects a small increase in retail spending over the next few quarters due to the increase in the wages of lower income consumers. Binder has a Buy rating and $85 price target on Wal-Mart. Related Link: Despite Rumors Of Another Bidder, Wal-Mart Was Only Company Looking To Buy Jet.Com Target For Target, Binder projects EPS at $1.12, which is a penny below the Street, but in line with management's guidance of $1.00-$1.20. Target set a comp store sales plan of 1.5-2.5 percent for the year, but expected to be flat to down 2 percent in the second quarter, based on a slowdown at the time of the first quarter report in mid-May. "We are maintaining our -1% estimate as our field checks looked choppy. We think May was particularly soft with a nice rebound in June and then some deceleration in July. Stores generally looked good and we think there was a focus on expense management in the sluggish environment," Binder highlighted. Binder has a Hold rating and price target of $72 on Target shares. Comparison Answering why Target should be a bigger multiple discount to Wal-Mart, Binder said "we think the market is anticipating an upward revision cycle in WMT EPS and a downward revision cycle in TGT EPS, both of which already are underway." Further, the analyst noted that the market views the Wal-Mart's heavy online spending would better position the company versus Target over long-term. In fact, Target grew EPS by 22.1 percent over the last 5 years, while WMT EPS grew only 12.8 percent. "We aren't ready to say the scales will tip the other way over the next five years as dramatically as what we saw in the last five years. However, we think the market is starting to view WMT's earnings as temporarily depressed and with progress recently, is gaining confidence and awarding a higher multiple," Binder added.

Try the Deep Fried Twinkie. Hostess Brands, maker of the original 1930s treat, just released the packaged frozen product as part of a collaboration with Wal-Mart's food lab, an initiative that fast tracks "innovative products" to customers. A longtime staple of state fairs across America, the deep-fried Twinkie weighs in at nine grams of fat and 220 calories, according to the Associated Press — significantly less than other fair favorites such as a double bacon corn dog (around 500 calories), a sugar-coated funnel cake (750 calories), or a giant turkey leg (1,100 calories). By comparison, a non-deep-fried Twinkie has only 4 grams of fat and 130 calories. "It has a retro cool factor," Ellen Copaken, vice president of marketing at Hostess, told AP. "And it's fun." So far, consumers seem to agree: Omg just tried the new deep fried Twinkie... Yum.— Paige Fadden (@PaigeFadden) August 2, 2016 Had my first deep fried Twinkie tonight. My life will never be the same. #twinkies #foodie— Steven Thomas (@Pigeonhunter85) August 1, 2016 Deep-Fried Twinkies are available exclusively at Wal-Mart for the next three months, but will be rolled out to other stores after that. And, at less than $5 for a box of seven, you'll still be able to afford that ticket to the state fair. Or a quick class at the gym.

Deandre A. Currie-Lamar and Daryl D. Larkin are charged with multiple offenses in Isabella County District Court. Deandre A. Currie-Lamar, left, and Daryl D. LarkinAndy Hoag | ahoag@mlive.com  Currie-Lamar, 20, of Detroit and Larkin, 22, of Ypsilanti were involved in a retail fraud at the Walmart near the south end of the Central Michigan University campus, according to a press release from the Isabella County Sheriff's Department. As sheriff's deputies arrived in the area of the store, they observed a vehicle that matched the description provided by Walmart employees, the release states. Deputies attempted to perform a traffic stop, but the driver of the gray Kia four-door sedan refused to stop, the release states. Deputies pursued the vehicle at high rates of speed along M-20 into Midland County and then into the city of Midland, the release states. Deputies ended their pursuit, and other agencies continued it through Midland County and then into Bay County and Saginaw County. As the chase continued on Dixie Highway in Birch Run, police used a precision immobilization technique maneuver to stop the vehicle, according to Michigan State Police 1st Lt. David Kaiser. The vehicle ended up on the front lawn of the Comfort Inn at 11911 Dixie, Kaiser said. K-9 takes down robbery suspect after 4-county chase in stolen vehicle One of the occupants of the vehicle fled on foot, but a state police K-9 took him down, Kaiser said. Medical personnel transported that man to a local hospital for treatment for bite wounds, while police transported the other man to the Saginaw County Jail. Police determined the gray Kia was stolen during a carjacking in the Detroit area that involved a gun and a knife, according to the Isabella County press release. The Detroit Police Department was investigating that incident, the press release states. Kaiser said police recovered a gun and the identification card of a victim of a strong-arm robbery at the Soaring Eagle Casino in Mount Pleasant. The Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Police are investigating that matter, according to the Isabella County press release. The Saginaw News could not immediately reach tribe officials for comment. Isabella County prosecutors on Thursday, Aug. 11, issued charges against Currie-Lamar and Larkin. They are charged with unarmed robbery, receiving and concealing stolen property, and third-degree retail fraud. Currie-Lamar also faces charges of acting as an accessory after the fact, fourth-degree fleeing from a police officer, and operating a motor vehicle on a suspended or revoked license. Magistrate Sandra Straus arraigned the two men on Thursday. Straus ordered Currie-Lamar jailed on a $120,000 bond and Larkin jailed on a $90,000 bond. They are scheduled for a Sept. 1 preliminary hearing before District Judge Eric Janes.

Hostess Brands, the maker of several sweet treats, including Twinkies, is set to introduce the state-fair favorite as its first frozen food item for the retail market. The treat, which will come in chocolate and vanilla, was born out of a yearlong effort by Walmart and Hostess. Both companies are looking to boost sales with new products. The new frozen Twinkies are available at some Walmart stores, with a scheduled nationwide rollout by Aug. 16 and will be available only at Walmart for the first three months. To achieve that state-fair taste, you’ll need to finish off the treat in a frying pan or oven before digging in. The move to frozen goods comes as Hostess works to recover from financial trouble in recent years. The company filed for bankruptcy in early 2012 and shuttered plants later that year. It was bought and renamed in March 2013. The iconic Twinkies snack first appeared on the market in 1930. But it was an immigrant from the United Kingdom, Christopher Sell, who gave America the deep-fried version when he began offering the not-so-heart-healthy version at his restaurant in Brooklyn in the early 2000s. From there, the idea spread to state fairs across the country. The new frozen item will set you back $4.76 for a box of seven, and each fried Twinkie will set your diet back 220 calories.

At least that’s the claim of a video comparing the product to its store-brand brethren. The folks at AL.com did an unofficial ice retention test comparing Yeti, Ozark Trail and Orca stainless steel vacuum-sealed tumblers, and the results have been making the rounds. In this test, the Ozark Trail (which retails for $9.74 at Walmart) held its ice for 56 hours and 30 minutes, outlasting the Yeti tumbler (a $40 value) by 20 minutes. The ice in the midrange Orca melted at 44 hours and 30 minutes. Yeti claims to have produced the original tumbler of its kind. Whether there has been another brand hidden away or not, it certainly was the first to make the stainless steel vacuum-sealed tumbler a necessity item and gobble up the entire market share. There are plenty of even-less-official videos online featuring amateurs conducting their own ice retention tests, and the only real evidence is they all keep ice frozen longer than the normal amount of time required to consume 30 ounces of water (minus the ice offsetting its volume). No matter the winner, Ozark Trail has proven there is more than one tumbler that can keep ice cold for an unreasonable amount of time. I hope Yeti has made its money, because it is a lifestyle brand moving into the next stage of its life cycle. These niche markets are fun to watch and stressful to be in because a new brand will always surface in the face of success claiming to be either better or cheaper (or, in this case, both). Just ask ridesharing service Uber about its competitor Lyft. I have so many questions for Yeti. Did the company build in enough margin to stay in the market now that it is no longer the only game in town? Will it have to adjust quality to maintain its margin? At the same time, has Ozark Trail underpriced its product at an unsustainable rate? We don’t know. The facts have changed, but the product valuation hasn’t. Does Ozark Trail really make a better (or even equally good cup)? Then why is it so much cheaper? The real answer is that Ozark Trail is cheaper because it isn’t trying to sell you a lifestyle as well as a cup, but the perceived answer is that it’s cheaper because it’s cheaper. The low price forces the consumer to subconsciously make assumptions about the lifespan, durability and cooling power of the cup. Reality may be fact, but consumer perception is reality. Think of it this way: Do you want to be seen with a Yeti or an Ozark Trail tumbler in your hand? Be honest. Now each brand has to decide if it’s going to compete on value or price. Ozark Trail will likely continue to position itself as the better value based on low price while Yeti makes the opposite value argument. Orca is the brand with tough decisions to make — it’s not cheaper or better. Ozark Trail’s lower price will help the company flood the market by selling to people who don’t value 56 hours of ice at $40. Simultaneously, flooding the market with a product perceived as cheap will only help to elevate the “exclusive” status of the Yeti tumbler. Yeti may have fewer customers going forward, but the people who buy Yeti mugs will likely not complain about the price — because they have a cheaper option and understand they’re purchasing an image and a lifestyle. There is nothing wrong with Ozark Trail’s strategy, aside from the seemingly contradictory claim of cheaper and better. It may be true, but it’s difficult for the human brain to accept. How often do we do this in our own businesses, thinking of ourselves as the best but positioning our brand as the “cheap” option instead of the “valuable” choice? I’m as guilty of it as anyone, but I’m often reminded of my value by my staff’s incredible work. At the end of the day, however, I think Yeti is going to stay on top — as long as there is a stainless steel vacuum sealed tumbler market. Look at the prestige brands in each product category. Apple. Gibson. Mercedes. Zales. Oakley. Coca-Cola. Sure, you may see these products on sale from time to time, but they are consistently sold at a higher price point than their competitors and rarely engage in price wars. One of the moments that most impacted my future marketing career was when, as a child, I was in a store with my dad and noticed Coca-Cola was always priced higher than RC Cola. When I asked my dad why Coke was priced higher, he said, “Because people will pay more for it.” Are higher-priced products better products? Maybe. Sometimes, probably. But it doesn’t matter — as long as they are perceived to be better products. If only wealthy people drive Mercedes and the company makes fewer cars than Honda, it will always be an exclusive commodity. Make sure you value your brand in accordance with the competition. Make the cheapest product with the understanding that while you’re disrupting the marketplace, you’re not making the best product. Value your product as the best, but don’t expect to hold exclusivity and market saturation in the same hand. » Josh Mabus is president and CEO of The Mabus Agency Apple Business Coca-Cola column Gibson Josh Mabus Mercedes Mississippi NEWS Ozark Trail RC Cola Yeti 2016-08-12 Contributing Columnist tweet Tagged with: Apple Business Coca-Cola column Gibson Josh Mabus Mercedes Mississippi NEWS Ozark Trail RC Cola Yeti Previous: TODD SMITH — Google sprints to Olympic search gold Next: Q&A — Credit union feeling shifts in business About Contributing Columnist More Stories Like This Memorial psychiatric hospital losing millions; sale imminent November 23, 2016 Mississippi man among those getting sentence cut November 23, 2016 Court blocks federal plan to extend overtime pay to many November 23, 2016 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Register Now Advertise Macy's Says 100 Stores Are On The Chopping Block by Thom Forbes, Featured Columnist @tforbes, August 12, 2016, 7:55 AM Recommend (3) Macy’s decision to close another 100 stores because they are worth more as real estate than as retail outlets drew a crowd of interested buyers yesterday. Its shares rose as much 17%, its biggest intraday gain since December 2008. It had been down 2.8% on the year, Bloomberg reports.   “We believe there is too much retail square footage in the department store space,” Macy’s president Jeffrey Gennette, who will take over as CEO next year, tells the Wall Street Journal’s Suzanne Kapner in an interview.  “The retailer has been evaluating its real estate since it came under attack by activist investor Starboard Value LP last year. Macy’s executives said they haven’t completed which of the company’s 728 locations they will close; and they will continue to operate most of the stores through the end of the fiscal year,” Kapner reports. “The company said it was also ‘examining opportunities’ involving its real estate holdings at four of its downtown flagship stores in the United States,” writes Megan Woolhouse for the Boston Globe — Herald Square in New York, Union Square in San Francisco, State Street in Chicago, and a site in downtown Minneapolis. “Most of these stores are under-performers or in weak locations,” said CFO Karen M. Hoguet in an earnings call transcribed by Seeking Alpha. She maintained that Macy’s would be able to “retain some of the sales” of all the closed outlets in other nearby stores as well as on macys.com. Amazon and its .com brethren have a lot to do with rendering those locations “weak,” of course.  “The shift in e-commerce, and the increase in online spending, is definitely pushing this move,” Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, which offers a free shipping service for Macy’s and other retailers available to consumers who pay a subscription fee, tells Woolhouse. He also say shoppers who turned to bargain stores such as TJ Maxx and HomeGoods during the recession have never returned. In the New York Times, Rachel Abrams and Sapna Maheshwari couple Macy’s plans to shutter its underperforming stores with Wal-Mart’s announcement Monday that it had reached an agreement to purchase Jet.com for $3 billion. “The decisions by … two towering figures in the industry have sent a clear message: The pressure to keep up with customers is at a boiling point,” they write.  “These legacy players are having a terrible time navigating through that shift successfully,” Mark A. Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, tells them. “They’re finally moving in the right direction,” Poonam Goyal, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, tells Bloomberg’s Lindsey Rupp about Macy’s decision. “This just shows you online is taking over. It’s really about taking their destiny into their own hands.” CNNMoney’s Matt Egan reminds us that Wal-Mart announced plans in January to shut down 269 stores this year and that Sports Authority’s filing for bankruptcy will close 450 stores. Target, JC Penney, Kmart, Sears and Kohl's also shuttered hundreds of stores in recent months. “It's a grim picture for retail store workers — there have been around 44,000 retail layoffs announced so far this year alone, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas data. Wal-Mart's closures alone impacted 16,000 workers,” he writes. But, as the NYT’s Abrams and Maheshwari point out in their lede, “the great American consumer is very much alive,” with household spending rising at an annualized rate of 4.2% this spring. “But more and more, they now want bargains and convenience — in stores and online — and know how to find them.” The overabundance of options is certainly hiding in plain sight. “We have five and a half times the number of retail physical locations in America per capita than any other country in the world,” Macy’s retiring CEO Terry Lundgren tells CNBC in an interview. “So there has to be a rationalization and we’re not waiting any longer.” He also asserts that macys.com is “only behind Wal-Mart and Amazon” in the categories that it sells online.  As for Gennette’s comment about there being too much square footage in retail, one imagines Wells Fargo’s CEO saying something similar about horses in the stable circa 1900. It, and fellow legacy stagecoach company American Express, are doing just fine today. Others who didn’t adapt? Not so much. 24 SHARES Tags: department store, retail Recommend (3) Print RSS All content published by MediaPost is determined by our editors 100% in the interest of our readers ... independent of advertising, sponsorships or other considerations. 1 comment about " Macy's Says 100 Stores Are On The Chopping Block".

August 12, 2016 06:53 AM NEW YORK (AP) - The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. Hostess Brands is launching packaged "Deep Fried Twinkies" starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. Advertisement – Content Continues Below The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Hostess says the Twinkie is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012. For Wal-Mart, it's part of a strategy of working with suppliers to come up with twists on existing foods or developing new ones. The company, which gets more than half its sales from food, opened a food lab in June as it aims to get products to the shelves faster. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They'll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart.

The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Veuer - on August 12, 2016< > Embed Hostess Selling Deep Fried Twinkies in the Frozen Food Aisle 00:38 Hostess is breaking into the frozen food market with new Deep Fried Twinkies.

Kaiser Health News: Should Big Insurance Become Like Walmart To Lower Health Costs? Retail titan Walmart uses its market dominance to inflict “ruthless,” “brutal” and “relentless” pressure on prices charged by suppliers, business writers frequently report. What if huge health insurance companies could push down prices charged by hospitals and doctors in the same way? The idea is getting new attention as already painful health costs accelerate and major medical insurers seek to merge into three enormous firms. (Hancock, 8/11) Kaiser Health News: Administration Paints Rosy Future For Obamacare Marketplaces Aviva Aron-Dine, senior counselor to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, said the data was encouraging when many insurers have announced double-digit rate increases for 2017 and others have pulled back in some states to curtail financial losses. “What we take from this is that the marketplace is on sound footing,” she said in a phone briefing with reporters. She also said the sharp 2017 rate increases could be intended to help insurers compensate for underpricing their premiums in 2014 and 2015 and not the first in a series of large annual rate hikes. (Galewitz, 8/11) Kaiser Health News: More Small, Midsized Firms Choose To Pay Workers’ Medical Costs Directly Instead of buying a health insurance policy to cover their workers, a growing number of small and midsized companies are opting to pay their employees’ medical claims directly, a potentially riskier practice financially called self-insuring, a recent study found. Between 2013 and 2015, the proportion of midsized companies with 100 to 499 employees that were self-insured increased 19 percent, to 30.1 percent, according to the analysis published in July by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The percentage of small firms with fewer than 100 employees that self-funded their health plans grew 7 percent, to 14.2 percent, the study found. Meanwhile, self-funding by large companies declined slightly, to 80.4 percent. (Andrews, 8/12) Kaiser Health News: Researchers Identify A Key Weapon Of Zika Virus Scientists at the University of Southern California discovered a key weapon used by the Zika virus to ravage the brains of infected fetuses: proteins. In an article published Thursday in the journal Cell Stem Cell, researchers identified two proteins in Zika potentially responsible for causing microcephaly. ... The proteins — called NS4A and NS4B — affect the brain by targeting a critical signaling pathway that controls cell growth and breaks down damaged cells and their elements. Initially, Zika slows cell development and reduces the variety of cells in the brain. Over time, this “rigged” system enables the virus to thrive and spread while healthy cells die. (Heredia Rodriguez, 8/11) California Healthline: Licensing Logjam For California Nurses Ivana Russo submitted her application for a California nursing license on April 22, nearly a month before she graduated from a nursing program at Brightwood College in San Diego. She expected it to take 10 to 12 weeks for the state to process her paperwork and authorize her to take the licensing exam. As of early August, 15 weeks later, the licensing board still had not reviewed her file and could not tell her when it would. Russo called the agency, often, to ask about the status of her application. It was hard to get a staff member on the phone. When she did, she said, “Every time I got a different story.” (Brown, 8/11) The Wall Street Journal: Obama Administration Counters Insurer View On Healthcare Law’s Costs The Obama administration on Thursday issued a data analysis saying insurers’ costs for people who buy health-care coverage on their own remained essentially the same between the first and second years of the Affordable Care Act, partly because of a healthier mix of customers on exchanges created by the law. The analysis is one way the administration is seeking to counter insurers seeking substantial premium increases for 2017. Health insurers already have filed proposed rates for the year ahead with state regulators, and big plans across the country are seeking hefty premium increases because of what they say are substantial losses in the first few years of the law’s implementation. (Radnofsky, 8/11) The Associated Press: Medicaid Estimate Renews Cost Concerns Over 'Obamacare' A government report says the cost of expanding Medicaid to millions more low-income people is increasing faster than expected. That's raising questions about a vital part of President Barack Obama's health care law. The law called for the federal government to pay the entire cost of the Medicaid expansion from 2014 through the end of this year. (8/12) The New York Times: With Congress Deadlocked, White House Diverts Funds To Fight Zika The Obama administration on Thursday said it was shifting $81 million away from biomedical research and antipoverty and health care programs to pay for the development of a Zika vaccine, resorting to extraordinary measures because Congress has failed to approve new funding to combat the virus. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, told members of Congress in a letter that without the diverted funds, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would run out of money to confront the mosquito-borne illness by the end of the month. (Davis, 8/11) The Washington Post: Obama Administration To Shift $81 Million To Fight Zika The money will supplement the $347 million HHS transferred away from an existing fund to fight the Ebola virus. The administration is seeking $1.9 billion to fight Zika, but Congress is deadlocked over the funding. “The failure to pass a Zika emergency supplemental has forced the Administration to choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid these delays,” Burwell wrote. (Snell and Dennis, 8/11) The Wall Street Journal: New Zika Funding To Come From Inside NIH Secretary Burwell, in her letter, said the administration now has to “choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid” delays in vaccine research on Zika. She estimated that, even with the $34 million, NIH will need another $196 million in fiscal 2017 for vaccine and other research related to Zika. (Burton and McWhirter, 8/11) Politico: Administration Shifts More Funds To Zika Fight NIAID Director Tony Fauci said at the National Press Club that funding Zika this way is not wise. "All of that is extremely damaging to the biomedical enterprise," he said. "We're taking money away from cancer, diabetes, all of those kinds of things." The new Zika funding is coming from other NIH accounts, as well as the Administration for Children and Families, CMS and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Burwell said that these moves will “exhaust” the ability to provide short-term financing help for ZIka and that more funding will be needed. (Haberkorn, 8/11) The Washington Post: Lobbyists Leading The Charge On Zika Funding: ‘We’re Making Stone Soup.’ Perhaps no one is more frustrated with Congress’s inaction on emergency Zika funding than Cindy Pellegrini. Pellegrini oversees lobbying at the March of Dimes, the nonprofit working to improve maternal and infant health. Since March, Pellegrini has been leading the charge on Capitol Hill to pass legislation funding research, vaccine development and other measures to combat the Zika virus, which causes severe brain defects in babies whose mothers are infected while pregnant. But her efforts have hit a wall. (Ho, 8/11) The Wall Street Journal: Biotech’s Resurgence May Cost Big Pharma There are signs that a new wave of deals is brewing in the biotech sector. That is juicing shares and pushing up valuations. Some likely buyers are Amgen, Gilead Sciences, and Merck, which are among the large drugmakers who have said this year that they are on the hunt for deals. Among possible sellers are Medivation, which signed confidentiality agreements with several potential acquirers earlier this summer, a precursor to a possible sale. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that the biotech giant Biogen has attracted preliminary interest from at least two potential suitors. (Grant, 8/11) The Washington Post: Do The New Merck HPV Ads Guilt-Trip Parents Or Tell Hard Truths? Both. Merck, which is running its first television commercials on human papillomavirus (HPV) in half a dozen years, has ignited a fierce debate over whether the pharmaceutical giant is trying to "shame" parents into getting their children vaccinated for the most common sexually transmitted infection. The ads, which first aired June 28, are running on major network and cable channels, in day time and prime time, including during the Olympics, when a lot of people are watching TV with their families. They don't mention Merck's Gardasil, the most widely used vaccine for HPV. Instead, they take aim at a tender spot: parents' worries about doing right by their kids. (McGinley, 8/11) Politico: Missouri PDMP: Quaint Outlier, Or Harbinger Of Privacy Backlash? When officials try to explain why Missouri, alone among 50 states, has failed to create a monitoring program that tells doctors when patients are abusing narcotics, they point to a right-wing state senator who has repeatedly filibustered the program. The effort to block the program is championed by Rob Schaaf, a Republican family doctor who has intense worries about privacy — even going so far as to suggest the Pentagon is using health care databases to find out who has guns. (Tahir, 8/11) The Associated Press: Studies Shine Light On Mysterious Placenta, How It Goes Awry Scientists carefully probe a placenta donated after birth, bluish umbilical cord still attached. This is the body's most mysterious organ, and inside lie clues about how it gives life — and how it can go awry, leading to stillbirth, preterm birth, even infections like the Zika virus, that somehow sneak past its protective barrier. In labs around the country, major research is underway to finally understand and monitor this floppy, bloody tissue that's often dismissed as the "afterbirth," the organ that lives about nine months and then gets thrown away. (Neergaard, 8/12) The New York Times: De Blasio Signs Bill Mandating Lactation Rooms In City Offices A new bill signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday will require certain city offices and service centers to provide a lactation room for nursing mothers to use at their choosing. In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. de Blasio — surrounded by several women holding babies — trumpeted New York as “one of the first cities in the country” to pass such a bill. Other cities with similar legislation include Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Madison, Wis. (Schmidt, 8/11) The Associated Press: Justice Department Sues Mississippi Over Mental Health Care The U.S. Justice Department sued Mississippi on Thursday, saying the state is violating the Americans With Disabilities Act by "unnecessarily and illegally" making mentally ill people go into state-run psychiatric hospitals. The state has failed to provide community-based services that would enable people with mental illnesses to have meaningful interaction with friends and family and to make decisions about work and daily life, says the suit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Jackson. It also says life in an institution leads to stigma, isolation and learned helplessness. (Pettus, 8/11) The Wall Street Journal: Training Rikers Island Staff To Defuse Conflicts With Mentally Ill Inmates Jenna banged her fists against a cinder-block wall at Rikers Island while two correction officers and a therapist hovered nearby. “I have the power, you do not!” screamed Jenna as she paced wildly in her cell. Jenna is actually Erin Shields, one of the actors who regularly come to the New York City jail complex, change into orange prison-uniform pants and play the role of inmate to teach correction and health staff how to defuse conflicts with the mentally ill. (Ramey, 8/11) The Associated Press: Terminally Ill Woman Holds Party Before Ending Her Life In early July, Betsy Davis emailed her closest friends and relatives to invite them to a two-day party, telling them: “These circumstances are unlike any party you have attended before, requiring emotional stamina, centeredness and openness.” And just one rule: No crying in front of her.The 41-year-old artist with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, held the gathering to say goodbye before becoming one of the first Californians to take a lethal dose of drugs under the state’s new doctor-assisted suicide law for the terminally ill. (Watson, 8/11) NPR: Where Lead Lurks And Why Even Small Amounts Matter Lead problems with the water in Flint, Mich., have prompted people across the country to ask whether they or their families have been exposed to the toxic metal in their drinking water, too. When it comes to assessing the risk, it's important to look in the right places.Even when municipal water systems' lead levels are considered perfectly fine by federal standards, the metal can leach into tap water from lead plumbing. (Pupovac, 8/12) NPR: Long-Term Therapy Appeared To Rebuild Damaged Spinal Connections Researchers in Brazil who are trying to help people with spine injuries gain mobility have made a surprising discovery: Injured people doing brain training while interacting with robot-like machines were able to regain some sensation and movement. The findings, published in Scientific Reports (one of the Nature journals), suggest that damaged spinal tissue in some people with paraplegia can be retrained to a certain extent — somewhat the way certain people can regain some brain function following stroke though repetition and practice. In fact, this isn't a new idea for treating injuries of the spinal cord. Even people with severe injuries can regain some sensation and function through physical therapy if some nerve fibers remain.

And analytics have always been the core tool for ensuring that those purchases remain consistently convenient and speedy. Now new strategies for engaging customers through Internet of Things (IoT) devices and virtual reality experiences are accelerating customer expectations. But before understanding advanced tactics, marketers must ask what takes to monitor customer activity. Consideration of analytic settings and a few basic reports can reveal how to monitor the frequency of online sales. How Speedy Online Retail Changed Analytics E-commerce has always been a game of speed. Consumer adoption of smartphones and tablets for e-commerce raised the profile for metrics associated with a rate of time. Studies have already shown that consumers accessing online retailers via mobile devices are usually ready to purchase, and can stimulate cross device retail as well. Thus the metrics should emphasize how long it takes customers to make purchase decisions in terms of time and in number of visitor sessions. Start With the Right Questions for Speedier Analysis You should start with basic questions nuanced for products and services and for timing when the purchases occur. Doing this allows you to know what reporting is needed, and to better planning of advanced e-commerce analytic features. This can speed up response to issues that may be impacting the customer experience. Here are a few example questions that can spot ecommerce details that an analytic report should provide: How long does it take for customers to decide to purchase? Are certain order combinations selected at certain times? Are customers ordering more from a tablet or browsing a potential purchase on a smartphone and finishing later on a home desktop? Vetting these questions against an analytics solution reveal needed metrics essential to understanding purchase behavior, such as product IDs and product category segments based on the site layout. Plan the Right Layout in the Reports The next step is to vet the analytic tag settings against the layout and the reporting based on the aforementioned needs. Doing so puts the right reports in place. Let’s say you have a site layout question — Is the e-commerce site hosted separately from your main website or is it hosted as a subdomain? Analytics solutions typically have a filter manager that can display reports for subdomain-only traffic. This is useful for setting reports for a subdirectory of site pages that are dedicated to e-commerce. Layout specific can also require tracking traffic across domains so that visitors are not double counted in the metrics. Fortunately, most analytics solutions offer cross device reporting, with a variation to setup details. Google Analytics, for example, has a User ID for this purpose. Initiating means setting the user admin, then adding a script in the analytic tracking code. Another setting consideration, this one specific to Google Analytics, is Enhanced Ecommerce. The feature, enabled in the main analytic tag, incorporates a data layer of information for product impression measurements. Those metrics are part of specific behaviors, such as purchases and refunds, viewing product details, responses to promotion, and adding/removing a product from a shopping cart. Enhanced analytics helps in highlighting multiple purchases in a session or a page hierarchy expected at each stage of a purchasing process, such as counting a visit when someone purchases a pair of shoes, then goes on to purchase a different pair. This differs a bit from the goals — which are still essential for conversion reporting and making general comparisons among data sources, such as comparing number of visits from referral traffic sources versus social media sources. Goals in an analytic solution are meant to count specific activity that occurs in a session (a site visit or app usage). Enhanced Ecommerce measures metrics for multiple activities in a visit. No matter what settings are added, it is important to maintain a master “rollup” analytics profile that tracks all the traffic associated with the domain. This arrangement is a set of unfiltered data that provides a comparison for diagnosing errors in traffic volume or metrics against a profile filtered for a subdomain. Check Metrics in Periods & Influence on the Sales Cycle With the right settings in place, your team can review sales conversions against a timeline or within a period. Planning periodic review, with simple trend comparisons examined at 30 day, 60 day, and 90 day intervals, can indicate if, for example, the top selling products appears to be an ongoing trend and a worth further investigation. Another consideration is examining how the sales cycle is occurring. This is done through a set of reports designed to analyze time to purchase; Top Conversion, Path Length, and Time Lag. Top Conversion is meant to display which combination of referral sources are leading to conversions. The Path Length report shows how many conversions resulted from conversion paths that contained single or multiple channel interactions.  The Time Lag report notes the days that lead up to purchase conversion. You can use these reports to examine other ideas on how well a site layout matches the sales cycle, such as reviewing page flow. Plan Periodic Reviews for Functional Diagnostics A more thorough review periodically can reveal technical issues or imply where content may be better positioned. If a review reveals content elements or wording concerns, use an A/B comparison test. The test can consider simple elements on a shopping cart page or on product page. Site speed reports highlight the added impact from page load concerns – reducing the time required to load a page can minimize poor site response that influence the customer experience. This is just the beginning in e-commerce – We will examine ways to improve shopping cart conversions and using alert notifications to monitor reports in a few upcoming posts. Ultimately analytics can reveal more than monitoring online sales. It is the essence behind understanding the drivers of e-commerce and ultimately your business model.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▲ 70.73 +0.61 +0.86% This week, the United States' largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.(NYSE: WMT), confirmed earlier rumors by buying upstart e-commerce company Jet.com. The Wall Street Journal (subscription required) reports Wal-Mart acquired the company for a total of $3.3 billion -- $3 billion in cash and $300 million in Wal-Mart stock. Overall, this is a small sum for the Arkansas-based retailer; as a point of comparison, the $3.3 billion figure is approximately half of what the company paid in dividends last fiscal year. On the surface, it makes sense for Wal-Mart. Perhaps the biggest shift in the history of retailing, and certainly within the past decade or so, is the rapid growth of e-commerce. In that time, e-commerce sales have grown from a paltry 3.5% of total retail sales to 7.7% in preliminary estimates of Q1 2016. Overall, e-commerce has grown at a clip of 15% over the last two years, versus the overall real GDP growth of 2% to 3% during this period.© Provided by Fool DATA SOURCE: U.S. CENSUS BUREAU. RIGHT Y-AXIS DENOTES YEAR-ON-YEAR GROWTH; LEFT Y-AXIS IS PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL RETAIL SPENDING. Overall, Wal-Mart's purchase of Jet is a small bet on a growing market the company clumsily conceded to the likes of Amazon.com decades ago. The real risk to this deal is unlikely to show up in either company's balance sheet. The culture could not be more different between Jet and Wal-Mart A large-scale study from Big-Four accounting company KPMG found that 83% of all mergers failed to boost shareholder returns. There are many theories why shareholder value does not materialize: paying too much for the acquired company, synergies figures that fail to materialize, and poor due diligence. However, the biggest reason generally given is a mismatch in corporate culture. By all accounts, the cultural differences between Wal-Mart and Jet could not be more different. Wal-Mart, an established retailer, is mostly worried about their bottom-line results, paying billions for share buybacks in an attempt to boost their earnings-per-share figures. Jet has continued to act like an aggressive start-up, more concerned with transactions and user growth at the expense of profits. The Wall Street Journal article notes that the company has been adding 400,000 shoppers monthly and was on pace to sell $1 billion in merchandise annually. However, the company is unprofitable, and its goal of undercutting Amazon's prices would make it hard to grow margins. Last year, the company abandoned its goal of a $50 subscription fee, much like Amazon's Prime service, in an attempt to expand its shopper base. It appears Jet has sacrificed profit for growth. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart did the exact opposite, choosing higher profit margins over revenue by closing 269 worldwide stores, many of which were the company's smaller Walmart Express concept and underperforming stores in Brazil. For Wal-Mart, buying Jet was the easy part There are potential benefits to the merger. Jet now has the buying power of the world's largest retailer and will most likely increase its already enviable 12-million SKU figure. What Jet brings is an Internet-focused and growth-first mentality. The downsides are obvious: If Wal-Mart applies its ruthless cost-cutting culture, it's likely Jet's growth will slow as marketing is pared back in favor of profit. Although the two will remain separate brands, there's an additional risk Jet becomes defined by Wal-Mart, which is the exact opposite of what a high-flying technology-based company would want to happen. In addition to the obvious financial loss in the event the acquisition fails, which is negligible in Wal-Mart's case, the company faces additional costs to combine distribution and potentially falling margins in the event Jet's razor-thin margin operations become a larger part of Wal-Mart's revenue haul. Overall, this was an aggressive move for a company continuing to fall behind in e-commerce. However, paying for Jet was the easy part; successfully integrating both companies is where this battle will be won or lost.  -- SPONSORED: A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The Saline County Prosecutor was forced to drop charges against a man on the run from police. KSHB Surveillance video courtesy Marshall Police Department Courtesy Marshall Police Dept. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next MARSHALL, Mo. - Two Marshall police officers are accused of embellishing their witness accounts in a case last year, according to the Saline County prosecutor. On the evening of May 13, 2015, officers Tyler Newell and Josh O'Bryan pulled up to a Chrysler 300C parked at the Walmart on S. Cherokee Drive to arrest Carl Roettgen who was wanted on a warrant. In a statement filed in court, the officers said as they walked up, Roettgen began to back up the car. Officer Newell said he asked the man in the passenger seat to get out of the car, and the man complied. Officer Newell then stated in the probable cause statement he "entered the vehicle through the opened front passenger side door in an attempt to put the gear shift into park. Officer Newell stated he looked up at Mr. Roettgen and saw a black in color handgun barrel pointed approximately one inch away from his face. Officer Newell stated he heard a loud click, which he believed Mr. Roettgen was attempting to shoot him with the handgun. Officer Newell described the handgun, as a semi-automatic. Officer Newell stated he exited the vehicle, removed his service pistol, and discharged one round at the fleeing vehicle." "It's the story that the Marshall, Missouri police department stuck with; until this day they have not contradicted that story," John James, Roettgen's defense attorney, said. In a Walmart surveillance video, the car's passenger door is closed as Roettgen drives off as officers chase the car. As Saline County Prosecutor Donald Stouffer prepared for the trial set for August 23, he said he noticed the discrepancy between the video and the statement. It forced him to drop a majority of the charges filed against Roettgen, who was arrested in Alabama after a massive manhunt. "Mr. Roettgen made a very poor decision trying to run from officers when he was being arrested. The officer trying to arrest him made a poor decision by discharging his weapon inappropriately and then he made a terrible decision by lying to cover it up," James said. In a statement Stouffer said this is the first time in his 28 years as a prosecutor that he's dismissed charges because the testimony from an officer lacked credibility.   Click here to read Stouffer's statement "I don't mean this as an indictment of every officer there and that's the sad part -- it's hard to know which ones were complicit and which ones weren't," James said. Roettgen was sentenced Monday to four years in prison for fleeing the officers. Stouffer said he now plans to review other cases where the two officers were key witnesses. Besides telling 41 Action News the officers are on paid administrative leave, the police department declined to comment any further on the case. ------   Andres Gutierrez can be reached at andres.gutierrez@kshb.com Follow him on Twitter:  Follow @AFGutierrez Connect on Facebook:   Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.

Roston - Aug 11, 2016 9 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit We’ve known for a few weeks now that CVS Pharmacy has been working on making mobile payments available in its stores, and all signs pointed toward those mobile payments involving Apple Pay. While CVS had confirmed in a roundabout way that it was looking into mobile payments, it didn’t specify platforms one way or the other. Now, it turns out via an official announcement, CVS wasn’t planning to launch Apple Pay: it was developing its own mobile payments platform called CVS Pay. CVS announced the new mobile payments platform today, saying it is an end-to-end payment platform launching in CVS Pharmacy stores. CVS Pay, much like Walmart Pay before it, is part of the CVS Pharmacy app, bringing the payments system, loyalty program, and prescription pickup tools all together in a single mobile destination. Much like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Walmart’s own version, CVS Pay has customers add their debit and/or credit cards to the CVS Pharmacy app, after which point they can hold their phone out to be scanned when checking out. The app presents a barcode, which the cashier scans. After scanning, the items are scanned, then the customer taps which payment card they want to use within the app. The app can also be used to handle all aspects of prescriptions using a single scannable barcode. In order to verify prescriptions and payments, the user has to enter some kind of detail, like a PIN and signature. Payment confirmations are delivered in-app after the payment goes through. In the present, CVS Pay is available in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York, but the company anticipates rolling it out to all stores across the nation by the end of this year. Both iOS and Android apps are supported, with the mobile payment app supporting all major credit cards, including American Express, MasterCard, Visa, and Discover. The app also supports debit cards, HSAs, and Flexible Spending Account cards.

Macy’s announced plans on Thursday to close about 15% of its department stores, the latest effort to adapt to shifting consumer preferences for online shopping. In a sign of how dramatically the retail shopping landscape is changing, Macy’s is closing 100 of its stores nationwide. Macy’s announced the closures Thursday. They represents about 15% of all Macy’s department stores. The iconic retailer did not disclose the locations of stores, but said most of them will be shut down in early 2017. The Macy’s move is the latest in a wave of store closures amid the rise and success of Amazon and other online shopping options. For instance, Walmart announced plans in January to shut down 269 stores this year and just this week, inked a $3.3 billion deal to acquire Amazon rival Jet.com. Sports Authority, once the nation’s largest sporting goods retailer, is shutting all 450 of its stores after filing for bankruptcy. Other traditional retailers such as Target, JC Penney, Kmart, Sears and Kohl’s have also pulled the plug on hundreds of stores in recent months. It’s a grim picture for retail store workers — there have been 47,000 retail layoffs announced so far this year alone, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas data. Walmart’s closures alone impacted 16,000 workers. Macy’s closures come amid a sixth-straight quarterly decline in sales. However, sales fell less than feared and the company said it’s “encouraged” by recent sales trends. Wall Street applauded the dramatic store closures, sending the stock surging 16%, on track for its best day since 2008. Macy’s said its new strategy is to concentrate its financial firepower and talent on its best-performing locations. The department store plans to invest in strong stores by highlighting new vendors, increasing the size and quality of its staff and investing in new technology. “We operate in a fast-changing world, and our company is moving forward decisively to build further on Macy’s heritage,” Macy’s CEO Terry Lundgren said in a statement. Macy’s said the store closures could result in the loss of about $1 billion in sales, even after accounting for shoppers who would go online and to other Macy’s locations. The company plans to offset that loss in sales by cutting costs, even beyond shutting down these stores. It’s not clear how many jobs will be impacted by these moves. Macy’s told CNNMoney it won’t detail layoffs until it finalizes its store closure list. Macy’s said employees at stores slated for closure may be offered positions in nearby stores “where possible,” Macy’s said. Workers who are laid off will be offered severance benefits. “Macy’s is committed to treating associates affected by store closings with respect and openness,” the company said. Karen Hoguet, Macy’s chief financial officer, said most of the stores being closed are “underperformers, or are in weak locations.” The Macy’s move is the latest blow to malls, many of which rely on the iconic department store to serve as an “anchor” tenant. Those malls impacted risk losing a major source of revenue and a suffering a traffic slowdown in traffic that is likely to hurt other stores. Struggles for other department stores make filling the hole left by Macy’s even more challenging. Shares of major mall owners General Growth Properties and Simon Property Group slumped 3% and 2%, respectively, on Thursday. Even some premiere Macy’s locations could eventually be scaled back. The company said it continues to “analyze possibilities” of bringing in alternative tenants into its flagship Herald Square location in Manhattan as well as the downtown stores in Chicago and Minneapolis. Macy’s revealed it’s also in talks to sell its Men’s Store on Union Square in San Francisco for redevelopment. Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, said the Macy’s store closures are “sensible,” but largely the result of a “self-inflicted defeat.” “Macy’s has simply not bothered with a large rump of stores for many years: they have lacked investment, been devoid of management attention, and now look distressed and dispirited,” Saunders wrote in a report. The key will be whether Macy’s is truly committed to rejuvenating its remaining stores in a way that gives consumers a reason to shop in person rather than online. 32.898004 -97.040015 Related stories Martha Stewart Frying Pans Recalled for Causing Welts and Burns Macy’s Closing Up to 40 More Stores Starbucks, Other Companies Look to Hire 100,000 Young People Filed in: National/World News Topics: Business Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Download the CW33 News App!

The section of Holton Whitehall Road, extending from U.S. 31 to Silver Creek Road, is expected to be closed for up to three weeks during the road reconstruction project. An open cut across Holton Whitehall Road is planned for today, Aug. 11, for work on a water main crossing. This map shows the area on Holton Whitehall Road where the road construction project is taking place.Google Map  The project, designed to improve the roadway and add turn lanes to that stretch of Holton Whitehall Road, was originally scheduled to begin on Aug. 1. The project had been delayed because of some changes to the original plan for the project, according to the Muskegon County Road Commission. Wal-Mart, which hired its own contractor for the project, is heading the completion of the project through a permit with the Muskegon County Road Commission, which has oversight of that section of road. Turn lanes will be added to that section of the road, which will be widened as part of the project. It is currently a two-land road in that section extending from U.S. 31 to Silver Creek Road. A detour is posted, directing motorists on Holton Whitehall Road to take Russell Road, then White Lake Drive, and then Whitehall Road. According to the road commission, local traffic may be able to get through, however, it is encouraged to use the detour route for safety reasons. The 122,000-square-foot store will offer a full line of fresh produce, general merchandise including health and beauty items, baby and pet supplies, toys and games, electronics, sporting goods, apparel and household items. A full-service pharmacy with drive-thru, vision center, money center, digital photo-processing center and Wal-Mart pickup will also be at the location. Wal-Mart is tentatively planning a grand opening in the spring or early summer of 2017, a spokesman said earlier this year. The construction of the store is the end of a long, pre-construction legal battle between the Bentonville, Ark.-based company and a local group calling itself BOW NOT — Back Off Wal-Mart, Not Our Town.

PETERSBURG Related News/Archive Suspect arrested in St. Petersburg home invasion after chase in stolen car; second man sought 1 Month Ago Police: St. Petersburg mother arrested for child abuse 4 Months Ago Arrest made in St. Petersburg Walmart attack 2 Months Ago A 39-year-old man was arrested Aug. 3 on charges that he stole a macaw named Kirby, according to an arrest report. Kirby was at home with his owner, James Clark, at 3237 53rd Ter. N when Danny Ray Teer broke into the mobile home and took him, the report says. Clark told Pinellas sheriff's deputies he knew who stole his bird, worth about $2,500. When they visited Teer, deputies found Kirby in good condition and took him home. Teer of St. Petersburg told deputies he stole Kirby "due to Clark owing him money for labor provided as an employee/employer agreement," a report states. Teer was jailed on a charge of burglary while the structure was occupied. LARGO Couple used stolen electricity meter for eight years, says a Duke Energy report to police A couple living at 8765 Abbey Lane are accused of stealing a neighbor's power meter and using it for more than eight years, totaling $15,358 worth of electricity, arrest reports state. Duke Energy reported to Largo police that Calvin Berry and Aneta Giadla had been using the meter since December 2007. After their arrest, Giadla, 39, admitted that Berry, 37, installed the meter years ago, according to the arrest report. They were jailed Aug. 2 on charges of grand theft from a utility. Clearwater Police: Driver slammed into telephone pole, but tells officers a different tale On Aug. 2, David Schnabel Jr. reported that he was the victim of a hit-and-run in the 2400 block of Gulf-to-Bay Boulevard. A blue Ford F-150 struck him as he pulled out of an AutoZone parking lot, he told officers. But after police inspected his car, along with a witness statement, it was determined that Schnabel, 30, "had in fact hit a telephone pole and was at fault for the traffic accident," an arrest report states. Schnabel told them he lied "to avoid getting in trouble." He was arrested on a charge of false report of a crime, and cited for careless driving. Compiled by Laura C.

By Jay Hancock August 11, 2016 Walmart holds down prices through brutal negotiation with suppliers. Similarly huge insurance companies might strike better deals with hospitals and pass on the savings, some suggest. (iStock) Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print Republish Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Email Print Republish Retail titan Walmart uses its market dominance to inflict “ruthless,” “brutal” and “relentless” pressure on prices charged by suppliers, business writers frequently report. What if huge health insurance companies could push down prices charged by hospitals and doctors in the same way? The idea is getting new attention as already painful health costs accelerate and major medical insurers seek to merge into three enormous firms. Now that hospitals have themselves combined, in many cases, into companies that dominate their communities, insurance executives argue the only way to fight bigness is bigness. No. 2 health insurer Anthem’s proposed marriage to No. 6 Cigna would let the combined company “manage the cost drivers that negatively impact affordability for consumers,” Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish told Congress last year. The bigger company could “negotiate better reimbursement rates” with medical providers, says Anthem spokeswoman Jill Becher. In metro areas with only a few big insurers, hospital and doctor bills tend to be lower than what economists would otherwise expect. If only one or two insurers are bidding to include providers in their networks, hospitals and doctors must submit to the offered deal or risk getting shut out of a huge piece of business. This KHN story also ran on NPR. It can be republished for free (details). “There’s some literature out there that does show that when you have relatively concentrated insurance markets, they tend to keep actual hospital costs down,” said Yevgeniy Feyman, a researcher at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a fellow with the Manhattan Institute. The American Hospital Association as well as the American Medical Association, trade groups for hospitals and doctors respectively, have long worried that insurance mergers do just that. Now that Anthem is trying to buy Cigna, and No. 3 health insurer Aetna wants to buy No. 5 Humana, they’re even more concerned. Both deals “have the very real potential to reduce competition substantially” and “diminish the insurers’ willingness to be innovative partners with providers and consumers,” AHA lawyer Melinda Reid Hatton wrote to antitrust authorities after the combos were announced. But hospitals have built their own market power through numerous mergers, giving them broad ability to raise prices paid by employers, taxpayers and consumers beyond what a competitive market would allow, economists argue. Hospitals “are much more concentrated than insurance markets,” said Glenn Melnick, a health care economist at the University of Southern California who has researched the matter. “They face a lot less competition than the [health] plans do.” Why not give hospital giants somebody their own size to negotiate with? For one thing, insurers might just pocket higher profits from low provider prices instead of passing the savings to consumers and employers. “I don’t find any evidence that reduction in provider payment leads to reduction in insurance premiums, and I don’t know of any study that does,” said Leemore Dafny, an expert in insurance markets and an economist at Harvard Business School. Feyman suggests requiring insurers in concentrated areas to spend 90 percent of their revenue on medical care. That might reduce their ability to boost profits with premium increases while preserving their ability to hold down hospital and doctor costs, he said. But he sees such a measure as only a “worst-case scenario” for the most monopolized insurance markets, not a recipe to allow the Anthem and Aetna deals to go through. Antitrust regulators are siding with the hospitals and doctors. Late last month the Justice Department sued to block both insurance mergers, arguing that competition is important to keep premiums down and that the deals “would leave much of the multitrillion-dollar health insurance industry in the hands of three mammoth insurance companies.” They also rejected the Walmart argument, which is related to what economists call “monopsony.” Monopsony is the opposite of monopoly: Instead of using market dominance to raise prices for consumers, huge buyers force down prices from suppliers. Walmart is often described as holding monopsony-like power. But critics of the insurance deals say monopsony can go too far. If the buyer pushes prices too low, suppliers stop producing, making needed goods and services unavailable. “As a result of the merger, Anthem likely would reduce the rates that … providers earn by providing medical care to their patients,” the Justice Department argued. “This reduction in reimbursement rates likely would lead to a reduction in consumers’ access to medical care.” Accepting Walmart logic for health care might bolster arguments for an even bigger, more powerful buyer of medical services: the government. A “single-payer,” government health system, of the type advocated by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, would be the ultimate monopsony: one buyer, negotiating or dictating prices for everybody. Neither the hospitals nor the insurance companies want that.

just-style home News & insights News Walmex sells Suburbia clothing unit for US$853.3m By Beth Wright | 11 August 2016 Font size Email Print Supermarket retailer Wal-Mart de Mexico, known locally as Walmex, has agreed to sell its Surburbia apparel division to Mexico's biggest department store chain, El Puerto de Liverpool SAB, for MXN15.7bn (US$853.3m) in a move it says will allow it to focus on its core business.. As part of the deal Liverpool will assume MXN1.4bn in debt related to leases, and an additional MXN3.3bn in dividends and a capital reduction when the deal closes. It is understood the acquisition includes 119 stores, of which seven are fully owned, 78 are on property leased from third parties and 34 alongside other Walmex operations, as well as Suburbia brands and other marketing and logistics assets. For the year ended 31 December 2015, Suburbia accounted for 3.5% of consolidated sales of Walmex and 5% of its consolidated EBITDA. Following the earlier sales of its restaurant and banking business, the sale of Surburbia represents the final step in Walmex's plan, announced in 2013, to rationalise its portfolio of operations and focus on its efforts on its core retail business. "The agreement reached with Liverpool is good for our shareholders, our associates and our clients," says Guilherme Loureiro, executive president and CEO of Walmart de Mexico. "Surburbia and our associates are in good hands to continue to grow and serve our customers. With this agreeement, we are fully focused on our core retail business and our objective of doubling our total shares by 2024." Walmex placed Surburbia on sale in January but said it would give no assurances that a transaction would take place.

Black Friday shopping is awesome. But back-to-school shopping? Yuck. That’s just work.” My friend sipped her ice coffee and turned back to her laptop — on which browser tabs for Staples, OfficeMax, Walmart, Amazon and several other retailers were open. A long list with a school logo on top lay threateningly on her desk. But she wasn’t clicking Buy Now just yet: her state’s sales tax holiday was due to run for two days later that week and meanwhile, she was biding her time and comparing prices. My friend is far from alone in her exhaustive — yet down-to-the-wire — online quest. The National Retail Federation (NRF) projects that almost half of the nearly $76 billion spent in 2016 by parents during the July-August back-to-school shopping season will be online. The Market Is Massive — and Growing Even more important, the NRF-sponsored survey found that nearly a quarter of cost-conscious back-to-school and back-to-college shoppers — 22 percent to be exact — wait until the last minute to make their purchases, in effect counting on closeout sales and sales tax holidays to lower their overall spend. In a season that’s shaping up to bring in 10 percent more revenues than last year, this is huge news for online retailers. It means that even relatively late in the back-to-school game, retailers still have the unique opportunity to tweak key user experience parameters that can have an immediate impact on sales. 10 Ways to Nurture and Nab the Online Sale So, quick, before it’s all over, here are ten factors to keep in mind and double-check. Some are simple and some are more complex, but all of them can help you ensure that the parents of the world choose your tab on the browser when it comes to outfitting their little darlings for the school year to come. 1. Realize that nobody’s in a very good mood Unlike holiday shopping that brings with it some sense of warmth and good cheer, back-to-school shopping really is a thankless grind. And for most parents, it’s the final hurdle to clear after a long, hot, tiring summer home with the kiddos. So first treat yourself to a viewing of Staples’ classic 2013 back-to-school commercial.  Then remember: To keep Mom and/or Dad happy, make their every online purchase decision simple, straightforward and crystal clear.  2. Accept the reality that returns will happen Just as in the bricks-and-mortar world, returns will happen. Don’t fight them. Make sure your return policy is easily accessible and clearly worded. Linking to information about returns right from the digital shopping cart doesn’t encourage returns — it raises purchase confidence and conversions. The same thing is true for spelling out your price guarantee policy. 3. Be crystal clear about your shipping schedule The clearer you can be about exact delivery dates — and the earlier in the funnel you provide this information to purchasers, the better. Since you know time is tight, tell your shoppers right upfront what it will cost them to get their order there on time. How can you know if time is especially tight? If you geolocate unregistered users and already know the location of your registered users, you can predict with some certainty when school will start. Impress them and show that you’ve got your finger on the community pulse by synching delivery options to their local back-to-school timeframes. 4. Clearly display your promotions We recently discovered that one of our Fortune 100 clients was advertising its promotions via banners and direct mail but nowhere was there a link on its website. Make sure that your promotions are clearly integrated into your site’s information hierarchy and menus — including from the shopping cart — because now is when your customers most want to know about and act on them. 5. Align your promotions with your inventory Make sure your promotions are aligned with up-to-date stock data to avoid sending out promotions for items that are nearly out of stock. Tired summer Mom will not be amused when the juicily discounted backpack/laptop/graphing calculator she needs is out of stock three minutes after your promotional email lands in her inbox. At the same time, if you know you have only 50 units of a popular product left, don’t be afraid to create urgency. Keep in mind that the issue isn’t availability; it’s expectations. 6. Make it easy (and worthwhile) to buy more Bundle, bundle and bundle again. Then discount the bundles, and make the price difference really clear. For example, if buying items separately costs $5 more, don’t make customers guess: boldly label the bundle “a $5 savings!” Even if the benefits of add-on purchases aren’t line item related, they still need to be crystal-clear. Amazon does this masterfully with its free shipping threshold alerts such as “ten more dollars and you’re eligible for free shipping.” 7. Give your “Very Important Parents” the VIP treatment Returning customers should be treated like the VIPs they are. You know they’re under back-to-school deadlines, so offer them incentives that make their lives easier, especially on shipping costs and delivery dates. Back-to-school season provides an ideal opportunity to be seen as a trusted friend who will deliver the goods — literally and figuratively — time and time again. 8. Make redeeming coupons fun Deep in their hearts, consumers know that coupons are just a promotional gimmick but they work really well and the easier they are to use, the more effective they are. Don’t make your customers copy and paste long promotional codes or write anything down to get discounts. Keep your coupons simple, feature them prominently and don’t take the fun away by adding too many restrictions. 9. Keep promotions focused Even the most valuable offering will be ignored if there’s too much background noise. So don’t overwhelm your customers with more than one promotional email each day. Show them the value of your offering and make it worthwhile for them to come visit but don’t add to the pressure by flooding their inboxes. 10. Maximize your site performance As with any high-traffic season, back-to-school is not the time for poor site performance. Even if you’re under a code freeze, keep checking your website performance, VOC (voice of customer) insights and conversion funnels. If something is wrong, you need to be able to fix it on the spot. Walk in Their Shoes Any offline retailer will tell you that knowing your customers’ state of mind is key to closing the sale. In back-to-school season, Mom and Dad’s state of minds is hassled. Put yourself in their shoes and evaluate your site’s user experience through eyes that are simultaneously shopping for the best deals on a tight budget and watching a five-year-old with a red Popsicle jumping on a white couch. Don’t mess with Mom or Dad this back-to-school season and your tab on the browser is more likely to come out on top.

(Lisa Dunlap Photo)   (Note: According to relatives, the youth involved in the alleged shootings are related and share a last name but only three are brothers. The 15-year-old is a cousin to the other three, they said. Also, the three older brothers did go to jail for charges related to the incidents.)   Three juvenile brothers have been issued criminal arrest citations for their alleged involvement in causing thousands of dollars worth of criminal damage by shooting at store and car windows along Main Street Tuesday night before their vehicle crashed near Wal-Mart when they became aware of police in their proximity. Their 10-year-old brother, whom Roswell Police Department spokesman Ryan Posey said was in the silver Chrysler 300 with his siblings, was released without being charged. “Basically it was a bad idea,” said Posey. “The boys were all juveniles, juveniles going around shooting BB guns and they wrecked their car.” The names of the youth were not provided given their ages. The three older boys, ages 15, 14 and 13, received criminal arrest citations but were not incarcerated. They are charged with at least 15 misdemeanor counts of criminal damage and evading police. They also were charged with at least one felony count of aggravated fleeing. According to police damage reports and statements, the youths drove north on Main Street at about 7 p.m. and allegedly began shooting at cars and store fronts. Bullet dents were observed in the glass store windows and doors of Barringer’s Blossom Shop at 314 N. Main St., Bows & Britches Boutique at 320 N. Main St. and the Law Office of Thomas Lilley at 330 N. Main St. Police reports also indicate that a Dodge Caravan parked near Bank of Southwest at 226 N. Main sustained damage to the driver’s side window and a sliding door window. The boys also allegedly shot at least five vehicles at Roswell Mall at 4501 N. Main St. and Sam’s Club at 4400 N. Main St. By about 8 p.m., police officers near Sam’s Club and Wal-Mart were checking out damage reports when they saw the Chrysler and decided to intercept it. Shortly afterward, the vehicle crashed in a vacant lot north of Wal-Mart at Pine Lodge Road and Main Street. “They weren’t even chasing it yet, they had just turned on their lights,” said Posey. “His desire ran away from his skill and he crashed himself. The police officer really didn’t have much time to get anything out on the radio.” Posey stated that three black BB guns were found with the boys along with many BB pellets. Most property owners declined to comment. Samantha Wagoner, owner of Bows and Britches Boutique, expressed disappointment with the culprits. “We work hard for what we have and they totally disrespected it,” she said. She estimated the damage of bullet dents in her windows at $1,500 or more. Anita Eoff, the owner of the Dodge Caravan, said she was parked on Third Street Tuesday night while working inside the Bank of Southwest on Main Street. She said that she didn’t hear anything while working inside the building but, upon leaving work shortly after 7 p.m., she had discovered that two of her vehicles’ windows had been shot out. She then called police. “You are disappointed when you come out and find this type of damage,” she said. She added that she is not sure of the total cost of damages. Officer Posey said that the Juvenile Probation Office and the District Attorney’s Office will determine whether to proceed with criminal cases related to the incidents.

Wal-Mart De Mexico y Centroamerica , also known as Walmex, will sell Suburbia with its 119 stores and real estate for 15.7 billion pesos ($852 million) including debt of 1.4 billion pesos. Walmex will also receive an additional 3.3 billion pesos in items including declared dividends after the deal closes, it said in a statement. In January, the retailer said it was looking to sell Suburbia without giving a timeframe for completing the sale. Some Mexican media outlets had speculated the sale could fetch as much as $2 billion. Liverpool is one of Mexico's department store operators, with more than 100 outlets. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment. Wal-Mart has been looking to double sales in Mexico by 2024 by boosting its core business of running discount retail and membership stores, and expanding its fresh food business. The divestiture is part of Wal-Mart's strategy, announced in 2013, to streamline and sell businesses not central to its overseas operations. Wal-Mart's international division, which contributes roughly one-third of the company's total annual sales of nearly $480 billion, has divested some non-core businesses across Chile, Mexico and Canada in the past two years. In Mexico over the past three years, Walmex has sold its Vips restaurant chain to fast-food operator Alsea SAB for $626 million, and its Banco Walmart unit to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa for about $247 million. Wal-Mart acquired Suburbia's parent supermarket chain Cifra in 1997. Suburbia has 119 stores in 46 cities and is popular with urban shoppers, ranking among Mexico's top five department stores, according to analysts. Suburbia, which is profitable, contributed 3 percent to Walmex's overall revenue in 2015. Walmex, Mexico's biggest private sector employer and the country's largest retailer, posted sales of about $26.35 billion in 2015. At the company's shareholder's meeting in June, David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's overseas division, singled out the Mexican market as a top priority. Mexico has Wal-Mart's largest number of stores outside the United States. Wal-Mart has struggled in overseas markets, including Britain and China, but Walmex has remained a bright spot with second-quarter revenue growing 11.5 percent to about $6.93 billion.

The deal disclosed on Monday follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart, the world's biggest traditional retailer, has already bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the massive gap with market leader Amazon. Wal-Mart's online division has underperformed against Amazon, posting its slowest growth in a year in the first quarter as it struggled to gain traction with consumers, especially millennials. Jet.com was launched by internet entrepreneur Marc Lore in July 2015 and includes software that can offer a customer lower prices as they add items to their shopping cart. Wal-Mart has said it would integrate that software into its main website while keeping Jet.com as a separate entity. "One of the things we really like (about Jet) is that the customer is even more in-charge of the price that they pay," Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a media call. McMillon said Wal-Mart will take time in getting the technology and design components from Jet and that they will grow both brands separately in the short-term. "Over time, piece-by-piece, we will end up running a business that is simpler and not completely independent." McMillon said Lore would run its new U.S. e-commerce business. Lore had cofounded Quidsi, the owner of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com, which was sold to Amazon. "Marc's e-commerce experience and success are obviously attractive," McMillon said. Wal-Mart's current head of global e-commerce Neil Ashe will leave the company at the end of the fiscal year. The decision to run Jet as an independent website is a good step because it can stay focused on growth, but the price Wal-Mart paid is high, UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser said in a note to clients. Wal-Mart said it would pay around $3 billion in cash and $300 million in shares for Jet, with some of that paid over time. Given Jet's revenue of about $500 million, the cash purchase price represents six times Jet's revenue, according to analysts. Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said the acquisition gives Wal-Mart a leg-up on competitors in the race to be the No. 2 online retailer, citing the size of Jet.com's online offerings and number of customers. Wal-Mart said Jet has added nearly 400,000 new shoppers monthly. "The impact on Amazon will be fairly benign. However, this acquisition, in tandem with its joint-venture in China with JD.com, demonstrates that Walmart is attacking online retail with significant zeal," he said. In June, Wal-Mart said it sold its Chinese online grocery store in return for a stake in JD.com Inc, China's 2 e-commerce firm. BILLIONS SPENT ON ONLINE EFFORTS Wal-Mart's first-quarter online sales grew 7 percent, a weaker rate than any of the four quarters just before that. In 2015, Wal-Mart's online sales rose 12.3 percent to $13.7 billion, compared with a 16 percent jump to $92.4 billion for Amazon.com. Wal-Mart has not said what it spent on acquisitions, but prior to the Jet.com deal it disclosed a total of $3.1 billion for e-commerce and digital projects, such as its platform and new warehouses, in the four fiscal years to January 2017. The deal should give Wal-Mart the scale to bolster its online presence, broaden its assortment of goods and offer the lowest prices at the same time, analysts said. Wal-Mart noted Jet has offered 12 million items in its first year of operation. Wal-Mart has said previously it wants to expand its online selection from around 10 million items to the tens of millions over the next few years. Rival Amazon has more than 200 million items for sale online. – Reuters Tags: Amazon | More Retail & Wholesale Stories The Big Boys Toys kicks off in Abu Dhabi TTM completes post-tensioning job for Qatari mall iPhady announces ‘White Friday’ sale Big Boys Toys returns bigger this year 15 win Middle East jewellery awards Dazzling Jewellery Arabia opens in Bahrain Cityland Mall signs up Carrefour as hypermarket operator Entertainer Bahrain 2017 now available at discounted price Huawei Mate 9 now available in UAE Dubai to host Olympus regional HQ Breitling launches Chronomat 44 Blacksteel Special Edition in Bahrain Bahrain mall project on track for 2017 launch Majid Al Futtaim unveils city centre revamp plan Souq.com to launch White Friday sale across GCC Dunkin’ Donuts opens new outlet in Dubai First Avenue signs up Carrefour as anchor tenant City Centre Deira re-launches ‘Break Time’ Marka Q3 revenue hits $17.9 million Juma Al Majid launches top European brand Samsung to buy connected tech firm Harman for $8bn Reem Mall inks partnership with Dubai Holding Group Alabbar, PIF to launch $1bn e-commerce venture UAE tops in consumer confidence in region Smartphones driving global power bank market Porsche Design, KEF launch hi-fi audio systems Huawei MateBook now available in UAE Dubai Watch Week to see largest coordinated watch launch Majid Al Futtaim starts work on flagship Oman mall Emaar Malls nine-month net profit up 16pc Graff unveils stunning heart shape diamond Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Since March, land owner and Florida businessman Chad Henderson has been working to get residents on board. “We are taking their ideas into consideration, things like elevation, how the store would look and feel, things such as green space within the parking lot, landscape buffering between the store and the residential community next door,” Henderson said.  Henderson has met with members of the Canebrake Home Owners Association and held a pair of meetings in the neighborhood on Monday.  A private Facebook page, “Say no to Big Box Walmart West Hattiesburg on Cole Road” has gained over 1,400 members and even gives residents an avenue to sign a petition against the Walmart store. “This is nothing that has been recent, this has been an ongoing process,” Henderson said.  Henderson added that Walmart has been in a contract for roughly three years and has been working to be a fit in the community. Potential mayor of the proposed city of Bellevue, John Adcock, said he is opposed to the store. MOBILE USERS: View the Walmart plans here. “I am against having an 180,000 square feet big box directly next door to me, as I think most anybody would be,” Adcock said. “It has its place, but right next door to a neighborhood, and the most populated neighborhood in the community at that, it just does not go there.” Henderson added that changes to store hours, lighting in the parking lot, truck delivery times along with other things have been addressed with Walmart officials. “They have agreed to delivery times, agreed to increase landscaping, and landscape buffering, things that are well above the code,” Henderson said. “We are not looking to put tattoo shops, and bait shops, pawn shops, things like that." Chick-Fil-A and Starbucks are the types of stores that are being targeted to accompany Walmart, according to Henderson. Adcock added this one of the reasons that he and other citizens are pushing the city of Bellevue. “Right now that property is not zoned for an 180,000 square foot big box retailer, it is zoned the way that it is for a reason,” Adcock said. "You don’t go straight from big box type commercial to a neighborhood.” Henderson said they have missed the date to file any paperwork for the September Lamar County Planning Commission meeting, but added there is no set timeline. “This is something we are going to continue to work at and try to get people on board,” Henderson said.  Copyright 2016 WDAM.

The acquisition of Jet.com by Walmart for $3 billion in cash appears to have made the founder of IdeaDash an "accidental millionaire." Fortune reports: "Martin, who is the founder of a startup called IdeaDash, won Jet.com's nationwide marketing competition -- Jet Insider -- in early 2015. The contest offered a reward of 100,000 shares of Jet stock to the contestant who got the most people to sign up for 6-month free trial 'insider' memberships to the membership shopping site, a sort of online Costco or Sam's Club. According to his company's website, Martin took first place out of the 350,000 people who participated, getting over 8,000 people to sign up. Martin spent $18,000 on online ads, Bloomberg reports, and now has a stake in Jet that is reportedly worth millions. Although Martin told Bloomberg that he is not sure exactly what his stake is worth, Fusion reported in February 2015 that his piece could be valued between $10 million and $20 million." internet money news ← Related Links → Samsung Pay Hack Lets Attackers Make Fraudulent Payments Walmart Buys Jet For $3 Billion, Hopes To Turbo Charge Ecommerce Walmart Is Cutting 7,000 Jobs Due To Automation Linux Trojan Mines For Cryptocurrency Using Misconfigured Redis Servers This discussion has been archived.

Walmart De Mexico y Centroamerica, also known as Walmex, will sell Suburbia with its 119 stores and real estate for 15.7 billion pesos ($852 million) including debt of 1.4 billion pesos. Walmex will also receive an additional 3.3 billion pesos in items including declared dividends after the deal closes, it said in a statement. In January, the retailer said it was looking to sell Suburbia without giving a time frame for completing the sale. Some Mexican media outlets had speculated the sale could fetch as much as $2 billion. Liverpool is one of Mexico’s department store operators, with more than 100 outlets. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment. Walmart has been looking to double sales in Mexico by 2024 by boosting its core business of running discount retail and membership stores, and expanding its fresh food business. The divestiture is part of Walmart’s strategy, announced in 2013, to streamline and sell businesses not central to its overseas operations. Walmart’s international division, which contributes roughly one-third of the company’s total annual sales of nearly $480 billion, has divested some non-core businesses across Chile, Mexico and Canada in the past two years. In Mexico over the past three years, Walmex has sold its Vips restaurant chain to fast-food operator Alsea SAB for $626 million, and its Banco Walmart unit to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa for about $247 million. Walmart acquired Suburbia’s parent supermarket chain Cifra in 1997. Suburbia has 119 stores in 46 cities and is popular with urban shoppers, ranking among Mexico’s top five department stores, according to analysts. Suburbia, which is profitable, contributed 3 per cent to Walmex’s overall revenue in 2015. Walmex, Mexico’s biggest private sector employer and the country’s largest retailer, posted sales of about $26.35 billion in 2015. At the company’s shareholder’s meeting in June, David Cheesewright, head of Walmart’s overseas division, singled out the Mexican market as a top priority. Mexico has Walmart’s largest number of stores outside the United States. Walmart has struggled in overseas markets, including Britain and China, but Walmex has remained a bright spot with second-quarter revenue growing 11.5 per cent to about $6.93 billion.   Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Ratan Tata's ego caused financial mess for group firms: Cyrus Mistry Demonetisation: Problem of plenty for RBI as banks park record Rs 4.32 lakh crore Demonetisation: Union Minister latest victim as hospital declines to accept old notes Supreme Court refuses to stay petitions against demonetisation No transaction charges on debit card payments: Govt More From Current Affairs U.S. factory, consumer sentiment data brighten economic outlook Dow hits record; U.S. yields, dollar at multi-year highs Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower Toyota aims to sell more hybrid cars in India Russia still working on how to freeze oil output ahead of OPEC talks [ more ] Top Stories ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster F C Kohli debunks Mistry's TCS sale claim SBI cuts bulk deposit rates by 1.25-1.9% [ more ] Markets ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Fall below 7,900 could take Nifty to 7,500-7,600 levels Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod Sesame output likely to fall 40% due to unfavourable climate Impact of demonetisation largely priced in: Ridham Desai [ more ] Companies Start-ups gear up to raise fresh funds under liberalised ECB regime Wadia sends third notice to Tata Sons Mistry knows where all the bodies are buried in Tata Group: Kumar Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster F C Kohli debunks Mistry's TCS sale claim [ more ] Opinion Gujarat Gas results set off downgrades Expect lower growth at Eicher Reliance Industries valuation at 10-yr low Don't revive inspector raj Resolving a disagreement [ more ] Latest News Start-ups gear up to raise fresh funds under liberalised ECB regime ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Fall below 7,900 could take Nifty to 7,500-7,600 levels Finders can't be keepers Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod [ more ] Today's Paper Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster Zara's recipe for success: More data, fewer bosses Debit card charges dropped, farmers to get easier cash access We should have 5 million customers by 2020: David Mcmillan, Aviva Europe Pakistan's jihad makers [ more ] News you can use Demonetisation: Stricter norms for NRIs Spread equity investments over three-four months Deposits above Rs 2.5 lakh: Don't panic if you receive the I-T notice Expect your household budget to shoot up: Going cashless comes at a cost Opportunities amid chaos New Balance created its PR crisis.

(Photo: Brian Cahn /Zuma Press/Newscom) The decision by the seniors group AARP to drop its membership in an influential legislative reform coalition is the latest example of the left’s successful pressure on corporations and other organizations to disown the group. “People should be concerned when any group believes solutions come from intimidation rather than discussion,” @ALEC_states says. As of December, according to the liberal website SourceWatch.org, “at least 108 corporations and 19 nonprofits” announced cutting ties with the American Legislative Exchange Council in the previous five years. Among those listed as parting ways with ALEC: Coca-Cola Co., Blue Cross Blue Shield, Johnson & Johnson, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, and Hewlett-Packard Co. “A great silencing is taking place across America,” ALEC spokesman Bill Meierling told The Daily Signal. “All people should be deeply concerned when any group believes solutions come from intimidation rather than discussion.” Of all the organizations in the conservative movement that have antagonized the left during the Obama presidency, this one stands out. The American Legislative Exchange Council is a nonprofit, nonpartisan network of state lawmakers, policy analysts, and private sector leaders that advances model legislation with an eye toward free market policy solutions. The organization that became known as ALEC grew out of informal meetings of conservative activists in Chicago during autumn 1973. Forty-three years later, the exchange council includes “nearly one-quarter of the country’s state legislators and stakeholders from across the policy spectrum,” according to its website. ALEC now has a long history of successfully promoting local and state legislation built on the constitutional principles of limited government, the free market, and federalism. While the exchange council has attracted both positive attention and negative scrutiny since its founding, well-funded, well-organized opponents on the left have made a concerted effort over the past five years to marginalize, discredit, and defund it. As previously reported by The Daily Signal, eight of the Senate’s most liberal Democrats also targeted ALEC last month in a letter to national and state-based think tanks and policy organizations demanding to know the names of donors. Conservative policy analysts and think tank leaders who are familiar with the assault on ALEC have some insight. A critical turning point came after the 2010 midterm elections, they say, when left-leaning lawmakers lost ground in statehouses across the country, making it possible for ALEC’s proposals to become policy at an accelerated pace. Matthew Vadum is a senior vice president at Capital Research Center, which investigates the “aims and activities of left-liberal special interest groups.” Vadum said he suspects that because ALEC worked successfully to “frame the debate” during the Obama presidency, it aroused the ire of liberal groups such as Common Cause. Those groups now see some of their most prized policy achievements in danger of losing their grip at the local and state levels, he said. Protesters march through a residential neighborhood in Phoenix on Nov. 30, 2011, on their way to picket the American Legislative Exchange Council during ALEC’s meeting at the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa. (Photo: Jack Kurtz/ZumaPress/Newscom) Obamacare and Voter ID After President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, into law in March 2010, ALEC “sprang into action” and “drafted model legislation aimed at blocking states from enforcing the new health insurance monstrosity,” Vadum noted in a research paper. In November 2011, ALEC published its “State Lawmakers Guide to Repealing Obamacare.” At least 10 states took up ALEC’s model proposal to block the federal health care law by 2013, Vadum wrote. But what rankled the left above all else is the exchange council’s commitment to passing voter identification laws as a safeguard against voter fraud, he says. Two opponents, The Nation magazine and the Center for Media and Democracy, have led the charge against ALEC for the past five years. Founded in 1865, The Nation describes itself as providing a progressive outlook on political and cultural questions. Its print circulation peaked at 187,000 in 2006; by 2010 it had dropped to 145,000. The Center for Media and Democracy is a left-leaning investigative journalism outfit based in Madison, Wisconsin, that describes itself as a watchdog on the use of public relations by corporations and political figures. The center, founded in 1993 by progressive Wisconsin writer John Stauber, publishes SourceWatch, PR Watch, and BanksterUSA. In July 2011, the magazine and the center partnered on a series of articles highlighting ALEC’s model bills and emphasizing its connections with the Koch brothers and their companies, organizations, and foundations. Charles and David Koch, wealthy entrepreneurs and philanthropists, drew the left’s ire by organizing contributions to libertarian and conservative causes and candidates. The Nation’s first article on ALEC called the Koch brothers the exchange council’s “billionaire benefactors.” The left’s opposition to laws requiring voters to produce photo identification figures prominently in the articles. One, for example, says ALEC is “peddling ‘Voter ID’ laws to disenfranchise voters.” The Center for Media and Democracy operates a website called ALEC Exposed, also dating to July 2011, that focuses on ALEC’s funding sources and policy proposals. The site criticizes corporations and nonprofits that support ALEC. Mark Holden, senior vice president and general counsel of Koch Industries Inc., shakes that off. “We support ALEC and the work it is doing on criminal justice reform legislation, protecting free speech, and promoting policies that remove barriers to opportunity for all Americans, especially the least advantaged,” Holden said in an email to The Daily Signal. ‘Seek to Silence’ The pressure tactics appear to have met with considerable success. As of December, according to the Center for Media and Democracy’s SourceWatch.org, “at least 108 corporations and 19 nonprofits—for a total of 127 private sector members—have publicly announced that they cut ties with the American Legislative Exchange Council.” Four of the 127 returned to ALEC, according to the website, but the left continues to claim new scalps such as AARP. ALEC declined to comment on membership details or the exchange council’s success rate in state legislatures, saying opponents exploit the information. Kevin Kane, president of Pelican Institute for Public Policy, a free market think tank based in New Orleans, said the anti-ALEC campaign is undermining free speech and the free exchange of ideas. “There has been an important tactical shift in the campaign against ALEC and other organizations that do not toe the line on certain policy issues,” Kane told The Daily Signal. “Many organizations on the left are no longer content to engage in a debate over the issues, instead they seek to silence opponents by convincing donors and sponsors that certain policy positions are beyond the pale and therefore unworthy of consideration.” In an email, Kane added: This creates an environment where policymakers and citizens are less likely to be exposed to a wide range of arguments over important policy questions. Organizations like Pelican Institute do not benefit from this development, but the real losers in this campaign are policymakers and their constituents, who are denied the many benefits that flow from robust and open debate over important policy questions. Pelican Institute, part of the State Policy Network, a coalition of state-based think tanks, sometimes partners with ALEC on legislative proposals. Jo Ann Jenkins, chief executive officer of AARP, speaks May 2, 2016, during the Milken Institute Global Conference at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo: Javier Rojas/ZumaPress/Newscom) AARP ‘Decides Not to Renew‘ Most recently, liberal advocacy groups succeeded in pressuring AARP, the nation’s most powerful organization of older Americans, to drop its affiliation with ALEC. AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, announced Aug. 4 it would not continue membership. In a letter that same day to Jo Ann Jenkins, chief executive officer of AARP, liberal groups accused the exchange council of pushing for policy changes that harm senior citizens. “AARP’s support of ALEC is antithetical to your mission to fight for the issues that matter most to families—such as health care, employment, and income security,” the letter to Jenkins said. The letter, which called on the seniors organization to withdraw from the exchange council, was signed by the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; the Center for Media and Democracy; Social Security Works; and ClimateTruth.org, among other groups. “After hearing from many of you, we’ve decided not to renew our membership to ALEC,” AARP said in a post that evening on its Facebook page. Politico broke the news. The liberal organizations’ letter to AARP’s Jenkins said in part: By partnering with ALEC, you have allowed it to use the powerful AARP brand to lend credibility to legislation harmful to seniors that is introduced in statehouses across the country. ALEC has been at the forefront of protecting drug companies and their ability to charge unreasonable prices, has been a strong advocate against the Affordable Care Act and has opposed Medicaid expansion, forcing lower-income retirees to make terrible choices between paying medical bills and buying groceries. … ALEC also blocks action on climate change, causing irreparable harm to the world we will leave our children and grandchildren. ALEC has spearheaded calls for a dangerous Article V convention to enact a federal balanced budget amendment that would ultimately gut critical programs for seniors like Social Security, Medicare and the Older Americans Act. ALEC has also spent years pushing the dismantling of retirement security for older Americans by promoting the elimination of defined benefit pensions and the privatization of Social Security, at least in part, in favor of risky investment accounts. ‘Contemptible Betrayal’ “AARP should be ashamed and embarrassed at its action in withdrawing from ALEC,” Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. He added: This is another sign of how much the progressive left wants to silence anyone who disagrees with them on matters of public policy. Their basic betrayal of the tenets of the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment is disgraceful—and AARP’s going along with this censorship is contemptible. Meierling, vice president of public affairs for the American Legislative Exchange Council, told The Daily Signal that left-leaning activist groups are working to silence organizations such as ALEC that hold alternative views on public policy. “ALEC members represent many millions of retired Americans and work on issues such as health care, employment, and income security—key AARP issues,” Meierling said, adding: All seniors benefit when their issues are discussed openly and with as many decision makers and stakeholders as possible. It is a shame that under the banner of good government, activists groups such as the Center for Media and Democracy would pressure any organization out of the free exchange of ideas. “The left succeeded in pressuring AARP to disassociate itself from ALEC by using the same smears and pressure tactics it has long used in its jihad against ALEC,” Capital Research Center’s Vadum said in an email to The Daily Signal. “Here the left claimed ALEC hates minorities and elderly people because it backed electoral integrity laws like photo ID requirements that combat election fraud,” he said. “It’s an absurd argument but it’s been quite effective in hitting ALEC in the pocketbook.” Vadum also argues that ALEC receives relatively little support from foundations and no government grants, according to tax filings. That contrasts with the National Conference of State Legislatures, its “left-wing counterpart,” he said, which “relies heavily on taxpayer funding.” Ken McIntyre contributed to this report.  It has been modified to correct the period during which SourceWatch counted organizations that left ALEC.

Penney, Macy's, Nordstrom and others all made their investors very happy, but there were still reasons to be cautious. Brian Sozzi Aug 12, 2016 3:20 PM EDT Wall Street may have largely cheered the first round of second-quarter retail earnings this week (Target  (TGT) and Walmart  (WMT) report next week), but the underlying numbers suggest many players continue to struggle with the shift to online shopping and tepid U.S. consumer spending.   The struggles were front and center in the latest government retail sales data. Retail sales in July were unchanged following an upwardly revised 0.8% gain in June, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales were also unchanged last month after rising 0.5% in June. While sales at department stores fell 0.5% in the month, sales at non-store retailers -- which includes mostly online merchants such as Amazon (AMZN) but also catalogs -- increased 1.3%.  TheStreet takes a brief look at the second-quarter performances from the country's major bricks-and-mortar retailers and the bold steps some are taking to improve their financial fortunes. 1. J.C. Penney (JCP) Thanks to J.C. Penney emphasizing affordable apparel and shoe prices in its marketing, and stocking stores with cheap private-label goods such as St. John's Bay under CEO Marvin Ellison, it was able to crush most of its rivals during the quarter. J.C. Penney's second-quarter same-store sales rose 2.2%, relatively in line with Wall Street forecasts. Gains were achieved in all months of the quarter, Ellison told analysts on a call. Top-performing businesses included Sephora cosmetics, home goods, footwear and handbags, while online sales also rose. Customer traffic increased, bucking the continued declines being felt across the bricks-and-mortar retail space. The company expects its same-store sales to strengthen in the second half of the year compared to the first six months, as it benefits from the roll-out of appliances, flooring and new Sephora locations. Excluding one-time items, J.C. Penney's adjusted loss tallied 5 cents a share. Analysts expected a loss of 15 cents a share. The company reiterated its full-year same-store sales growth target of 3% to 4% and expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $1 billion. "We feel really good about the trajectory of our business. The onus is on the retailer to give people reasons to shop," said Ellison during an analyst conference call. Talk about putting down a challenge to its industry peers.

The incident was reported shortly after 3 p.m. Friday at a WalMart parking lot in Helotes (hel-OH’-tis), a San Antonio suburb. Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges says the child’s father is employed at the store and told officers that he forgot to drop the child off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m. When he got off work about 3 p.m., he found his child dead. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains. No charges have been filed. Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees in the area much of the afternoon.

The latest retail giant hoping that shrinking will lead to bigger profits is Macy's. On Thursday, it announced it would close 100 of its full-line department stores next year. It hasn't released yet which Macy's will close, but said profitability at most of the targeted stores has been “declining steadily in recent years.” Even though the retailer saw second quarter sales and profits fall from a year ago, it's stock price jumped on the prospect of fewer stores leading to higher profits in the future. Gap, Sears, Staples and Walmart are among those retailers who have previously announced store closings. They also are among the store operators scheduled to release their latest quarterly results in the week ahead. It's too early to see any significant financial impact of fewer stores, but long-term investors should listen for clues as to progress on the strategy of going smaller for bigger profits. The retail reduction knows no bounds. It has cut across traditional categories. Sports Authority is no more. Coach is closing a quarter of its stores. And the oldest Sear's, open for 90 years on Chicago's north side, closes this month. It’s been a mixed year for retail stock shareholders. The biggest and best performing retail stock in the S&P 500 stock index is Amazon.com. While its margins put it line with other brick and mortar retailers, it need not worry about the performance of storefronts pinching profits.

Deborah Gomez, of Northlake, Ill., and her husband, Adolfo Gomez, were arrested in June that year after police found two of their children, ages 5 and 7 at the time, blindfolded and bound with duct tape outside of a vehicle in a Lawrence Wal-Mart parking lot. The couple were located inside the store with a shopping cart that contained two more rolls of duct tape, two tarps and a softball bat. The couple said at the time that they were traveling from Illinois to Arizona because they believed the world was coming to an end and their family home in Illinois was possessed by demons. Douglas County Sheriff's Office Adolfo and Deborah Gomez, of Northlake, Ill., were arrested June 13, 2012, after two of their children were found bound by their hands and feet in a Lawrence Wal-Mart parking lot. The children were later found to be "Children in Need of Care" and taken into state custody. Both parents later pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges of endangering a child. Adolfo Gomez also was convicted and sentenced on two felony counts of child abuse. Deborah Gomez served approximately six months in jail before she was released. Two years later, in October 2014, the state filed a motion to terminate the couple's parental rights with all four of their children, including three daughters and a son. Among other factors, prosecutors noted that they had convictions in Kansas for endangering children, and both had prior convictions on similar charges in another state. After a trial in 2015, Douglas County District Judge Peggy Kittel granted the motion. Both parents appealed that decision, but Adolfo Gomez's appeal was thrown out on procedural grounds. Deborah Gomez claimed that the evidence was insufficient to prove she was an unfit mother, and that she had ineffective counsel. While her appeal was pending, the oldest of the four children reached the age of majority. The youngest child is now 9 or 10, based on the year of birth listed in the opinion. One of the children eventually moved to Arizona to live with other family there, but the other children remained in Kansas. During trial on the state's motion, Christina Maki, the family's initial case manager, testified that Deborah Gomez had moved back to Arizona after her release and that she had family and a support system there. Sagan Smith, a subsequent case manager, testified that Deborah Gomez had successfully completed many of the case plan's expectations, and that she returned to Kansas for monthly supervised visits with two of the children here. Other case managers testified that Deborah Gomez had moved back to Kansas in the spring of 2014. But the foster mother of two of the children and other social service officials testified that they did not believe Gomez was ready to resume her role as a parent. In a 20-page unpublished opinion, which only refers to the parties by their initials, or as "Mother" and "Father," a three-judge panel of the Kansas Court of Appeals rejected Gomez's arguments and upheld the District Court's decision. "There is clear and convincing evidence Mother was not presently fit and able to care for the Children and would not be able to care for the Children in the foreseeable future," the panel said.

Living in a Cincinnati, Ohio, suburb, it is rare to be able to visit Pittsfield where I grew up, let alone be there on the July 4 weekend. I had dinner with friends and visited homes where we lived. Much had changed, so much had not. A key reason for stopping was to honor my friend Jim Shulman for his work bringing the Berkshire Carousel to fruition. He is a historical visionary who sees an opportunity to enhance Pittsfield's image and bring new visitors to the city center. What had not changed, however, was the lack of vision of city leaders. I listened to friends who still call Pittsfield home speak of providing prime real estate from the General Electric plant site for a proposed Walmart Supercenter. There is no vision there. Why more retail especially on this property that will siphon business from existing stores? Pittsfield's leadership history of being visionary is a zero. From the 1960s, it was always worried General Electric would be slighted if they sought new industry. GE opened the door, walked out and left a mess. City Councils from that period had no idea what type of "industry" should be sought. Today, new industry is not manufacturing. The city has squandered state funds provided to bring in business with zero success. By vision, I mean what kind of businesses makes sense for the city to market itself as a potential home today? Hi-tech? Startups need low-cost space and cost-of-living found in a place like Pittsfield. What about engineering companies? Same answer. How about financial services, advertising, marketing? When presented with the prospect of living in a great small city but only two hours from clients on the I-95 beltway of Boston it might be very enticing. Startups have moved from California to Cincinnati because there is a concentration of available labor and low cost of living. Long-term vision, a new Walmart? The business community and City Council must think differently. I know there is much castigating of GE for what it left behind. Has anyone thought to call CEO Jeff Immelt and ask him to consider placing a facility such as I mentioned on the old property? You could even give the company some of the land back, no charge. GE is advertising it is a technology company that happens to manufacture stuff. The city needs to make a business decision instead of a knee-jerk decision, and tell them it's time to change.

Aug. 12 2016 5:02 PM Hostess, Following Its Customers’ Lead, Now Makes Frozen Deep-Fried Twinkies By Erik Sherman   Nonfried, nonfrozen, normal Hostess Twinkies at a grocery on Dec. 11, 2012, in Chicago. Scott Olson/Getty Images This post originally appeared on Inc. As Apple has found, having to scramble for your next big hit can be dangerous. There’s the chance that interest in the old cash cow starts to drop without something else to take up the difference. Advertisement You can try to encourage innovation, or sometimes you can see it elsewhere and get on the bandwagon. In the case of Hostess, it only took 14 years. Get Slate in your inbox. The company has started to sell its first frozen product: deep-fried Twinkies, as the Associated Press reported. If that sounds familiar, it should. Deep-fried Twinkies have been a staple of so-called fair food, the treats served at county and state fairs, since at least 2002, where it was invented in Brooklyn, according to the New York Times. Here's how the paper described it: Something magical occurs when the pastry hits the hot oil. The creamy white vegetable shortening filling liquefies, impregnating the sponge cake with its luscious vanilla flavor (sure, it’s imitation, but nevertheless potent). The cake itself softens and warms, nearly melting, contrasting with the crisp, deep-fried crust in a buttery and suave way. The shop adds its own ruby-hued berry sauce, which provides a bit of tart sophistication. Advertisement What you get from the Walmart (the only place selling them for the first three months) freezer aisle isn’t quite the same. Available in vanilla or chocolate, a box of seven running $4.76, they come partially fried. You finish them off in an oven, toaster, or frying pan. Hostess worked with Walmart, which suggested the idea and opened a food lab for development. By providing the opening exclusive (and, who knows?, maybe a cut of the profits), Hostess gets to bring a new old concept to market. According to the AP, the Hostess vice president of marketing said they had a “retro cool factor.” (If 2002 is really retro, I’m really depressed.) Most importantly, it’s a product whose general concept, if not exact execution, was not only developed by others but proven for 14 years in public trials. It should be market ready. And with each vanilla Twinkie running nine grams of fat and 220 calories, compared with the four grams of fat and 130 calories of the regular type, maybe Hostess can sell gym memberships afterward.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) Print Email Amy Kuperinsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Amy Kuperinsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 12, 2016 at 3:33 PM, updated August 12, 2016 at 4:37 PM comments You won't have to go to a summer carnival or a state fair to get your deep-fried Twinkies anymore.  Not if you can handle them frozen. Taking a cue from years of fair vendors plunging Twinkies into hot oil, Hostess is debuting frozen Deep Fried Twinkies at Walmart this summer.  Described on the box as "funnel cake battered sponge cake with creamy filling," the Twinkies are partially pre-fried and have to be heated in a toaster oven, oven or frying pan. The resulting dessert clocks in at 220 calories, 16 grams of sugar, 32 grams of carbohydrates and 9 grams of fat per serving — even 3 grams of protein.  It's the first time Hostess is selling a product in the freezer section. There's also chocolate Deep Fried Twinkies, which are chocolate flavored and filled with a chocolate cream. The rumors are true. You're welcome! #DeepFriedTwinkie https://t.co/nxlZcp60dC — Hostess Snacks (@Hostess_Snacks) August 12, 2016 John Pearson, a senior buyer for frozen foods at Walmart, says the company worked with Hostess to create the sweets "specifically for our customers" — to "fill a need," even, for more desserts in the frozen section. "I knew there was a desire to push the envelope on the products we offer," he wrote in a Walmart blog, saying the deep-fried snacks would be available in 4,000 Walmart stores by August 16.  Tweets gobbled up the Twinkie news as the latest punchline in the ever-expanding pool of jokes about the American diet and Chris Christie.  When you still have four more weeks of bathing suit season but Deep Fried Twinkies are trending... pic.twitter.com/1Plx0MlAF6 — Caitlin Green (@caitiegreen) August 12, 2016 One day we'll tell our children what it was like in the United States when men were free. #DeepFriedTwinkies 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/o1k8rkHTTY — Steven George (@MrStevenGeorge) August 12, 2016 They should've sent a poet. #DeepFriedTwinkies pic.twitter.com/cWQ1Smty6s — choppah (@iamchoppah) August 12, 2016 Now that Deep-Fried Twinkies have moved from the fair to the freezer, there is even less exercise involved in getting them. — Eric Schwartz (@ericschwartz) August 12, 2016 me after hearing about #deepfriedtwinkies pic.twitter.com/g0V4Y4jQZu — Madison (@GeishaPrncess) August 12, 2016 Hostess launches Deep Fried Twinkies and Chris Christie.... pic.twitter.com/gRkROPPhrs — Benny (@BRios82) August 12, 2016 I want to eat these #deepfriedtwinkies while watching the #Olympics — Vinnie Penn (@VinniePenn) August 12, 2016   Listen to the latest episode of our TV podcast Subscribe on iTunes Subscribe on Google Play Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Get Your Weekly Entertainment Guide TV recaps, movie and music reviews, local dining guides, and the latest in Atlantic City entertainment news delivered to your inbox!

Walmart Has A Not-So-Secret Food Lab To Develop New Products Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Has A Not-So-Secret Food Lab To Develop New Products Image courtesy of Nicholas Eckhart August 12, 2016 4:04 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup america's other test kitchen wal mart test kitchens food lab research and development What do frozen stuffed doughnut bites and prepared meals for the Paleo diet have in common? Not very much, other than they’re both coming to Walmart store shelves soon after being developed and tested in the mega-chain’s new test kitchens and sensory lab, which the company uses before launching new products from its suppliers. The lab is in the company’s headquarters in Bentonville, AR, and the Associated Press paid a visit and told us what’s inside. The 10 test kitchens in the facility include a big fancy chef’s kitchen, kitchens that resemble more humble facilities that home cooks use, and also kitchens for testing new store-made products that are identical to the facilities in stores’ delis and bakeries. The sensory labs are meant for company employees and customer volunteers to test new products before they hit shelves nationwide. (Our sibling publication, Consumer Reports, also has sensory lab and professional tasters, on whom we inflicted KFC’s Double Down six years ago, and new margarine formulas last year.) Food is important to Walmart: about 56% of its sales come from Supercenter grocery and grocery-only Neighborhood Markets. House-brand products are an important part of that, too, to appeal to budget-conscious consumers and also keep suppliers on their toes.

What is this ? X What is this? Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen People in the tiny village of Elgin, N.B., are devastated at the news the Elgin Country Market is closing — the general store has been a focal point in the community for more than 70 years. “Just not enough support, I am just tired of trying to pay the bills” owner April Steeves said Friday about why the market is closing. Steeves has been running the general store in the village of about 500 people for 13 years. She says that business just isn’t what it used to be. Story continues below “Most people work in town, they buy their groceries at the Superstores and the Walmarts where it is dirt cheap and they just drive by [the market],” Steeves said. On Friday morning, the hugs were tight and the tears were flowing as the the news about the closure spread through the village. Steeves said it feels like the end of an era. Walking into the market is like taking a step back in time. Market-goers can buy everything from gas to groceries, hardware to fishing licenses. While business may be down, this Friday morning — like every Friday morning — Elgin’s wass packed with locals, all with their sweet tooth, in search of one special treat — the infamous sticky buns. “We probably have been coming here 25 years” said local resident Dot Hill. She and a group of about eight women gather at the market each week — they even have their own table. Dot says it’s where she and her friends connect and share stories. Built back in 1945, Elgin Country Market was a place where the locals would gather. Dot says she and the girls sit at one table, their husbands at another. “We have stories to tell and they have stories to tell, and maybe they don’t want to hear ours” she laughed. Dot’s husband Bob, who is also sad to see the store closing, says the market is a place where local memories are born and shared. “It’s really sad it sucks, like I put my blood sweat and tears into this place” Steeves said, adding the property is up for sale but she hasn’t had any takers yet. “It’s gonna be a ghost town, there is nothing else here.” The market will officially close on August 27.  Dot and the girls say they’re not sure if they’ll come the Friday before, as it will be too hard. She hopes someone will take over the market and carry on the life of the small-town gem. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment inc.

The AP reports Hostess, in collaboration with Walmart, is launching its own frozen line of Deep Fried Twinkies. The treats come in vanilla and chocolate and need to be finished in the oven or toaster oven before eating. A Hostess executive says they have a "retro cool factor." They also have a retro health factor, with approximately double the fat and calories of a normal Twinkie. But CNN quotes a Walmart executive who says they're "so good they're worth the calories." Deep-fried Twinkies, which have been a staple at state fairs for years, will be Hostess' first entry into frozen foods.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   17% Hilarious 7% Intriguing 5% Depressing 30% Brilliant 13% Scary 29% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 47 comments Next on Newser: What Clinton's 2015 Taxes Show Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 47 comments TwoSheds Aug 13, 2016 6:15 AM CDT Too much work for People of Walmart http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/ MariCee Aug 13, 2016 5:38 AM CDT Disgusting!

New Jersey State Police  Sydney Pastor-Poe, 19, of Newton had been sought by State Police since she was seen on surveillance footage July 26 at the store on Route 206 in Hampton Township. State Police posted images on Aug. 3 asking for the public's help in locating her. She surrendered later that day. Pastor-Poe was charged with theft of mislaid property, State Police announced Wednesday. Police in Hunterdon County encountered a similar case last month. A 35-year-old Glen Gardner man said the $40 he allegedly removed from a lost wallet he later returned was a "finder's fee." He was also charged with theft of mislaid property.  Jeff Goldman may be reached at jeff_goldman@njadvancemedia.com.

Credit: thinkstock More like this The CVS go-it-alone app suffers from the pharma payment pain CurrentC mobile-payment pilot ends Walmart Pay vs. Apple Pay: Hardware age dictates all Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware CVS has announced CVS Pay inside its existing mobile app that allows customers to pay in store for prescriptions by scanning a barcode at the register. Payments will be backed by a customer’s credit or debit card, the company said Thursday. CVS Pay is currently available in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware; a nationwide rollout at all 9,600 stores is expected to kick off later this year. CVS doesn’t support Apple Pay or other NFC-based payment technologies, and its use of barcodes for payments is reminiscent of the way Starbucks customers pay for coffee. Working with the barcode technology was a faster way for CVS to bring forward technology for more convenient in-store payments, analysts said. Other retailers have created in-store payments through their own apps. Walmart created Walmart Pay in December to allow payments through mobile device QR codes that can be read at checkout registers. “There’s nothing really innovative here with CVS Pay,” said Gartner analyst Avivah Litan on Friday. “They are pretty much following the trend. It’s just mobile commerce with a credit card attached. It’s no big deal to put a credit card in a wallet.” At one point, CVS was working with Walmart and dozens of other major retailers in the Merchant Customer Exchange, which was designed to process mobile payments electronically through bank accounts and not credit cards to cut out the card processing cost that merchants paid to banks. But MCX ended its pilot of its mobile app, CurrentC, in June. Analysts have predicted the concept will not continue.

(Photo contributed by Hostess) For the longest time, deep-fried Twinkies were a delicacy you could find and enjoy at state fairs and possibly well-equipped kitchens. But now, Hostess is allowing Twinkie fans to enjoy the 86- year-old pastry from the comfort of their own home. Hostess announced today, Friday, Aug. 12, that Deep Fried Twinkies will be available in the frozen food section at Walmart for the next three months, and after that will be available at other stores, according to the Associated Press. The treats come in two flavors: chocolate and vanilla. And the best part is, making Deep Fried Twinkies at home is a piece of cake (if you will). Just pull it out of the freezer and bake for six to eight minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. You can also use a toaster oven at 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or deep fry them for two-and-a-half to three minutes. However, the question remains: will the frozen Deep Fried Twinkies match up to their freshly-fried state fair counterparts? Only you can decide!

The committee was launched last year to investigate the Obama administration's response to the Benghazi attacks that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. The investigation has widened in recent months to focus on Clinton's use of a private email account and server. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (Susan Walsh) Print Email Shannon Young | syoung@repub.com By Shannon Young | syoung@repub.com masslive.com Follow on Twitter on August 12, 2016 at 12:44 PM comments Although Hillary Clinton pledged to remove herself from the Clinton foundation's business while serving as secretary of state, CNN reported Friday that her former State Department chief of staff conducted job interviews for candidates seeking a top position at the non-profit. The new outlet's investigation, which comes in the wake of controversial emails between State Department and Clinton Foundation officials, further raises questions into the relationship between the federal agency and non-profit. According to CNN, Cheryl Mills, while working as Clinton's chief of staff, traveled to New York City in June 2012 to interview two high-level business executives -- reportedly from Pfizer and WalMart -- in an effort to help the Clinton Foundation find a new leader. Mills' attorney stressed that her work for the non-profit was voluntary, adding that she received no payment for the work and did not use government dollars to finance the trip -- claims which Clinton's Democratic presidential campaign echoed, CNN reported. "Cheryl volunteered her personal time to a charitable organization, as she has to other charities," campaign spokesman Brian Fallon told the news outlet. "Cheryl paid for her travel to New York City personally, and it was crystal clear to all involved that this had nothing to do with her official duties. The idea that this poses a conflict of interest is absurd." A State Department spokesman, meanwhile, told CNN that "federal employees are permitted to engage in outside personal activities, within the scope of the federal ethics rules. " Mills left the board of the Clinton Foundation when Clinton became secretary of state to serve as her chief of staff. She has since returned to the board while running her own business, according to CNN.
