(NYSE:WMT) has announced to review its merchandise procured from a major textile supplier after its rival Target Corporation also severs ties. The company says that it is analyzing Welspun India Ltd.’s cotton certification records after Target pulled back all its cotton sheets over Egyptian cotton dispute. Target had claimed that the supplier sent counterfeit Egyptian cotton sheets. Wal-Mart has now joined its competitor in scrutinizing Welspun over concerns that the Indian textile manufacturing giant may have sent in cheaper bed sheets that it marketed and passed off as premium Egyptian version. The longer fiber cotton dubbed as Egyptian forms a softer thread compared to other types of cotton. It is also sold at a much higher price, owing to its premium status and higher quality. The retail giant has plans to undertake further talks with the supplier to see how it can handle any issues discovered appropriately. While Target is the second largest customer for Welspun, Wal-Mart happens to be the third largest. Target announced last week that it has ended all business with the supplier and halted the sale of all pillow cases and bed sheets from both, its outlets and online platforms, after its investigation confirmed fears of deception. Because the two retailers are one of its largest customers, any business lost from them is badly going to affect the supplier’s sales for the year. Target generated almost $90 million of the company’s total annual sales for the year 2016 that ended in March. It ascribed to nearly 10% of the total sales made for the year. Bed Bath & Beyond on the other hand is the supplier’s largest customer and along with Walmart, it markets and sells Crowning Touch sheets online.At this time, the supplier has been talking about being on track to reach its goal of $2 billion in top line by the year 2020. If Walmart’s investigation confirms cotton being counterfeit, it may lose business with the retail giant. This makes its long-term goal quite a challenge to achieve. It is also likely that other customers such as BBBY may also begin raising questions over Welspun’s supplies. The company is currently making rugs, sheets, towels, and carpets for nearly 18 of world’s best 30 retailers. Hence, the litigation battle with Target combined with Wal-Mart’s scrutiny has pushed the stock of Welspun India—one of the largest textile manufacturers in the world—to slump by 36% in just two days at the Indian Mumbai stock exchange. According to Bloomberg, the two-day slide worth 36% is the worst the company has ever been stooped down since 1999. It has brought its market cap to just $990 million (66.2 billion rupees), down from over $1300 million just the week before. Welspun is part of a conglomerate worth $3 billion that is currently led by Balkrishan Goenka having interests and business that spans a multitude of industries such as energy, pipes, textiles, steel, and physical infrastructure. The company claims to have made “every fifth towel” that is marketed and sold in America. Its list of competitors includes apparel retailers such as Macy’s Inc. and J C Penney Company Inc. The textile giant hopes to become one of top 50 Indian industrial groups in market value in four years. As the company faces backlash from two of its largest customers, it has itself begun the review of its supply chain and quality control departments. It has hired one of the “big four” accounting and audit firms to analyze this process. The company has engaged with key customers to cooperate with them if anymore issues arise. Wal-Mart Can’t Afford Inventory Slipups The retail giant recently released upbeat results for second quarter (2Q) at time when it appear to be on track to recovery, it cannot afford to see any inventory mishaps over quality issues. Comparable store sales growth for the 2Q came in at 1.6% as opposed to its own forecast of 1%. The boost has led to a two-year stacked growth rate of 3.1%, up from 2.1% growth in 1Q of fiscal 2016. Sam’s Club reported comps growth of 0.6% (without fuel), which was in line with guidance of “slightly positive.” The 1.6% increase in US comps comprised 1.2% traffic growth, slightly down from 1.5% in the 1Q, but flat at 2.5% when measured on a two-year stacked basis. Average ticket also improved growing 0.4% from the 0.5% decline in the 1Q of fiscal 2016. This is the eighth consecutive positive comps increase for Walmart US and seventh consecutive positive traffic increase. Inventory continues to be a major focus for Walmart US and as it sees material improvement, the company should focus on its quality control so as to ensure high-quality products reach its end consumers. Hence, the investigation lies aligned with the retailer’s goal of offering the best at the most affordable price while keeping customer satisfaction on an upward trend.

Rachel Aldrich Aug 23, 2016 9:41 AM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Walmart (WMT) were advancing in early-morning trade on Tuesday after the company began reviewing records for Welspun India, one of its bedsheet suppliers, Bloomberg reports. Walmart is investigating claims that the supplier has been selling cheaper bedsheets as premium Egyptian cotton. Last week, Target (TGT) pulled its Welspun products from shelves after discovering they were mislabeled. Target has terminated all business with the Indian supplier. Welspun manufactures one out of every five towels sold in the U.S. and sells to major customers like J.C. Penney (JCP) and Macy's (M), according to Bloomberg. Walmart will be looking into Welspun's cotton certification records. The Bentonville, AR-based retail giant plans to wait on further discussions with the supplier and will "handle it appropriately" if issues are uncovered, according to a spokesperson cited by Bloomberg. Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. TheStreet Ratings rated this stock as a "buy" with a ratings score of B+. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, increase in net income, revenue growth, good cash flow from operations and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows low profit margins.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Not only is Walmart home to some truly odd creatures, but, it turns out, the big box retailer sells plenty of weird gadgets, too. We bought a few to see if they’re any good. I don’t mean weird in the sense that there are VCRs still sitting on store shelves (although I wouldn’t be surprised to find a location selling them). We scoped out the kind of technology any normal consumer would avoid, but for some reason Walmart still sells. Speakers that blast water to the beat? Reece’s-themed headphones? A $15 handheld camera that records Full HD? These are the type of gadgets you’d expect to find at a garage sale in the middle of nowhere. There is so much good (and affordable) technology out there (including at Walmart) that it’s almost offensive Walmart tries to hock these gadgets. As you might have guessed, a camera that’s just $15 isn’t very good (or very functional), and Reece’s-themed headphones shouldn’t be your go-to during a long commute. If you like a good bargain, indiscriminately choosing gadgets off the shelf at Walmart isn’t the smartest move. But we did it anyway, because why not? Check out the video above to see what we found.

The suspects used 10 motion picture $100 bills, according to authorities. Police say Sinquefield later returned the lawn equipment for cash at a different Walmart. Police: Cashier never returned to work According to authorities, Sinquefield confronted the cashier, Jocelyn Gerstenlauer, about an alleged personal debt prior to the purchase. Afterward, police say Sinquefield walked out of the store, which is when Taylor allegedly used the fake money to buy the equipment at Gerstenlauer's register.  Police say Gerstenlauer never returned to work after the fake money was found in her register.  Gerstenlauer turned herself into authorities around noon on August 23 and is being charged with first-degree forgery. She has since bonded out of jail. Sinquefield was booked into the Gwinnett County Jail on Thursday morning. She is charged with first-degree forgery, theft by deception and probation violation. Taylor is still wanted on charges of first-degree forgery and theft by deception.  Copyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

The largest U.S. electronics retailer also raised its fiscal-year earnings outlook and reported a surprise increase in sales at stores open at least a year. The results bucked a string of weak performances in the electronics category by competitors like Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and reflected Best Buy's resilience against larger online rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Best Buy reported a nearly 24 percent increase in online sales, whose share of domestic revenue has risen to 10.6 percent from 8.6 percent a year earlier. It said it benefited from faster shipping and improvements in the checkout process and search functionality. "Given the heavily promotional July environment due to Amazon's Prime Day and Walmart's steady diet of competing offers, Best Buy's online results stand out," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said. He estimated the company's online business at about $5 billion. Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said that along with e-commerce investments, the retailer is focusing on improving employee retention and training "with a heightened focus on product knowledge and selling skills." During the second quarter ended on July 30, demand at Best Buy increased for items like home theaters and large appliances, categories where Target and Wal-Mart typically do not have a significant market share, according to analysts. Sales declined for mobile phones and gaming, where those rivals have a sizeable presence. Mobile phone sales have fallen industrywide due to a dearth of new products. Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said he expected demand to increase this quarter and next as scheduled product introductions draw consumers. Apple Inc's APPL.O long-awaited iPhone 7 is set for availability next month. Last week, Target blamed its poor performance in part on lower sales of electronics due to a drop in demand for Apple products. Excluding special items, Best Buy's second-quarter earnings of 57 cents per share beat the analysts' average forecast of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose slightly to $8.53 billion from a year earlier, snapping a three-quarter streak of declines and exceeding analysts' estimates of $8.40 billion. Sales at established stores increased 0.8 percent. Analysts had expected a 0.60 percent decline, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Best Buy said it expected low-single-digit percentage growth in fiscal-year operating income, compared with a previous forecast of "approximately flat" results. The company gave a third-quarter profit and revenue outlook roughly in line with analysts' estimates.

Morgan got to sit in the passenger seat of a Wal Mart 18-wheeler, and take a ride from the hospital all the way to the Clinton Wal Mart, flanked by Jackson Police. He helped to kick off a special campaign. The Children's Miracle Network is teaming with Batson Hospital and Wal Mart stores to conduct "Champion Child" patient transports. It's a great break for the children and Morgan says the trip was wonderful.  "I was talking to the driver about how he said he had been driving the truck for 45 years, and he's been to a lot of different Wal Marts, like in Pearl and Texas," Jordan said. Jordan's mother, Deborah Morgan, says it's been a big day for her son and she's proud of him.  Copyright 2016 MSNewsNow. All rights reserved.

With no truly compelling new device or essential piece of tech on the market for months, consumer electronics sales have been underwhelming. This is one of the reasons Target gave to explain declining sales: Electronics sales were down, with sales of Apple tech dipping a steep 20% in the second quarter of 2016. Given the “challenging environment” depicted by Target, most analysts were expecting Best Buy to post similarly poor earnings results this week. “Declining sales present a more formidable headwind,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter wrote recently of Best Buy, according to Investor’s Business Daily. “The expectations [for Best Buy] are muted partly because people are buying fewer consumer electronics,” the Wall Street Journal explained mere hours before the retailer released second quarter earnings. When the company did post surprisingly strong earnings on Tuesday, its stock price immediately shot up more than 15%. How did Best Buy do it? Well, part of the reason for Best Buy’s surging stock price is that expectations had been so low. Analysts had anticipated a 0.6% decrease in same-store sales, making the 0.8% second quarter increase seem particularly impressive. And what seems to have most impressed investors is that Best Buy has managed to cut costs while figuring out a way to compete well with Amazon and Walmart, particularly in terms of online sales. Read Next: How Walmart Is Surviving the War Against Amazon—and Beating Target “We saw continued positive momentum in our online sales – delivering a second straight quarter of nearly 24% growth. We also continued to deliver cost savings and drive efficiencies in the business, a discipline that is critical to our ability to invest in our future,” Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said in a press release on Tuesday. “In what we characterize as a solid quarter, especially given the heavily-promotional July environment due to Amazon’s Prime Day and Walmart’s steady diet of competing offers, Best Buy’s online results really stand out,” said Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. While this is good news for Best Buy (and potentially, investors), the results indicate that Target’s struggles may be even worse than people think. Target has been facing the same formidably strong headwinds as Best Buy, including major discounting from Amazon and Walmart, and Target’s efforts to compete have been coming up short. Analysts say that Target’s e-commerce department have long lagged behind the competition, and that its recent 16% online sales increase was actually pretty weak in the grand scheme. While Best Buy long ago established itself as an electronics specialist, and it has been able to boost online sales thanks to competitive pricing, faster shipping, and better product reviews and service, Target has remained an all-purpose retailer that doesn’t really stand out as exceptional in any key category. Read Next: Amazon Has Upper-Income Americans Wrapped Around Its Finger The company recently admitted it is “sitting in the middle of no man’s land” with its poorly performing grocery section, as the stories groceries tend to be not as cheap as Aldi or Walmart, and not as high-quality as Whole Foods or Wegmans. It appears as if Target is essentially in no man’s land in terms of electronics sales, and online sales in general, too. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Anne D'Innocenzio, AP Retail Writer Leave a comment 62 reads People leave Target’s downtown Minneapolis corporate headquarters Tuesday, March 10, 2015. (AP Photo/Star Tribune, Glen Stubbe/File) NEW YORK (AP) _ Target Corp. cut its profit forecast and a key sales outlook Wednesday as it saw fewer customers in its stores and acknowledged it didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. The Minneapolis-based discounter’s second-quarter net income fell nearly 10 percent, though that was better than what most had expected. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.1 percent, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. Its main competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reports results Thursday. Target’s shares fell $4.74, or 6 percent, to $70.74 in afternoon trading. Customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half as Target struggled to get its grocery offerings right and shoppers looking for deals on essentials like detergent were turned off. Other issues, both company-specific and industrywide, ranged from a lack of new electronics for sale and lingering disruptions caused by the sale last year of its pharmacy business to CVS. Sales by markets also varied, with weakness on the East Coast but pockets of strength in California. “Our No. 1 focus is driving traffic back to our stores and accelerating business to our site,” Chief Executive Brian Cornell said. Target joins retailers such as department store chain Macy’s that are struggling with fewer customers coming in as shoppers buy more online. The bright spots in retail have been T.J. Maxx’s parent company TJX Cos. and Home Depot as consumers look for clothing bargains and focus more on their homes. Under Cornell, Target has been trying to reinvigorate itself restore its cheap-chic status after a series of headline-grabbing setbacks such as a 2013 data breach. It’s focusing on categories like fashion, home furnishings and wellness products, creating vignettes featuring home products and launching the children’s line Cat & Jack. But striking the right balance between stylish clothing and bedspreads while offering toothpaste and detergent at good prices has been tricky. “Our progress in apparel and home has been really significant,” said Cornell. “And we’ve got to make sure we never lose track of the other side of our brand promise and that’s the “Pay Less” side. And that’s all about those core household essentials that we have to make sure are presented effectively.” To boost sales and traffic, Target plans to increase marketing for its essentials and work with key vendors like Apple to push more innovation and to also improve presentations. Apple product sales were down 20 percent and the electronics department was a “significant drag,” Cornell said. Target is still struggling, however, to reinvent its food section _ an area where Wal-Mart is particularly strong. Grocery sales represent about 20 percent of Target’s total business but it has seen disappointing results from perishables like fruits and vegetables. Its nonperishable items have been doing well, and it’s marketing more organic, natural or gluten-free products. Yarbrough noted that Target faces stiff competition on the low end from Wal-Mart, which is focusing on lowering prices further, and at the high end from the likes of stores like Whole Foods and others. “Grocery is going to be more difficult to fix,” said Brian P. Yarbrough, a senior analyst at the Edward Jones investment firm, which downgraded Target’s stock to “hold” from a “buy” rating Wednesday. “They’re not a destination for food. They don’t offer a whole suite of products.” While nowhere near the online volume of Amazon, Target is expanding its online services. It’s doubling the number of stores that will be used to ship products directly to online shoppers’ homes, which will result in speedier deliveries. Online sales rose 16 percent in the second quarter, lower than the 23 percent gain in the first quarter. Target also is spending to modify some stores after an outcry from some customers about its policy of allowing transgender customers and staff to use the bathrooms that identifies with their gender identity. Chief financial officer Cathy Smith said the backlash hasn’t had a “material” impact on sales, but some customers are still upset. “We are listening to our guests,” she said. Target is investing $20 million in building single-stall bathrooms in stores. Target reported net income for the quarter of $680 million, or $1.16 per share. That compares with $753 million, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted per-share earnings were $1.23, beating projections of $1.14 from Wall Street, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue fell 7 percent to $16.2 billion. The company now expects earnings this year from $4.80 to $5.20 per share, lower than the $5.20 to $5.40 it had projected earlier. Same-stores sales could fall as much as 2 percent in the second half of the year, Target said. ____ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio on Twitter at http://www.Twitter.com/adinnocenzio ___ Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

He weighed in at 605 pounds, and his doctor basically told him his life was in serious danger. So Pat decided to make a change. He lived about one mile from a Walmart, and he decided that every time he was hungry, he’d walk to Walmart, buy food, walk home, cook it, and eat. Quote, “You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking six miles.” And after the walk there, he’d be more inspired to buy healthier foods like lean meats, vegetables, sweet potatoes, or quinoa. Now, three years later . . . he weighs 279 pounds. He lost 326 pounds, or almost 110 pounds a year. For the first two years, he lost ALL the weight just walking to and from Walmart. Over the past year, he’s also walked on a treadmill and started lifting weights . . . and now he’s RIPPED. He went from 53% body fat to under 10%. And last week, he went through the final step of his transformation and had, quote, “several feet” of loose skin surgically removed.

(DG) Should Ride With the Bulls Wall Street is expecting a 15% jump in Dollar General earnings, but guidance could be key By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Aug 23, 2016, 10:36 am EST     Popular Posts: Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc.

(T) 2 Ways to Collect on Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Tuesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), GoPro Inc (GPRO) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) View All Posts Dollar General Corp. (NYSE:DG) is having a stellar year, with DG stock up more than 25% since the start of 2016. The shares have a chance to add to that lead this week, as Dollar General heads to the earnings confessional to release its second-quarter earnings report. With DG stock hovering near technical support and oversold levels, Dollar General options traders should take a serious look. Currently, Wall Street is expecting second-quarter earnings to rise nearly 15% year-over-year to $1.09 per share, with revenue seen advancing 7.9% to $5.5 billion. Though the company sports smaller sized stores, Dollar General competes almost directly with retailing juggernaut Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT). 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of While Walmart’s venture into the small-store market largely failed — and ended with Dollar General snapping up about 40 Walmart Express locations — the company’s recent earnings report hinted at product pricing moves that could impact DG stock’s guidance. That said, analysts don’t seem to be too worried about Walmart’s competition, with EarningsWhispers.com projecting a whisper number of $1.11 per share — two cents better than the consensus. What’s more, the brokerage community as a whole has a bullish outlook on DG stock. For instance, Thomson/First Call data states that Dollar General has received 19 buy ratings, seven holds and no sell ratings. The 12-month price target of $99.71, meanwhile, represents a healthy premium of about 9.8%. Turning to data on short selling, there were 5.65 million shares of DG stock sold short as of the most recent reporting period. Representing a mere 2.17% of DG’s total float, this figure is hardly worth noting. However, it is worth pointing out that short interest plunged by 22% in the most recent period, indicating that short sellers are abandoning Dollar General in droves — which could be a sign that bears are concerned about a post-earnings rally for DG stock. Click to Enlarge Options traders, on the other hand, remain skeptical of DG stock’s post-earnings prowess. At last check, the August/September put/call open interest ratio rested at 1.02, with puts and calls in near parity. This ratio dips only fractionally to 1.00 for the weekly August 26 series. Overall, weekly August 26 series implieds are pricing in a potential post-earnings move of about 4.2% for DG stock. This places the upper bound at $94.85 and the lower bound at $87.15. Key short-term support for DG lies at $90, with $85 providing a potential backstop, while the $100 mark is the biggest technical hurdle for DG, though the shares will have to power past short-term resistance at $95 first. 2 Trades for DG Stock Call Spread: Dollar General has a history of moving higher in response to quarterly earnings reports. This coupled with the fact that the shares are hovering near technical support and in oversold territory could provide the impetus for a post-earnings rally. As such, traders looking side with the bulls ahead of DG’s report might want to consider a Sept $92.50/$95 bull call spread. At last check, this spread was offered at $1, or $100 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $93.50, while a maximum profit of $1.50, or $150 per pair of contracts, is possible if DG closes at or above $95 when September options expire. Why Twitter Inc (TWTR) Will Finally Get Bought Out Put Sell: On the other hand, those with a bullish-to-neutral bias on DG might consider a weekly Aug 26 series $85 put sell position. At last check, the August $85 put was bid at 36 cents, or $36 per contract. The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as DG stock closes above $85 when these options expire at the end of this week. The downside is that should DG trade below $85 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $85 per share. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share What Should Walmart Do Now That It’s Landed Jet.com? Image courtesy of Mike Mozart August 23, 2016 9:39 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk the honeymoon is over walmart jet.com wal-jet retailers retail e-commerce It’s no secret why Walmart bought Jet.com for $3 billion: the company’s e-commerce know-howo and experienced could be the key to the brick-and-mortar retailer’s plans of catching up with Amazon, finally, after all these years. But now that the honeymoon is over, it’s time to look at how, exactly, this marriage will work. Walmart bought Jet.com for a few reasons, including true love, but namely, its experience in the logistics and distribution processes needed for an online business, its affluent customer base, and the e-commerce minded employee culture that is so different from Walmart’s traditional retail environment. It’ll be tricky for Walmart to suddenly move to the quick and nimble innovative corporate culture of an entirely online business, Mohanbir Sawhney, the McCormick Foundation chair of technology and director of the Center for Research in Technology & Innovation at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management says in writing for Forbes. “E-commerce demands an entrepreneurial culture where experimentation and failure are par for the course,” he writes. “Converting Walmart into a nimble e-commerce competitor is a little bit like asking an Olympic athlete who has trained all his life as a weightlifter to suddenly become a gymnast. That is why Walmart needed to buy rather than build its e-commerce capabilities.” Just buying Jet.com doesn’t mean that all Walmart’s dreams will now come true, however: it’ll depend on what the company does now with its new bride. Sawhney’s view is that Walmart will come out best in the long run if Jet.com’s executive team and technical experts rebuild Walmart’s website and work on its e-commerce distribution, thus giving the retailer a bit of a makeover. Keeping Jet.com’s corporate culture and adaptability will be key, but not so easily accomplished, Sawhney says. And Walmart can’t just come in there with its ideas about how traditional retail works and stifle the spirit of Jet.com. If history has taught us anything, it’s that successfully combining two companies that are so different isn’t very easy. Often, big corporate parents who snatch up budding new businesses have a tendency to smother their acquisitions into an early grave. “Moreover, Walmart does not have a history of growing through acquisitions,” Sawhney says. It’s all worth a try, however, as Walmart is likely aware of these challenges, and figures it’s worth it if it can carve out even a little bit of Amazon’s market share.

Now Walmart’s Investigating The Sheet Manufacturer That Target Ditched Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Now Walmart’s Investigating The Sheet Manufacturer That Target Ditched Image courtesy of Mike Mozart August 23, 2016 10:16 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Taking a closer look walmart retail welspun manufacturer egyptian cotton supplier Days after Target terminated its relationship with one of the world’s biggest textile manufacturers after finding the company supplied the retailer with nearly a million sheet sets labeled as “Egyptian Cotton” that were actually made from non-Egyptian cotton, Walmart says it’s reviewing Welspun India’s records and cotton certifications.  Bloomberg reports that Walmart is scrutinizing Welspun’s products and records to determine if there are any discrepancies with the quality and labeling of sheets and pillowcases provided to the world’s largest retailer. A spokesperson for Walmart says the company will hold discussions with Welspun and “handle it appropriately” if issues are uncovered. Walmart, along with Welspun’s largest customer Bed Bath & Beyond, sell 500 and 800 thread count sheets online under the Crowning Touch label for about $175, Bloomberg reports. A rep for Welspun, which makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 retailers around the world, didn’t provide comment on Walmart’s review. The company previously told Bloomberg that it was reviewing its supply chain and would hire an accounting firm to examine its processes. Analysts say the latest development is cause for worry for the manufacturer. “It is likely that other customers too will start raising questions over Welspun’s supplies,” said Arun Kejriwal, a director at Kejriwal Research & Investment Pvt. in Mumbai, tells Bloomberg. Troubles for the manufacturer began on Friday when Target pulled its products from shelves and began notifying customers that they’ll get a refund on certain products under the Fieldcrest label that sold for as much as $75.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | August 23, 2016 -- 14:06 GMT (07:06 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Walmart is pondering lumping its OneOps open source cloud management platform under OpenStack since the two projects have integrated so well in an internal deployment. special feature Integrating the Hybrid Cloud As far and fast as cloud computing is embedding itself into the enterprise, there remain many cloud-resistant applications and services. Read More The retailing giant's OneOps platform is already open source and on Github, but the company has rolled out its management console along with OpenStack for years. OneOps was founded in 2011 as a company focused on provisioning and managing applications in the cloud. Walmart Labs acquired the company in 2013 and used its software to run its e-commerce sites. In January, Walmart Labs released OneOps as an open source project under Apache 2.0. Wal-Mart buys Jet for $3 billion, hopes to turbo charge e-commerce | Walmart tops Q2 targets on double digit ecommerce growth In a demonstration at OpenStack East in New York, Andrew Mitry, Walmart's lead cloud engineer, said the company deployed OneOps and OpenStack together and wanted to "start a conversation about moving OneOps into OpenStack." Mitry's main point is that OneOps and OpenStack work well together and could advance the cause of an open source cloud operating system. Kire Filipovski, a distinguished architect at Walmart Labs and co-founder of OneOps, said the OneOps software is deployed in more than 30 cloud regions and the uptake of applications and users has surged over the last three years. Filipovski noted that OneOps is used to deploy various instances of open source technologies. The demo included a Postgres deployment. "We are heavily pushing open source technologies at this point," he said. Overall, Walmart is creating and destroying cloud instances at a rapid rate. "The (adoption) curve is unpredictable and we're building a platform that's built for change," he said.

I, like many others, predicted that if the new venture showed signs of success it would be acquisition bait for the big dogs fighting it out for digital retailing supremacy. While it was certainly not shocking when Walmart announced in early August that it had come to terms to purchase the upstart, the speed with which the acquisition occurred and the price paid certainly raised some eyebrows. With a price tag of $3 billion, plus an additional $300 million in Walmart stock, the acquisition was the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company. “We’re looking for ways to lower prices, broaden our assortment and offer the simplest, easiest shopping experience because that’s what our customers want,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO, Walmart in a statement announcing the sale. “We believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we’re pursuing will happen quicker, and we’ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time. Our customers will win. It’s another jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart.” It is that last line from McMillon — “jolt of entrepreneurial spirt” — that is the most telling and may well be the reason the retailing giant was willing to pay such a high price for the upstart when there were no other offers on the table. As part of the deal, Jet founder and CEO Marc Lore agreed to run the U.S. e-commerce businesses of both Jet and Walmart — a major win for Walmart. As Walmart looks to accelerate its online growth and connect with highly profitable and influential Millennial shoppers, it will have a true digital innovator at the helm with a proven track record of e-commerce success. In addition to founding Jet, Lore co-founded, led and eventually sold Quidsi, the parent company of e-commerce sites Diapers.com, Soap.com and Wag.com. Walmart missed out on the sale of Quidsi to rival Amazon in a bidding war in 2010, and was intent on not only acquiring Jet before Amazon showed interest, but bringing the mastermind behind the site in-house. “The combination of Walmart’s retail expertise, purchasing scale, sourcing capabilities, distribution footprint, and digital assets — together with the team, technology and business we have built here at Jet — will allow us to deliver more value to customers,” Lore said in a statement. Will the addition of Jet and Lore be the shot in the arm Walmart’s e-commerce team needs? That remains to be seen. But with online growth for the most recent quarter sitting at an uninspiring 7%, Walmart needed to make a move.

Now, "dogs of the Dow" investors are being handsomely rewarded for rolling the dice on these two downtrodden picks. "Dogs of the Dow has been a great strategy over the years, and this really is a classic dogs of the Dow," Eddy Elfenbein said on CNBC's "Power Lunch" when discussing Wal-Mart and Caterpillar. "Both stocks had terrible years last year, and both have done quite well this year," he said Friday. Caterpillar and Wal-Mart have soared 23 and 19 percent, respectively, this year. Elfenbein, editor of the "Crossing Wall Street" blog, explained that "dogs of the Dow" calls for investing in 10 Dow stocks with the highest dividend yield at the end of the year and then holding onto those stocks for one year. As it stands, the "dogs of the Dow" strategy has outperformed the market in recent years. With Wal-Mart in mind, Elfenbein noted that the retailer raised guidance following a strong second quarter and, leading up, had been "investing in themselves." Additionally, Wal-Mart opted to give employees a wage increase, and Elfenbein said the company is "cleaning up their stores and going after Target's audience. I think going forward, Wal-Mart is the better buy, and Caterpillar still has a lot of work to do." However, Piper Jaffray senior technical strategist Craig Johnson said investors should remove sentiment from the equation when evaluating which former "dog" is a better buy right now.

And the reason says a lot about how the retail giant does business and its place in the larger economy. Time reported last week that police in many communities get more calls to Walmart shopping centers than anywhere else. For some stores, police are called multiple times a day. The problem appears to be far larger for Walmart than for competing retailers like Target. And the crime ranges from mostly standard shoplifting and petty theft to the occasional rape, stabbing, shooting, murder, or meth lab hidden in a 6-foot drainage pipe under the store parking lot. "I've got all my bad guys in one place," Darrell Ross, a Tulsa police officer permanently stationed at the local Walmart, joked to Bloomberg. Critics in both stories point to Walmart's aggressive cost-cutting, beginning in 2000 with the tenure of former CEO Lee Scott, as a big part of the problem. Retail consultants told Time that Walmart likely has about 400,000 fewer workers in the U.S. today than a decade ago. In giant stores that can range up to five acres, that translates into one worker for every 524 square feet of retail space — a 19 percent decrease in workers per square foot from 10 years ago. The greeters at the entrances are gone, many cashiers have been replaced with automated checkout scanners, and there are simply fewer eyeballs monitoring everything than before. That all proved beneficial for Walmart's bottom line, as sales per employee grew 23 percent over that same time period. But just like some Walmart detractors accuse the company of relying on government aid programs to subsidize its workers, critics say Walmart is skimping on security and implicitly farming the cost out to publicly-financed police forces. "It's ridiculous — we are talking about the biggest retailer in the world," Robert Rohloff, a police sergeant in Tulsa, told Bloomberg. "I may have half my squad there for hours." Walmart is making some moves to solve the problem, like installing eye-level security cameras and moving more of its remaining employees towards the exits. The company is going to spend $2.7 billion to raise wages throughout its stores, and thus hopefully boost morale and training. Walmart is also rolling out a program whereby shoplifters, instead of having the cops called on them, can pay a fee and take a theft-deterrence class. Burt Flickinger, the managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail consultant, told Bloomberg that the most straightforward fix is just for Walmart to spend the necessary money — and that $2.7 billion isn't enough. He estimated the company needs to spend at least $3.25 billion a year on additional part-time work, and even that wouldn't bring them to the ratio of workers per square foot they had in the 1990s. The idea would be to get Walmart's operations closer to those of its competitors like Target, which just has a lot more workers for its space. (Though it doesn't necessarily pay them more.) But the Target comparison also reveals a bigger reason for why Walmart cuts corners. Target has steadily enjoyed larger profits than Walmart: Its financial statements from 2015 show a profit margin of 4.6 percent, versus just 3 percent for Walmart. That 3 percent amounted to $14.7 billion, which would be cut by a quarter just by Flickinger's recommendations. Add on the general pressure for Walmart to pay a living wage and such, and its profit margin starts to quickly shrink. Despite investing in a larger employee force to monitor its stores, and a few other measures, Target enjoys a higher profit margin. That's probably because of the company's overall business strategy, which relies on smaller stores and a more affluent customer base. Walmart shoppers earn 18 percent less than Target shoppers on average, and the gap between them and Costco or Macy's shoppers is even bigger. Walmart brings in way more shoppers who make under $25,000 than Target. And as you keep going up the income ladder, Walmart's share of the customer base shrinks while Target's increases. Walmart's business model relies on low prices because it serves a precarious and low-wage customer base. And Walmart operates in a world where recoveries from recessions are grindingly slow, incomes have stagnated or even fallen for the middle and lower slices of American workers, and where big cities are the few remaining islands of economic vibrancy. So it has to keep cutting prices to keep up with its customers' ability to pay. But Walmart is also the country's biggest employer, and the biggest employer in 19 states. So when it holds down pay to make its price cuts financially viable, it ends up creating a vicious cycle. All the while, Walmart has trouble keeping a profit margin compared to upscale competitors. Walmart's lawbreaking problem is, to some extent, an outgrowth of where its stores are located. Impoverished communities are more likely to be afflicted by crime in general, and these days a Walmart store is often the biggest retail hub — or even the biggest hub for economic activity, period — in those communities. Critics of the crime problem also point out that Walmart stores — unlike Target — are open 24 hours to allow people to congregate or camp out in parking lots. But that's part and parcel of the outsized social role Walmart stores can play in these dying communities: "They can easily generate more traffic than the whole town," Charles Fishman, author of The Wal-Mart Effect, told Time. "By pure numbers, the crime is going to be where the people are." So certainly, some of Walmart's ruthlessness is a choice by the company's leadership. But some of it is a necessity, making Walmart a creature of our broader failure to create opportunity for low-income Americans: You can be ruthless and sell to these consumers, or not be ruthless and not sell to them at all. Neither Walmart nor any other private business can work with money that isn't already there. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

That share is expected to grow with the recent rollout of what Home Depot calls BODFS, or buy online and deliver from store, according to Home Depot CEO Craig Menear. BODFS allows customers to pick a much shorter delivery window and have purchases delivered from their local Home Depot store. The program has rolled out in 700 of Home Depot's 2,200 stores, and will be available at all stores by the end of the year, Menear said last week on an earnings call.  Retail industry experts and analysts have long encouraged brick-and-mortar retailers to better utilize their physical stores to compete with Amazon online.  Both Walmart and Home Depot have a long way to go before they catch up to Amazon in terms of online revenue, however. Walmart's online sales were $13.7 billion in 2015, compared to Amazon's $107 billion. Home Depot doesn't break out sales for e-commerce, but said online sales accounted for about 5.6% of its $26.5 billion in second-quarter sales.  NOW WATCH: 4 things every man should know before going into a Victoria's Secret Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From Business Insider Here's what can happen when you eat too much salt Business Insider The pound is tumbling Business Insider 5 most annoying resume mistakes Business Insider 19 easy ways to slowly destroy your career Business Insider Business Insider View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Welspun’s list of troubles keep getting longer and longer. India’s largest home textile exporter finds itself tied in knots with a problem that the company admits is entirely its own making.   Here’s what happened. On Friday Target issued a statement alleging that Welspun had substituted non-Egyptian cotton for sheets that were sold under the Fieldcrest brand. These sheets manufactured between August 2014 and July 2016 were sold as 500 thread Egyptian cotton count sheets at $175 apiece.   Ever mindful of customer satisfaction (and the threat of litigation) Target pulled the sheets from its shelves, offered customers a full refund and said it was terminating its relationship with Welspun. While Target accounts for 10 percent of Welspun’s sales the reputation loss was a body blow for the company.   In a hastily arranged conference call on Monday morning Rajesh Mandawewala admitted to the lapse and said that the company was appointing an audit firm to probe further. The company expects the report to be out in 6-8 weeks. On Monday its stock tumbled 20 percent shaving off Rs2300 crore in market cap. Tuesday morning brought further bad news with Walmart stating that it was examining products supplied by Welspun. Bloomberg reported a Walmart spokeswoman was saying that if any issues were discovered the retailer plans to “handle it appropriately.”   Welspun’s shareholders are irate. They’ve rushed to the exit. On Tuesday, the stock was down another 20 percent with about 3,00,00,000 shares waiting to be sold on Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange. While there were question marks over the integrity of the Welspun management, some message boards wondered whether this could lead to retailers auditing supplies from other suppliers as well. Rising cotton prices have been another overhang for the sector. Indian companies have a 48 percent share of the US home textile market.   For the time being, investors are showing that they’re nervous while analysts have revised their growth forecasts for Welspun. While the company has disclosed that sheets made of Egyptian cotton constituted no more than 3-6 percent of revenues in the last two years, investors are waiting to see what sort of liability Target imposes on Welspun. One thing is certain: Welspun is unlikely to reach its target of $2 billion in sales by 2020.

(TGT) terminated business with the Indian textile manufacturer over cheaper bedsheets and pillowcases being labeled as premium Egyptian cotton. Following this, retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) is reviewing supplier Welspun's cotton certification records, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Welspun India, part of conglomerate Welspun Group, told BSE in a filing that it has initiated a probe in the matter. "We have initiated actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor to audit our supply systems and processes. This is an issue of highest priority for us and we will take all necessary steps to address it." Target on Friday announced that it was ending all business with Welspun India after it discovered last month that 750,000 sheets and pillowcases labeled as Egyptian cotton were actually made with another type of cotton. The retailer pulled the items from its stores. The company began to notify customers on Friday about a refund on the products. These were produced between August 2014 and July 2016 and sold for as much as $75. Target confirmed that the withdrawal includes two lines of Egyptian cotton bedding, and not all of its Egyptian cotton sheets are affected. Mumbai-based Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Target is Welspun's second-biggest customer, behind Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., and Wal-Mart is the third-biggest customer. Other major clients include J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc. Welspun also manufactures towels for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Rugby World Cup. As per reports, every fifth towel sold in the US is manufactured by Welspun India, and its sales to Target amounted to $90 million in the fiscal year ended in March. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Worst IPO flops of 2016 Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories More Top Stories Omni Custom's Chicken Quarters Recalled For Undeclared Allergens Trump Taps Charter School Advocate Betsy DeVos As Education Secretary Trump To Nominate Haley As U.S. Ambassador To The United Nations Voters At Odds With Trump On Several Key Issues Major Averages Remain On Opposite Sides Of Unchanged Line - U.S. Commentary H.J.

FIRST IN THE WORLD-HERALD Hayneedle looks forward to boost in sales, hiring after Walmart buys its parent company By Cole Epley / World-Herald staff writer Cole Epley Aug 24, 2016 (…) RYAN SODERLIN/THE WORLD-HERALD Photographer Wendy Wees, left, and stylist Cora Coppock work to put products in their best light at the Hayneedle photo studio.

RYAN SODERLIN/THE WORLD-HERALD Becky Kelly, left, a senior product development buyer, Rebecca Gray, center, vice president of merchandising, and Christine Tvrdik, a senior product development buyer, talk about possible fabric choices for furniture at the Hayneedle photo studio. Hayneedle got a big lift when Jet.com scooped up the local home furnishings e-retailer earlier this year. Now, Walmart’s purchase of Jet.com is set to give Hayneedle another boost, the Omaha company’s chief executive said. Hayneedle Chief Executive Jon Barker told The World-Herald the company is on track to surpass $500 million in sales in 2016, up about 40 percent from more than $350 million in 2015. “We were able to partner with Jet and really put the resources toward the Hayneedle platform that we’ve built for so long,” Barker said. “That has taken off at a rate that has probably been the highest in the history of the company.” With the added Jet marketing muscle, more people are visiting the Hayneedle site to find products as varied as hammocks and high-end patio furniture. But more important, more of those people are actually making purchases, he said. To handle the growth, 14-year-old Hayneedle has been on a hiring spree — and it’s not stopping with the Walmart deal, Barker said. Hayneedle today has almost 600 local employees compared with 400 when the Jet deal closed in late February. “We have 300 more people to hire through the remainder of this year alone, more than 200 of which are in Omaha,” he said. That would bring its local headcount to 800 or more. As a Jet subsidiary, Hayneedle maintains its separate identity and its corporate headquarters here, along with a photo studio and a call center. New Jersey-based Jet, which formally launched in July 2015, spent the second half of last year building up its customer roll while raising hundreds of millions of dollars from private-equity investors. Of that, $90 million went to Omaha to complete the Hayneedle purchase, and a far larger portion was earmarked for raising the companies’ profiles among would-be shoppers of competitor Amazon.com, Jet co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Marc Lore, has said. But where Amazon has matured since its founding in the mid-1990s, Jet still has some growing up to do: The company at its launch last summer was banking on a $49.99 annual membership fee, but it scrapped the model, promising instead to beat competitors on pricing. (Hayneedle is operated separately and never had an annual fee.) To that end, Jet uses a pricing algorithm that determines the lowest-cost combination of goods and sellers based on location of products and other factors. Apparently the approach is attractive, and the $3.3 billion deal in which big-box giant Walmart bought Jet earlier this month should keep moving the needle in Omaha. That makes the big question whether the Jet deal will move the e-commerce needle for Walmart, the largest retailer in the world. Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove told The World-Herald earlier this month that the retailer’s network of brick-and-mortar stores gives it more than 4,000 potential distribution points for web retailing, not to mention its own dedicated e-commerce distribution facilities and the industry expertise that accompanies the Jet team. Company executives on Aug. 16 presented a better-than-expected outlook for the rest of the year with second-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates. That’s despite the forecast of a small hit to earnings per share tied to the Jet deal. But some analysts are not yet sold. E-commerce sales at Walmart jumped 12 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago, according to the company’s most recent financial filings. That’s decent, but it lagged behind such growth at Target, which reported e-commerce growth of 16 percent from the same period last year. And even though the Arkansas-based retailer boasts almost $485 billion in annual revenue, online sales there make up about $14 billion of that total, according to Morningstar analyst Erin Lash. Amazon, meanwhile, has roughly $100 billion in annual sales. Lash in a note to clients last week said the Jet deal is expected to boost Walmart’s share of online sales. It has the name recognition and heft to better narrow the gap, and “shipping costs for e-commerce firms are much higher than those for brick-and-mortar firms,” she said. Less clear is just how long that will take. Lash also said the push to compete with Amazon and other e-commerce heavyweights could come at the slight expense of sales in Walmart’s own stores, which require overhead regardless of where sales are made: “The supercenter — or any other store — and its labor and other overhead, including rent or mortgage, is the unnecessary middleman in the Amazon business model,” she said. While the Jet-Walmart integration plays out, Hayneedle’s Barker said the Omaha business will keep humming along. Local product development teams continue to design and develop new product collections to make sure offerings stay fresh and fit in with shoppers’ changing tastes, for example, and that mid- to high-end furniture beckons a more affluent customer than the average Walmart shopper. And where electronics and appliances are increasingly bought and sold via online channels, Barker said it’s a far smaller share of home goods like Hayneedle’s own Belham Living and Coral Coast lines of furnishings that are bought and sold only online. Only 7 percent of home furnishings sales happen online in the U.S., Barker said. “We’re in the early stages for home furnishings online, and we’re in a position to capitalize on that.” Contact the writer: 402-444-1534, cole.epley@owh.com More information Walmart deal will pay off for Jet.com backers With Walmart Stores buying Jet.com for $3.3 billion, some of the biggest names on Wall Street and Silicon Valley — from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Google’s venture arm — are cashing in.

Thanksgiving Eve parties: Highlights at Lehigh Valley clubs News Breaking News Judge: Ammo lawsuit tied to Valley slayings going back to Philly court MORNING CALL/FILE PHOTO A lawsuit involving a deadly random shooting spree in Allentown and Easton will be heard in a Philadelphia court. A lawsuit involving a deadly random shooting spree in Allentown and Easton will be heard in a Philadelphia court. (MORNING CALL/FILE PHOTO) Peter HallOf The Morning Call Walmart must defend claims over ammo sold in Lehigh Valley killing spree in Philly court. A lawsuit claiming Walmart and its employees negligently sold handgun ammunition used to kill three people in Allentown and Easton last year must be heard in Philadelphia County Court, a judge has ruled. Shortly after the lawsuit was filed in January, Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart moved the suit by the families of three people killed in a random early morning shooting spree from Philadelphia court to federal court in Allentown. The company's lawyers argued the suit belongs in U.S. District court under a rule that gives federal courts jurisdiction when none of the defendants reside in the state where the case was filed. Although two store managers who live in Pennsylvania are named as defendants, they weren't involved in the sale and can't be held liable, Walmart's lawyers claimed. Walmart alleged the managers were "fraudulently joined" in the lawsuit to give a Pennsylvania state court jurisdiction over the case. U.S. District Judge Joseph F. Leeson said last week that even if the managers weren't involved in the sale, the victims' families may have a valid claim that they are liable for failing to properly train the unidentified cashier who did sell the ammunition. Walmart sued over ammo sale in deadly Lehigh Valley shooting spree Peter Hall Twenty-year-old Robert Jourdain had been drinking for hours before he walked into a Walmart store early on the morning of July 5 and bought a box of .38-caliber ammunition, court papers say.

Twenty-year-old Robert Jourdain had been drinking for hours before he walked into a Walmart store early on the morning of July 5 and bought a box of .38-caliber ammunition, court papers say. Shortly before 3 a.m., Jourdain left the Northampton Crossings shopping center in Lower Nazareth Township... (Peter Hall) The suit alleges Walmart should not have sold a box of .38-caliber ammunition to 20-year-old Robert Jourdain, who had been drinking for hours before he walked into the retailer's Lower Nazareth Township store shortly before 3 a.m. on July 5, 2015. After purchasing the ammunition, Jourdain joined alleged gunman Todd West in a sport utility vehicle with Kareem Mitchell at the wheel. The three men drove to Easton, where West allegedly gunned down 22-year-old Kory Ketrow just steps from his Lehigh Street apartment, then to Allentown, where West allegedly shot city residents Francine Ramos, 32, and Trevor Gray, 21, as they sat in a car at North Sixth and Greenleaf streets.

(Laurie Mason Schroeder) The families claim selling the ammunition to Jourdain was negligent because Walmart's employees should have recognized he was too young to buy it legally and was mentally impaired by alcohol. Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company extends condolences to the victims' families and is reviewing its next steps. In which court the case moves forward is a matter of significance because each side stands to gain an advantage. Attorney Matt Casey said the victims' families, whom he represents, can legally sue Walmart in Philadelphia simply because it does business there. But the city's courts boast a case management system that guarantees a trial in 18 months. He also noted that personal injury lawsuits are statistically more successful in Philadelphia than in suburban or rural Pennsylvania courts. "As the lawyer for these families, my judgment was the Philadelphia venue was the best place for this case," Casey said, noting that it could also be litigated in Lehigh or Northampton county courts. Walmart, on the other hand, would potentially benefit from any federal case law that develops as a result of the lawsuit because it would apply to similar cases elsewhere in the nation. The suit is noteworthy because it seeks to hold Walmart responsible for the victims' deaths under a narrow exception to federal immunity to liability for firearms and ammunition dealers under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. Only a handful of similar cases have succeeded and Casey said his suit is the first of its kind in Pennsylvania. The suit alleges Walmart is not protected by the law because its employees negligently entrusted the ammunition to Jourdain and because the sale violated a federal law prohibiting the sale of handgun ammunition to people under 21. Leeson also rejected Walmart's claim the case belongs in federal court because there is a dispute whether its employees violated federal law. Walmart claims they did not because the .38-caliber ammunition at issue can also be used in rifles and rifle ammunition can legally be sold to 18-year-olds. Jourdain, now 21, of Easton; West, 23, of Elizabeth, N.J., and their alleged driver, Mitchell, 24, of Newark, N.J., face trial on charges of homicide and attempted homicide in Lehigh County. West, who faces the death penalty for the killings in Lehigh and Northampton counties, is also charged with killing four people in New Jersey. peter.hall@mcall.com Twitter @phall215 610-820-6581 Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, The Morning Call Trials and Arbitration Homicide Allentown police dash cam captures double-murder scene Dash Cam video of the July 5th, 2015 double homicide in Allentown Breaking Popular Obits Biz Cycle Sports LV Craft Beer Video/Photos Classifieds 46°

They’re also a hotspot for police calls. In Vancouver, Washington, there were more police calls to the Walmart at Northeast 104th Avenue than any other one location in the city in 2015. It was nearly twice the number of calls as the second-highest location, Vancouver Mall. Compared to Fred Meyer, Walmart stores generate more than twice as many calls on average in the Portland metro area.   In Multnomah, Washington and Clark counties, police were called to Walmart on average of 803 times a year, compared to 374 for nearby Fred Meyers. And one store isn't skewing the data. Every single Walmart generated significantly more calls than the nearest Fred Meyer. Police departments are already strapped for time and the calls cost taxpayers, who foot the bill. In the Portland metro area, officials at several police departments said the calls are not a significant burden and not every call is a report of a shoplifter.  “We have enough time to handle those calls because they really don’t take that much time for the officer,” said Chief Bob Richardson of the Battle Ground Police Department. But this isn’t just a local issue, and police departments in other cities say it’s putting a strain on officers.  Across the country, Walmart generates a disproportionate number of police calls. The Tampa Bay Times found Walmarts in four Florida counties generated four times as many calls as Target stores.  9News in Denver found Walmart was one of the top generators of police calls in the city and surrounding areas.  In Tulsa, Okla., there’s an officer known as “Officer Walmart” because his job is to police the local Walmart, according to a Bloomberg report.  “We have teams in place that are there to deter and prevent and stop shoplifters, but they are not law enforcement,” said Erica Jones, spokeswoman for Walmart. “If someone is stopped shoplifting or committing a crime at our store, we will call police.” Jones said the company has launched programs at Walmarts around the country, including Portland-area stores, to reduce calls. “We’ve enacted preventative measures here in the past few months including a program called ‘More at the Door,’ which bolsters a presence at the front of the store to deter criminal activity,” she said. Walmart also started a program called “Restorative Justice.” First-time shoplifters can choose to participate in an educational program instead of dealing with police. Jones said the programs reduced police calls by 40 percent in the first store they studied.  The Restorative Justice program is not without critics. Time Magazine reported that a company Walmart hired to give the courses is being sued for overcharging and false imprisonment. The article also questioned the ethics of forcing shoplifters to choose between paying money or face the possibility of an arrest.  It’s unknown whether Fred Meyer has enacted similar programs or if there are just fewer crimes committed at the stores. A spokeswoman for Fred Meyer said the company does not publicly discuss its security measures. Jones says Walmart hopes the new programs help ease the burden on local police departments, including the ones in the Portland area. “We don’t want people in our stores or the community for the wrong reasons,” she said. “We value our partnerships with law enforcement agencies and if there is some way we can enact some measure in our stores that can either prevent crime or reduce those calls for police service to our stores then we’re going to look at those and do what it is that we can.” Published August 22, 2016.

Off the Street Video Research Politics World Science Policy Tech Energy Religion Defense Sports Recent Videos Advertisement: August 23, 2016 Wal-Mart's Jet.com Buy Puts Online Sales Tax at the ForefrontBy Jessica Melugin This month, Wal-Mart announced plans to acquire e-commerce start-up Jet.com for $3.3 billion in the largest ever buyout of a U.S. e-commerce business. Wal-Mart should give itself a Smiley-the retailer's iconic happy face indicating a cost savings - and slash its budget for lobbying Congress to expand online sales taxes. The deal undercuts Wal-Mart's argument that the lack of online sales taxes allows competitors an "unfair" advantage in the marketplace. In fact, it illustrates that large retailers believe bigger distribution networks for faster delivery to customers and a strong online presence, is more of a competitive advantage than the lower prices achieved by avoiding sales tax obligations. How Wal-Mart will handle tax collections from purchases at Jet.com has not been released, but it is likely Wal-Mart's lobbyists will be in the awkward position of demanding an end to the online sales tax "loophole," while the company simultaneously chooses not to take advantage of it. States can only collect sales tax from companies with a physical presence, like a store or warehouse, within their borders. The Supreme Court's 1992 Quill decision enshrined this manifestation of "no taxation without representation," preventing states from taxing companies in other states that happen to sell to their residents. But state politicians seeking to fill tax coffers are petitioning Congress for expanded taxing authority. Specifically, they would like to reach outside their borders and collect sales taxes from companies that have no physical presence in their states. Never mind that these companies have no political voice in those states and don't benefit from the public services those taxes fund. Moreover, compliance costs for calculating for almost 10,000 distinct tax jurisdictions, each with its own base, rates, and tax holidays, would prove fatal for many small and mid-sized online sellers. State officials also seem nonchalant about their plan's detrimental effect on interstate tax competition and the free flow of goods the Constitution's commerce clause was written to protect. Joining state sales tax enthusiasts on Capitol Hill are lobbyists for big box retailers like Target and Best Buy-in addition to Wal-Mart. Their stores trigger sales tax obligations in all 50 states, so they feel they're at a competitive disadvantage relative to online retailers, which don't face those same tax liabilities. If the thought of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, needing the federal government to protect it from folks selling hand-knitted socks on eBay seems absurd, Wal-Mart's Jet.com purchase only makes it more so. It's hard to imagine Wal-Mart will forgo all the advantages of fully integrating Jet.com just to preserve the latter's current advantage of paying sales tax in only seven states. To do so, would deny Jet.com access to Wal-Mart's warehouses and stores in all 50 states, as that would trigger sales tax obligations for all Jet.com purchases. It's more likely Wal-Mart will sacrifice the tax advantage of Jet.com's small physical footprint in order to take full advantage of the parent company's vast distribution network to get customers what they want faster with less hassle. Wal-Mart wouldn't be the first to take this approach. Amazon.com, the number one online retailer in the U.S., has come to the same conclusion. For years, Amazon opposed expanded sales taxes online, but then reversed its position as it changed its strategy from a limited physical presence in only five states to distribution warehouses all over the country to offer faster delivery and even same-day service in some areas. Amazon now collects sales taxes in 28 states and on a majority of the U.S. population. Amazon's continued support for online sales taxes also creates a market for its tax software to help mom-and-pop online sellers comply with burdensome calculating and remitting requirements across the nation. Amazon has much to gain from government intervention and is therefore unlikely to reverse course again. In the bigger picture, online retail sales continue to grow-10.6 percent in the first half of 2016. Therefore, inequities in the way online sales are taxed may need to be addressed. But let's not forget, expanded sales taxes mean more bureaucracy on the Internet, higher costs for taxpayers, and could even be the death nail for smaller sellers-an unacceptable price to pay to end a tax policy that its critics can't even be bothered to exploit. The best solution would be an origin-based approach that requires online retailers to collect sales tax according to the point of purchase, not the residence of the customer, like their brick-and-mortar counterparts do. This system treats all types of retailers the same, allows states to collect only from within their borders, preserves healthy tax competition among states, and alleviates the costly compliance burden for companies. Now there's an idea Wal-Mart lobbyists might want to embrace.

Nominate yourself for the W100 now » When Carol Leaman took over as president and CEO of Axonify, the Waterloo-based e-learning company had exactly one client. Mind you, that client was not your typical first customer. Most startups start with small businesses, who typically have less complicated and lengthy procurement processes and are more willing to work with unknown partners. By contrast, Axonify’s initial sale was an American automotive parts retailer called Pep Boys, with $2 billion in revenue and a fleet of 20,000 employees. Leaman admits that signing Pep Boys to Axonify, which develops game- and incentive-based employee training software, took a bit of luck. But once the company was in the Axonify fold, keeping it and finding other giant corporations to partner with was easy. Soon, Leaman was selling her product to Toys R Us, Walmart, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and FedEx, to name just a few. It’s only now, five years later and with nearly $10 million in annual revenue, that Leaman,who ranked No. 26 on the 2016 W100 Ranking of Canada’s Top Female Entrepreneurs, has started focusing on selling to smaller businesses. While the approach—starting with mega clients and working down to the small ones—runs counter to the conventional startup strategy, it’s helped Axonify achieve mass success early on and accelerate quickly. Here, Leaman offers advice on how to start big and grow small. Focus on needs, not size “One of the things I’ve learned over the years and after four companies is [that you need to] pick your sweet spot and drill deep to get a footprint and a repeatable sales story,” says Leaman. After seeing what worked for Pep Boys in the area of health and safety training, Leaman and her team sought out companies with similar needs and sell them on Axonify’s product based on their first client’s experience. By targeting companies based on their needs rather than their size, Leaman ensured Axonify would have a compelling case to present. “With every big client, it made selling to the next one easier and easier,” Leaman says. Sell your vision “With larger companies, there tends to be inertia when it comes to change,” says Leaman. “They’ve invested millions of dollars already into training and it’s hard to see how this one service is going to change the game.” For a company like Walmart, for example, adopting Axonify’s product meant spending tens of thousands of dollars across several countries to reach 2.3 million employees. “The impact across the organization is so potentially great that they can’t afford to fail,” says Leaman. That’s why you need to create a vision of what the client could achieve if they worked with you. “You really have to get that person or team you’re selling to excited about the opportunity to transform the business,” says Leaman. “In smaller organizations, people can wrap their heads around it more easily.” Offer a trial period Even with a handful of positive testimonials, many FORTUNE 1000 companies weren’t willing to work with a little-known startup claiming to make huge impacts on employee behaviour. “We had to prove ourselves before they’d jump in with both feet,” says Leaman. Axonify won their trust by offering short-term pilot programs at a reduced rate for three to six months. One such arrangement was with Walmart, which adopted Axonify’s health and safety training for 5,000 employees across eight distribution centres over a six-month period. Walmart’s goal was to reduce the number of occupational health and safety reports by 5%; at the end of six months, the actual reduction was 54%. “Once we did enough of these pilots and converted them to long-term deals, we didn’t have to do trial offers anymore,” says Leaman. “Our existing customers were happy to talk to prospective customers to validate that our programs work.” Don’t ignore the value of small deals In the last few years, “gamified” employee training has become something of a trend, as research suggests ongoing development can yield significant improvements in employee retention and performance, and the bottom line. Coupled with Axonify’s growing name recognition, this increased interest has helped the company to attract small and medium-sized businesses organically. While these businesses don’t generate nearly as much revenue for Axonify as the multinationals, Leaman says they’re still worth her team’s time, especially if they’re easy to work with. “The benefit to those organizations is that we are often the first and only technology-enabled learning that they employ,” she says. “So we aren’t needing to integrate with other software solutions, or compete with the statement: ‘We’ve already invested in this other thing so how are you different and better?’ It makes the value we provide specific and unique.” Leaman also notes that many of the small and medium businesses she works with will someday be large companies with more resources and a greater need for services like Axonify’s. Staking a claim with these companies early on could lead to major payoffs down the road—particularly if you’re selling in an increasingly competitive market. “If we feel the smaller companies can grow,” Leaman, “it’s great to get in early and grow with them.” MORE ON LANDING BIG CLIENTS: Master the Art of Landing Big Clients » 6 Ways to Make Your Company Look Bigger Than It Really Is » How to Bag a Trophy Client » 3 Low-Cost Keys to Getting Big Companies to Trust You » Who Your Most Valuable Customers Really Are » Subscribe to our e-newsletter Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Follow us on LinkedIn Print Email Comment Share: Directory Learn more about Canada’s Best Places for Business 2016 Photo gallery Damn Good Advice from the 2016 PROFIT 500 On… BusinessCast 3 Good Reasons Not to Franchise Your Business Loading comments, please wait.

Across Western Europe, the food market is dominated by a number of large corporations including, but not limited to, Walmart, Carrefour, Metro AG, Tesco, as well as many more subsidiaries. In order to sustain businesses on such a massive scale, these businesses require large numbers of staff in order to fulfill day-to-day operations. Much of the work required to keep these companies going from falls under the remit of the customer assistant. The traditional customer assistant role is defined as being fairly low-skilled, low-paid, and often filled by young people as their first job. As food retailers have the potential to have a large environmental impact across their operations, be it through sourcing suppliers, how their products are farmed and produced, logistical operations, as well as the environmental impact of store locations, it is doubly important for a succinct environmental policy to be implemented. A quick look on the big players websites such as Walmart, Lidl and Tesco shows that these businesses do appear to take the environmental cost of their operations seriously. An environmental mission statement is only as good as it’s execution, however. For a large retailer to reduce it’s impact on the environment, an green attitude must be adopted across the entire business. Last month, Raz Godelnik argued that CEOs have limited control over the environmental impact of their businesses. Here, the issue is largely similar, as it requires engagement from staff at every level. The question that those in the upper management level should be asking themselves is what can be done to encourage every single one of our employees to invest in our vision for sustainability. Some retailers are better at employee engagement than others. The UK supermarket Waitrose is part of the John Lewis Partnership, an employee owned department store, famed for how well it’s staff are treated. John Lewis is frequently cited as being one of the best companies to work for in the UK. Looking at Waitrose, we can see that this same attitude is fostered through the treatment of new employees. Upon receiving a work contract, new customer assistants are given shares in the company and made ‘Partners’ through their Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Giving new workers a tangible stake in their place of work is a proven method of improving company commitment. The Waitrose website reveals a strong commitment to environmentalism. The business practices they have implemented cover a variety of issues, ranging from reducing the amount of waste generated by individual stores, to the responsible sourcing of fish, as well as collaborative work with environmental charities such as The Woodlands Trust and The Prince’s Countryside Trust. Bringing it back to the workers of Waitrose themselves, what can we glean from this combination of staff engagement and ambitious environmental policy? A closer look at the supermarket’s Indeed profile shows a rather impressive 4.1 out of 5 score. This gives us a snapshot that Waitroses’ employees are satisfied, and makes for interesting reading when compared with other British supermarkets such as the Walmart owned ASDA, whose employees gave them 3.7 out of 5, and Tesco, who have 3.8. So when we put satisfied staff with an ambitious environmental policy, what do we have? (Interestingly, Waitrose’s parent company John Lewis, which also uses an ESOP has a rating of 4.2.) Research conducted by ethicalConsumer.com found Waitrose to be the third most ethical supermarket in the UK behind the Co-Op and M&S. The poll’s scoring system actually puts Waitrose top of the pile, however researchers at ethicalConsumer.com have adjusted their qualitative data to put the Co-Op and M&S ahead. The research took into account a number of variables including workers rights, supply chain management, and environmental impact. As Waitrose scores high on both how they treat their employees, and how environmentally conscious they are, other retailers should recognise that the two go hand in hand. It’s all too easy to stereotype low level supermarket customer assistants as disinterested and workshy. What we see online does little to help dissipate this image, with the likes of Grocery Store Bingo, and the People of Walmart website. However, when a large company takes the time to engage and invest in employees at every level, you end up with a business with a common goal. When that goal is to reduce the environmental impact inflicted by their operations, we end up with an example that other food retailers should be following.

Bobbi Rebell reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Wal-Mart sells just about anything a consumer could want And so when its sales results fall short- it sends a broader message about the economy: Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman: SOUNDBITE: JOE FELDMAN, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP (ENGLISH) SAYING: "It definitely seems like there is a slowdown, broadly speaking, at that more moderate consumer, certainly in the U.S. and globally as well. I mean, there was some sales pressure as well. But here in the U.S., the 2 percent payroll tax is definitely weighing on the consumer. The paycheck cycle was still very pronounced for Wal-Mart meaning people were really timing purchases around when they get their paychecks." Wal-Mart didn't just miss on its same store sales- the discounter lowered its outlook for revenue and profits for the year. Shares of Wal-Mart fell on the news. But the pain was selective- and looking at what sold and what sat on the shelves- is a window into what's going on in retail. SOUNDBITE: JOE FELDMAN, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, TELSEY ADVISORY GROUP (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Grocery was fine and we are still seeing grocery fine. But if you remove that from the table Apparel was a better category for them. That's been mixed from a lot of the retailers that have been reporting so far and next week I think it will be mixed as well. Home was actually pretty good. They are still seeing home furnishing trends being very strong. Bed and bath. Sporting goods was actually better than we had expected so I think that might bode well for Dick's Sporting Goods. We do think next week, back to the home theme, Home Depot, Lowe's will do well. Pets was another good category. So I think that bodes well for Petsmart." Also tough for Wal-Mart- international sales were not up as much as hoped. The company says it will be doing more to control costs in those markets.

 The 10 fastest billion-dollar exits for VC-backed companies CB Insights Aug. 23, 2016, 11:00 AM 955 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart bought Jet.com for $3.3B a little over a year after the site was officially launched. We used CB Insights data to analyze what some of the other quick turnarounds there were for startups. Specifically we looked at companies that exited for more than $1B+ and the number of days from their first institutional financing. Q2 VC Report: Big drops in deals and funding Airwatch represents the fastest acquisition post-investment, selling the company to VMWare about a year after raising a gigantic $200M growth equity round (Airwatch was bootstrapped for the decade prior to the fundraise so the company was definitely more mature than a company like Jet.com). Biotech company Flexus Biosciences sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb for a total of $1.25B after raising an initial $15M from Kleiner Perkins less than 500 days prior. Jet is the fifth fastest flip. The largest quick acquisition on this list is Whatsapp, acquired by Facebook with a final price tag of $22B. Facebook acquired three companies on this list: Oculus, Instagram, and Whatsapp, highlighting their penchant to snap up emerging consumer platforms quickly.

Oanh Ha and Rajhkumar K Shaaw Bloomberg NEW! HIGHLIGHT AND SHARE Highlight text to share via Facebook and Twitter Getty Images ADVERTISEMENT Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it's reviewing Welspun India Ltd.'s cotton certification records, joining Target Corp. to scrutinize the supplier over cheaper bedsheets being passed off as premium Egyptian cotton and sending the Indian company's stock down by daily limits for a second session. The world's largest retailer plans to hold further discussions with Welspun and "handle it appropriately" if any issues are discovered, according to spokeswoman Marilee McInnis. Wal-Mart is Welspun's third-largest customer, behind Target, which said late last week it had pulled sheets and pillowcases off its shelves after discovering they were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton. It also terminated all businesses with the supplier. A Welspun representative didn't immediately have a comment when reached by Bloomberg News. Part of a roughly $3 billion conglomerate headed by Balkrishan Goenka and with interests spanning textiles, steel, pipes, energy and infrastructure, Welspun said it manufactures every fifth towel sold in the US. and counts J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc among its customers. "This is a serious issue," said S.P. Tulsian, who runs investment advisory firm sptulsian.com. "On one hand the company has been talking of $2 billion top-line by 2020 and on the other hand the U.S. is a very big market for them. Now that goal of $2 billion revenue will be difficult to meet." Welspun fell another 20 percent to 65.85 rupees on the Mumbai exchange. The 36 percent two-day slide -- the steepest since 1999 -- cut the company's market value to 66.2 billion rupees ($990 million). Welspun Group said it wants to become one of India's top 50 groups by market value by 2020, according to its website. Sumant Kumar, an analyst at Elara Securities India Pvt., cut his rating on the stock to sell from buy. Goenka's family and group companies hold about 74 percent in the home-textiles supplier, with his wife Dipali Goenka acting as CEO and joint managing director. On Monday, a company connected to founder Goenka bought 500,000 Welspun shares in the open market, according to an exchange filing. Welspun said it's reviewing its supply chain and would hire a "Big Four" accounting firm to examine its processes. The company is engaging with key customers, managing director Rajesh Mandawewala said during a conference call Monday. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., Welspun's biggest customer, and Wal-Mart sell the company's 500 and 800 thread count sheets online under the Crowning Touch label. They retail for as much as $175 a set. "It is likely that other customers too will start raising questions over Welspun's supplies," said Arun Kejriwal, a director at Kejriwal Research & Investment Pvt. in Mumbai. Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Sales to Target amounted to $90 million in the fiscal year that ended in March, or about 10 percent of the company's revenue, the company said. Egyptian cotton, which has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread than other cotton, often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be of higher quality.

With the ease of online shopping and fast, free shipping from subscription services like Amazon Prime and Wal-Mart’s ShippingPass, some consumers are shying away from physical retail locations. Shoppers prefer stores to the web for now, but online shopping is growing at a fast pace. E-commerce sales jumped 15.5% in the first quarter of 2016 compared with a year earlier, while total retail sales increased by only 2.2% during that time, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Some companies are shutting down branches due to lack of profit. Kmart and Sears are in the process of closing 78 locations, and Macy’s recently announced plans to close about 100 stores. But retailers are finding creative ways to make in-store shopping more enticing and prevent it from becoming obsolete. “There’s no store customer or e-commerce customer, there’s just customers, and customers shop increasingly as they want,” says Dan Evans Jr., Nordstrom’s business public relations director. “For us to grow and evolve as a company, we need to have a real sense of urgency around staying relevant.” Retailers know that relevancy revolves around technology these days. That’s why many have taken steps to become more up-to-date. Here’s a look at some of their tactics, how they work to your advantage and where they fall short. 1. Interactive kiosks Retailers are attempting to turn stores into more engaging spaces by incorporating elements of the online shopping experience, including screens that mimic smartphones and computers. Macy’s has tested kiosks in some of its top-performing department stores, including those at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio, and New York’s Herald Square. These touch-screen centers perform a range of duties, from completing in-store pickups to providing tourism information. Kiosks can be helpful if you can’t find a sales associate or if you’d rather shop solo. The benefits: You can browse through merchandise and information and potentially complete transactions by yourself. And there’ll likely be no line, so you can get in and out of the store quickly. The drawbacks: In many ways, this experience is no better than shopping online — except, of course, you don’t get to sit on the couch in your pajamas. 2. Creating a cell phone haven Companies hope that if mobile users’ needs are met, they’ll spend more time — and money — in stores. Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic offer free Wi-Fi to shoppers. So do the Apple Store and Target. But Wi-Fi is no good unless your mobile device is charged enough to use it. Some businesses have you covered there, too. Through its partnership with ChargeItSpot, Neiman Marcus has installed phone-charging stations in a majority of its stores; customers can lock up their phones and charge them while they shop. The benefits: With a full battery and access to Wi-Fi, you can compare prices, browse your favorite websites and check your social media feed without eating up your data. The drawbacks: Retailers don’t always have the fastest internet connection. Plus, privacy is a concern. Is the network secure? Is the store collecting your data? Check the terms of use before you connect. 3. Apps and web tools Almost every retailer now has its own free app that shoppers can use at home and in stores. American Eagle Outfitters, Nordstrom, J.C. Penney and Victoria’s Secret are just a few examples. Apps can keep track of your coupons and rewards points at specific stores. With some, you can get reviews and more information about a product by scanning its bar code with your phone’s camera. If you’re in the store and an item is out of stock, these apps can tell you whether it’s available at other nearby locations. Macy’s is taking mobile use a step further. At 10 locations, the department store is rolling out a browser web tool dubbed Macy’s On Call, which uses IBM’s artificial-intelligence platform Watson as an in-store guide for shoppers. Customers can ask for directions to a certain product or department, and they’ll get an answer on their phone. The benefits: You’ll have all the resources you need at your fingertips. These tools make applying discounts and navigating the store more convenient. The drawbacks: Apps take up storage space on your phone, so they might not be worth downloading if you’re an infrequent shopper. And whether you use an app or your browser, retailers can track your shopping behavior for marketing purposes. 4. Smart fitting rooms At some stores, you’ll even find technology in the fitting rooms. For example, some have mirrors that let you create a virtual catalog of sorts, featuring yourself as the model. High-end retailer Neiman Marcus has installed full-length “memory mirrors” at select locations, including San Francisco’s Union Square. You just need to enter your email address and create a PIN to use them. These mirrors are more like screens that use cameras to capture pictures and shoot 360-degree videos, so shoppers can get a complete view of the outfits they try on. Customers can also scroll through inventory and send the images to their email addresses or share them with friends for a second opinion. Other places, like Bloomingdales, have tablets in their dressing rooms. These let customers find an item in another size or color or request help from an associate. The benefits: Smart mirrors let you compare ensembles side-by-side, and because they “remember” the images, you won’t have to try the same outfit on multiple times. Tablets are a little less high-tech but still offer convenience. The drawbacks: Again, security might be an issue. Stores have measures in place to protect your privacy, but they could be gathering data, and breaches do happen occasionally. 5. Mobile POS It’s become commonplace for staff to get in on the digital action as well. Chains across the nation, including Lowe’s and Nordstrom, have staff members equipped with mobile point-of-sale devices such as iPhones or tablets. Using these, they can search for inventory, scan price tags, place orders or swipe your credit card when you’re ready to check out. “Our hope is that we can use technology in a way that makes the experience a customer chooses as seamless as possible” says Evans, the Nordstrom public relations official. The benefits: The mobile POS enables fast, one-one-one customer service. It’s almost like having a personal shopper; associates can help you find what you’re looking for online if the store is out of stock or bring the register to you so you don’t have to wait in line. The drawbacks: You may feel pressured to transact, and the speedy checkout process means you’ll have less time to rethink your purchase. Why shop in stores? There’s no doubt that online shopping is convenient and efficient, but there are advantages to shopping in the physical world. Thanks to technological advances, you can shop smarter and more independently in stores than ever before, plus you still have the option to consult an employee if you need assistance. And you’ll get a truer sense of how an item looks, feels or fits in person than you will from a website. As long as shops feel e-commerce sales breathing down their necks, you can expect that they’ll work harder to improve your experience.

Macquarie Strategist Viktor Shvets thinks technology, too much debt, and adverse government policy are responsible for a bleak future. (Courtney Sacco/Odessa American via AP) Do you feel something is wrong with the United States and the global economy? Despite a respectable recovery and low unemployment, many people aren’t happy with their current economic situation or their outlook for the future. From rising prices for basic necessities or schooling, to harsh competition and low pay for lower income jobs, to negative interest rates—the poor and the middle class all have their problems to deal with. Experts in the government and central banks are trying to manage a suboptimal situation but cannot isolate the problem, let alone offer solutions. Or maybe they know what’s wrong but don’t want to talk about it because the truth is too shocking. Enter Viktor Shvets, the global strategist of the investment bank Macquarie Group. He not only dares to think outside the box but also isn’t afraid to openly voice his opinions, which are fascinating and shocking at the same time. Read More The Clinton and Trump Economic Plans: Growing the State or the Private Sector “The private sector will never recover, it will never multiply money again,” he told Epoch Times. His main theme is the “declining return on humans,” which means that in today’s digital world, normal humans don’t grow productivity fast enough to justify more jobs and higher wages as the machines are taking over. It takes time to line up machines, and this time we are replacing humans altogether. — Viktor Shvets, global strategist, Macquarie Group The UBS Stamford, Conn., trading floor in 2008 (L) and in 2016. (UBS Publicity Image; @anilvohra69) “There is no productivity on a global basis. Secular stagnation, technological shifts, monetary policy, all are suppressing productivity growth rates,” he said. But what about technology making humans more productive? Shvets says this was true in the first and second industrial revolution, when displaced jobs, such as the horse-cart driver, eventually morphed into higher-tech and higher-productivity ones, like the taxi driver. However, in this, the third industrial revolution, machines are not augmenting humans, they are replacing them. The self-driving car will completely eliminate the driver. And even in the previous, more-mechanical industrial revolutions, it often took decades for productivity growth to recover and for jobs to come back, and only after higher-productivity sectors dominated the majority of the economy. “We are now on the sharp end of the technology S curve. It started in the late 1970s, it’s picked up in the last 5 to 10 years, productivity growth rates go down, not up. It takes time to line up machines, and this time we are replacing humans altogether,” he said. And not only lower-skilled jobs like taxi drivers are threatened. Just look at the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, where you can barely see a human specialist trader anymore. The machines in New Jersey have taken over the trading. (Macquarie Group) Of course, there are companies and sectors in which machines augment people’s productivity, but they are in the minority and also always teeter on the edge of machines replacing humans completely.  “Parts of the economy become extremely competitive, the rest becomes far less competitive. Walmart’s two million employees are less productive than the few hundred thousand people working for Amazon,” said Shvets. Walmart’s revenue per employee was $220,000 at the end of the second quarter of 2016, compared to $1 million per employee at Amazon. As a result, total productivity growth has been negative in the United States for at least a decade, according to the Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco. The so-called Total Factor Productivity fell almost 2 percent annualized in the second quarter of 2016. (Total Factor Productivity, source: Macquarie Group) Leverage In order to counter falling productivity, households and companies, as well as the government, have taken on unsustainable amounts of debt to keep consumption going. “When the economists say we can continue to leverage, as we have done in the last three decades, it lacks understanding of the balance sheet. Even at zero interest rates, at a certain level of debt, you go bankrupt because the private sector loses confidence in the system,” said Shvets. This is the phenomenon of a balance-sheet recession, where the whole balance sheet of the economy must shrink in order to restore confidence in the system and return to private-sector business cycles. Japan is the most famous case; its balance-sheet recession is now 25 years old. But the United States and Europe essentially have the same problem. Since the beginning of 1980, total debt in the United States has increased by a factor of 14 to $63.5 trillion, while GDP has only increased by a factor of 6.2. The debt is not spread evenly, we still live in a tribal world, and it’s easier to start a war than to forgive debt. — Viktor Shvets, global strategist, Macquarie Group Shvets says the world should have actually delevered or paid down the debt to return initiative to the private sector, but thinks people could not accept the levels of pain associated with doing that. “You could eliminate the impact of the overcapacity through deflation. Nobody is prepared to accept that we might have to wipe out decades of growth just to eliminate leverage. Banks go, there are defaults, bankruptcies, layoffs,” he said. (Source: St. Louis Fed.) He thinks the biblical debt jubilee, when slaves would be freed and debt would be forgiven every 50 years, is a nice idea that would also work today if it weren’t for entrenched special interests. “The debt is not spread evenly, we still live in a tribal world, and it’s easier to start a war than to forgive debt,” Shvets said. Global central banks, with their easy money policies of negative interest rates and quantitative easing, are working against a debt deflation scenario, with limited success, according to Shvets. “That was the entire idea of aggressive monetary policies: stimulate investment and consumption. None of that works, there is no evidence. It can impact asset prices, but they don’t flow into the real economy,” he said. “Remember, the people at the Fed and the Bank of England are not supermen, they are people with an above average IQ trying to do a very difficult job in a highly complex environment.” Both overleveraging, easy-money policies and technological shifts are responsible for increasing levels of income inequality across the globe—another hallmark of the previous two industrial revolutions. Fewer people control more of the wealth. According to the World Bank, the U.S. GINI coefficient, which measures inequality, rose from 37.7 in 1986 to 41.1 in 2013. In China, it rose from 27.7 in 1984 to 42.1 in 2010. The higher the coefficient, the higher the concentration of income among a group of people. (Macquarie Group) The Rise of the State So if the private sector won’t recover until most of the debt gets written off, which won’t happen because neither the people nor the elite want it to happen, who is left to pick up the slack? “Nobody has visibility; private sector signals have died. The private sector has no idea what to do. The more aggressive the public sector becomes, the less visibility the private sector has. They don’t spend and invest the way they should,” said Shvets. According to him, the state will take over—it’s only a question of how. If you are dominated by the public sector, then investment in the traditional sense is no longer possible. — Viktor Shvets, global strategist, Macquarie Group “You are essentially in the world where public sector signals dominate,” he said, giving the example of how it’s the global central banks that are moving markets more than earnings or trade data. “If the private sector refuses to multiply the money, then the state will do that.” This move toward the state brings its own issues, however. “The public sector doesn’t have cycles like the private sector. Investment theory evolved around cycles. If you are dominated by the public sector, then investment in the traditional sense is no longer possible.” Business-cycle theory centers around the expansion and contraction of money and credit, as well as business activity, earnings, and stock valuations. If money and credit are abundant, businesses invest, expand, and hire people; consumption picks up, so company profits improve. Stocks tend to rise in tandem with an expansionary cycle. Viktor Shvets, global strategist of Macquarie Group, in an interview with Bloomberg, in this undated screenshot. (Bloomberg) This is not true for the state; public investment in infrastructure and central banks printing money create a super cycle, with a huge bust at the end. The S&P 500 is trading at an all-time high despite the second most expensive valuations since the 1999 stock market bubble and despite the fact that total S&P 500 earnings fell during every reporting period since the third quarter of 2015. The market is banking on the Fed to turn on the money spigot again, at any time. “The public cycle is aligned with politics. People always avoid radical solutions, so they are doing a little bit here, a little bit there, to keep the Humpty Dumpty on the wall,” said Shvets. Eventually, if the private sector doesn’t recover and the state assumes more power, Shvets thinks countries will move toward fascism and communism again, just like in the 1920s and 1930s, when the economic framework was comparable to today’s. The state will decide where capital goes — Viktor Shvets, global strategist, Macquarie Group “Younger people like communism because it is inclusive, paints a bright picture of the future. Nobody believes it, but it looks good and young people don’t have anything to lose. Older people tend to be more racist, less inclusive, protectionist, anti-immigration, rather than believe the bright future of everyone holding hands together in a sunny place,” said Shvets. Either way, the outcome could be similar to what took place in the 1930s in Europe and the United States—less globalization and more power to the state. “The pendulum is definitely swinging towards the state, and the state will decide where capital goes,” said Shvets. One way or another it will have to take on most of the private sector debt, maybe through the nationalization of banking and insurance industries. “It’s impossible to see how you can unwind the economy’s debt load any other way.” Nevertheless, there are some government programs that Shvets thinks could enhance human productivity and benefit the private sector, like government research and development (think of NASA in the 1960s), as well as re-skilling and retraining programs that would enable workers to compete with machines. In the long-term, Shvets thinks that biotechnology could play a role in that process, but we are a long way off. How to Invest Despite all these challenges, Shvets still recommends that his clients invest in certain types of stocks. “The outcomes of the next 10 to 15 years could be quite dramatic. How do you invest in that climate? There are only two ways of investing. The first is, assume non-mean reversion. The private sector will never recover. The only thing left would be the public sector cycle.” This means we can conveniently forget about corporate profits, or valuations like the price-earnings ratio of the S&P 500, as many investors already have. The only thing that matters is public sector activity in the form of central bank intervention or government stimulus programs. If that is the case, gold goes back $100 per ounce. — Viktor Shvets, global strategist, Macquarie Group An extreme example of this cycle is perhaps Venezuela. While the country is going up in flames, people don’t have enough food, and the currency is dissolving itself in a vicious hyperinflation, the stock market has actually gone up 10 times since the beginning of 2012. Only recently has reality caught up with stocks, and the market has given up 15 percent of its gains since the beginning of the year. “Buy quality sustainable growth, high returns on equity. Companies capable of generating a high return on equity through margins and without leverage. Don’t worry about the price-to-earnings ratio, there is no mean reversion,” said Shvets. “And don’t own any financials.” Good advice. The stock price of the likes of Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse have been decimated this year. The share prices of Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Credit Suisse AG (CSGN) have both lost almost 50 percent of their value this year (Source: Google Finance) The other option is to invest along some pretty grim themes that benefit from the new trends identified by Shvets. “People are still going back to 20th-century thematics, it’s so old-fashioned.” None of the new trends can be described as inspirational or uplifting, but the Macquarie portfolio reflecting the themes has bested the MSCI World Index by almost 30 percent since the beginning of 2015. “The biggest theme is declining return on humans; the replacement of humans; biotech; augmentation of humans; opium for the people, like computer games and gambling,” Shvets said. Performance of the Macquarie Group Thematics portfolio (Macquarie Group) Then there are themes catering to geopolitical risk and potential regional wars or civil uprisings, like detention and prison centers, weapons, and drones. Another theme supports the aging demography in the West, so companies holding hospitals, funeral operators, and psychiatric institutions should do well. On the positive side, Shvets notes technological disrupters like Amazon and Google. All those companies should be independent of the government and long-term structural shifts. “They go on no matter what.” If readers shy away from profiting from these themes, there is always gold. Related Coverage What Is Going On With US Stocks? “If you think of gold, the only way gold loses is if normal business and private sector cycles come back. If that is the case, gold goes back $100 per ounce. The other outcomes deflation—stagflation, hyperinflation—are all good for gold.” As for a return to a gold standard, Shvets has more bad news: “Gold standards come back after the war, not before the war.” Editor’s Picks China’s Growing Trade Deficit with US, Rising State and Corporate Debt: Very ‘Concerning’ Says Congressional Report What Trump’s Presidency Means for Health Care Sector Grass-Roots and Professional, Anti-Trump Protests Seek Healing and Political Change Receive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter Important stories from around the world, in your inbox daily.

(Academy.com) Work is underway on a new Academy Sports + Outdoors at an empty Walmart at Memorial Parkway and Drake Avenue in Huntsville. The Texas retailer confirmed today it will launch a 63,000-square-foot store at the site, which is being developed by RD Management of New York. The building has been vacant since fall 2014 when Walmart moved from the property to a new facility on 3031 Memorial Parkway S.W. Academy, which is also expanding in Florence, said the new Huntsville store will bring 100 jobs to the area. "We're looking forward to opening next year and continuing to be an active member of the Huntsville community," said Ken Attaway, Academy Sports + Outdoors executive vice president and chief operating officer.  Redevelopment concept plan for the former Walmart site at Memorial Parkway and Drake Avenue in Huntsville. (RDManagement.com) In addition to footwear and apparel, the Huntsville store will have team sports and golf products, patio sets, barbecue grills, and hunting, fishing and camping equipment and gear. The chain also will provide multiple services, including scope mounting, bore sighting, line winding/spooling, propane exchange, racquet stringing, hunting and fishing licenses, and local team clothing and novelty items. Academy currently has more than 210 locations in 15 states. The nearest stores are on U.S. 72 in the Madison area and Wimberly Drive in Decatur. A redevelopment concept plan of the property on the RD Management website shows up to 36,000 square feet of additional retail at the site, which has a two-way average traffic count of 93,000 cars per day. Demographics show there is a population of 63,419 and average household income of $65,137 within three miles of the development. "There is nothing new to announce at this time," said Thomas Mirandi, vice president of real estate for RD Management. "As soon as we have updates, we will share them with you."

Walmart, Home Depot Relying More On Physical Stores To Complete Online Orders Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart, Home Depot Relying More On Physical Stores To Complete Online Orders Image courtesy of Nicholas Eckhart August 23, 2016 3:09 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler where's my stuff? walmart home depot inventory online orders stores retail fulfilling orders Walmart’s recent $3 billion acquisition of e-commerce company Jet.com may have been the retailer’s way of spurring its online business, but the largest retailer in the world has already been mingling its physical stores with its online presence. Much like fellow big box store, Home Depot, Walmart has increasingly used its vast network of stores to fulfill online purchases.  Business Insider reports that in addition to five large distribution centers and 100 small e-commerce facilities across the country, Walmart now uses 80 of its 4,500 stores in the U.S. as areas to pack and ship orders placed online. As with its purchase of Jet.com, Walmart appears to be using its physical store order fulfillment as a way to keep up with Amazon, which has 180 fulfillment centers across the country. By using the physical stores, Walmart is able to spread out orders, matching inventory to the area in which orders are being shipped. This could also help the company in fulfilling its Amazon Prime competitor — the $50/year Shipping Pass, which offers two-day shipping on products. Like Walmart, Home Depot has begun to rely more on its physical stores to package and either ship or hold online orders for pickup. About 42% of the retailer’s online orders are picked up at physical stores, Business Insider reports. That figure will likely grow, CEO Craig Menear says, with the complete launch of “BODFS,” or “buy online and deliver from store.” The program allows customers to pick a shortened delivery option that sends orders directly to a local store. So far, BODFS has launched at 700 of Home Depot’s 2,200 stores. The system seems to be a bit of a contrast from Home Depot’s previous push to cut back on the amount of inventory it holds in-store. In June, the retailer said it would start keeping inventory levels flat or slightly down, and instead depend on distribution centers for online sales.

Travis B. Taylor, 36, of Blakely, Ga., Melissa A. Sinquefield,30, of Buford and Jocelyn Gerstenlauer, 19, of Auburn are accused of using "movie set" money to purchase approximately $1,000 worth of lawn equipment, which was then returned to a different store for a cash refund, according to a news release. In an afternoon update Tuesday, police said Gerstenlauer has turned herself in, and Sinquefield was "aware of the warrants and has made plans to turn herself in in the upcoming days." Taylor is accused of passing the fake money, which was marked with "for motion picture use only," at Gerstenlauer's cash register. Gerstenlauer never returned to work after a loss prevention officer at the Wal-mart, which is located on Sardis Church Road, discovered the bills in her drawer. Sinquefield returned the merchandise to the store on Ga. 20 near I-985 later that day, July 19. Taylor is accused of a similar crime in Early County (where Blakely is located), and has active warrants in that jurisdiction. Authorities believe Taylor and Sinquefield have left metro-Atlanta, and could be in Early County. Taylor, Sinquefield and Gerstenlauer are all charged with first degree forgery; Sinquefield also faces charges of theft by deception and violation of her probation. Anyone with information on any of the suspects' whereabouts is asked to contact Gwinnett County Police.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Teachers don't often get the adulation they deserve, so when a stranger thanked seventh grade teacher Sabrina Drude for what she was doing for underprivileged kids and showered her with an unexpected gesture of kindness, she could not help but burst into happy tears. Before the start of every school year, Drude would shop for supplies for her students at Wal-Mart. This year, she was noticed by a man standing in line at the counter, according to CBS News. Drude's cart was filled with notebooks, pencils, and markers, and the man behind her was curious why she had so many school supplies. Drude, who is a teacher at Francis Scobee Middle School in San Antonio, Texas, explained to the man that she is teaching in a very low socioeconomic area, where kids cannot always afford to buy their own supplies. Touched by Drude's concern for the children, the man offered to pay for her items. But Drude declined, saying she could not accept his money. When $97 flashed on the cash register, the man named Lester Brown would not take "no" for an answer. "He said, 'Put your wallet away,' and I just started crying," Drude shared. "That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard." The teacher could not understand why anyone would do something nice to a complete stranger like her. Brown explained to her that it's "because teachers don't get the recognition that they deserve." Drude is grateful to Brown, and she plans on telling her students about the kind man who paid for their school supplies. "This is exactly the type of person I want to influence my kids to be," said Drude, who plans on inviting Brown to join her class for a pizza party. "I want him to inspire my kids just like he inspired me; if any of my kids grew up to be half the man he is I'd be very proud."

The Gloves are Off: Walmart (WMT) Beating Amazon (AMZN) At Its Own Game? Walmart’s (WMT) entry in the online retail market is giving Amazon.com (AMZN) a run for its money. August 23, 2016 WSP The world’s larger retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is using its massive chain of stores to outperform Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the online grocery segment and its efforts are paying off. Walmart is actually giving Amazon a run for its money by introducing a slew of new pickup stores for convenient deliveries. In a pre-recorded earnings call last week, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company just added 30 more grocery pickups in the US markets during the second quarter. The service is now available to more than 60 markets and virtually 400 locations in and around the US. “It’s gratifying to see how much this service helps our customers save time,” McMillon said. Walmart’s online grocery service works by enabling customers to place their grocery orders online. Customers can choose the time to pick up the orders and then pull in a designated parking area when arriving at a Walmart store. From there, an attendant will load up the groceries to the customer’s car. The grocery chain is not done yet. A source familiar with the matter said the conglomerate is bent on rolling out the service to additional markets. But don’t expect Walmart to do heavy promotions on the service-the company wants to grow it from a grassroots perspective. It seems like the strategy is working. Pictures of smiling customers started cropping up all over social media, most are young mothers. Approximately 90% of online users are repeat customers. The service is appealing to millenial moms in particular with baby products and diapers consistently being top sellers. Some of the most frequently ordered items are dairy, produce, and meats. The reason why Walmart’s online grocery service is so popular among young mothers is that the service enables them to get out of the house with the baby in tow, pop their trunk once they arrive in store and have someone load the ordered items up. Despite the onslaught of e-commerce, Walmart is able to keep up with its rivals, particularly its nemesis Amazon, thanks to a strong urban concept and robust contributions from perishable goods. Walmart recently posted an excellent second quarter earnings, exceeding the street’s expectations. The retail chain also raised its annual guidance even as competitors were struggling to generate decent numbers. Walmart is also benefiting from the shutting down of poor performing stores and altering its merchandise combination. In addition, in-store sales open to more than one year were up for the 8th consecutive quarter. Walmart recorded a net income of $3.8 billion, up 8.6% from last year’s comparable quarter. The world’s largest retailer also reported EPS of $1.21, well above analyst estimates of $1.02. Although online sales are affecting volumes of brick and mortar chains, Walmart is countering it by offering new deals, smoother service and building an experience that its online service lacks. The company is also working to increase wages, revamp stores, and develop workplace culture to boost sales.

The foundation will award grants between $25,000 and $200,000 to Indiana nonprofit organizations that help underserved populations. The grant will fund programs that focus on hunger relief and healthy eating, career opportunity, disaster preparedness and community engagement. The foundation awarded $595,000 earlier this year to 13 Indiana non-profit organizations for their programs that address hunger and food insecurity in communities throughout the state. “At Walmart, our mission is to create opportunities so people can live better,” said Marlene Hunter-Lammie, regional general manager, in a statement. “In addition to the thousands of community service hours our associates perform and the in-kind donations that are spread throughout the communities we serve, these grants allow us to help local nonprofit organizations fulfill their mission and continue on their path of service.” The Walmart Foundation was founded in 2008 and is helped by associate-led State Advisory Councils to identify needs within their state, review grant requests and make funding recommendations to the Foundation. Applicants must have a current 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status in order to be eligible for a grant. Applications are only accepted online at http://corporate.walmart.com/_foundation_/apply-for-grants/state-giving-program.

The last few quarterly reports have been marked by falling revenue and slipping sales at comparable stores, and Q2 wasn’t exactly one for the books when it came to physical retail. Or maybe it was — but not the books retailers would like to revisit. In a segment that was weak on the whole, consumer electronics were among the weakest links in the chain. Target took a beating from shareholders after it notched another lackluster earnings performance — a performance that CEO Brian Cornell said was at least partially attributable to weakness in consumer electronics, and particularly Apple products. Walmart, on the other hand, managed to pull off its second quarter of relative strength in a weak field, but even Big Blue reportedly sluggish consumer interest in tablets, TVs and smartphones. Today it was Best Buy’s turn at the plate. Though many analysts were predicting a rude shock to the other Big Blue’s investors when the results hit today, it seems numbers were better than expected. Revenue was up, and so were same store sales. Investor confidence spiked in early hours trading — the company’s stock priced bounced up 16 percent as Best Buy forecasts end of the year strength that will (slightly) more than counterbalance the rocky start of early 2016. So how did Best Buy beat The Street, and is the outlook a lot better than it was last week?   By The Numbers  Best Buy had a lot of green arrows to report to its investors this morning when numbers for the second quarter of the year hit the wires. Revenue clocked in at $8.53 billion — about $5 million more than a year ago, beating analysts’ $8.39 billion average estimate. Net income was also on the rise, up to $198 million, or 61 cents per share in Q2 , a notable increase of $164 million, or 46 cents per share, from a year earlier. Profit was 57 cents a share, excluding some items, the Richfield, Minnesota-based company noted Tuesday in a statement, and well in excess of the 43 cents/$8.40 billion average that analysts were predicting. “We continue to expect the slight revenue decline in the first half to be offset by slight growth in the back half,” Chief Financial Officer Corie Barry noted in a statement that accompanied the earnings release. Best Buy’s revenue pickup snaps a long cold spell. The firm had seen revenues decline for the previous three quarters before this latest report’s turnaround. The electronics retailer also managed some growth where declines were expected, though in both cases the the numbers were small. Same store sales growth managed to stay in positive territory with 0.8 percent growth — not exactly a barnburner of a number, but a lot better than the 0.6 decline the experts had been looking to see. The largest U.S. consumer electronics retailer also forecast revenue of $8.8-8.9 billion and a profit of 43-47 cents per share for the third quarter. Best Buy also managed big growth in its online channels. At 24 percent, it was well ahead of the growth Walmart notched (11.8 percent) and the U.S. average eCommerce growth rate of about 15 percent. So investors enthusiasm in early hours trading is pretty understandable; Best Buy is notching growth numbers when there was every reason to expect it wouldn’t.   Fighting Gravity  Best Buy’s strength comes at a time and in a segment where competitors online (especially Amazon) and in the physical world (especially Walmart) are coming on particularly strong. Amazon’s Prime Day was a retail even in itself, and it sent a lot of customers to the web looking for brilliant bargains on competitor sites. Best Buy also showed strength in consumer electronics, where its competitors are struggling. Consumer enthusiasm for wearable technology, appliances and home theater gear seemed to more than balance out the relative softness in smartphones and tablets. CEO Hubert Joly is also widely credited for undertaking an aggressive and organized program to both close underperforming stores and better optimize the retailer’s existing store and warehouse infrastructure. Charlie O’Shea, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said Best Buy’s online sales growth of 24 percent was “impressive,” and noted that Joly had demonstrated that proper management can make a big difference to the fortunes of struggling retail players. “[Best Buy’s second-quarter performance] is evidence that a well-managed brick-and-mortar retailer with a well-thought-out strategy that successfully utilizes its physical assets can thrive as it transitions to a true multi-channel retailer,” O’Shea noted. The fact that Best Buy is managing some legitimate growth in a tough atmosphere raises interesting questions, because Best Buy is not an anomaly. Walmart and TJX are also big-store retailers who are effecting at least something of a turnaround and keeping consumers coming in. Can Best Buy keep it up? It’s hard to say. The answer is likely dependent on how consumers feel about consumer electronics during the holiday season. But those appliance sales are eye-catching, since they sync up with what Home Depot and Lowe’s are reporting as well. It’s worth watching to see if Best Buy can keep riding the waves as they come.

The supermarket chain, which has 626 stores across the U.K., recently confirmed on Twitter that Apple Pay is something it is "currently trialling in a few of our stores," but it remains unclear if the testing will lead to a wider rollout in the future. A few Asda customers have recently tweeted about the newly enabled Apple Pay support at superstore locations in Aberdeen, Scotland and Ferring, a small village located about 60 miles southwest from London, England. @Hyperglaucoma Thanks, I believe this is something we're currently trialling in a few of our stores. Thanks, Beth— Asda Service Team (@AsdaServiceTeam) August 15, 2016 As recently as August 12, a support representative tweeted that Asda does not currently accept Apple Pay, but that it does accept contactless payments in some of its stores. Apple Pay generally works where contactless payments are accepted, but some retailers have specific policies against accepting Apple Pay. In 1999, Asda was purchased by Walmart, which recently completed a nationwide launch of its own QR code-based mobile payments solution Walmart Pay in the United States. Walmart was initially committed to the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) consortium and its now indefinitely postponed payments service CurrentC. In related news, Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank, and digital banking service B introduced Apple Pay support for cardholders in the U.K. last week.

In 1965, when the Asquith brothers approached Associated Dairies to run the butchery departments within their small store chain, a merger was proposed.

Sainsbury's don't support it yet. ASDA have a very small trial. It's only Waitrose and M&S that have been offering contactless for some time (and Apple Pay since it launched). At first I thought it was about data grabbing on your shopping habits, but everyone has a loyalty card to do that these days, so you don't really need the payment method to do that. You'd think stores would want to make it as easy as possible for people to spend as much as possible in the way they prefer.

The AtlanticAugust 23, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Democrats and Republicans seem to have a difficult time agreeing on just about anything these days. But one place where they have found common ground: the now defunct Glass-Steagall Act—which once kept commercial and investment banking separate. (It did so by preventing investment banks from taking deposits and mandating that only 10 percent of a commercial bank’s income could come from securities.) The post-Great Depression financial regulation was passed in 1933, and was effectively repealed in 1999. Both presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have included plans to reintroduce the bill in their economic platforms. The argument for the act is that it could have prevented (or at least dampened) the 2008 financial crisis, and that reinstating it could ward off future ones. Is that the case? The Atlantic’s editors reached out to economists and experts in financial regulation to ask them why Glass-Steagall is seeing renewed popularity right now, and what they think would make America’s financial system safer in the future. Recommended: When T.G.I. Friday's Loses Its Flair The responses below have been lightly edited for clarity. Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and former Secretary of Labor from 1993 to 1997 Some argue Glass-Steagall wouldn’t have prevented the 2008 crisis because the real culprits were non-banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. But that's baloney. These non-banks got their funding from the big banks in the form of lines of credit, mortgages, and repurchase agreements. If the big banks hadn’t provided them the money, the non-banks wouldn’t have got into trouble. And why were the banks able to give them easy credit on bad collateral? Because Glass-Steagall was gone. I’ve also heard bank executives claim there’s no reason to resurrect Glass-Steagall, because none of the big banks actually failed. This is like arguing lifeguards are no longer necessary at beaches where no one has drowned. It ignores the fact that the big banks were bailed out. If the government hadn’t thrown them lifelines, many would have gone under. Their balance sheets were full of junky paper, non-performing loans, and worthless derivatives. They were bailed out because they were too-big-to-fail. And the reason for resurrecting Glass-Steagall is we don’t want to go through that ever again. My conclusion: We need to resurrect Glass-Steagall. We also need to bust up the big too-big-to-fail banks. Their platoons of lawyers are already busily rolling back Dodd-Frank. Stephen G. Cecchetti, a professor at Brandeis International Business School and Kermit Schoenholtz, the director of the Center for Global Economy and Business at NYU Stern School of Business Recommended: Sometimes, Getting to Church With a Baby and a Full-Time Job Is Just Too Hard In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-2009, voters want assurance that the U.S. financial system is safe and that the government will not be tempted again to bail out the country’s banks and bankers. Some people blame the crisis on the 1999 repeal of the 1934 Glass-Steagall Act, which had segmented investment and commercial banking in an effort to limit risk taking. In our view, however, separating investment and commercial banking would not have prevented the financial crisis, and its re-imposition will not prevent the next one. What made the crisis so deep were practices that were completely legal and have little to do with Glass-Steagall. For example, many financial institutions that depended heavily on short-term funding operated with very few liquid assets and almost no capital. Some of the largest firms also used derivatives that allowed them to conceal extraordinary risks. The scandal is that many risky behaviors remain insufficiently addressed. To make finance safe—to prevent runs, credit crunches, and the need for government bailouts—the financial system must be made more resilient to disturbances that undermine the balance sheets of intermediaries. This means requiring greater capital and liquidity buffers, treating the activities of financial intermediaries alike regardless of who is performing them (whether it is a bank, a money market fund, or some other type of “shadow bank”) and modernizing the financial plumbing (including short-term financing mechanisms, collateral rules, and derivatives trading). These changes, combined with a streamlining of the U.S. regulatory apparatus itself, will reduce the incentives to take risks that trigger crises and bailouts, while making the system capable of absorbing the potentially large and unforeseen shocks that will inevitably come. Unfortunately, regulators face powerful opposition from politically connected financial intermediaries and their clients, all of whom benefit from high leverage and implicit, taxpayer-financed, government support. Viewed from this perspective, the focus on Glass-Steagall is a damaging distraction from the job of designing and implementing effective reforms that truly make our financial system safe. John Berlau, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Recommended: Al-Qaeda Has Been at War With the United States for 20 Years Election years are a time when politicians put on their favorite pair of rose-colored glasses and make future plans with an idealized view of the past. This year, that shiny object for many in both parties is Glass-Steagall. Glass-Steagall is touted as being of progressive origins, reining in big Wall Street banks, and bringing stability to the financial sector. But none of these claims square with reality. First, the law’s sponsors, Senators Carter Glass of Virginia and Henry Steagall of Alabama, were not progressives but “Dixiecrats” who championed the “Jim Crow” segregated American South. Glass helped design Virginia’s poll tax and literacy test for the express purpose, in his own words, of ensuring “the complete supremacy of the white race in the affairs of government.” Glass’s horrific views on race don’t translate into him being automatically wrong on everything else, but they do at least warrant much more skepticism of his other ideas on public policy. Second, since Glass-Steagall forbade “Main Street” commercial banks from venturing into investment banking, it actually protected Wall Street investment banks such as Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs from competition, enabling them to get bigger. Through the 1980s, the Securities Industry Association, a trade group for investment banks, lobbied and litigated against any loosening of the law. And in the end, it was pure investment banks such as Bear and Lehman Brothers—neither of which had merged with commercial banks—that were the first dominoes to fall in the financial crisis. “In the financial industry, policy makers have mistakenly thought an answer to ensuring stability is to limit competition.” To really curb the problem of “systemic risk”—or banks that are “too big to fail”—we must bring to the financial sector what virtually every other field of American business possesses: competition. Companies such as Borders and Blockbuster once dominated their industries but their implosions—while difficult for employees and stockholders—didn’t trigger a crisis. This is largely because competitors were standing ready to absorb demand from their customers. But in the financial industry, policy makers have mistakenly thought an answer to ensuring stability is to limit competition. Since 2010, federal regulators have approved only two new banks to operate in the U.S. Before then, even in the depths of the savings-and-loan crisis, more than 100 new banks per year would get the green light from regulators to open. Also, unlike virtually every other industrialized nation, the U.S. effectively bans non-financial corporations from owning bank affiliates. During the George W. Bush administration, some of the best-run American corporations—including Walmart, Home Depot, and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway—tried and failed to get regulatory approval to create banking units. By contrast, in the United Kingdom, one out of eight pounds [units of currency] are taken from the cash machines of Tesco Bank, a division of the retail giant Tesco. And Canada and Mexico have allowed Walmart to operate the very banking units there that were denied to them by regulators here. Financial stability can also be bolstered by creating special bankruptcy laws for the financial sector and limiting taxpayer-backed deposit insurance for the wealthiest savers, but allowing more competition must be at the forefront of any true financial reform. Sheila Bair, president of Washington College and former Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under President George W. Bush Repeal of Glass-Steagall, by itself, did not cause the crisis but it did exacerbate it. Glass-Steagall repeal was part of a broader movement in the late 1990s and early 2000s toward the idea of “self-correcting” markets—that banks knew better than regulators how to manage risk and regulate themselves. Even more damaging than Gramm-Leach-Bliley was the Commodity Futures Modernization Act which essentially made derivatives markets out of bounds for any regulatory authority—including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and state insurance regulators. New “risk-based” capital standards, which provided highly generous capital treatment for mortgage-backed securities, derivatives contracts, and other risky assets, encouraged mega-banks to take on excessive levels of leverage and load up on assets which were in fact, high-risk. As a result, investment banks, in particular, had little cushion to absorb losses when the housing market turned and mortgage losses mounted. And those hundreds of billions of losses on the underlying mortgages translated into trillions of losses on derivatives contracts. It is important to understand that not all supporters of reinstating Glass-Steagall are financial reformers. There is some (quiet) Wall Street support as well. I think their hope is that by forcing investment banks to separate from commercial banking, the investment banks would once again be free of prudential oversight by the Fed. “There is too-big-to-fail and then there is simply too big.” To be sure, Glass-Steagall repeal gave birth to larger, more complex institutions which were “too big to fail” given the regulatory tools available during the crisis. So, even if repeal did not drive the crisis, it certainly contributed to the need for bailouts of these behemoths. Another negative outcome of Glass-Steagall repeal, which is frequently overlooked, is the increase of political and market power by the mega-banks. There is too-big-to-fail and then there is simply too big. Politicians, media, think tanks—all are influenced in one way or the other by these powerful financial institutions. And given their tremendous market influence, even large corporations can be fearful about taking them on. Pre-Gramm-Leach-Bliley, the commercial banks and investment banks were frequently fighting with each other and offsetting each other’s agendas in Congress. You no longer have that dynamic. I’m supportive of reinstating Glass-Steagall—particularly if it separates derivatives dealing from commercial banking. I don’t think that is an activity that should be included in the safety net and backed by things like FDIC insurance. But even more important is a dramatic strengthening of capital requirements for large banks, using a “leverage ratio,” not a risk-based capital standard. Risk-based rules do not work—they are static when risks are dynamic, subject to political influence and gaming by banks through their risk models. A 10 percent minimum leverage ratio—meaning that a mega-bank would have to fund itself with at least 10 percent equity and no more than 90 percent debt—would be the most effective thing we could do to stabilize our financial system and make sure that it is resilient during times of economic stress. Helen Garten, a former law professor at Rutgers University The rise of populism in both political parties and lingering anti-bank sentiment after the recession have fueled the movement to reinstate Glass-Steagall. Nostalgia is a factor as well. There is a perception that, back in the day of Glass-Steagall (the 1930s through the 1990s), financial institutions were simpler and safer, protecting us from financial crises. This perception is inaccurate, unfortunately. First, the wall between investment banking and commercial banking constructed by Glass-Steagall was crumbling as early as the 1960s as a result of industry innovation and regulatory encouragement. By the time Glass-Steagall was finally repealed in the late 1990s, banks were already in the securities business. Second, Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis of 2008. Lehman and AIG were not part of diversified bank holding companies. Excessive risk taking by banks occurred in mortgage lending and securitization, both permitted under Glass-Steagall. Finally, although the end of Glass-Steagall did facilitate some mergers between large banks and securities firms, consolidation in the banking industry and the resulting "too big to fail" problem was a serious regulatory concern long before the statute's repeal. It's impossible to go back to 1933. The complexity and interconnectivity of our financial markets are a reality, and managing risk requires a more nuanced approach than simply restoring Glass-Steagall. Some new techniques are already in place, including enhanced capital and liquidity requirements. The challenge for regulation is to find ways to improve banks' internal controls. One approach is to encourage large banks to simplify their complex and interconnected legal and business structures, which will facilitate regulatory oversight and enable more efficient resolution in the event of a failure of one or more units. Ironically, the result of simplification may be greater separation of different financial businesses within diversified banks, an internalized twist on the original Glass-Steagall model. Alex Tabarrok, the director of the Center for Study of Public Choice and the Bartley J. Madden Chair in Economics at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University When Black Lives Matter calls for a restoration of the Glass-Steagall Act we know that the Act has exited the realm of policy and entered that of mythology. No, restoring the Glass-Steagall Act would not end racism. Nor would restoring Glass-Steagall have done much, if anything, to have avoided the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner was correct when he said the problems at the heart of the financial crisis had “nothing to do with Glass-Steagall.” The financial crisis is best understood as a run on the shadow banking system, that collection of financial intermediaries who based their credit creation not on deposits but on repo, money market funds, structured investment vehicles, asset-backed securitizations and other financial structures. Separate commercial and investment banking? Please. The problem was that by 2007 the shadow banking system had become so separated from commercial banking that the Federal Reserve didn’t know that a majority of credit was being generated by the shadow banks. When the crisis came, moreover, the Federal Reserve was not prepared with the right tools to deal with the problem. Ironically, one of the few tools that did work was, thanks to the repeal of Glass-Steagall, the ability to merge investment and commercial banks which was crucial in arranging acquisition of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan and of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America. Glass-Steagall Act was not even a good policy in dealing with the Great Depression. Eugene White [a professor of economics at Rutgers], for example, found that national banks with security affiliates were much less likely to fail than banks without affiliates. Randall Kroszner [a professor at University of Chicago and a former governor of the federal reserve system] and Raghuram Rajan [the governor of the Reserve Bank of India] found that securities issued by unified banks were (ex-post) of higher quality that those issued by investment banks. A powerful book by George Benston [who was a professor at Emory University] went through the entire Pecora hearings which supposedly revealed the problems with unified banking and found them to be a complete sham. Carlos Ramirez [a professor at George Mason University] showed that the separation of commercial and investment banking increased the cost of external finance. My own work unearthed the actual reasons for the separation in a titanic battle between the banking interests of the Morgans and Rockefellers, a real inside job. “Will these new rules prevent a future crisis? Of course not. No rules will prevent all manias, panics and crashes” “Nothing has been done!” may play well in some quarters but the Obama administration has in fact imposed systematic reform on the financial system. Most importantly, capital requirements have been increased (leverage has been reduced), forcing financial intermediaries to have greater skin in the game and to provide a cushion in the event of a fall in asset prices. Moreover, capital requirements have been extended far into the shadow banking system. Most recently, the Fed has imposed a capital surcharge on the biggest institutions i.e. the too big to fail institutions. As Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at the time the capital surcharge on the big players "will confront these firms with a choice: they must either hold substantially more capital, reducing the likelihood that they will fail, or else they must shrink their systemic footprint, reducing the harm that their failure would do to our financial system. Either outcome would enhance financial stability." Ironically, despite the political power of the financial sector it seems that more has been done to raise bank capital ratios than to require homeowners to raise their capital ratios by requiring larger down payments. There is a lesson there. Will these new rules prevent a future crisis? Of course not. No rules will prevent all manias, panics, and crashes but the new rules have reduced the likelihood of a large financial crisis and they have made smaller crises easier to manage. Since no rules will prevent all crises it’s important that the Federal Reserve and the Federal government have room to make credible commitments in the event of a future crisis and that means keeping public debt low. We need an unbalanced budget amendment, a requirement to pay down debt and even run surpluses in good times so that capacity is at the ready in bad times. The fact that we do not yet have our budget fully under control is perhaps the biggest danger moving forward. Lawrence White, professor of economics at New York University’s Stern School of Business The idea of reviving Glass-Steagall is receiving more attention because it seems like a "simple"—and simple to describe—action that would separate investment banking from commercial banking and thereby reduce the size of the largest banks in the U.S. Unfortunately, since the removal of the Glass-Steagall restrictions in 1999 had no connection to the financial crisis of 2008—all of the "bad actors" of the 2008 crisis could have done all of the same things even if Glass-Steagall had been in place—the whole notion of a revival of Glass-Steagall is misguided. A policy for curbing systemic risk would not involve a revival of Glass-Steagall, but does involve rigorous prudential regulation that has a number essential components: first, high capital requirements (relative to risks) for depositories and other financial institutions that have significant systemic connectivity with the overall financial system; substantial liquidity requirements for financial institutions that issue run-able short-term debt; activities limitations for prudentially regulated entities (limited to activities that are "examinable and supervisable"); managerial competency requirements for prudentially regulated entities; large numbers of well-trained and well-paid examiners and supervisors; and lastly, powers of receivership for the regulator.

These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food (Investor's Business Daily) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) may be undergoing a turnaround, which is attracting investor attention. However, dividend-focused investors may now be shying away from the stock. According to Bloomberg Gadfly's Shelly Banjo, the aggregate amount of cash Wal-Mart distributed to investors in the form of dividends actually fell by 1.1 percent in the second quarter compared to a year ago. In fact, this marks only the third time in history this has happened, with the other two occurring in the first quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2014. Related Link: 4 Discount Retailers Reporting Earnings This Week Banjo noted that Wal-Mart is a member of the "dividend aristocrats" — companies that have boosted their dividend payments every year for at least 25 consecutive years. Long-term dividend-focused investors love a stock like Wal-Mart, as the company has actually increased its dividend for 43 straight years and is showing no signs of stopping. However, Banjo stated that Wal-Mart is merely doing "the bare minimum" to "cling to the aristocracy." She pointed out that Wal-Mart's dividend payout was raised by just one penny in each of the past three years, marking a change of policy after years of "steep" increases. Moreover, since Wal-Mart has also instituted a share buyback program, there are now 18 percent fewer shares on the market since 2010, which explains why the total payout to all investors has actually shrunk. On the other hand, Wal-Mart's dividend yield of around 2.7 percent is still superior to the S&P 500's average of 2.1 percent and looks even more attractive compared to the 10-year note yield of around 1.5 percent.

The stock fell by the daily limit of 20 percent for a second day, the biggest two-day tumble since 1999. The examination is underway, and Wal-Mart plans to hold additional conversations with the supplier, company spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said. If any issues are discovered, the retailer plans to “handle it appropriately,” she said. Wal-Mart is Welspun’s third-biggest customer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Welspun supplies a number of products, including sheets, to Wal-Mart, McInnis said. Shares of Welspun fell to as low as 65.85 rupees in Mumbai trading yesterday. On Monday, the company said it is reviewing its supply chain and hiring a “Big Four” accounting firm to examine its processes. Target on Friday pulled the affected products off shelves and cut ties after it discovered sheets and pillowcases supplied by the textile manufacturer were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton. After Monday’s decline, the stock has a market capitalization of US$1.2 billion. Welspun Group said it wants to become one of India’s top 50 groups by market value by 2020, according to its Web site. “It is likely that other customers too will start raising questions over Welspun’s supplies,” said Arun Kejriwal, a director at Kejriwal Research & Investment Pvt in Mumbai. “The stock may have another rough day,” he said. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc, the Indian manufacturer’s biggest customer, and Wal-Mart also carry Welspun Egyptian cotton sheets. Both retailers sell the company’s 500 and 800-thread count sheets online, labeled as Crowning Touch. They retail for as much as US$175 a set. Welspun is engaging with key customers, Welspun managing director Rajesh Mandawewala said on a conference call on Monday. Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Other major clients include J.C. Penney Co and Macy’s Inc. Every fifth towel sold in the US is manufactured by Welspun India, according to the company. Sales to Target amounted to US$90 million in the fiscal year that ended in March, or about 10 percent of the company’s revenue, the company said on Monday. Egyptian cotton, which has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread than other cotton, often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be of higher quality.

Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, plans to hold further discussions with Welspun and "handle it appropriately" if any issues are discovered, according to spokeswoman Marilee McInnis. The chain is also reviewing its other suppliers of Egyptian cotton products out of an abundance of caution, McInnis said. The announcement sent Welspun's shares down by daily limits for a second straight session. Wal-Mart is Welspun's third-largest customer, behind Target, which said late last week it had pulled sheets and pillowcases off its shelves after discovering they were mislabeled as Egyptian cotton. It also terminated all businesses with the supplier. A Welspun representative didn't immediately have a comment when reached by Bloomberg News. Part of a roughly $3 billion conglomerate headed by Balkrishan Goenka - with interests spanning textiles, steel, pipes, energy and infrastructure - Welspun said it manufactures every fifth towel sold in the U.S. and counts J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc among its customers. "This is a serious issue," said S.P. Tulsian, who runs investment advisory firm SPTulsian.com. "On one hand the company has been talking of $2 billion top line by 2020 and on the other hand the U.S. is a very big market for them. Now that goal of $2 billion revenue will be difficult to meet." Welspun fell another 20 percent to 65.85 rupees on the Mumbai exchange Tuesday. The 36 percent two-day slide - the steepest since 1999 - cut the company's market value to 66.2 billion rupees ($990 million). Welspun Group said it wants to become one of India's top 50 groups by market value by 2020, according to its website. Sumant Kumar, an analyst at Elara Securities India Pvt., cut his rating on the stock to sell from buy. Goenka's family and group companies hold about 74 percent in the home-textiles supplier, with his wife Dipali Goenka acting as CEO and joint managing director. On Monday, a company connected to founder Goenka bought 500,000 Welspun shares in the open market, according to an exchange filing. Welspun said it's reviewing its supply chain and would hire a "Big Four" accounting firm to examine its processes. The company is engaging with key customers, managing director Rajesh Mandawewala said during a conference call Monday.

(Ann Millspaugh/Flickr/Creative Commons) In 1960, the city of Detroit was the greatest manufacturing city that the world had ever seen. Nearly 2 million people lived there, and it had the highest per capita income in the United States. That may be hard to believe because today it actually has one of the lowest per capita incomes of all of our major cities. Over the decades more than a million people have left the city, and thousands of abandoned homes have been torn down. But there are still tens of thousands of abandoned dwellings that remain standing, and some have sold for as little as $1 in recent years. Once, Detroit was the envy of the entire planet, but now it has become a global joke and in other countries they love to do news stories about "the ruins of Detroit" to show how rapidly America is rotting and decaying. Sadly, Detroit is far from alone because there are other formerly great manufacturing cities that have declined just as fast as Detroit has. Earlier today, I came across a video that contains footage that someone recently captured as they drove through the city of Detroit at night. To say that the footage is disturbing would be a tremendous understatement. It has become known as a mecca of violent crime and poverty, and now a viral video is giving an unpleasant view of Detroit after dark. The clip, called Driving through Detroit at night, was filmed by a woman who was a passenger in a car going around the Motor City and was posted to Twitter at the weekend. It shows terrifying scenes of gangs gathered on the sidewalk, prostitutes lifting up their skirts and dancing, and even a man being run over by a car on purpose. I would have liked to share the video with you all, but it is just way too graphic. There really are prostitutes lifting up their skirts in the video, and a man really is hit by a vehicle. If you want to watch it for yourself, it is very easy to find on YouTube. But please be warned that children should not be watching this. If you live in a peaceful rural or suburban setting, the kind of behavior displayed in this video may seem very foreign to you. In America today, it is way too easy to allow our televisions to define reality for us. But the warped view of reality that we get through our televisions is nothing like the real world. The real world is cold, cruel and very unforgiving. If you are in the wrong place at the wrong time, the real world will eat you alive. In the city of Detroit today, close to half the population is functionally illiterate, and one survey found that 60 percent of all children in the city are living in poverty. It has been reported that 40 percent of the street lights do not work, and as you can see from the video it is a very frightening place to be after dark. And don't count on the police to help you. The size of the police force in Detroit has been reduced by about 40 percent over the years, and it has been estimated that it takes the Detroit police an average of 58 minutes to respond to a call. If it was just one major city where all of these things were happening, that would be bad enough. Sadly, the truth is that what is happening in Detroit is happening all over the nation. In fact, St. Louis and Memphis now have higher gun crime rates than Detroit does. The listing places St Louis above the notoriously dangerous Detroit which has topped the list in previous years thanks to the city's high gun crime rate. Detroit is now listed as third after Memphis, Tennessee, which had 84.2 violent crimes per 10,000 residents. Birmingham, Alabama, comes in fourth place with 82.8 violent crimes per 10,000 residents while Rockford, Illinois, was fifth with a rate of 76.3. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1527441025" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1527441025" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement Earlier this month, we saw how a major city such as Milwaukee can erupt in flames in just a matter of hours. And in Chicago, some of the major gangs have agreed to use automatic weapons and sniper fire in their battle against the police. A spirit of chaos and violence has descended on America, and things are going to get much worse during the months and years to come. Meanwhile, crime continues to rise in our smaller cities and in our suburbs as well. For a moment, I want you to consider a short excerpt from a recent Bloomberg article entitled "Walmart's Out-of-Control Crime Problem Is Driving Police Crazy." The call log on the store stretches 126 pages, documenting more than 5,000 trips over the past five years. Last year police were called to the store and three other Tulsa Walmarts just under 2,000 times. By comparison, they were called to the city's four Target stores about 300 times. Most of the calls to the northeast Supercenter were for shoplifting, but there's no shortage of more serious crimes, including five armed robberies so far this year, a murder suspect who killed himself with a gunshot to the head in the parking lot last year, and, in 2014, a group of men who got into a parking lot shootout that killed one and seriously injured two others. Police reports from dozens of stores suggest the number of petty crimes committed on Walmart properties nationwide this year will be in the hundreds of thousands. Did you catch that? This Bloomberg report says that there will be "hundreds of thousands" of crimes just committed at Wal-Mart stores alone this year. If people are behaving like this while times are still relatively stable and relatively good, what would things look like during a real crisis? Many people openly wonder what happened to Detroit, but it really isn't much of a mystery at all. Over the decades, our politicians have stood idly by as tens of thousands of businesses and millions of good paying jobs have left the country. Our economic infrastructure has been absolutely gutted, and as a result formerly great manufacturing cities have become rotting, decaying hellholes. And it certainly doesn't help that voters in many of these cities have willingly chosen to put radical leftists into power time after time. Unfortunately, it appears that the nation as a whole is about to hand the keys to the White House to a radical leftist that has a violent temper that is absolutely legendary. If she gets into power, that might just be the final nail in our coffin. What has already happened to Detroit is slowly happening to the entire country, but we never seem to learn from our past mistakes. So now we will suffer the consequences for our very foolish decisions, and it will not be pretty. Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of End Of The American Dream.

Shares in Welspun, one of the world's largest textile manufacturers, were suspended after a few hours of trading, as on Monday, after dropping by 20 percent, their daily limit. Target said on Friday that it was severing ties with Welspun after its extensive investigation had confirmed that the Indian company, which purportedly used Egyptian cottons to make sheets and pillowcases sold to the retailer, substituted non-Egyptian cotton instead. Target is Welspun India's biggest customer after Bed Bath and Beyond. It accounted for about $90 million, or 10 percent of the company's total business in the financial year through March, Welspun executives said on a conference call on Monday. Welspun said on the call that it was investigating the product specification issue and would hire a Big Four accountancy firm to review its supply processes. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Welspun's third-biggest customer, is also reviewing the company's cotton certification records, the Wall Street Journal reported. A spokesman for Welspun said the company did not wish to comment on the reported Wal-Mart review. The U.S. retail giant accounts for about 8 to 9 percent of Welspun's revenues, according to Elara Capital analyst Sumant Kumar. "The risk is there as these are still early stages, so we need to wait and see," Kumar said. Sales of Egyptian cotton bedding account for only about 6 percent of Welspun's total sales, according to Kumar, but the loss to the company's credibility means other customers could withdraw all their business as Target has done. Analysts said Welspun did not provide clear answers during Monday's conference call, when asked whether other customers could follow Target's move to cut ties. "We are actively engaged with our clients," Welspun's Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala said, in response to that query on the call. Kumar, in his note, said Welspun executives were vague on facts during the call, which threw up more questions than answers.

Can drones be taken seriously in the supply chain? Feature 23 August 2016 Before drones can be commercialised, we will need concrete legislation that outlines parameters of how they can be used COMMENT Drones have the potential to enhance process efficiency and reduce costs Nick Ismail Drones have the potential to revolutionise supply chain and logistics, a notion not lost on retail behemoths Amazon and Walmart, which have been trialling warehouse and home delivery projects for well over a year. More recently though, drone strategies have been taken to the next level, with Amazon announcing a partnership with the British government to run tests to explore the feasibility of using drones to deliver small parcels. The implications of this are significant, given that 90% of Amazon’s sales involve products weighing less than five pounds. In the US, 7-Eleven have even made their first commercial delivery by drone, demonstrating that drone deliveries are far more than just a pipe dream. >See also: Will drones be an opportunity or a threat to industry? From a technology perspective, the capabilities of drones are improving day by day – advancements in autonomous piloting, ‘sense and aware’ technologies and increased battery life mean that delivery drones are now very much a potential for the future. For users, it is expected that drones will reduce costs and speed up traditional supply chains, deliver an additional source of data gathering and provide added convenience because they are not restricted to postcodes. However, a lot of preparation is still needed before drone delivery in everyday supply chains becomes feasible. . Only once an enabling policy framework is in place can the drone market fully develop. >See also: The future of retail: digital, drones, decisions, data – and no queuing The UK is slightly ahead in legislative terms, as certain guidelines around the use of drones already exist. The Civil Aviation Authority’s ‘The Drone Code’ requires drones to be flown in direct visual line of sight of the pilot; away from congested areas, aircrafts and airports; at least 50m from people, vehicles and structures; and under 400ft. These stipulations are accompanied by other barriers, such as 20kg weight limits. As drones can only travel short distances and with light loads, they are currently only suited to delivering smaller packages to a consumer customer base. Therefore, it is likely to be some time before the technology is able to sustain the volume and consistency of B2B services, as work will need to be done to increase load lifting capacity and journey endurance. >See also: They’re watching you: drone technology to establish evolved geographical information systems Furthermore, cybersecurity fears are among the biggest obstacles, given that drones require a wireless connection to an operations centre, making them potentially vulnerable to hackers. There are also concerns over whether drones will be used to complement existing jobs in the supply chain or replace them outright. Despite some stumbling blocks, the market is projected to reach $5.59 billion by 2020. To make these expectations a reality, it is likely the government will call for companies to register to operate drones and that organisations will need to prove they have a strategy in place that complies with legislation. As drones show promise to be the next disruptive technology within the supply chain, businesses, would do well to start investigating strategies now to see if they would fit their business model. >See also: How to solve the danger of the drone Whether to speed up retail deliveries or bring key parts and equipment to heavy industry projects, drones have the potential to enhance process efficiency and reduce costs. Businesses should start seeking help from experts to understand the technological challenges, practicalities and limitations of using drones as part of the supply chain process before dismissing altogether or indeed going all in too quickly.   Sourced by Trish Young, UK head of business consulting – retail, consumer goods, travel & hospitality, Cognizant Related Topics drones Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Read More Latest Popular Two-thirds of London’s councils suffered a data breach in the last 4 years 8 ways Philip Hammond put technology at the centre of his first Autumn Statement Looking ahead to 2020 and the e-voting system Connecting big data and big content Customer service must go mobile in the Uber era The smart nation: Singapore’s masterplan The path to manageable data Wine cellar, swimming pool and a treehouse: Inside Zoopla’s new office Rolling into the digital age: inside Rolls-Royce’s tech transformation Turning big data into high-class insights Products Information Age Magazine Since its launch in 1995, Information Age has been regarded as one of the most respected technology titles in the B2B realm.

(TGT) terminated business with the Indian textile manufacturer over cheaper bedsheets and pillowcases being labeled as premium Egyptian cotton. Following this, retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) is reviewing supplier Welspun's cotton certification records, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Welspun India, part of conglomerate Welspun Group, told BSE in a filing that it has initiated a probe in the matter. 'We have initiated actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor to audit our supply systems and processes. This is an issue of highest priority for us and we will take all necessary steps to address it.' Target on Friday announced that it was ending all business with Welspun India after it discovered last month that 750,000 sheets and pillowcases labeled as Egyptian cotton were actually made with another type of cotton. The retailer pulled the items from its stores. The company began to notify customers on Friday about a refund on the products. These were produced between August 2014 and July 2016 and sold for as much as $75. Target confirmed that the withdrawal includes two lines of Egyptian cotton bedding, and not all of its Egyptian cotton sheets are affected. Mumbai-based Welspun makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Target is Welspun's second-biggest customer, behind Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., and Wal-Mart is the third-biggest customer. Other major clients include J.C. Penney Co. and Macy's Inc. Welspun also manufactures towels for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Rugby World Cup. As per reports, every fifth towel sold in the US is manufactured by Welspun India, and its sales to Target amounted to $90 million in the fiscal year ended in March.

Sanjai Welspun shares fell to as low as Rs65.85 in Mumbai trading on Tuesday. Mumbai: Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, said on Tuesday it is reviewing Welspun India Ltd’s cotton certification records following Target Corp.’s decision to snap ties with the Indian textile maker. Welspun stock plunged 20% for a second successive day to close at Rs.65.85 at Tuesday’s close, the lowest in 15 years, the two-day rout wiping Rs.3,717.48 crore off its market value. American retailer Target, Welspun’s second largest customer, said it is cutting business ties with the textile firm, which it accused of passing off cheap cotton bed sheets as those made of fine Egyptian cotton between August 2014 and July 2016. “Yes, Welspun is a current supplier and supplies us with a number of products, including some sheets. We are currently reviewing Welspun cotton certification records and plan to have additional conversations with Welspun. If we discover an issue, we will handle it appropriately,” a Wal-Mart spokesperson said in an email response to Mint. Click here for enlarge Wal-Mart is Welspun’s third biggest customer, behind Target and Bed Bath and Beyond Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Welspun currently supplies a number of products, including bed sheets, to the retailer. The company makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Its other major clients include J.C. Penney Co. and Macy’s Inc. It also manufactures towels for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Rugby World Cup. “Sales from the US account for two-thirds of Welspun’s sales. If the other companies also start investigating the quality of supplies from Welspun and find issues with it, then could be a cascading impact on revenues,” said Sumant Kumar, an analyst at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. Welspun has appointed an external auditor (one of the big four) to audit its supply systems and processes. “This is an issue of highest priority to us and we will take necessary steps to address it,” Welspun said in a statement to BSE. Rajesh R. Mandawewala, managing director at Welspun India, told analysts on Monday that the company had been selling the same material to a “few other customers” as well. “We are actively engaged with our customers. Most of them have been supportive,” he said, sharing that the product made up 3-6% of its overall sales. Mandewewala said the firm was in talks with audit firms to restore the robustness of its supply process and the audit should be completed in 6-8 weeks. Sapna AgarwalP.R.

By Thomas Bailey Jr. of The Commercial Appeal Posted: Dec. 25, 2015 2 A Memphis plant last month put a wrap on its 2015 printing of more than 10 million rolls of Christmas gift wrapping for Wal-Mart. The increased production by Impact Innovations' plant at 6269 Shelby Drive is part of Wal-Mart's effort to stock more of its shelves with U.S.-made products. "In 2015, 100 percent of the giftwrap printed in Impact Innovations' Memphis facility was for Wal-Mart,'' Wal-Mart spokesman Scott Markley said. That production represents about a third of the gift wrap Minnesota-based Impact Innovations sold to Walmart 2015. Impact Innovations also supplies Wal-Mart wrapping paper that is printed in China and converted into consumer-size rolls. But in 2016 half of all the wrap that Impact Innovations sells to Wal-Mart will be printed in Memphis. "And that's in addition to all the wrap we produce for other customers,'' said Impact Innovations chief executive officer John Dammermann. His company's other customers include Kmart, Michael's and Big Lots. The Memphis employer is playing a role in Walmart's 10-year commitment — started in 2013 — to buy $250 billion in products "supporting American jobs.'' "Up until 2015, 100 percent of our wrap was printed in China,'' Dammermann said. Before the Wal-Mart contract, Impact Innovations in Memphis would receive master rolls of wrapping paper, each containing 40,000 linear feet, that were printed in China. The Memphis plant used machinery to convert the master rolls into small, consumer-size rolls sold in stores. "Now, we are actually printing the paper,'' said Trisha White, senior director of marketing for Impact Innovations. "Next year, we hope to start printing the first of January,'' she said. Wal-Mart's plan has worked so far, at least in Memphis. Impact Innovations had about 35 full-time employees before the Wal-Mart contract, added 18 in 2015, and plans to hire more the next two years. In addition, the company hired more than 100 seasonal workers this year. Impact Innovations bought a new press in May to accommodate the big Wal-Mart contract and had it running a month later. In June the plant started printing the Wal-Mart wrap branded Holiday Time and stamped "Made in the USA" for distribution to the chain's 4,500 stores. "Our customers tell us that where products are made is most important second only to price,'' Markley said. "With changes in energy costs and labor costs overseas, it is increasingly cost-effective and efficient to manufacture closest to the point of consumption ...,'' he said. Impact Innovations is a Minnesota-based company with a 250,000-square-foot plant the Southridge industrial park of Southeast Memphis. The company had been a competitor of Memphis's old Cleo Inc. gift-wrap company until 2011 when Impact Innovations purchased Cleo's designs, licenses and other intellectual property. Cleo's owner, CSS Industries, closed the Cleo plant at 4025 Viscount in December 2011. In March, the Economic Development Growth Engine (EDGE) board granted Impact Innovations a three-year tax incentive totaling $297,000. In turn, the company decided to stay in Memphis instead of moving to DeSoto County, buy two additional printing presses worth more than $7 million and add 18 full-time employees to the 35 it already employed. Without identifying Walmart at the time, Impact Innovations told the EDGE board it had signed an agreement with its largest customer to produce more wrapping paper.

A 25-year-old Anchorage man already wanted on an outstanding warrant faces additional charges after he rammed three police vehicles and three civilian vehicles while attempting to avoid arrest Monday evening. An off-duty Anchorage police officer spotted Trevon Allridge at the A Street Walmart at 5:47 p.m., according to police spokeswoman Renee Oistad. She said the officer knew Allridge had a warrant for his arrest for the charges of discharge of a firearm and reckless endangerment, so they called police dispatch. On-duty officers arrived and tried to keep Allridge, who was in his vehicle when they arrived, in the parking lot by blocking him in with their vehicles. “Allridge began ramming the police cars and made his way out, hitting a civilian car in the process,” Oistad wrote. She said in a separate email that she wasn’t sure if that vehicle was occupied when Allridge hit it. Allridge left the parking lot and drove to the area of 32nd Avenue and A Street, where Oistad said he got stuck. Police tried twice more to block him in as he made his way away from Walmart. He hit another civilian vehicle that was occupied and began going the wrong way down C Street, Oistad wrote. Police decided to stop following him briefly because of traffic, she said. “However, just moments later, officers re-engaged when Allridge hit a third civilian vehicle, making officers concerned for public safety,” she wrote. Allridge was finally stopped and taken into custody, at which point police found a gun in his vehicle. Oistad said Allridge faces new charges in connection to the chase and collisions, including several counts of assault and criminal mischief No one reported any injuries. “There was a female passenger in the car with Allridge who was uninjured and not charged with any crime in association with this incident,” Oistad noted. C Street was briefly closed while police investigated the collision involving civilian vehicles, but all lanes have since reopened, Oistad confirmed.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds E-Edition log in Editorial: Technology could help save us from ourselves Tuesday Aug 23, 2016 at 12:01 AM Two weeks ago Lake Wales police saved the life of a 3-year-old girl. Timothy Adams and Anna Adams, the father and grandmother, respectively, of the unidentified youngster left her inside their Honda Element on a sweltering afternoon while they went into Wal-Mart to shop. The car was not running when police arrived, and she had been alone in the car for more than 20 minutes, according to The Ledger's report of the incident. Officers smashed a window to get the anxious child out. At the hospital, doctors determined she had not suffered any serious injuries. The Adamses, both of Frostproof, were arrested, charged with child neglect. While Timothy Adams had taken the girl's 6-year-old sister with him, the 3-year-old was left, they told police, because each thought the other had taken her. Adams' younger daughter was one of the lucky ones — very lucky. According to a scientist who tracks such incidents, Jan Null of the Meteorology and Climate Science Department at San Jose State University, being left in a hot car killed an average of 37 children across the country between 1998 and 2015. Twenty-seven have died so far in 2016, including three from Florida. The clinical term for the cause of death is hyperthermia, more commonly known as heatstroke. Hot days create a stifling climate inside a vehicle that overheats the child's internal temperature, and overwhelms its body's ability to process the spike in degrees. Researchers say a child's body can heat up three to five times faster than an adult's, and yet lacks the maturity to efficiently regulate the temperature change. Children 4 and younger are most vulnerable. And death can come relatively quickly. In some situations a car can become a death box within 10 minutes. Null cites a study that revealed on days when outside temperatures ranged between 72 degrees and 96 degrees, the temperature inside the vehicle climbed 43 degrees within an hour. But two-thirds of that jump occurred within the first 20 minutes. Texas (100 deaths) and Florida (72) account for one-quarter of the child deaths related to hyperthermia since 1998 by Null's count, far surpassing the rest of the country. California ranks third with 44. Null's research indicates that most of the time (54 percent) the child is inadvertently left in the car. In another 29 percent the child was playing while unattended in a car. On the other occasions, the child was purposefully left in the car, but it's unclear whether the person who did so intentionally meant to harm the youngster. Suffice to say, this is among a parent's, grandparent's, or caregiver's worst nightmares. And when it happens, the person responsible, whether or not the legal system punishes him or her, is left with nothing but memories and a haunting inside their soul of what could have been done differently. Perhaps it's time technology helped prevent that. Child-safety experts recommend a number of steps to avoid such tragedies. For example, never leave a child unattended in a car for any reason, even with windows cracked or air conditioning on. Put something of value that will be needed during the day — a purse or cellphone — in the rear seat with the child. It's also a good habit to check the back seat every time you get out of the car. And set a calendar or timer reminder on your phone to do so. Some smartphones have apps that can be downloaded as well. The one thing that hasn't happened, but should, is that automakers have not developed and deployed such life-saving technology. Back in June NBC News reported that General Motors is set to offer a pilot rear-seat reminder system on one brand of its SUVs for 2017. If so, it would be the first such system. It's past time for that. In March 2009 Washington Post columnist Gene Weingarten wrote a lengthy and moving article on this topic. He noted that in 2000 three NASA scientists began working on such technology after a colleague's 9-month-old son died after being forgotten in a car. By 2004 they had invented a working model based on weight sensors and a keychain alert. It never took off. Weingarten observed that no commercial partner was willing to manufacture it because of the liability potential. “But another big problem,” Weingarten noted, “was psychological: Marketing studies suggested it wouldn't sell well. The problem is this simple: People think this could never happen to them.” It can and does happen all too frequently, and parental skill does not matter. Nearly 300 children have passed away in overheated cars since Weingarten's article. Were it not for an alert passer-by in Lake Wales, we could add one local 3-year-old to the list. How many more must perish before we figure this out?

Why Clean Energy Fuels Is a Good Buy Articles > Market Commentary > Whole Foods Market: a Strong Buy? Whole Foods Market: a Strong Buy? Whole Foods Market (WFM) announced third quarter ended June 30, 2016 total sales of $3.70 billion, up 2 percent year-over-year from $3.63 billion during the same period last year. Whole Foods Market declared third quarter of 2016 net income of $120 million or $0.37 per diluted share, down 22 percent year-over-year from $154 million or $0.43 per diluted share in third quarter of 2015. The global organic foods provider reported continued year-over-year slight improvement in its top line primarily driven by a healthy trend of comparable store sales and rising sales from the company’s increasing number of global organic foods outlet. Focusing in the right areas   Whole Foods Market has illustrated notable improvement in top line for the first quarter of 2016 after witnessing continued revenue decline since last four quarters. However, operating margin for the company declined 58 basis points during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and despite significant cost-saving initiatives being undertaken by the company. Going forward, Whole Foods Market is consistently facing significant competition from value-driven organic food providers like Trader Joes, Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and conventional retailers like Costco (COST), Kroger (KR) and Walmart (WMT). Therefore, Whole Foods Market needs to deliver superior product innovation in order to successfully counter the expanding competition from these well-established organic food players. The organic foods company is believed to continue to suffer top line losses and market share loss to several other organic foods retailers that have sheer size and impressive financial position to support their growth operations while delivering attractive innovation in their organic food offerings. The overall financial performance of Whole Foods Market has diminished with the expanding competition. Image by PublicDomainPictures / Pixabay The company declared 8.4% of EBITDA margin during the first quarter of 2016, which is believed to be the weakest since past 16 quarters. However, Whole Foods Market’s sales per square foot were recorded better than Walmart (WMT), Fresh Market (TFM) and Kroger (KR) while weaker than Costco (COST). Whole Foods Market same-store sales remained the highest among its competitors and the company registered the greatest EBITDA margins. Impressive moves   Whole Foods Market has undertaken several growth efforts to enhance the value perception, expand long-term profitability and restructure traffic such as strategic investments in core technology platforms and superior digital technologies, improved external marketing initiatives, strategic and well-planned price reductions, enhanced promotional activities, introducing attractive stores, enhanced focus on prepared foods and exclusive brands and impressive cost restructuring. Moving ahead, Whole Foods Market targets on opening three major 365 stores from May 2016 till August 2016. The organic foods company has already declared 13 key leases for 365 store format. These innovative 365 stores are expected to support the company in better managing the value sensitivity issues and would target millennials. The company is expected to be successfully countering the rising threat from other major organic foods retailers through the strategic introduction of new stores at key destinations while optimizing its financial position for successfully supporting the well-planned growth efforts. Whole Foods Market delivered 45 basis point enhancement in comps since last quarter, with a notable growth in items per basket hugely offset the decline in the average cost per item and the number of transactions. The combined operations optimization efforts of Whole Foods Market including, the company’s value strategy, customers moving towards selecting smaller-priced items and disinflation in certain item types caused year-over-year fall in average cost per item. Although the company’s value approach is consistently and negatively impacting gross margin and comps, while Whole Foods Market is continuing to witness a widespread improvement in the number of items per basket and seems stimulated with expanding traffic trends through some major departments, mainly produce. Conclusion Overall, the investors are advised to “Hold” their position in Whole Foods Market, Inc. considering the company’s significant long-term growth prospects but, currently weaker financial position with significant total debt of $1.05 billion against weaker total cash position of $625 million only, restricting the company to make future growth investments. The profit margin of 3.04% seems satisfactory. The PEG ratio of 4.91 indicate healthy company growth. Published on Aug 22, 2016 By Subhen Mittra Copyrighted 2016.

Residents have expressed concern about more cars on the road when developments like Walmart are completed. Stephen Fastenau sfastenau@beaufortgazette.com i By Lucas High lhigh@islandpacket.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Beaufort County and the City of Beaufort moved closer Monday to resolving a conflict over who should responsible for paying for a traffic study along the Sea Island Parkway corridor on Lady’s Island. County officials balked earlier this month at a request by the city that the county carry the full burden of paying for the nearly $88,000 study — sparking what Rep. Shannon Erickson described as a “turf war” between the two entities. Beaufort Mayor Billy Keyserling and city manager Bill Prokop came back before the county’s governmental and finance committees Monday with a new proposal that appeared to be more palatable for county officials. We have to be very careful and very frugal in how we spend our funds. Beaufort County Councilman Jerry Stewart Recommended unanimously by members of the finance committee, the new deal would require the county to pay for 90 percent of the study — roughly $79,000 — while the city would shoulder the remaining 10 percent of the cost. Funding for the study would come from road impact fees paid by Walmart, which is building a new store on Lady’s Island. Lady’s Island “has become a very popular place” to live and shop, and congestion is already an issue prior to the opening of the Walmart, Keyserling said Monday. “There is a traffic problem on Lady’s Island that needs to be addressed,” he said. While county officials agreed with city leaders about the need for a comprehensive traffic study in the area, County Council members said the city ought to have some skin in the game. “We have to be very careful and very frugal in how we spend our funds,” Councilman Jerry Stewart said Monday. He said he thinks that “it is important that the city does contribute” to the cost of the study. County Councilman Steve Fobes said he remains “a little conflicted about the dollar amounts” spent by the county compared to the city, but he isn’t “going to quibble ... whatever the split is” at this point in the process. Despite the recommendation by the county’s finance committee, the full council must approve funding deal with the city. If the deal were to fall through, the city would be on the hook for the full cost of the study, Prokop said Monday. “We’re committed. We signed a contract” with engineering firm Ward Edwards to perform the study, he said. “We will have to cut other things out of our budget” if the county declines to fund the vast majority of the study, he said. While there are still lingering differences in opinion on who should pay for what, everyone involved seems to agree that traffic in the area is a problem. A comprehensive study would be the first step toward finding solutions, officials from both the city and county say. Concerns were brought late last year from local residents who said entering and leaving the area around Lost Island Road would become more dangerous when the new Walmart, along with several other proposed developments, open. The residents asked state Erickson to bring the S.C. Department of Transportation into the discussion. The agency joined a group including the city and county to form a plan in recent months. The funding split proposed by city leaders Monday will likely be introduced to the full County Council for consideration next month.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Tag News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted Journalist Account PRNewswire Distribution Search Progressive Real Estate & SRS Real Estate Sell Former Walmart Bldg in Perris, CA for $4M Former Walmart Sold in Perris, CA for $4M   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Retail * Commercial Real Estate * Progressive Real Estate By Industry: * Real EstateRANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. - Aug. 22, 2016 - PRLog -- Progressive Real Estate Partners and SRS Real Estate Partners announced today the sale of a 127,000 square-foot former Walmart building for $4,050,000 in an all cash transaction.  The building is located at 2560 North Perris Boulevard in Perris, CA and is also part of the well-established 292,000 square-foot Spectrum Shopping Center which includes Cardenas, Dollar Tree, Wells Fargo Bank, Verizon, Taco Bell and Payless ShoeSource. Investment sales experts Greg Bedell and Paul Galmarini of Progressive Real Estate Partners and Townsand Cropsey of SRS Real Estate Partners exclusively marketed the property and represented the seller, a Santa Monica–based private investment firm.  The buyer, a private California investor, was represented by Drew Wetherholt of Marcus & Millichap in Ontario, CA. Built in 1991, the 127,000 square-foot retail building is easily divisible, has excellent pylon signage and ample parking with approximately 750 parking spaces.  The building is zoned community commercial allowing for a variety of retail uses which was a key selling point.  Located off the 215 freeway at the signalized intersection of N. Perris Boulevard and Orange Avenue, the Spectrum Shopping Center is on a major retail thoroughfare with excellent visibility to 34,000 cars per day.   The property is also directly adjacent to the proposed 1800-unit Harvest Landing residential community and a 228-unit apartment complex. "Prior to placing the building on the market, we were able to generate significant pre-leasing interest from multiple national retailers making it a particularly attractive investment opportunity, especially in a market where there is limited new ground-up construction.  As a result we were able to sell the property at a price that was 22% more than what our client had paid for it approximately 6 months prior,"  according to Greg Bedell, Investment Sales Specialist at Progressive Real Estate Partners.   "Furthermore we had multiple offers and were able to execute a non-contingent contract with a 10-day close.  With historically low interest rates and rising values, demand remains strong for well-located retail properties in SouthernCalifornia's Inland Empire market," he added.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 22, 2016 1:27pm   Comments Share: BMO Capital has maintained its Underperform rating on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT), despite better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and gross margin. The world's biggest retailer reported adjusted EPS of $1.07, which exceeded the Street estimates by $0.05 a share and BMO estimates by $0.07. Wal-Mart's revenue grew 0.5 percent to $120.9 billion and topped the analysts' expectations of $120.16 billion. Its comp sales rose 1.6 percent. Guidance And Analyst Take Moving ahead, the retailer raised its full-year adjusted EPS view to $4.15–$4.35 from $4.00–$4.30. BMO also raised its full-year EPS estimate to $4.34 from $4.22. "The year-to-date improvement in GM rate has been the single biggest surprise in 2016 as we expected price investments to lead to pressure," analyst Wayne Hood wrote in a note. Related Link: Have Discount Retailers Remained "Amazon Proof"? However, Hood said although e-commerce and GMV sales grew 11.8 percent and 13 percent, respectively, most e-commerce retailers are posting similar, if not higher, sales growth. Wal-Mart is actually below the average with total U.S. e-commerce sales growing at 15.8 percent year-over-year in the second quarter according to the U.S. Census Bureau. "We are concerned that, in an effort to catch up in the e-commerce game, Walmart may jeopardize its margins and not get the corresponding return it expects," Hood highlighted. Hood also expressed his concerns that the $3.3 billion Jet.com acquisition is on top of Wal-Mart's plans to invest $1.2 billion–$1.5 billion in e-commerce in 2016. Further, the analyst said Marc Lore, Jet.com founder and CEO, who will join Wal-Mart and run both Jet.com and Walmart.com, has limited experience running a business long term. "We have concern about Marc Lore's ability to run a company and also that he will move on sooner rather than later given his track record," Hood noted. Justification Hood's Underperform rating is based on the thesis that further large increases in gross margins could lessen as price investments accelerate into 2017, despite the company's steps to restore traffic, grow SSS and reduce inventory point to success. "Importantly, at 17x 2016 EPS, expectations are high for a company with a LSD long-term EPS growth rate, leaving us at Underperform," Hood added. At time of writing, shares of Wal-Mart were down 0.33 percent to $72.51. Hood raised his price target to $67 from $60. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

According to the ‘FACT SHEET: White House Announces New Commitments to the Fair Chance Business Pledge,’ companies and organizations that pledged to Ban the Box collectively employ over 3 million Americans. By signing the Fair Chance Business Pledge, these companies demonstrate a commitment to reduce barriers to jobs for the approximately 70 million Americans with some type of criminal record by: Using practices such as “Ban the Box” to delay criminal history questions until later in the hiring process; Ensuring that information regarding an applicant’s criminal record is considered in proper context; and Engaging in hiring practices that do not unnecessarily place jobs out of reach for those with criminal records. The White House FACT SHEET explains that the Obama Administration is committed to reducing barriers facing individuals with criminal records trying to reenter society. Over 2.2 million individuals are incarcerated in American prisons and jails and the majority of them will return to their communities. Improving education and job opportunities for these individuals reduces crime and helps communities. Along with Walmart, larger U.S. employers who have taken the White House Fair Chance Business Pledge to Ban the Box include American Airlines, Best Buy, Coca-Cola, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Hersheys, Johns Hopkins Medical Center, Kellogg Company, Koch Industries, Lyft, Microsoft, Oklahoma City Thunder, PepsiCo, Prudential, Staples, Starbucks, Uber, UnderArmour, University of Pennsylvania, and Xerox. The White House launched the Fair Chance Business Pledge in April 2016 to encourage U.S. companies to ensure that all Americans – including individuals with a criminal record – have the opportunity to succeed by eliminating barriers for those job seekers with a criminal record. A full list of employers taking the Ban the Box pledge is at www.whitehouse.gov/issues/criminal-justice/fair-chance-pledge. More Ban the Box Information from ESR The Ban the Box movement that removes the box job applicants are asked to check on applications if they have a criminal record is spreading rapidly. Currently, more than 20 states and over 100 cities and counties in America have some form of Ban the Box legislation.

You would think that after a bomb threat, accidental shooting, and hostages were held at gunpoint by a disgruntled employee, this Walmart would have exhausted its bad luck. However, just this weekend, another unfortunate situation played out. Around 3:30 on Sunday, August 21st, police were called to the parking lot, where a 51-year-old woman had been struck by a vehicle. She said that one of the passengers of the car that hit her got out and took her purse, then fled. The story only gets crazier: a witness saw the robbery and followed the vehicle out of the parking lot. After a short drive, the vehicle stopped and a man got out with a gun. He pointed it at the witness, threatening to shoot him if he continued to follow them. The witness drove back to Walmart to speak to police. APD is currently looking for these suspects. There were two Hispanic women in the front seat and three Hispanic men in the backseat of a four-door red Lincoln Town Car. Thankfully, the victim of this crime only received minor injuries and was able to be treated. Please contact the police at (806) 378-3038 or Amarillo Crime Stoppers if you have any information about the suspects. You can call (806) 374-4400 or submit an online tip here.

The all-out brawl occurred inside the store in Crestwood, south of Chicago, and was all captured on video by a witness. The fracas involved four women and was attempted to be stopped by a single male security guard, who got lost in the fight.  Brawling: The four women starting hitting and screaming each other inside the Walmart  The incident occurred at the store in Crestwood. One woman her top ripped in the fight, which exposed her breasts  A woman at the center of the brawl had her top pulled down in the melee, exposing her breasts. Another woman was then finally dragged away from the group by the security guard, though she continued to fight against him and scream. It is unclear what started the argument that led to the brawl. Crestwood Police did not have records of any arrests. The video was uploaded to YouTube last week and has received thousands of views.   Break it up: A security guard managed to get one of the women away from the group  Melee: The woman continued to shout and yell back at the group  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The amazing results of the 'walk to Walmart' diet: Arizona...

(WFLA) – A four-drawer wooden chest sold on Walmart’s website is being recalled over concerns they could tip over onto children. This recall involves four-drawer wooden chests made by Sauder Woodworking sold under the Storybook brand (model 416407). The white laminated chests have a single white wood pull on each drawer. The recall states the chests are unstable until they are anchored to the wall, posing a serious tip-over risk. The chests were manufactured between April 2016 and June 2016. They were sold exclusively at Walmart.com from April 2016 to June 2016 for about $100. A label with the date code is located on the back of the unit. The chests measure 42.13 inches high by 29.25 inches wide and 16.25 inches deep. There were no reported injuries or incidents in connection with this product. Consumers should immediately stop using any recalled chests that are not properly anchored to the wall and place them in an area that children can’t have access to them. The company is contacting all known purchasers directly and sending free repair kits and wall anchoring kits. If you can’t attach the repair kit, you can contact Sauder Woodworking for a full refund. Consumers who request a refund will be provided instructions by Sauder on how to properly dispose of the chests. CPSC strongly recommends that all dressers be anchored to the wall.

Porter’s and Kramer’s Creating Shared Value approach is “moving into the mainstream and growing exponentially. Companies that adopt shared-value thinking remain committed (as they should) to philanthropy and corporate social responsibility. But they’re moving beyond often-fuzzy notions like sustainability and corporate citizenship, and instead making measurable social impact central to how they compete.” Sustainability as a fuzzy notion for business strategy? I’m going to push back on that. As the environmental NGO that spearheaded a first of its kind partnership with McDonalds over 25 years ago, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) has partnered with hundreds of leading companies to address sustainability in specifically non-fuzzy ways. We do it by following the science and making sure that every EDF+Business project drives measurable environmental and business results. Porter and Kramer single out EDF and our 10+ year partnership with Walmart. (Thank you, we’ve actually worked with 15 companies on the Fortune list!) The non-fuzzy win-win to this partnership is that EDF helped Walmart set a first of its kind goal for reducing its supply chain greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 20 million metric tons (MMT) by 2016. We helped design the stretch target and then stuck around for the tough middle miles of execution, forging solutions across their global supply chain to achieve that goal. The result? A reduction of 36.5 MMT of GHG emissions by the end of 2015. EDF is also working with Walmart to eliminate chemicals of concern from health and beauty products on their shelves. The result? A reduction of 23 million pounds of chemicals out of products in 24 months. This is just one example from our rich history of collaboration with leading companies. Our partnership with McDonald’s eliminated the Styrofoam clamshell packaging and over 300 million pounds of waste. Our partnership with FedEx created the first fleet of hybrid delivery trucks reducing emissions by 65%. Our work with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) resulted in 27 KKR portfolio companies achieving nearly $1.2 billion in avoided costs and added revenue, while eliminating more than 2.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, 27 million cubic meters of water use, and 6.3 million tons of waste through eco-efficiency efforts. I could go on, but I think you get my point. Plus, unlike August 1, 1990 when we launched our work with McDonald’s, we’re no longer alone, our colleagues at BSR, Ceres, CI, TNC, WRI and WWF are leading complementary, collaborations with leaders across the economy and around the world. When business partners with an NGO like EDF, the results are anything but fuzzy. When NGOs and Business work together, they can change the world. @TPMurray Click To Tweet Powered By CoSchedule With that said, the key themes in Porter and Kramer’s article are solid. Corporate leaders need to integrate societal, and in broader terms, the planet’s needs into their core strategies. Investors need to consider creating value for the planet as well as themselves when allocating capital resources. And businesses and NGOs need to work together to ensure that creating shared value is the strategic norm for the future.

 TECH INVESTOR: We're in a huge bubble — but it's not what you think Rob Price Aug. 22, 2016, 6:19 AM 12,803 facebook linkedin twitter email print "I'm not in a bubble! YOU'RE in a bubble!" Ethan Miller/Getty Images What links Walmart's $3 billion purchase of Jet.com, Unilever buying up Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion, and GM buying Cruise for $1 billion? They're all examples of smaller startups being acquired by dominant incumbent rivals. And according to Dave McClure, a venture capitalist at the investment firm and startup accelerator 500 Startups, they're indicative of a bubble — but not where most people think. Bubbles are among the tech sector's favourite topics of discussion: Is the industry in one? And what happens when it pops? With huge volumes of venture capital sloshing around, and the increasing proliferation of billion-dollar-plus startups, known as unicorns, plenty of people think there's a tech bubble. And amid a decline in VC funding and valuation write-downs of some of Silicon Valley's darlings (including Snapchat), we may already be in a contraction, the argument goes. But McClure takes the opposite approach. "Most unicorns and many tech IPOs are perhaps overvalued, but a few of them are actually UNDER-valued as well," he argues in a new blog post. The investor points to Facebook as an example of how tech company valuations can skyrocket postvaluation — and makes the case that if anyone is in a bubble, it's the traditional incumbent companies, ripe for disruption. Of course, McClure works in the venture capital business, so it's no surprise that he's trying to talk down the idea that he might be contributing to an unsustainable bubble. He has his livelihood and the valuations of his investments to think about. With that in mind, it's an interesting argument, not only for its own merits but also because of what it tells you about the vision of boundless meritocratic "disruption" that startup investors are trying to sell to the world. Is that unicorn a dog in disguise? John Moore/Getty Images McClure asserts: "The REAL bubble is in far-too-generous P/E multiples and valuations of global public companies, whose business models are being obliterated by startups and improved by orders of magnitude." As a result, he argues, we should expect to see plenty more acquisitions like Walmart's purchase of Jet.com, as the incumbents wake up to the threat that smaller startups are posing and attempt to "hedge their own public valuations by buying the very same unicorns that keep them awake at night." He goes on (emphasis ours): "Of course, this might be risky, but it's no more risky than not doing anything and expecting to keep your CEO job intact and the stock price rising. Hedging your public company stock by buying potentially disruptive unicorns for only 5–10% of your market cap may be one of the simplest ways to defuse the startup threat and keep on trucking ... this is the Unicorn Hedge. ... "No surprise, most of the now-public tech giants are investing in and buying OTHER tech startups and unicorns to stay on top of their game. Microsoft bought LinkedIn and Skype. Google bought YouTube and Android. Facebook bought WhatsApp and Instagram. In fact in the past five years ALL of the top 5 highest-value public companies are tech companies. So what do you think is more overvalued? The average unicorn or tech IPO? Or the average non-tech public company that hasn't innovated in over a decade?" These allegedly non-innovative public companies, McClure argues, are ripe to come crashing down (emphasis ours): "The REAL twist is Wall Street finance getting disrupted by Silicon Valley tech (and, by NYC and LA tech too). The REAL twist is the S&P 500 not realizing their avg P/E multiple should be ~5–10 instead of ~15–25. The REAL twist is big oil & gas and automotive companies not realizing their market caps aren't just overvalued, but that in 10–20 years THEY WILL GO TO ZERO as electric power and autonomous vehicles become the norm. The REAL twist is thousands of public companies hemorrhaging billions in losses and value over the next ten years, like gigantic, collapsing Manhattan skyscrapers in slow motion … except that it might not be that slow." In short: It's the traditional billion-dollar companies that are overvalued — not the startups that are planning to eat their dinner. It's certainly true that some big incumbent companies will be toppled by the next generation of entrepreneurs. But even the most ardent bubble-theory advocates wouldn't disagree with that. It's the extravagant spending in some corners of startup culture and the allure of meteoric growth and hyperbolic investor promises that are in question. And as McClure points out, these incumbents are more aware of — and taking steps to counteract — the threat posed by startups than ever before. At the same time, when multibillion-dollar startups can blow through hundreds of millions of investor dollars before imploding — or hire hundreds of employees and then close without ever launching a proper product — it gets harder and harder to believe that the tech sector isn't at least a little inflated.

The request from District 1 Supervisor Roger Gitlin sparked a debate among commissioners Tuesday about whether a property owner — in this case the county — can remove someone’s possessions even though they’re living on that property illegally. The Del Norte Solid Waste Management Authority decided to table the request until the Del Norte County Board of Supervisors weighs-in on the cleanup. The homeless encampment is on county-owned property northeast of Walmart. District 2 Supervisor Martha McClure led the discussion, pointing out that other agencies, including the City of Eureka, had to go through the court system in order to remove people’s possessions from illegal encampments. She said she was concerned that by approving Gitlin’s request, the Solid Waste Management Authority was opening the door for other bin donation requests from private individuals who are also dealing with illegal campers. “I’ve been in enough of the encampments to know the folks who are suffering, many times are also people who are working in the community,” said McClure, who recently stepped down as Solid Waste chair. “The folks who are suffering, who are doing with hardly anything, are doing that because of whatever their predicament is. It is not because they want to be scofflaws.” As part of its franchise agreement with Recology Del Norte, the Solid Waste Management Authority can donate up to 20 dumpsters a year to community events and other cleanup activities. The bins can be up to 40 cubic yards, according to Director Tedd Ward. The value of the allocation and waiving of fees is about $186.16 per dumpster. The donation of a bin does not include the disposal fee to Hambro/WSG, which operates the transfer station, Ward said. Gitlin, who founded Take a Bite out of Blight in 2013 and is currently seeking re-election, said he was frustrated at his request being tabled and felt that it was personal, blaming it on a “cantankerous election year.” Shortly after he founded the program, Gitlin and Take a Bite out of Blight volunteers cleaned up a different section of the same county-owned property. That clean-up effort was in an area south of Walmart near the parking lot that code enforcement staff eventually fenced off. “No one gave us permission to clean up the county-owned property contiguous to Washington Blvd.,” Gitlin said, adding that then-Solid Waste Management Authority director Kevin Hendrick approved of the group’s request for a dumpster. “We only went to the (Board of Supervisors) when we asked them to pay for $150 worth of ‘no trespassing’ signs.” Gitlin’s current request involved the removal of trash and what appears to be a tent behind the store. The debris is only on the county’s property, Gitlin said, not the neighboring Walmart property, which has been cleaned up by the store’s employees. Take a Bite out of Blight volunteers had been involved in Solid Waste-authorized cleanups before, Ward said, but he doubted they involved homeless encampments. He said there is no current criteria involved for allocating bins and wasn’t sure what policies the county has in place when it comes to cleaning up homeless encampments. “I don’t know if the county has a mechanism or a process by which they establish of the county-owned properties which ones are the priorities for being cleaned up,” Ward said. “I don’t know if there’s a process for instance also of the homeless encampments, the following are of greatest environmental concern. If in doing a cleanup, making sure that law enforcement is appropriately involved and people are appropriately trained, again I’m not sure what process that is. To the extent the authority supports these kinds of activities it makes sense we would jump through those hoops.” The authority’s new chairman, Crescent City Councilor Blake Inscore called for input from county supervisors indicating that they approve of the cleanup effort and that they would take on the liability of such an effort. “I’m very concerned about volunteers being in any kind of homeless encampment without this having been weighed-out by law enforcement,” he said. “I’ve been in some of the encampments as well and I think there’s a safety factor we should consider before we, in essence, put our stamp of approval and put public funds toward something.” Gitlin pointed out that since county property is involved he will have to get permission from the Board of Supervisors to clean up the homeless encampment. But he said he’ll probably wait until January to address the issue. “I’m not going to grovel for a bin to provide free labor for,” he said. “My first protocol is to get the bin and on consent I would ask the county to approve our intention to clean up this area at zero cost to the county, but everything is such cantankerousness that they have to decide as if this is going to cost Del Norte County penny one and that’s where my frustration boils over.” Ward is expecting a dumpster request for next month’s beach cleanup and said with the eight the authority board approved Tuesday its allotment will be exhausted for the year.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) is killing off retail brick-and-mortar stores may not ring true in respect to major discount retailers. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) reported a strong Q2 earnings beat Friday, beating analyst's estimates on revenue by nearly $700 million, generating nearly $121 billion in sales. It was Wal-Mart's eighth consecutive quarter of positive comps. Wal-Mart's strong quarter may suggest that big discount retailers may be immune from Amazon's e-commerce reign. Many consumers fear that Amazon is becoming a near monopoly and that prices are too high as a result. This leaves room for discount retailers.

"The victim forgot the cash and walked away," Keller said. "When she walked back the cash was gone." Walmart's Security Department checked store video surveillance and saw another woman had taken the money, Keller said.

Best Buy is scheduled to report its second quarter earnings before the opening bell on Tuesday, August 23 By Neha Saleem on Aug 23, 2016 at 7:18 am EST Best Buy Co Inc. (NYSE:BBY) is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings for fiscal 2017 on August 23. Investors and analysts alike are awaiting whether the giant electronics retailer will be able to surpass expectations or not. Investors have remained concerned regarding the future of traditional retailers as big box retailers such as Walmart and Macy’s are suffering from the recent trend of lower consumer spending. This has been a great concern for the investors as it reveals the future of retail industry. Fortunately, Best Buy’s fast growing online sales has been able to offset declines at its retail stores. Past Performance The electronics retailer managed to outperform Wall Street analysts’ expectations in past four straight quarters of 2016. In its last quarter earnings, the giant retailer reported revenue of $8.44 billion, 1.3% lower than $8.59 billion it had in the same quarter last year. The reported revenue is more than expected figure of $8.29 billion. Following the earnings, the stock surged more than 3%. During previous quarter, the retailer announced better-than-anticipated revenue, improvement in profitability, and that the company has progressed against its initiatives for fiscal 2017. The management notified that although the company has reported stronger-than-expected earnings in the first quarter, the retailer did not raise its full year guidance as its first quarter represents less than 15% of the full year earnings and at that time the company had no material information regarding its new product launches throughout the year. Recently, in order to improve its earnings, the giant consumer electronics retailer is strengthening its relationship with its key suppliers by increasing the reach and visibility of its products. The company is investing heavily in its e-commerce services. Earnings Prediction During its first quarter earnings, the company gave the guidance for the second quarter. According to the company, it predicts the earnings per share (EPS) to come in the range $0.38-0.42, while the revenue is expected to fall between $8.35-8.45 billion. Analysts predict that sales and profit both will decline on year-over-year (YoY) basis. They forecast that the company will report the EPS of $0.43. The revenues are anticipated to clock in at $8.4 billion. In the same quarter a year back, the electronics retailer posted the EPS of $0.49 and $8.53 billion in revenue. In the earnings call, investors should look for retailer’s full year guidance. Recently, the company has revealed its plans to invest in the transformation of its online technology platform, such as it is increasing mobile investment to offer information during the discovery, research, and check out processes. During the quarter, the company’s chief financial officer Sharon McCollam stepped down from his position in mid-June. However, Ms. McCollam will remain in the company until the end of this fiscal year. Corie Barry, a 16-year veteran of Best Buy and its current chief strategic growth officer, is stepping into the CFO role. Stock Performance Year-to-date, Best Buy stock has just slightly outperformed the broad market. So far this year, the stock is up more than 10%. However, during the past 52 weeks, the stock is up nearly 8.5%. On Friday, Best Buy shares closed at $1.8% at $32.59. The analysts ‘consensus price on the stock is of $32.91. In the recent research note issued to investors, analyst Michael Pachter maintains his underperform rating on Best Buy stock. He anticipates a fall in sales which reveals that a more “formidable headwind going forward along with elusive cost cuts.” According to Mr. Pachter, management has done a good job in terms of promotional activity to balance out weak traffic and on-going share repurchase have improved the earnings. Despite, he predicts a return to persistent comp declines because of lack of exciting new products. Mr. Pachter also believes that the cost cuts are reaching to a limit, which might leave the retailer with fewer options to drive EPS growth in fiscal 2017 and afterwards. As of Monday, August 22, Best Buy stock last traded at $32.80, up 0.64%.

(Photo: Alan Diaz / AP) Talk about rising above low expectations. Best Buy Co.’s shares soared 20 percent on Tuesday — its biggest one-day gain in more than a decade — after reporting a surprising uptick in quarterly comparable sales when investors were expecting a slight drop. “Best Buy continues to defy the skeptics,” David Magee, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, wrote in a research report. Wall Street predicted negative results out of the electronics chain based on multiple troubling signs about a downward trend in consumer electronics over the summer, said R.J. Hottovy, an analyst with Morningstar. “Against that backdrop, it’s not surprising that even modestly positive results are driving the stock upward.” The red flags included Target Corp.’s bombshell last week that its electronic sales were down double-digit percentages in the second-quarter — and sales of Apple Inc. products in particular were down more than 20 percent. Wal-Mart executives also talked about softness in that segment. And recent data from the U.S. Commerce Department told a similar tale about a slide in electronics and appliance store sales. On top of that, investors had become increasingly skeptical about Best Buy’s turnaround since its chief financial officer Sharon McCollam — a major player in cost-cutting efforts that got the company back on stable footing — announced in May that she would step down. They were also unsettled by chief executive Hubert Joly’s sell-off earlier this summer of $12.8 million of shares he owns in the company. Add all of that up, and in the day leading up to Tuesday’s earnings release, headlines in the financial press warned of “mounting troubles” for Best Buy and a possible imminent “crash” of its shares. So when Best Buy, headquartered in suburban Minneapolis, posted a comparable sales growth in the U.S. of 0.8 percent, investors celebrated. The retailer, which had forecast flat sales in the May-to-July period, also posted a better-than-expected 21 percent increase in profit. “You have to give the company a lot of credit for very good execution and what seems to us as clear market share gains,” said Peter Keith, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. “They are executing very well in a tough environment.” Still, his firm is maintaining its neutral rating because of the overall tepid consumer electronics industry. Keith added that there continues to be concerns about the price deflation of 4K TVs and about how much of a lift Best Buy could get out a new iPhone model, which is expected to be released this fall. Because of the industrywide decline in smartphone sales, Best Buy is sticking with its forecast for flat sales this year. But it has also lifted its profit outlook. Best Buy attributed the better second-quarter performance to strong sales of TVs, appliances, computing and health and wearables that helped offset weakness in smartphones and video games. Also, tablet sales, which have been declining industrywide, did not perform as badly as expected. Joly said it was also a reflection that the company’s strategy of turning its stores into destinations with mini-shops highlighting major vendors, focusing on customer service and upgrading its digital channels is paying off. “Like any space in retail, there are winners and losers,” Joly told reporters. “It is a really hard category to be successful at, and we’ve clearly raised the bar on ourselves. It’s good to see the customers reward us.” Best Buy’s online sales were another standout, rising 24 percent in the quarter compared to 17 percent a year ago. That continued acceleration contrasts with other retailers who have begun to see their online growth slow. Best Buy has been upgrading its website and app to improve search capability, provide summaries of customer reviews and streamline the checkout process. It’s also now often getting packages to customers’ doorsteps in two days or less. “And it’s free — you don’t have to pay a subscription to get that service,” Joly said in an obvious jab at Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime program that has set industry expectations with free two-day delivery. At the same time, about a third of Best Buy’s online orders are picked up in stores. Charlie O’Shea, an analyst with Moody’s, said Best Buy’s online growth is especially notable since it was up against Amazon’s Prime Day sales bonanza in July and a steady stream of offers from Wal-Mart. It is “evidence that a well-managed brick-and-mortar retailer with a well-thought-out strategy that successfully utilizes its physical assets can thrive as it transitions to a true multi-channel retailer.” In the three months ended July 30, Best Buy’s net income rose to $198 million, up from $164 million in the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted for one-time expenses, Best Buy earned 57 cents a share, which was better than the 43 cents a share analysts were expecting and the 38 to 42 cents range the company had forecast. Overall revenue was $8.5 billion, better than the expectations and basically flat compared to last year. Best Buy’s stock closed Tuesday at $39.23, up $6.43. Looking forward, Joly said he expects 4K TVs, appliances and connected home products to continue to be productive categories. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2bTtvCe TOP VIDEOS Pistons return to Detroit 2:35 American Center for Mobility breaks ground at historic Willow Run plant 2:42 Mary Barra, Michiganian of the Year 2:39 GM opens new Company Store at Renaissance Center 1:54 Pistons owner Tom Gores discusses possible move downtown 5:50 Tom Izzo on Dan Gilbert's $15 Million gift to MSU 2:14 ZF TRW automotive demonstrates self-driving technology 1:57 Building Mars spaceship parts in Metro Detroit 1:38 Tour the Detroit riverfront's industrial heart 2:27 Hamtramck’s Bon Bon Bon crafts artisan chocolates 3:55

Determination to move forward is the key. When Greenhaw Pharmacy broke ground Monday for its new office facility at Ash Street and Orchard Drive, it marked the launch of the fourth major building project in Hillsboro this summer. Already well underway is construction of the new Hillsboro Com­munity Hospital, the Shari Flaming Center for the Performing Arts on the Tabor College campus and the handsome MB Founda­tion headquarters where a year ago stood a Prime­­Time eyesore. These four projects represent a total investment in this community of around $28 million. Barely nine months earlier, Hillsboro residents were in a funk. The new Wal-Mart store had closed its doors after only four months, the Alco store had shuttered its building because of a corporate bankruptcy and the Heartland Foods grocery store stood sadly vacant along the highway. It was a gloomy time for many. But economic progress is rarely a steady march forward. Towns, like nations, have seasons of economic challenges and downturns as well as seasons of growth and new energy. Certainly the latest building boom has generated the latter in Hillsboro. We have no way of knowing how long the positive energy will last. In fact, challenging times are bound to resurface. Progress means being determined to move forward rather than raise the flag of surrender. Sustaining prosperous rural communities in Kansas will always be a challenge given the urban bias in Topeka. It takes a committed corps of positive and determined citizen leaders to lead the way—and a cadre of citizens who lend their support and encouragement. —DR   Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Company suing to overturn Unfair Sales Act has history of violations MATTHEW DeFOUR mdefour@madison.com Aug 24, 2016 0 Buy Now AMBER ARNOLD -- State Journal Michigan-based Krist Oil is seeking to overturn the state's minimum markup law, which it has violated in the past. A Michigan-based company suing the state over a law that requires a minimum markup for gasoline sales has paid fines for violating the same law and has been under investigation by the state for more than five years. Krist Oil is one of two plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed Monday by the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty in Vilas County Circuit Court. The other is Green Bay resident Robert Lotto, a consumer seeking to pay the lowest possible price for gas. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the state’s 1939 Unfair Sales Act, also known as the “minimum markup law,” which prohibits retailers from selling merchandise at less than cost and also sets a minimum price markup for tobacco, alcohol and gasoline sales. “This lawsuit seeks to vindicate the right of Wisconsin businesses to serve their customers free of anti-competitive, arbitrary and irrational government regulation,” the lawsuit states. “This lawsuit also seeks to vindicate the right of Wisconsin consumers to purchase products at the most competitive price, free from arbitrary and irrational government regulations that drive up prices.” State and federal courts have rejected 11 similar lawsuits dating back to 1940, according to the Wisconsin Petroleum Marketers & Convenience Store Association. Brandon Scholz, a lobbyist for the Wisconsin Grocers Association, said companies such as Krist Oil trying to overturn the law want to push smaller competitors out of the market. “He wants to sell below cost,” Scholz said. “He wants to get rid of having competition by pricing them out of business.” Big box retailer Wal-Mart and several conservative Republican lawmakers have called for repealing the law, saying it unfairly imposes a burden on consumers. WILL president Rick Esenberg said the law has “a dubious objective of attempting to protect consumers from low prices.” In Wisconsin, the law means gasoline includes a 9.18 percent markup over cost. The price also can’t be changed for 24 hours after being posted. There are some exceptions to the law that allow for lower pricing, though the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, which polices the law, receives hundreds of complaints each year of alleged violations. Almost all of those complaints are filed by gas stations against competitors. In 2014, Krist Oil filed the most, according to an analysis by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank. But Krist Oil, which owns and operates more than 70 gas stations in northern Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, has been the subject of several complaints as well, according to public court records and memos from DATCP Secretary Ben Brancel to Gov. Scott Walker’s office, which the State Journal obtained under the state open records law. In 2007, Krist Oil agreed to pay nearly $4,000 after the state charged the company with changing the price of gas more than once in a 24-hour period. Nine months later, the company committed more violations for which it agreed to pay more than $2,100 in 2009. Also, in 2010 the Department of Justice filed an enforcement action against Krist Oil for under-filling propane gas containers, which resulted in the company paying a more than $45,000 fine. Enforcement of the Unfair Sales Act was put on hold from February 2009, when U.S. District Judge Rudolph Randa struck it down, until September 2010, when an appeals court reversed Randa’s decision. According to a memo from DATCP Secretary Ben Brancel to Walker, former Gov. Jim Doyle did not authorize DATCP to investigate complaints after the lawsuit was resolved. Then in February 2011, DATCP sent an informational letter warning the company about alleged violations of the law at four of its Wisconsin gas stations. On March 8, 2011, the company’s owners called DATCP for further explanation of the law, and said they would comply, according to Brancel. But between Feb. 25 and March 31, 2011, the state received 15 additional complaints against Krist Oil. Brancel authorized the agency to open an investigation in April 2011. In June 2011, Brancel reported to Walker that the agency had found the manager of at least one Krist gas station was falsifying records. In October 2012, Brancel reported to Walker that of 18 complaints against Krist’s Antigo station, it had substantiated 12 of the complaints and found an additional 30 violations. “DOJ is now determining whether to prosecute the case,” Brancel wrote. “This would be the first case brought in this administration.” DATCP spokesman Bill Cosh said earlier this summer the agency’s investigation is still open more than five years after it began. He didn’t have further comment Tuesday before the agency reviews the latest lawsuit. DOJ spokesman Johnny Koremenos said his agency is also reviewing the lawsuit, but didn’t provide further comment on what happened to the DOJ’s review of the DATCP investigation after 2012. Esenberg said in a call with reporters Tuesday that part of the problem with the law is that it can soak up state resources that might be used trying to investigate the numerous complaints that get filed. “Krist Oil doesn’t make any secret of the fact that it believes itself to be an efficient operation that wants to charge its consumers low prices,” Esenberg said of the company’s past violations. “That’s what we’re seeking to address here.” Krist Oil owner Krist Atanasoff declined to comment. Esenberg said because complaints against and by Krist Oil are ongoing, it isn’t appropriate for Atanasoff’s separate private lawyer to comment. ‘Krist Oil doesn’t make any secret of the fact that it believes itself to be an efficient operation that wants to charge its consumers low prices.’ Rick Esenberg Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty president × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Answer: Two of the big seasonal Halloween stores are preparing for September openings in Grand Chute and Appleton. A third has a branch in Green Bay if you’re willing to drive. • Halloween Express is setting up in the former Savers space at 317 N. Mall Drive, on the approach to the Fox River Mall in Grand Chute, where it has been for the past few years. “I’ll be opening in early September this year because of Labor Day coming a little later this year,” said Todd Cloutier, the Combined Locks-based owner. • Halloween City will set up in the former DirectBuy space at 3829 E. Calumet St. in Appleton, east of Walmart on the city’s east side. “We will start to work on it next week,” said Gerry Robinson, district manager. “The goal is to open no later than Sept. 15.” • Spirit Halloween will not have a location in Appleton this year. “However, we do have a store in Green Bay that is already open,” said spokeswoman Tricia Lombardo. It’s at 2350 E. Mason St. in the East Town Mall next to Petco. RELATED: Read more about local businesses in The Buzz Some details about Halloween costumes this year: Besides the usual ghouls and goblins, Halloween Express’ owner Todd Cloutier said he’ll have plenty of political masks and superheroes, like Batman, Superman and the characters from “Suicide Squad.” For little kids, licensed costumes include Paw Patrol and Shopkins. Big seasonal Halloween stores typically set up for two months each year in large vacant storefronts. In addition, you’ll find costumes, candy and décor departments in big-box stores, discounters, thrift stores and dedicated downtown Appleton costume shops.

His new business was almost wireless flat irons and curling irons for hair. But then Schmitz was watching his son, Bo, play a college baseball game at Bemidji State and there was a new idea. "We were sitting after one of the games and all the kids were getting dressed and they were all complaining about their arm sleeves, how they were falling apart at the seams and how they wished they could find a sleeve that matched their jersey (colors)," Jim said. "I had some connections in the graphic design world and a light kind of went off that this may be something. "We started researching factories in China and then one thing led to another. That was in April (2015). Last June, we started selling the product." In a little more than a year in business, B-Driven Sports has sold products such as compression sleeves to more than 12,000 customers in all 50 states and seven countries. The company also is in talks with Wal-Mart about getting the sleeves in their stores. Buy Photo Kathey Schmitz prepares B-Driven Sports products for shipment Tuesday at the company's headquarters near Sauk Rapids. B-Driven Sports sells compression items worldwide.  (Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com) Unique qualities There are some large companies selling compression arm sleeves. Some are among the bigger names in sporting goods: Nike, Under Armour, Adidas and EvoShield, to name a few. What makes the sleeves by B-Driven Sports unique? "We've got over 300 designs and patterns in more than 25 colors and five sizes," Jim said. "When we started, we really thought we would be solely (a) youth sports (driven company). "What we've found in the last year is how broad the market is. We sell a lot of sleeves to elderly people with (illnesses). ... And thanks to social media, we've started to get a lot of pictures of our product out there. Instagram is the big one and then Facebook." Jim estimates that there are about 25 professional baseball players wearing B-Driven Sports products, including one at the major league level. To get a pro player to endorse a product is a process because of the policies and contracts of the leagues and the respective players' unions. But there are subtle ways around that. Buy Photo A box of compression items is ready for shipment Tuesday at B-Driven Sports.  (Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com) "(Players will) get pictures of them playing in games with it or signing autographs, tag us (on social media) and the next day, we get a bunch of kids calling us," Jim said. This summer, Jim said that he was called by a sports agency based in New York that represents more than 120 NFL players. "Anything that's worn during the regular season has to be NFL approved, but we will have players who are wearing our product during the preseason," Jim said. "After the first season, we will have the ability to sign a contract with the player and they can endorse our product outside of the NFL. "It's all happening much faster than we thought it would happen. We wanted to get a good foundation on our website (www.bdrivensports.com), get things working and get the name and branding out there and learn a lot from the first year." Family business The majority of the work in the business is done by Jim and immediate family members. For 20 years, Jim and his father, Ralph, owned and operated James & Associates Development in Sauk Rapids. Jim said that 90 percent of the construction business was tied to assisted-living facilities in the area. Jim, a 45-year-old Sartell High School graduate, played three years of baseball at Jamestown College before hurting his throwing arm. After he did, he moved back to the area and began working for Ralph. "My dad said, 'I can teach you more in the office than you're gonna learn (in school). Work in the office and start earning money,'" Jim said. But Jim said he got burned out in the construction business. So he and Ralph sold the company's assets and contracts and Jim went into development mode to start a new business. He learned everything he could about the e-commerce world. Then there was a fateful trip to a Bemidji State baseball game. Buy Photo B-Driven Sports owner Jim Schmitz on Tuesday displays some of the compression items available from the company, near Sauk Rapids.  (Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com) "When he called me and told me he was going to start that (business) off, I said, 'Oh, I didn't know you were going to take my idea and run with it,'" Bo said, laughing. "But it was kind of cool. "And for once, it felt like something I could be involved with in his business and I've always looked up to him as a businessman. I was really excited." Bo, a catcher and 2013 Cathedral High School graduate, decided to transfer to St. Cloud State and sat out a season for the Huskies in the spring per NCAA rules. But he also spent time going to youth baseball tournaments and selling sleeves. "I wanted to come to St. Cloud State to be closer to my family. I just wanted to learn about the business aspects,"  said Bo, who is majoring in entrepreneurship. "When I go home and see my dad working, in just 10 minutes, I gain so much experience. It helps me out quite a bit." Buy Photo B-Driven Sports items are available in a wide variety of colors and styles.  (Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com) The warehouse for B-Driven Sports is on property owned by Ralph Schmitz and his wife Kathey. While Jim and Ralph have worked together for a number of years, this is the first time Kathey has been involved in one of the family's businesses. "My dad's always got some other businesses he's dabbling in, but this is like us playing ball together," Jim said. "What has been fun about this business has been to bring my mom into this because she was never really involved in the construction business." She handles fulfillment, including shipping and inventory. Jim said his wife, Paula, supports him through his long work days and provides him with his family's foundation. Jim said that more than 25 percent of B-Drive Sports' business is people reordering product, and that customers from California and Texas make up "almost 30 percent of our market." B-Driven Sports also sells sports headbands, calf sleeves, compression socks, shirts, leggings, eye black and game day face paint.

The purchase price marks a massive discount from a valuation of $900 million that the startup had secured when it raised more than $100 million from investors in early 2014. The disappointing sale, which was announced in June without a purchase price, does not come as a total surprise to those who had followed the once-hot startup in recent years. Recode had reported in January that the shopping site had been searching unsuccessfully for a buyer, in the wake of multiple rounds of layoffs and a business that had been deteriorating for some time. A Bed Bath & Beyond spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the wake of Dollar Shave Club’s $1 billion sale to Unilever and Walmart’s impending $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet, the One Kings Lane outcome is a reminder of how brutal the e-commerce industry can be for many startups. The web retailer, co-founded by Ali Pincus and Susan Feldman, burst onto the scene in 2009 with limited-time sales — known as “flash sales” — of upscale furniture and home decor at heavily-discounted prices. As Gilt Groupe did with the fashion industry, One Kings Lane initially benefited from the fallout of the Great Recession; businesses were desperate to find new ways to unload pricey goods as the economy slumped and shoppers shunned full-price discretionary items. Over time, the company secured $225 million in investments from firms such as Greylock, Tiger Global, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Mousse Partners, and at one point it booked hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue. As the economy bounced back, however, excess inventory was harder to come by for flash-sale sites across the board. Traditional retailers and brands also began running their own versions of these sales on their own sites. In short, it was really tough to keep the selection of goods fresh on a daily basis. To make matters worse for One Kings Lane, the furniture and home decor categories are much less seasonal than the fashion industries, meaning there wasn’t as much unsold merchandise to come by organically on a quarterly basis, as there is for discount sites in apparel. The startup tried to jump-start growth through new initiatives like Hunters Alley, a site that was like an eBay for high-end decor. But that project was killed less than a year after launching. One of the first red flags now seems so obvious in hindsight. Within months of raising $112 million for his company in early 2014, then-CEO Doug Mack stunned insiders and outsiders by leaving for the same role at Fanatics, an online seller of licensed sports apparel. There’s a lot more to the story of what went wrong at One Kings Lane and what e-commerce entrepreneurs and employees can learn from it. That includes the tough lessons some employees learned after spending thousands of dollars to exercise stock options that were rendered completely worthless after the sale to Bed Bath & Beyond.

Shares in Anglo American (LON:AAL) were the biggest gainers, rising by 5% at one point and closed up 2.7% at 857.42p, with shares in another mining firm, BHP Billiton (LON:BLT), also up by 4.4% at one point but ended up 2.3% at 1,056.51p. But two leading housebuilders also enjoyed continued big increases in their market value. Shares in the housebuilder Barratt (LON:BDEV) closed 4.9% higher at 486.29p, and shares in Persimmon (LON:PSN) rose by 4% to 1,864.78p. Persimmon said customer interest since the Brexit vote had been "robust". Tesco, meanwhile, closed up 3.4% at 164.89p after a retail report on the sector shone favourably on the grocer. One analyst “blamed the weather” on Tesco’s improved performance. “Tesco shares are trading higher by 3% this morning after a sales boost in the last 12 weeks, fuelled mainly by the good weather, and the Olympics. However, despite the boost, market share is still declining albeit at a slower pace which could possibly signal a return to growth in the not so distant future for the supermarket giant,” said Vinay Sharma, Senior Trader at ayondo markets. The FTSE 250 index closed up 0.6% at 17,982 as it closed in on 18000 for the first time since May 2015. The FTSE AIM 100 Index advanced 0.2% to 3,770 while the FTSE AIM All-Share Index was up 0.3% to 790. London gainers outnumbered losers by 38% to 26% and even beat the unchanged stocks of 36%. London afternoon UK shares roses strongly again led by housebuilders and supermarkets and the prospect of a strong start on Wall Street. FTSE 100 was 46 points higher at 6,874, with Persimmon (LON:PSN) leading the way adding 3.7% to 1,861p on better than expected results. In the six months to June, pre-tax profit rose 29% to £352.3mln on a 12% boost to revenue to £1.49bn. Legal completions increased 6% to 7,238 new homes sold while the average selling price grew 6% to an average of £205,762. Broker Liberum said that the improved sales rate showed that customers in Persimmon's markets – outside of London- appeared to be shrugging off Brexit uncertainties. The news cheered others in the sector and Barratt Developments plc (LON:BDEV) added 4.5% to 484.40p.   Taylor Wimpey (LON:TW.) rose 3% and and Berkeley Group plc (LON:BKG) 3.5%. Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO), up 3.6% to 165.3p led the supermarkets higher following the latest monthly data from research group Kantar WorldPanel. Aldi’s growth was the slowest for five years, though still 12.2%, while Tesco saw sales dip by the lowest amount for six months. Asda’s woes continued as sales fell by 5.5% in the 12 weeks to 14 August, there was some good news for the Wal-Mart–owned chain as its offloaded its loss-making photo division to Photo-Me International (LON:PHTM) for up to £6mln. Photo-Me shares were flat at 162.6p. Junior oiler Jersey Oil & Gas PLC (LON:JOG) was one of the top gainers, spurting almost 13% higher to 34.6p as it revealed a  new farm-out deal. It is bringing in Norwegian major Statoil into the North Sea exploration projects. Statoil is to take 70% of UK Seaward Licence P.2170, Blocks 20/5b and 21/1d in the Central North Sea. The project is estimated to host over 500mln barrels of oil in place, across two prospects estimated at 300mln and 212mln barrels each. Other risers included hydrogen fuel specialist ITM Power plc (LON:ITM) on the back of another contract to supply hydrogen fuel for commercial vehicles. Office supplies business Commercial Group will use ITM’s refuelling stations to power its fleet of delivery vehicles. ITM shares rose by 9% to 24.45p. Tethys Petroleum Ltd (LON:TPL, TSE:TPL) leapt 83% to 2.27p as its proposed recapitalisation cleared a regulatory hurdle in the Cayman Islands. London open UK shares were on the up as traders look to the Wyoming symposium stateside later in the week and received positive European manufacturing data. There was some good company news about too. Junior oiler Jersey Oil & Gas PLC (LON:JOG) was the top gainer in London, spurting almost 20% higher to 36.5p as it revealed a  new farm-out deal. It is bringing in Norwegian major Statoil into the North Sea exploration projects. Statoil is to take 70% of UK Seaward Licence P.2170, Blocks 20/5b and 21/1d in the Central North Sea. The project is estimated to host over 500mln barrels of oil in place, across two prospects estimated at 300mln and 212mln barrels each. The FTSE AIM 100 is up over 15 points at the time  of writing at 3,780, while the FTSE AIM All share added over two points to 790.970. On the blue chips, FTSE100 is up over 28 at 6,856 with property firms running away with the medals. Housing back in focus again and Persimmon PLC (LON:PSN) is up 3.12% to 1,850p after it cheered investors with better than expected pre-tax profits. In the six months to June, pre-tax profit rose 29% to £352.3mln on a 12% boost to revenue to £1.49bn. Legal completions increased 6% to 7,238 new homes sold while the average selling price grew 6% to an average of £205,762. Broker Liberum said that the improved sales rate showed that customers in Persimmon's markets – outside of London- appeared to be shrugging off Brexit uncertainties. See our story here.. The news cheered others in the sector and Barratt Developments plc (LON:BDEV) added 3.48% to 479.40p.  Taylor Wimpey (LON:TW.) and Berkeley Group plc (LON:BKG) were also higher. Both France and, importantly Germany, reported positive manufacturing data this morning, which is giving confidence to the market that the predicted impact on demand post the Brexit vote has not yet materialised. Traders are of course gearing up for Fed chair Janet Yellen's speech on Friday at Jackson Hole, where interest rates and a possible rise this year will be very much on the cards. Snapshot at 8.15am The FTSE 100 was 27 points to the good this morning at 6,856, managing to claw back most of yesterday's losses. The top winner was Persimmon (LONPSN), up 2.5% to 1,837p after the housebuilder reported better-than-expected pre-tax profits. The biggest loser was Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC (LON:HIK), down 1.6% to 2,275p.

Wall Street was mixed overnight, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advancing 0.1% to 5,245, while the Dow and the S&P 500 were both slightly softer – the former down 0.1% at 18,529 and the latter 0.1% weaker at 2,183. Investors are adopting a wait-and-see posture ahead of this Friday’s speech by Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, at the central bankers symposium at Jackson Hole. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 was down just over a hundred points in the last hour of trading at 16,494, with exporters out of favour as the yen made headway overnight. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng was 89 points lower at 22,909. On the economic front, it is a big day across the globe for Purchasing Managers’ Indices. Closer to home, focus will be on trading updates from The Rank Group PLC (LON:RNK), after it recently decided not to press on with its takeover bid (in partnership with 888) for bookie William Hill, and Persimmon PLC (LON:PSN), the house builder.

 There's an $80 billion elephant in the room that could be worse than a recession for Walmart, Home Depot, and Costco Ashley Lutz Aug. 23, 2016, 1:06 PM 56,400 facebook linkedin twitter email print Joe Raedle / Staff / Getty Images America's largest retailers are facing a threat that is rarely discussed: student-loan debt. Consumers make $80 billion in student loan interest payments a year, Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said on Bloomberg TV. This means that they have less money to spend at retailers like Walmart, Home Depot, and Costco. Total loan payments add up to $160 billion annually.  "The average salary per college graduate has increased by only about 3% in the past seven years, while the average student debt burden has increased by roughly 53% over the same period," O'Shea told Bloomberg. He says that America's more than $1.3 trillion in student loans could hurt the American economy more than a recession because it will last for decades to come. Industry website Retail Dive notes that younger people are so burdened by student-loan debt that they're frugal. "It's slated to get worse as retailers find that millennials in their thirties are hampered by debt in what should be their highest-spending years," writes Daphne Howland at RetailDive.com. Student debt could also be part of the reason why sales are contracting at department stores like Macy's, Sears, Nordstrom, and Kohl's. Off-price retailers like TJ Maxx are thriving because consumers have less money to spend on clothing. Macy's same-store sales fell 7.4% in the most recent quarter, Nordstrom's fell 1.7%, and Kohl's dropped 3.9%. Shares of Macy's and Nordstrom have lost about 50% of their value in the last year, and Kohl's stock price has fallen 40%, notes Business Insider's Hayley Peterson. Shopping visits made to off-price retail stores increased by 4% in the 12 months ending April 2016, compared to the same period last year.

Minyanville SP 500 Weekly Earnings Update: Drilling Down into the Forward Estimate Revisions By Scutify Aug 22, 2016 8:20 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. With the unofficial end of Q2 '16 earnings season this week, with the Walmart report, investors now look forward to September's earnings reports since we see companies with an August '16 fiscal year-end or quarter end. That would be names like Oracle (ORCL), Fed-Ex (FDX), Nike (NKE), etc. as well as Accenture (ACN), Micron Technology (MU), and Walgreens Boots (WBA). (Long all except ACN), all of which report before or around October 1 '16. Because of the comments on last week's SP 500 Earnings Update, from this Seeking Alpha post, showing how Technology estimates were tracking with this article (with and without Apple's numbers), was necessary (in my opinion) to show readers / investors how market cap can greatly influence SP 500 price action. Technology is the largest sector within the SP 500 by market cap at 20% of the index. Thomson Reuters (by the numbers): Forward 4-quarter estimate: $125.82 vs last week's $125.88. P.E ratio: 17(x) PEG ratio: 12(x) - most bear's reference the PEG ratio as a reason not to own stocks, and it's very valid, except that it ignores market cap. SP 500 earnings yield: 5.76% vs last week's 5.76%. Typically an earnings yield above 6% is where the market has stopped correcting. Year-over-year growth rate of the forward estimate: +1.46% vs last week's +1.47% and still well below where I thought it would be by this point in 2016. The single distinguishing characteristic of the forward 4-quarter earnings estimate detailed above is that the negative revisions to the metric are much less severe than in past quarters. What that means is that there seems to be far less downward pressure on forward earnings estimates than in prior quarters. Here is the data: Q3 '16: $125.82 today vs. $127.04 on July 1. The $1.22 difference is a 1% degradation in the forward estimate over the last 6 weeks Q2 '16: $123.00 on May 13th vs. $124.78 on April 1. The $1.78 is a 1.5% degradation in the forward estimate over 6 weeks from April 1 through May 13 '16. Q1 '16: $121.90 on February 12 vs. $126.64 on January 1. The $4.74 degradation in the first six weeks of 2016 was a 3.7% decline or degradation in the forward estimate. Q4 '15: $123.86 on November 13, vs. $126.58 on October 1. The $2.72 degradation in the forward estimate was a 2.7% decline from early October '15. Factset tells its readers of "Earnings Insight" the percentage decline and gives the averages. Using Thomson's data, I've shown readers the trends and the earnings erosion over the last few quarters so readers can see the trend. Factset to its credit, gives 1, 3 and 5 year averages which is very important although it was noticed on Factset's Earnings Insight this week that they stopped providing commentary on sector earnings and revenue growth. One caveat for astute readers: For each quarter cited above, the forward 4-quarter earnings estimate used was after the quarterly bump in the estimate. As we roll into each new quarter, there is typically a $3 - $5 increase in the forward estimate as the back quarter rolls off and the forward quarter is added. The point is that it is very natural to see a decline in the forward estimate as each quarter progresses through earnings, thus measuring the rate of decline of degradation, conveys important information about analyst sentiment towards future quarters. Readers may consider this too technical, and navel-gazing at its finest, but it's important to repeat that subtle changes in the SP 500 earnings data, both absolute changes in growth rates and more importantly relative changes between sectors, conveys important information to investors. Pre-Labor Day and the 4 weeks of September will be quieter in terms of earnings data, which is the same every quarter. Of all the sectors, Technology looks the best through year-end and into Q1 '17 based strictly on sector earnings revisions. (Again, see the post from this blog from Thursday, August 18, 2016.) The Energy sector looks good too, but I suspect Exxon-Mobil's earnings and revenue miss from Q2 '16, is weighing on the sector data. More to come - thanks for reading.

The results bucked a string of weak performances in the electronics category by competitors like Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). Best Buy said demand rose for items like home theater systems, major appliances and computing products, as well as smartwatches, but declined for mobile phones and gaming. Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said he expected mobile phone sales to increase this quarter and next as scheduled product introductions draw consumers. Apple Inc's APPL.O long-awaited iPhone 7 is set for availability next month. Last week, Target blamed its poor performance in part on lower demand for electronics due to a drop in demand for Apple products. Best Buy's online sales as a percentage of domestic revenue increased to 10.6 percent from 8.6 percent in the second quarter ended on 30th July, helped by faster shipping and improvements in the checkout process and search functionality, Joly said. Excluding special items, earnings of 57 cents per share beat the analysts' average forecast of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at established stores rose 0.8 percent from a year earlier. Analysts had expected a 0.60 percent decline, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Best Buy said it expected low-single-digit percentage growth in fiscal-year operating income, compared with a previous forecast of "approximately flat" results. The company gave a third-quarter profit and revenue outlook roughly in line with analysts' estimates. Revenue rose slightly to $8.53 billion in the second quarter, snapping a three-quarter streak of declines. Analysts on average had expected $8.40 billion. Net income increased 20.7 percent to $198 million from $164 million. International revenue declined 1 percent but rose 4.1 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

(TWTR) Stock Set to End 2016 with a Whimper Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock’s Rebound Underscores the Buy Case General Electric Company (GE) Stock Hasn’t Looked This Healthy in a While View All Posts Shares in Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) soared Tuesday after it reported better-than-expected sales and earnings in the most recent quarter, proving once again that it’s tough to count Best Buy stock out. Source: Austin Kirk via Flickr For a company with no future, BBY sure is hard to kill. The consumer electronics chain has been hanging on by its fingernails against Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and e-commerce in general for five years, and yet reports of its death always prove premature. That has made Best Buy stock a poor buy-and-hold over the years. Shares are up 36% over the past half-decade vs. a gain of 85% for the broader market. As a trade, however, BBY has offered many opportunities for outperformance. Believe it or not, for the year-to-date, Best Buy stock is actually ahead of the S&P 500. Tuesday’s market action should only extend that lead. BBY stock is up 15% in premarket trade. You can chalk that up to the fact that Best Buy has never lost its ability to confound Wall Street expectations in a good way. For example, in the most recent quarter, same-same sales — a critical retail industry metric — rose when analysts expected them to fall. BBY Stock: More of a Trade than an Investment In the most recent quarter. Best Buy earnings rose to $198 million, or 61 cents a share, from $164 million, or 46 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. On an adjusted basis — which is what analysts care about — earnings came to 57 cents a share. That beat the Street’s forecast for 43 cents a share by a wide margin, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. 7 of the Worst Stocks on Wall Street Like comparable-store sales, total revenue actually inched up when its was expected to fall. The top line expanded to $8.533 billion from $8.528 billion. Analysts’ average estimate stood at $8.4 billion. As for the aforementioned comp sales, they increased 0.8% when the Street was looking for a 0.4% drop. The keys to the quarter were brisker sales of appliances and consumer electronics and cost controls, BBY said, but the exciting news came from e-commerce. As CEO Hubert Joly pointed out in a news release: “We saw continued positive momentum in our online sales — delivering a second straight quarter of nearly 24% growth.” As promising as the latest quarter was, Best Buy is trying to keep the bar low on Q3. The company expects adjusted earnings of 43 cents to 47 cents a share, while the Street is looking for 45 cents a share. It’s hard to call Best Buy stock a buy after Tuesday’s huge move. That’s especially true given it routinely coughs up hard-won gains — and more — if you stick around long enough. BBY does, however, remain one of the more interesting names for traders or tactical investors. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(Photo: Jupiterimages, Getty Images) A Milford woman could face charges, investigation by child welfare officials or both after she apparently left a toddler strapped in a safety seat inside a hot, locked car while she shopped Aug. 17. According to a report, the woman called 9-1-1 to request help at her home in the 1100 block of Milford Township at about 1:30 p.m., telling police and fire department first-responders she and her 12-year-old daughter went to the Walmart store in Lyon Township to pick up school supplies and forgot the 2-year-old boy was in the vehicle. The two shopped for 45-60 minutes, only remembering the child when they returned to the car and heard him crying. It wasn't clear why the woman went home before calling for help. ►Related: Police chief suspended for refusing to wear bullet proof vest Police noted in a police report the outside temperature was 83-85 degrees at the time. Milford Fire Department personnel determined the child was not in a life-threatening situation, and the woman signed off on transport to the hospital. ►Related: Michigan State Police lab faulted for mistakes The woman, who appeared visibly upset and crying, told police she is not the boy's mother but has temporary guardianship and has never left any of her five children in a car before.  She remembered bringing the boy along as she and her daughter returned to the car and heard the child crying. Milford Police turned the report over to deputies in Lyon Township for investigation. 1987 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 59 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2bRDVlx More Stories Betsy DeVos tapped by Donald Trump for education secretary Nov. 23, 2016, 2:17 p.m. 4 men found dead in Detroit tire shop; carbon monoxide suspected Nov. 23, 2016, 2:12 p.m. Teen back in jail for fatal 'road rage' beating; bond hiked to $1M Nov. 23, 2016, 2:06 p.m. My brother’s keeper: Basketball-loving twins fight arduous cancer battle together Nov. 23, 2016, 11:33 a.m.

The international research firm reveals that even people with chronic conditions have expressed skepticism because of low awareness and lack of knowledge about these health services. Options, such as free trials and the promise of no long-term contract, can help boost overall interest and adoption of these services. "The health industry must convince consumers of the value of these services by enlisting help from their trusted doctor and building a satisfying patient experience that rewards consumers with improved health status both clinically and emotionally," said Harry Wang, Senior Research Director, Parks Associates. "Currently, people don't understand the value that can be provided to them and the impact these services can have on their healthcare costs and overall well-being." Parks Associates will address these issues at the third-annual Connected Health Summit: Engaging Consumers, August 30 - September 1 in San Diego. The event provides in-depth analysis and discussion on the implications of the connected healthcare revolution and the resulting consumerization of healthcare. Confirmed keynotes for the event include HumanaVitality, Medtronic, Samsung, and Walmart. Wang will moderate the session "From Selling Products to Selling an Integrated Care Experience" at 8:45 a.m. on Wednesday, August 31. The session explores the pay-for-performance environment and ways business leaders can demonstrate the positive impact of a drug or device as part of an integrated care experience. Speakers will also discuss the types of partnerships and strategies that can shift the focus of drug and device makers from selling products to selling a care solution. Speakers for the session include: Jeroen Brouwer, Director of Business Development and Sales, Philips Ranndy Kellogg, President & CEO, Omron Healthcare, Inc. Jim Pursley, Chief Commercial Officer, Livongo Health John Vander Meulen, General Manager, Commercial Markets, Johnson & Johnson, Health and Wellness Solutions Wang will also moderate the session "Innovative Devices for Consumer Care" at 8:45 a.m. on Thursday, September 1. This session explains why device makers need to incorporate disruptive but user-friendly technologies to offer a differentiated experience. The speakers in this session will focus on strategies to engage consumers, increase usage, and demonstrate clinical or wellness benefits. Speakers for the session include: David E. Albert, M.D., Founder & Chief Medical Officer, AliveCor Richard Fury, M.D., Director, TPMG Tech Group Ravi Kuppuraj, Chief Architect for Patient Care and Monitoring Solutions, Philips Simon Longbottom, VP of Preventive Health, Nokia James R. Mault, M.D., F.A.C.S., VP and Chief Medical Officer, Qualcomm Life "The best way to engage healthy and sick consumers alike is to provide them with the tools that enable them to proactively and remotely monitor their health. As we venture further into the connected healthcare revolution, there is more data available to consumers and physicians than ever before, leading to not only a greater understanding of human health and disease management, but also to an empowered and truly engaged patient," said Dr. David Albert, Founder and Chief Medical Officer at AliveCor. "The technologies that will be truly successful and embraced by caregivers, physicians, and patients are convenient, useful, inexpensive, and easy to use. By empowering patients to take control of their own health, the possibilities for changing the consumer's healthcare experience are endless." "mHealth technology is the key to patient engagement, provider efficiency, and value-based care," said Richard Fury, M.D., Director, TPMG Tech Group. "We believe at Nokia that the smart use of technology in people's everyday lives can empower them to take better control over their health and those they care about," said Simon Longbottom, Vice President of Preventive Health at Nokia. "However, getting devices into consumers' hands is only half the battle to empowering them and driving real health benefits. I'm looking forward to discussing the various issues surrounding this topic with my fellow panelists during the Connect Health Summit." Parks Associates research shows that among U.S. broadband households owning connected healthcare devices, 54% stopped using their smart watch in six months or less and 33% stopped using their digital pedometer or fitness tracker over that same timeframe. Only 3% of smart watch owners have used their device for three years or more. Conference sponsors include Independa, higi, ARM, Care Innovations, Healthways, Alarm.com, Honeywell, MEDL Mobile, MultiTech, New Fields Technologies, PokitDok, Z-Wave, ZigBee, the California Health Care Foundation, Bright.md, Medable, and Home8. Registration to Connected Health Summit is open, and media are invited to secure press passes. For more information visit, www.connectedhealthsummit.com. Follow the conference on Twitter at @CONN_Health_Smt and CONNHealth16. To schedule a meeting with an analyst or speaker, contact Holly Sprague at hsprague@gmail.com, 720.987.6614. About Connected Health Summit Connected Health Summit: Engaging Consumers analyzes the role of innovative connected health solutions in driving changes in consumer behaviors as well as healthcare systems, insurers, and hospital networks. The event focuses on four areas of consumer health, which require active consumer participation to be successful: remote health monitoring for accountable care, consumer-centric wellness and fitness solutions, independent living technologies and services, and innovative convenience care models. The event will take place August 30 - September 1, 2016, at the Omni Hotel in San Diego, CA. Parks Associates is accepting submissions for speakers for the event.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Talent Engine Launches New Service Model with Website Talent Engine Launches New Service Model with Website Posted on August 23, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Sourcing Company Takes On Competitive Intelligence Led by Award-Winning Sourcer, Dave Mendoza DENVER, Colorado (PRWEB) August 23, 2016 Talent Engine, the brainchild of Dave Mendoza, is the latest entrant into the world of outsourced sourcing intelligence. Talent Engine recently put out its virtual shingle with the launch of a brand new website. The new site outlines the process and system whereby the consultancy claims to be a single source of competitive intelligence and sourcing data. Talent Engine best serves organizations of all sizes looking for accurate candidate sourcing and hiring data. Talent Engine was built on the processes and methodologies that have won Mendoza, the Managing Director, awards from some of the industry’s most visible media companies. “My Futurecasting methodology and the work I’ve done at Informatica, Wal-mart, Cisco, Blizzard and more have all created a library of sourcing knowledge that have scaled the work for the average talent acquisition department,” said Mendoza. “We’re not only impacting the big companies who have had access to great sourcing resources for some time, we’re creating real change for small to mid-sized companies, those that make up most of the workforce.” The Talent Engine team offers a proprietary platform that works with their clients' recruiters to build a “single source of truth” for talent acquisition data within their company. This allows talent acquisition leaders to control how their talent acquisition team works best and with different external resources. With that off their plate, company recruiters can spend their day on important parts of the hiring process requiring personal touch and attention like calling candidates, closing offers and training new hires. “Dave consistently delivers on what he sets out to do. His Talent Engine team (a very appropriate name) drives results,” said Matt McDonald of SAP. “They consistently deliver high volume and high quality data. The amount of detail they are able to capture in such a short period of time goes above and beyond expectations and really helps drive projects to fruition.” With accolades from some of the largest names in the global talent acquisitions space, Mendoza’s Talent Engine is poised to bring sophisticated sourcing to the SMB market. With the help of media partner, Red Branch Media, the company launched a new website to do just that. “We completely understood Dave’s vision for the site from day one. It’s an engine that drives talent acquisition within your company,” said Maren Hogan, CEO of Red Branch Media. “I’ve known Dave for years and worked with him on many projects in the past. This is one I am very excited about.” Talent Engine is taking select clients through Spring 2017. Connect with Talent Engine to start your candidate sourcing process today. About Talent Engine: Talent Engine is a talent acquisition technology firm based in Colorado looking to build a scalable talent pipeline for the future. Talent Engine digs through the layers of talent acquisition data to revitalize, remove irrelevant details, optimize to cater to each client and validate incoming data for bottom-line results.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      People come from all around the world to see Mount Everest. But if you lived in Nepal and saw it lurking in the distance every day, it might not seem nearly as impressive. You might take it for granted or even dismiss it as no big deal. That’s really where we are today with Apple (AAPL) and the absolutely gargantuan Apple cash hoard. It’s been so large for so long that no one really pays attention to it anymore. In fact, it seems the most common thing I hear said about the Apple cash stockpile these days is that “it’s really not that big when you take debt and potential taxes into consideration.” Frankly, that’s ridiculous. Even allowing for a massive tax haircut, AAPL’s cash hoard would rank as one of history largest treasures… a fortune that would make Croesus blush. As of Apple’s latest quarterly earnings report, the company had $231.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. The Apple cash balance — the gross number, before any debt or tax considerations — would be the 13th-largest company in the world… bigger than Wal-Mart (WMT) and just a hair smaller than Procter & Gamble (PG). Now, of course, the Apple cash is mostly overseas, while Apple’s $72.4 billion in debt is mostly domestic. Let’s pretend that Apple suddenly got religion and decided it wanted to be debt free… now. And let’s further assume that Apple wanted to move its entire cash hoard stateside because… go America! And let’s take this one step further and assume that Apple is paying the full 35% U.S. corporate tax rate on the whole pile of money. (None of these are realistic assumptions, mind you, but let’s go through the exercise anyway…) After taxes, Apple’s $231.5 billion in cash becomes $150.5 billion. That would still put the Apple cash hoard in the top 30 largest companies in the S&P 500… about on par with Phillip Morris International (PM) and just a hair smaller than IBM (IBM), Disney (DIS) and Pepsico (PEP). After stripping out the $72.4 billion in debt, the $150.5 billion becomes $78.1 billion. That’s still not exactly chump change. In fact, that’s nearly double the average market cap of all S&P 500 and more than four times bigger than the median market cap of all S&P 500 companies. And remember, this all assumes the absolute worst case scenario for taxes. Were Apple to actually attempt to repatriate its cash, it would likely negotiate much better terms. So, yes. The Apple cash hoard is a big deal, no matter how you slice it.

Target has dumped one of India’s biggest textile companies because of fake bed sheets Quartz 23-08-2016 Madhura Karnik Target, America’s second-largest discount retailer, has decided to cut ties with Indian textiles manufacturer Welspun India because of fake Egyptian cotton sheets supplied by the Mumbai-headquartered company. On Aug.19, the Minneapolis, Minnesota, retailer said that between 2014 and 2016, Welspun India supplied sheets saying they were made of Egyptian cotton, although they were not. RECOMMENDED: Welspun India gets tangled in knots “After an extensive investigation, we recently confirmed that Welspun substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton when producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016,” Target said in a statement. Target is contacting customers and offering a refund to those who bought these sheets, it said. The retailer has also removed the product—sold under the Fieldcrest label—from its stores. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” Target added. Some 750,000 such products were impacted over the two-year span, Molly Snyder, a Target spokesperson said in an email. Welspun India is one of the world’s largest textile makers and typically caters to the US, UK and European markets. Target is Welspun India’s second largest customer, behind American retailer Bed, Bath and Beyond, Bloomberg reported. J. C. Penney, Macy’s, Costco, Home Depot and Walmart also buy from Welspun India. ALSO READ: Welspun India sinks 20% after Target severs ties with co The manufacturer also makes towels for the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Other products it makes include bath robes, bath rugs and mats, area rugs, carpets, bed sheets, utility bedding and fashion bedding. Shares of Welspun India fell as much as 20% on the BSE Aug. 22, and hit the lower circuit. The company said in a statement (pdf) to stock exchanges that it has commissioned an audit. “We have initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor (one of the Big Four) to audit our supply and processes,” said Welspun India, part of the $3 billion Welspun Group, adding the issue is of “highest priority.” Important customers The textile maker—and its shareholders—have reason to be worried because it has a huge exposure to the US market. “Every 5th towel sold in the US is manufactured by Welspun India,” according to its annual report (pdf). The company depends on exports for 95% of its revenue. It earned a total revenue of Rs 4,961 crore for the 2015-16 financial year. Future growth hinges on the US market where the company is targeting the hospitality sector, analysts have said. “Growth potential in the US hospitality and health care channels remains immense as Welspun sales from hospitality channel at $25-30 million (versus market size of $1.5 billion across both these segments). Welspun is in business development phase in its healthcare segment,” analysts Avi Mehta and Sameer Gupta of IIFL Institutional Equities, a brokerage, wrote in a July 27 research note. Welspun India didn’t immediate reply to an email from Quartz inquiring on the specific business impact of Target’s decision. MORE IN MONEY Who is Urjit Patel?

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Displaying weakness for the second straight session today, shares of Welspun India crashed 20 percent as the US-based retailer Target Corp has decided to terminate its contract with the company for alleged lapses in products supplied to it. After a weak opening, the scrip tumbled 19.99 percent to Rs 65.85 -- its lower circuit limit -- on BSE. On NSE, the shares plummeted 19.97 percent to hit its lowest trading permissible limit for the day at Rs 66.10. The stock had plunged 20 percent in the previous session also, wiping out Rs 3,716.88 crore from its market valuation in two days. The Indian textiles manufacturer said it is investigating the root cause and in the process of appointing an external auditor to audit its supply systems and processes. Target Corporation is the second largest retailer in the US after Walmart and is a major customer for Welspun. "We refer to a product specification issue with one client programme of our subsidiary WGBL. We have initiated immediate actions to investigate the root cause. We are appointing an external auditor (one of the Big Four) to audit our supply systems and processes," Welspun India had said in BSE filing. Target Corp said it has confirmed after an extensive investigation that Welspun, which uses Egyptian cotton to make bedsheets and pillowcases sold by the retailer, substituted another type of non-Egyptian cotton while producing these sheets between August 2014 and July 2016. "As soon as our investigation confirmed the substitution, we pulled all remaining products from Target stores and Target.com. We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them," Target Corp had said in a statement last week.

Photo-Me will buy 191 Asda in-store photo centres and 172 self-service kiosks and operate the supermarket’s online photo-processing service. It will pay £3.35m for the business and will also buy about £2m of stock. The world’s biggest photobooth operator will manage the sites as concessions in stores for 10 years and pay commission to Asda. Employees at the photo division will work for Photo-Me after the deal is finalised in October. Asda is getting rid of surplus services such as in-store pizza-making as it seeks to reverse plunging sales at its main grocery business. The Walmart-owned chain has faced intense competition from Aldi, Lidl and a revived Tesco amid an ongoing price war between food retailers. Photo-processing had already been earmarked for the chop by Asda, with Photo-Me saying in April it was interested in buying the business, which lost £3.4m last year on sales of £19.3m. Photo-Me said it expected to increase sales by installing better equipment, revamping layouts and introducing new products. Serge Crasnianski, Photo-Me’s chief executive, said: “This is an interesting opportunity to significantly expand our UK business in a strong set of locations and increase our market share in the digital photo printing market, which we believe has growth potential in the digital age.” Photo-Me’s main business is operating photobooths and digital printing kiosks. It trades in 17 countries and has 6,600 photobooths in the UK. Underlying pre-tax profit rose 15% to a record £40.1m last year, helped by demand for photos for an identity card in Japan.

While inside the CVS Pharmacy in Tell City, Tell City Officer Daymion Marsh observed a man acting suspicious. Marsh contacted Master Trooper Trey Lytton and informed him that the man had been driving a white Chevrolet Cavalier. Lytton drove through the parking lot and located the vehicle, but did not get a computer return on the vehicle registration until after it had left the parking lot. Lytton continued checking information and found that the possible identity of the male was 37-year-old Jason Tuley of Dale. Tuley was actively wanted through Spencer County. Marsh confirmed with Lytton after seeing a picture that Tuley was the male he observed in CVS. A short time later, Lytton observed the Chevrolet pull into the Walmart parking lot on State Road 66 in Tell City. Lytton observed the Chevrolet pull up to the front of the store where 19-year-old Shawn Payne of Evanston got into the car. Lytton observed the Chevrolet pull onto State Road 66, when Tell City Officer Bryce Hammack initiated the traffic stop. Officers learned that both Tuley and Payne were wanted on warrants through Spencer County. As officers were checking the Chevrolet, they opened the trunk and immediately smelled a strong chemical odor. After observing numerous items consistent with the manufacturing of meth, the Indiana State Police Methamphetamine Suppression Section was contacted to dismantle and dispose of the meth lab. During a search of the vehicle, officers found smoking pipes, hypodermic needles, synthetic marijuana, pills that were identified as legend drugs, and burnt aluminum foil that field tested positive for meth. Both Tuley and Payne were arrested without incident and lodged in the Perry County Jail. Both men are facing charges of manufacturing meth, a Level 5 felony; possession of meth, a Level 6 felony; possession of 2 or more precursors, Level 6 felony; maintaining a common nuisance, a Level 6 felony; possession of a hypodermic syringe (9 Counts), Level 6 Felony; possession of a legend drug, a Level 6 felony; possession of a synthetic drug, a Class A misdemeanor; possession of drug paraphernalia, a Class C misdemeanor Tweet « Previous Article Next Article »  Print    Archive    RSS Have a question or comment about a news story?

The mutual fund led a $350 million round in e-commerce company Jet.com at what research firm CB Insights says was a $1.5 billion valuation. Now, with Walmart Stores buying Jet.com for $3.3 billion, some of the biggest names on Wall Street and Silicon Valley — from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Google’s venture arm — are cashing in. Backers of Jet.com, which bought Omaha-based Hayneedle earlier this year, may rake in anywhere from twice to 15 times their initial outlay, depending on when they invested. Latecomer Fidelity owned shares worth $14.6 million, according to a June 30 filing. While that investment hardly moves the needle for the giant investment firm — it represents just 0.079 percent of net assets in Fidelity’s Blue Chip Growth Fund — it’s doubled in value in just eight months. A Fidelity spokesman declined to comment. Earlier investors will fare better. Those in the running for a five-times return include Alibaba Capital Partners, Citi Ventures, Coatue Management, Forerunner Ventures and General Catalyst. Also in that group are Goldman Sachs, Google Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Silicon Valley Bank, Temasek Holdings Pte and Thrive Capital. All of them invested in early 2015, according to CrunchBase, at what was reported to be a $600 million valuation. But the biggest winners are investors from the first round in July 2014. At the time, Jet.com’s price tag was more than $200 million, a lofty valuation at the time considering it was an early funding round, according to one investor who participated. New Enterprise Associates led that round, with participation from Accel, Bain Capital Ventures, MentorTech Ventures, Primary Venture Partners and angel investor David Spector. Those investors could pull in a 15-times return on their investment. “It was an early round and I was lucky to get in,” said Spector, who co-founded online lingerie startup ThirdLove. Spector said he believed in Jet.com founder Marc Lore, who had sold an earlier company that included Diapers.com to Amazon.com Inc. Most interesting to Spector was the new pricing mechanism Lore created with Jet, designed to decrease costs as shoppers added more items to their online cart. Spector told other angel and venture investors about the startup, but they passed, he said. Not only that, they began increasingly to needle him as Jet.com raised cash at higher valuations and announced plans to spend hundreds of millions on marketing to gain users. “When I saw them socially, they’d give me an eye roll and a sarcastic, ‘Hey, how’s Jet doing?’ ” said Spector, noting that by then it had become unfashionable for startups to focus on anything but profit. Spector hasn’t worked out his actual return yet because his investment was diluted with each subsequent round, but he considers it a win. “I got a few emails over the weekend saying ‘Congratulations. You got the last laugh.’ ” More information No job cuts at Hayneedle after parent company Jet.com's purchase, Walmart says Hayneedle will continue to exist as a standalone brand, a Walmart spokesman said after the mega-retailer bought the parent company of the Omaha-based online purveyor of housewares. Hayneedle looks forward to boost in sales, hiring after Walmart buys its parent company Walmart plans to open fewer new stores as it revamps its online efforts Tags David Spector Investment Goldman Sachs Investor Marc Lore Fidelity Valuation Featured Businesses CFI Tire Service Omaha 5115 Ctr St, Omaha, NE 68106 402-933-7962 Coupons Shelly Ragan | CBSHOME | Real Estate | Omaha 15950 W Dodge Rd, Ste 200, Omaha, NE 68118 402-672-5522 Priority 1 Fitness | Exercise Experts | Workout Equipment | Omaha 14491 W Center Rd, Omaha, NE 68144 402-330-1133 Equitable Bank | Personal & Business Banking Services | Financial Management | Omaha 10855 W Dodge Rd , Omaha, NE 68154 402-827-8100 NP Dodge Real Estate | California St. | Omaha NE California St. 13321 California St, Ste 300, Omaha, NE 68154 402-398-5282 Cutler-O'Neill-Meyer-Woodring Funeral Home 545 Willow Ave, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 712-322-7779 World-Herald 150 Stocks In case you missed it Holiday store hours around the area Crossroads Mall site developers likely to miss end-of-year demolition deadline Cabela's didn't meet financial goals in 2015, but executives still collected big bonuses Berkshire’s surprise investment in airlines is a ‘seal of approval’ for soaring industry At the center of debate over Costco plant in Fremont: How 17 million chickens will affect the area Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway Berkshire’s surprise investment in airlines is a ‘seal of approval’ for soaring industry Replay: Nov. 22 Warren Watch chat Venue changes to Anthony’s Steakhouse, but business students still drink in Warren Buffett's advice Tweets by @OWHmoney loading...
