New Falls resident Kyandrea Thomas, 34, was arrested Monday for the dastardly act, as noted by Inside Edition, and charged with attempted second degree murder. According to the tabloid news program, Thomas was soliciting patrons outside of the Walmart for tips on behalf of the Salvation Army on Saturday, December 24, when she suddenly went into labor. Rather than request medical assistance, the accused instead made her way to a bathroom stall inside of the department mega-store and gave birth to a healthy baby girl, before placing the her inside of a plastic bag and tossing her into a garbage can. KYANDREA THOMAS 34,LOUISIANA Woman> Accused Of Abandoning Newborn in Walmart Bathroom & THROWING IT IN THE TRASHCAN https://t.co/910GrDQr5p — Eric Wright™ (@therealeric916) December 26, 2016 By happenstance, another Walmart employee who was sent to clean out the bathroom discovered the child inside of the bin and called for help. Initially unresponsive, the newborn was able to be properly resuscitated at nearby Point Coupee General Hospital before being transferred to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital in Baton Rouge. The child, who was temporarily named Olivia by medical staff, is now said to be in stable condition. “It’s a very emotional situation, to say the least,” Pointe Coupee Sheriff Bud Torres expressed of the matter. “We don’t know all the facts or what the motivation was for it, but it was a senseless act on her part.” Chief Deputy Joe Gannon, a staff member of the Pointe Coupee Parish Coroner’s Office, relayed to FOX Carolina that Thomas’ baby was approximately 4- to 6-hours-old when the Walmart employee found her in the bathroom. Incidentally, this was not the first time that Thomas has been accused of causing harm to a child. As noted by CBS affiliate WAFB-9, the body of 3-year-old Damiyn McElveen was found inside of a van belonging to Wanda’s Kids World, a day care center that once employed Thomas, in 2009. As stated by court documents, Thomas, along with two other former day care workers, somehow forgot to ensure that McElveen had exited the vehicle on July 1 of that year after picking her up at home earlier that day. As such, the toddler was left to overheat inside of the van for six hours, with temperatures outside reaching upwards to 90 degrees during the afternoon. Thomas was subsequently sentenced to five years probation and 10,000 hours of community service. Kyandrea Thomas of Louisiana allegedly threw her newborn baby inside of a Walmart bathroom trash bin. [Image by slobo/iStock] Louisiana is one of several states that has currently has a “Safe-Haven” statute in play. Under that law, which is occasionally referred to as the “Baby Moses law” (in reference to the plight of the biblical character), overwhelmed parents can drop off unharmed newborns or infants at state-designated hospitals or firehouses. As Kyandrea Thomas’ child was just born, the mother was fully eligible for the aforementioned regulation. Following her booking at the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison on Monday, Thomas was transferred to the Point Coupee Parish Jail, where she currently awaits sentencing. No word on the child’s father has been publicly made. Just last month, as reported by the Inquisitr, a Nigerian woman also gave birth inside of a public bathroom and discarded the fetus to make a connecting flight inside of an Austrian airport. Nigerian Mother ‘Dumps Baby At Vienna Airport So That She Didn’t Miss Her Flight https://t.co/Fu0c6Gw5DN — Information Nigeria (@infonaija) November 15, 2016 Just as with Kyandrea Thomas, janitorial employees for Vienna’s Schwechat International Airport found the newborn, who, like Thomas’ baby, was also placed inside of a plastic bag and thrown into one of the bathroom’s trash bins. The unnamed child, whose gender was not made public, subsequently died as a result of complications of a prolonged lack of oxygen. The mother, who was a college student on her way to America, was taken to a nearby hospital to be treated before being arrested.

Chancey One of our newer members commented, “You folks do Christmas all month long!” And we do! I love to preach Christmas sermons, and to collect Christmas stories. Now we’re on the other side of Christmas, gearing up for a New Year. But let’s allow the Christmas spirit to linger just a little longer, shall we? Christmas brings out the best in most people and usually we hear about someone expressing the Christmas spirit in a generous way. Tulsa’s Fox 23 reported that Christmas came early for shoppers in a local Walmart after a secret Santa paid off every layaway. The gracious individual not only paid layaway debts, but also bought $50 Walmart gift cards for the 162 customers, then donated a generous amount to the Salvation Army’s Angel Tree program. Can you imagine the thrill customers experienced when they learned their accounts had been paid off and they could come pick up their items? The donations totaled nearly $50,000. (http://www.ajc.com/news/national/secret-santa-pays-for-thousands-dollars...). In Wake Forest, North Carolina, a U.S. postal worker and a good Samaritan acted fast when the postal truck caught fire while making deliveries. As soon as the fire started in the engine, the driver scrambled and started unloading packages that included numerous Christmas gifts. As the fire spread, they were able to get all the packages off the truck. “If it wasn’t for her quick thinking to pull right over and remove the parcels, it could’ve been tough,” said Wake Forest fire chief Ed Barrett. “Somebody did save Christmas. . .” (http://www.ajc.com/news/national/watch-postal-worker-saves-christmas-aft...). The Christmas spirit is not just about giving material gifts. It’s about giving of oneself. Two Milwaukee brothers who had just gone to the mall to buy new snow boots were on their way home and noticed a man in a wheelchair trying to shovel snow off of his sidewalk. Daniel Jr., 10, and Dominic, 6, Medina pleaded with their dad to stop the car while they pulled out their brand new boots and put them on. They borrowed shovels from the man and spent the next 45 minutes clearing his large corner lot’s sidewalks and also the nearby bus stop. The proud dad, Daniel Sr., snapped a photo, posted it on Facebook, and it took off. These boys found a way to give that didn’t involve spending money. Of course, the greatest Gift ever given is God’s Son, whose birth we celebrate at Christmastime. Because God shared with us, we should find ways to share His love with others. Dr. J. Robert White has served as executive director of the Georgia Baptist Mission Board since 1993. During his first December, he shared this story: It was Christmas morning in Los Angeles 30 years ago and Father Hopkins was unlocking the doors of the church in preparation for the 6 a.m. Mass.  A quick glance around the sanctuary indicated that everything was in order.  The worshippers came and went. Just before 8 a.m. the Father checked again to make sure everything was together, but to his great dismay, the Christ child was missing from the nativity scene. In the frantic search that followed, there was no sign of the missing statue.  Everything else in the scene was untouched.  Who would want a plaster-of-paris likeness of baby Jesus?  The statue wasn’t worth much, but the nativity scene certainly was not worth anything without the Christ child. Was this a prank?  Did a Christmas scrooge strike?  Was this the work of an atheist?  One fact was clear:  someone had the gall to walk right into the chapel take baby Jesus right out of the manger. Just before the 9 a.m. Mass, a seven-year-old boy appeared at the front door of the church.  He was pulling a brand new red wagon.  In it was the missing statue. “Where did you find him?” asked the priest. “I didn’t find him, I took him,” replied the boy. When asked why, he said, “I prayed for a brand new wagon and I promised Him that when it came, I’d give Him the very first ride.” I like this Christmas spirit of sharing and giving. Maybe we can keep it going all year round?   Dr. David L. Chancey is pastor, McDonough Road Baptist Church, Fayetteville, GA.

The retailer now requires workers to wear a white or navy collared shirts, khaki or black pants, close-toed shoes and a new, royal blue vest with the Walmart logo. Employees are already distressed about the financial burden that the new Walmart uniforms will bring upon them as the chain is only providing them with the vest. Walmart’s current uniform consists of blue shirts and khakis but the company did not require collared shirts before. Other employees believe the new Walmart uniforms are a waste of money. “Our registers and other equipment are slow and unreliable,” said one worker who also complained about the working conditions. He added that the retailer could be spendings its money more wisely. The new dress code takes effect on September 29.

TheStreet Staff Dec 27, 2016 10:12 AM EST The U.S. dollar is hovering near 14-year highs in the wake of the Fed's latest interest rate increase and expectations for tax cuts and other stimulus measures under a Trump administration. While Americans traveling overseas this holiday season are getting more bang for their buck, one corporate giant isn't too happy. Walmart's (WMT) outsized international exposure stands to wreak havoc on its bottom line during the fourth quarter and into the early part of 2017. The extent of the damage in the fourth quarter could come as a surprise to many on Wall Street as Walmart's full earnings guidance of $4.20 to $4.35 a share assumed no change in currency rates when it was issued in mid-November.

ANDY MATSKO/STAFF PHOTOS Mary and Bob Porter, Pottsville, shop for day-after-Christmas sales Monday at Boscov’s at the Fairlane Village mall, Norwegian Township. Image Gallery for Bargain hunting season Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link Freezing rain slickened some roads in Schuylkill County on Monday. But that didn’t stop some people from one of their favorite Yuletide traditions, day-after-Christmas shopping. “We do Black Friday and this is something we do after Christmas. We were at Wal-Mart just after 7. I think they had the best deals. I left with a cart full of Christmas lights,” Holly Swope, Ringtown, said as she visited Schuylkill Mall in Frackville. Bargain hunters also flocked to shopping centers including Fairlane Village mall in Norwegian Township and Wal-Mart in Saint Clair. When the doors to Boscov’s opened at 7 a.m. Monday, there were eight people waiting to come in. “It’s not what it used to be in years past. In years past you’d have crowds at all the malls at all the stores,” Liz Eich, store manager at Boscov’s at Fairlane Village mall, said. At 7:30 a.m., Natalie Setlock, Pottsville, had finished her shopping at Boscov’s. “I couldn’t sleep past six. They opened at 7 and I got here right at 7. They have good deals here and QVC, the home shopping network,” Setlock said. Items she bought included a pair of slippers for her boyfriend, William Spleen, and towel sets. Therese Freeman, Pine Grove, arrived at Boscov’s at 7:10 a.m. “And we came out early to beat the crowd. People are still sleeping in yet, I think,” Freeman said at 7:35 a.m. “We came out to look for deals on Christmas lights and things like that,” Freeman said. Boscov’s was advertising “50-75 percent off our entire trim-a-home department.” That’s where items like artificial Christmas trees, Christmas lights and other holiday decor can be found. “I’m looking for sales on Christmas stuff for next year,” Rhoda Weir, Forestville, said at 7:45 a.m. At 7:55 a.m., Trisha Updegrave, Williamstown, and her mother, Karen, hauled a few big bags out of Boscov’s front entrance. Many were filled with Christmas decorations, including a Santa Claus doll. “And gifts. Good deals,” Trisha said. “We have many areas with sales of more than 50 percent off. In the trim-a-home area we’re up to 75 percent off Christmas merchandise,” Eich said. “It’s definitely a tradition. People know they’re coming in to shop for bargains on things that will definitely go on sale after the holidays, seasonal items. A lot of people buy for next year,” Eich said. At 8:15 a.m., Charles Bailey, Tamaqua, and his wife, Laura, were searching for something specific in Boscov’s trim-a-home department. “We were looking for certain outdoor decorations, big plastic decorations, the old-fashioned kind which light up outside. They had a big selection. We were looking for the ones that resemble carolers. They had a pile here. I saw them here about a week ago, and there were about 20 on the shelf. But I think now they’re completely sold out. We’re amazed at how it’s wiped out here,” Bailey said. At 8:20 a.m., Dan Keysock, Frackville, was wearing a Santa hat as he toured Boscov’s trim-a-home department. “I was just over at Wal-Mart and a lady over there said they had 50 people at the door waiting for them to open up this morning,” Keysock said. He took a few boxes of Christmas lights up to the counter. “I’m looking for sales, looking for lights,” Keysock said. His order would have totaled more than $150, but with the sale it came to just over $45. The Bon-Ton at Schuylkill Mall opened at 7 a.m. Monday and other stores in the mall opened at 10 a.m. Monday. At 9:20 a.m., Ida Rakowsky, Schuylkill Haven, was walking through the mall with her daughter, Anastasia, 17. “We’re trying to get some good deals. We’re here for Bath and Body Works,” Ida said. “They do big sales,” Anastasia said. At 9:45 a.m., Holly Swope and her mother, Karen Donchak, also of Ringtown, were wandering around Schuylkill Mall waiting for stores to open. “We’re here for semi-annual sales,” Holly said. “And the sales at Bath and Body Works,” her mother said. They had just come from shopping at Boscov’s. “We were looking for sales on decorations for outside, blow-ups, things like that. And I found a blow-up decoration there, a Santa with a helicopter. It was 75 percent off. The regular price was $109. I got it for $29.99,” Holly said. “We were at Boscov’s around 7 a.m. There was hardly anybody there. I was telling her the early morning crowds for day-after-Christmas shopping around here was incredible years ago. It’s not what it used to be. You used to see crowds of people waiting to get in. It’s just not anymore,” Ida said. More than 20 years ago, day-after-Christmas sales drew much larger crowds, according to people interviewed Monday. But times have changed. “I think the economy plays a part of everything, especially when gas prices are so high,” Setlock said. “I think it’s the internet,” Ida Rakowsky said. “A lot of people go online shopping,” Weir said. “You can find your good deals on the internet and you don’t have to wait until after Christmas until the stores drop their prices because somebody online has it on sale already,” Ida Rakowsky said. “I do most of my shopping online. I did almost all of my Christmas shopping online this year so I wouldn’t have to be out in the crowds,” Freeman said. “I don’t know what happened really,” Karen Updegrave said. “I think the economy hit a lot of people,” Trisha Updegrave said. “I used to go to Kmart, but they’re not around here anymore,” Keysock said, referring to the Kmart at Schuylkill Mall that closed in 2015. Elaine T. Maneval, Schuylkill Mall manager, and Eich offered another reason why the shopping crowds many not be so intense this year. “So many stores do promotions before Christmas. They’ll get very close to that 75 percent off. And some people may not wait until that day after. They’ll take advantage of it right before the holiday,” Eich said. “Now, after-Christmas deals start before Christmas is even here. Black Friday has moved into Thanksgiving. And I guess the day after Christmas has moved to before Christmas,” Maneval said. At 10 a.m. Monday, three siblings, Kayla Borrelli, 17, of Minersville, and her brothers, Micah, 14, and Cody, 11, were at Schuylkill Mall. For them, day-after-Christmas shopping isn’t a tradition. They were there because Kayla wanted to see what was on sale at Bath and Body Works. “I think some items are 75 percent off,” she said.

Carolyn Wilkerson, of Sweet Home, happily waited in the customer service line Monday at Wal-Mart Supercenter, 9002 N. Navarro St. "Everybody is so nice," Wilkerson said. "There is no pushing or shoving." She was returning gifts the day after Christmas because she is having surgery Wednesday. "I talked with a sweet boy this morning, picked up some things for myself and did my exchanges," Wilkerson said. "This is how it should be after Christmas." Red and green Christmas sweaters, striped socks and oversized shirts made their way back to retail stores Monday hours after being unwrapped as gifts. About 8 percent of annual retail sales are returned, according to the National Retail Federation, but 20 percent of all returns take place during the holiday season, and one out of every three recipients has returned a holiday gift. Christy Fojt, of Yoakum, clutched a pack of Hanes men's T-shirts in the customer service line. "I'm the wife that bought the wrong size for her husband," Fojt said. While people were looking to exchange their Christmas items, others were looking to add to or update their spirit for next Christmas. Among the families looking to save on Christmas decorations for next year was the Blaschke family, of Cuero. The family purchased Christmas lights, wreathes and outdoor light fixtures. "We do this almost always," Shea Blaschke said of their day-after-Christmas trips to Hobby Lobby and Wal-Mart. Many Victoria businesses saw a busy day of returns, exchanges and purchases. Another store filled with holiday shoppers was The Market of Victoria, 1411 E. Airline Road. Traffic picked up noticeably Monday morning, said employee Joann Utley, of Victoria. Browsing among jewelry and home furnishings was Becky Barrier, of Houston, who was visiting family for the holidays. "I've seen some things I'd like to pick up," Barrier said. She said she had shopped at the market previously. "If I find a treasure that has a deal after Christmas, I will buy it," Barrier said.

LGBTQ activists from Iraq, Lebanon, South Africa, Sri Lanka, St. Lucia, Sweden, Thailand, and the U.S. gathered at the office of OutRight Action International, formerly the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, in New York, N.Y., to discuss the impact of the incoming Trump Administration and urge the president-elect and his administration to maintain U.S. commitment to protecting the human rights of LGBTQ people globally. info: outrightinternational.org.

Through the AIDS United Positive Organizing Project, with funding from Gilead Sciences, the concept of meaningful engagement of people living with HIV/AIDS is being revitalized. Through the initiative, 17 community-based organizations throughout the country will tackle HIV-related stigma and discrimination in their communities by advancing grassroots organizing among people living with HIV. Two Carolinas organizations are among those listed and are Palmetto AIDS Life Support Services and Positive Women’s Network. info: aidsunited.org. The National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) published a report on the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, which is a follow-up to the 2011 groundbreaking National Transgender Discrimination Survey report published by the National LGBTQ Task Force and NCTE. The report was compiled from data collected from 27,715 transgender people in the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and U.S. military bases overseas. It showed disparities between transgender individuals and the general population. info: thetaskforce.org. ustranssurvey.org/report. K. Rocco Shields, director and co-writer of the provocative film “Love Is All You Need?,” is creating a one million dollar fund to be distributed to 20 non-profits that partnered with her during the film’s “MovieMent” tour. The film is a love story taking place in a parallel world where being gay is mainstream. Heterosexuals are bullied and ostracized for who they love.

Fred Davie, executive vice president at Union Theological Seminary in New York, N.Y., hosted a press conference with Evangelical and other faith leaders from around the country to promote a pro-LGBTQ public policy agenda for the Trump Administration and new Congress. “It is vital that the Trump Administration and Congress continue to support policies and legislation that preserves and defends the rights of all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation,” said Rev. Dr. Serene Jones, president of Union Theological Seminary. “We at Union are proud of the historic advances in LGBTQ rights and we remain committed to advocating for the equal protection of all people under the law.” Presenters at the event highlighted why they support the LGBTQ community because of their faith, and not in spite of it. The policy agenda will focus on five key areas proposed by faith leaders: LGBTQ basic rights, LGBTQ homeless youth, LGBTQ senior citizens, the transgender community, and global anti-discrimination. info: utsnyc.edu.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has released a report showing high rates of substance use and mental illness among sexual minority adults. The report used data from the administration’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health and found that more than 39 percent of sexual majority adults have reported illicit drug use in the past year versus 17.1 percent in the case of heterosexual adults with a similar split for instances of mental illness. However, the research does show that sexual minority adults are also more likely to seek and receive treatment for these issues. SAMHSA also provided additional resources for and about the LGBT community. info: samhsa.gov/behavioral-health-equity/lgbt. When Jon Stryker and Jurek Wajdowicz launched their collaboration with The New Press, they set out to to explore and illuminate the most intimate and personal dimension of self, still too often treated as taboo: gender identity and expression and sexual orientation. Their series is the only one to commission photojournalists to document international LGBTQ life. They have assembled photographers to do more than shed light on LGBTQ life. So far there are five volumes which have featured subjects from the U.S., Australia, Mexico, Russia, and most recently India, specifically Delhi, and a sixth is due out next year about Japan. info: thenewpress.com. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (Lawyers’ Committee) and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) issued a statement in response to a nationwide spike in hate-filled incidents nationwide. It says, “Hate crimes and hate-filled incidents stand as a dark cloud over our democracy,” said Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law President and Executive Director Kristen Clarke. “The recent spike in hate crimes is attributable, in part, to the racially-charged rhetoric that characterized the 2016 election cycle and the rise of ‘alt-right’ white nationalist extremism. This is a moment that calls for federal, state, and local officials to use every tool in their arsenal to fully investigate and prosecute these incidents when they occur.” “President-elect Trump says he’s surprised his supporters have been responsible for hate incidents across the country and that he has no idea why the white supremacist community has been energized by this victory,” said Southern Poverty Law Center President Richard Cohen. “But none of it should come as news to him. Both are the predictable results of the incendiary campaign that he waged for the presidency.” info: lawyerscommittee.org. splcenter.org.

Walmart Stores Inc. class-action lawsuit. “Actions speak louder than words, and until now, Walmart’s actions regarding LGBTQ workers’ and their spouses’ health benefits were discriminatory and hurtful. We are pleased to hear that Walmart has admitted wrongdoing in Cote et al. v. Walmart Stores, Inc., and that they have agreed to abide by anti-discrimination policies, and to make those who have been discriminated against whole. It is our hope that Walmart accepts how wrong they were so that not one more Walmart worker will have to experience such injustice and bigotry. We congratulate Jacqueline for her bravery, and we hope she inspires other Walmart workers to come forward and speak up about intolerance. In addition, we hope that Walmart realizes that this is just a start, and that too many of its hard-working Walmart men and women face poverty-level wages, poor benefits and unfair workplaces.

Kim LaCapria Dec 26, 2016 Share - - In mid-December 2016, the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) asked Amazon and Walmart to remove third-party "Black Lives Matter" related merchandise from their vast online marketplaces. On 20 December 2016, the FOP tweeted a copy of a letter addressed to Walmart requesting such items be removed from the retail giant's online listings: Letter from National President Canterbury to Walmart President and CEO regarding third party sellers of BLM gear on the company website. pic.twitter.com/BLu1Eb0iND — FOP Legislative (@FOPLegislative) December 20, 2016 The Washington Post reported that Walmart acquiesced to part of the request, removing "Bulletproof" items (but not "Black Lives Matter" merchandise): The president of the national Fraternal Order of Police, the country’s largest police organization, on [20 December 2016] asked Walmart to stop selling t-shirts and sweatshirts which say “Black Lives Matter” and “Bulletproof” on the department store’s website. Walmart said it would remove the shirts which say “Bulletproof,” but not the “Black Lives Matter” shirts. “Black Lives Matter” is a slogan and protest movement which emerged after the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and police-involved slayings in 2014, and is seen as offensive by many in law enforcement. The website Breitbart.com posted an article which said that Walmart was “selling Black Lives Matter clothing and other items,” though the merchandise is actually being sold through Walmart’s website by [a third-party merchant] ... Chuck Canterbury, the FOP president, wrote to Walmart CEO C. Douglas McMillon to advise him that the Walmart website was selling “offensive shirts and sweatshirts,” and “I urge you to prohibit the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products.” The Walmart site and Old Glory’s site also sell “Blue Lives Matter” shirts. On 21 December 2016, the FOP tweeted a copy of a similar letter (that referenced the "urban myth of 'hands up, don't shoot'") sent to online retailer Amazon.com and posted a larger copy on Facebook: In the letter to Walmart, Canterbury warned he was "concerned that by allowing these articles of clothing to be sold in this way will damage [Walmart's] good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers." The version sent to Amazon asserted Canterbury was "very upset" that the company was "complicit in the sale of this offensive merchandise." On 22 December 2016, a Walmart representative was quoted as saying: Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise ... After hearing concerns from customers, we removed the specific item with the 'bulletproof' reference. Both the maker of the shirts in question and an FOP executive spoke to USA Today about the controversy: Glenn Morelli, the owner of Old Glory Merchandise, the shirt's maker, said he's not surprised by the FOP's request. He got a call from the organization and decided he'd pull the shirt himself. He said the shirt now isn't featured on any of the websites selling Old Glory merchandise. "We understand where the FOP stand and their point of view," Morelli said. "We didn't want to ruffle any feathers. Also, too, we support the police in different ways." FOP Executive Director Jim Pasco said his organization doesn't oppose the "Black Lives Matter" phrase, but does object to those who intend to divide Americans racially. The organization, he said, decided to take action after the shirt was flagged by members. On 22 December 2016, GQ criticized the FOP's request for not extending to either retailer's selection of "Blue Lives Matter" shirts: Oddly, the FOP's screed voices no analogous concerns about the variety of reactionary, dog whistle-y "Blue Lives Matter" merchandise that is also available on those sites — merchandise that, according to one supplier, "sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined." Walmart, of course, caved immediately. The right's continued insistence on treating Black Lives Matter as a violent anti-police ideology is bafflingly misplaced at best and willfully misleading at worst. At the most basic level, it's a slogan adopted by people who share the groundbreaking opinion that black people should not be getting killed by police officers at alarming rates. This is not a position that should be remotely partisan or contentious. Although Walmart granted the FOP's request (at least in part) with alacrity, as of 26 December 2016 Amazon had not publicly responded to requests they cease selling "Black Lives Matter" merchandise, and a "Bulletproof" shirt (not the same as the one depicted above) was among items available for sale on Amazon along with two one-star reviews dated 26 December 2016. The FOP asserted that the organization would "continue to pressure retailers who sell the Black Lives Matter (BLM) merchandise until the group makes it clear that [they] don’t approve of anti-police violence." The generally stated focus of the BLM movement is not to promote violence against police, but to address "issues of racial profiling, police brutality, and perceived racial inequality in the United States criminal justice system."

The blue and black stripes — in this instance — is supposed to represent the “Blue Lives Matter” movement, at the protest by police and police supporters that was held on Thursday, July 28, 2016. That protest in Somerville, Massachusetts, featured Mayor Joe Curtatone’s pledge to keep a “Black Lives Matter” banner in City Hall — in spite of some complaints from police. Now the “Black Lives Matter” and “Blue Lives Matter” debate is once again in focus, because of recent requests from the Fraternal Order of Police. As reported by Snopes, both Amazon and Walmart were asked by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) to get rid of “Black Lives Matter” products from their online space. Walmart responded in part to the request — reportedly removing the “Black Lives Matter” t-shirt that had #Bulletproof above the slogan, according to the Washington Post. Indeed, a search for #Bulletproof “Black Lives Matter” merchandise on Walmart’s website does not result in the #Bulletproof t-shirts. However, it does result in plenty of other “Black Lives Matter” t-shirts from third-party retailers. Fraternal Order of Police Calls for Amazon to Drop 'Black Lives Matter' Products https://t.co/sNLso6mLhz — snopes.com (@snopes) December 26, 2016 There are not only “Black Lives Matter” hoodies and t-shirts, but variations of the slogan, with ones declaring that “Blue Lives Matter” and that “Black Lives Also Matter” and that “Journalists Lives Matter” and that “Homeless Lives Matter,” too. It proves that Walmart’s response to the Fraternal Order of Police, which proclaimed that Walmart would indeed remove #Bulletproof t-shirts and sweatshirts but not all “Black Lives Matter” shirts remains true. The president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Chuck Canterbury, claimed that Walmart was selling an offensive product when it sold “Black Lives Matter” shirts. However, “Black Lives Matter” emerged after Trayvon Martin was shot and killed in 2012, after buying Skittles from a corner store. Not only did the Fraternal Order of Police request that the CEO of Walmart — C. Douglas McMillon — stop selling “Black Lives Matter” merchandise, Amazon was asked to do the same thing. Removal of “Blue Lives Matter” shirts, which remain on both Walmart and Amazon, was not mentioned in the Fraternal Order of Police request. The FOP called it an “urban myth of ‘hands up, don’t shoot‘” according to the Washington Post. The FOP claimed the “Black Lives Matter” t-shirts for sale on Amazon made them very upset that the online retailer was “complicit in the sale of this offensive merchandise.” Meanwhile, Walmart noted that they continue to offer “Blue Lives Matter” as well as “Black Lives Matter” and “All Lives Matter” merchandise via third-party retailers, like plenty of other online retailers. Walmart to stop selling Black Lives Matter shirt after FOP request, continues selling Blue Lives Matter gearhttps://t.co/qzgYgM0oZ6 — In Spite of Trump (@InSpiteOfTrump) December 21, 2016 “Black Lives Matter” has been accused of racially dividing the nation, however — as reported by GQ — the fact that “Blue Lives Matter” merchandize wasn’t criticized by the FOP was noted. As such, both “Black Lives Matter” and “Blue Lives Matter” merchandise — which reportedly sells more merchandise than “Black Lives Matter” — exist together on both retailers’ websites. And the debate continues between those who see “Black Lives Matter” as an anti-police movement versus those who see “Black Lives Matter” as a movement that tries to stop African-Americans from getting killed or jailed at disproportionate rates. Amazon has not responded, as of this writing, to the “Black Lives Matter” merchandise melee. At least one “Bulletproof” t-shirt exists on Amazon as of this writing, as well as multiple “Black Lives Matter” and “Blue Lives Matter” merchandise. Along with products like the Men’s Blue Lives Matter American Flag T-shirt on Amazon, there are “Blue Lives Mater” wristbands, hoodies, flags, reflective decals and more.

The Desert Dispatch compiled a list of five of the biggest public safety stories in Barstow in 2016.  Local authorities report five murders in the greater Barstow area — The first reported murder was the death of Calvin Lowell Welch Jr., a 45-year-old Barstow resident, back in April. Barstow Police Department officers responded to reports of shots fired and found two victims, including Welch, suffering from gunshot wounds. Police arrested Gregory Boiser after he barricaded himself in a home for over two hours before turning himself in to authorities. Boiser answered to a count of murder and attempted murder, that each include several enhancements, and is next scheduled to appear in court Jan. 9 for a pre-preliminary conference. — Kenneth Ray Hawkins, 62, of Barstow, was killed back in May. Police arrested Maurice Richard King over the weekend after responding to a home in the 1700 block of Paloma Street to check for Hawkins, who was previously reported missing. King told a responding officer that Hawkins was not home. The officer checked around the home and found Hawkins with upper body trauma. He was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators allege Hawkins was shot multiple times. King is next due in court March 24 for pretrial. — Robert Whitnack, 33, of Barstow, was killed in June after he was involved in a verbal dispute, authorities say. Whitnack was found lying on the ground with upper body trauma and was transported to Barstow Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead in the emergency room. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department's Specialized Enforcement Detail arrested Scott William Brodie on June 22, a day after authorities say he shot Whitnack. However, Brodie was released from custody because the District Attorney's office rejected the case. Homicide investigators told the Desert Dispatch they don't believe that there are "any additional suspects." Criminal charges have not been filed against Brodie related to Whitnack’s death. — Samantha Hedger, 22, of Phelan, was pronounced dead at the scene of a party where sheriff’s investigators say she was shot by her step-brother Joshua Leithland Inscho back in August. Sheriff's responded to a shooting in the 25000 block of Avenida Laredo in Barstow and learned that Inscho and Hedger went to the party together. While at the party Inscho was involved in an argument with another man. Then Inscho pulled out a handgun, authorities said. Hedger and another person grabbed Inscho and he fired the gun, striking Hedger. Inscho then fled from the location in a vehicle and was later arrested on suspicion of murder. Inscho is next due in court Jan. 31. — Roger Renteria was pronounced dead at at the Handy Carwash at 1221 E. Main St. after authorities say he was shot and killed by Eric Douglas Blocksom and Joaquin Gibson Jr. Barstow police arrested Blocksom, 24, after a three-hour standoff at the Suncrest Apartments, after he had been sought for over two weeks. Gibson, 23, was arrested the day of the shooting at his home in Barstow. Both men were charged with murder and other allegations. Gibson is next due in court on Jan. 6 for a dispo/reset. Blocksom is next due in court Jan. 17 for a pre-preliminary conference. Boy arrested after Wal-Mart fire causing an estimated $1 million in damages A 12-year-old boy was arrested after authorities say he started a fire in the arts and crafts section at Wal-Mart back in September. The blaze caused an estimated $1 million-plus in damage and forced management to shut down operations for several days. Paramedics treated several people for smoke inhalation due to the fire. The Barstow Police Department dispatch center received a call regarding a fire inside the business and preliminary investigation indicated that it had been intentionally set. A detective from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department Arson and Bomb Unit responded and determined that the fire's cause was arson. Detectives processed the scene, interviewed witnesses, and reviewed the Wal-Mart surveillance footage and identified a boy, wearing a green T-shirt with distinctive markings and black pants, who left Wal-Mart riding a push scooter and wearing a backpack. Detectives searched the area and located a boy on a scooter near Rimrock Road and Opal Street. He was wearing the same clothes as seen on the surveillance footage and detectives obtained additional evidence linking the boy to the arson. “Justified” officer involved shootings The San Bernardino County District Attorney’s office investigated two 2015 officer-involved shootings that occurred in Barstow and ruled both fatal shootings justified this year. The DA’s office announced in November that Dep. Kyle Woods was justified in his actions of "using deadly force to protect himself and others" after he shot and killed Nathaniel Harris Pickett II. Pickett was shot and killed at the El Rancho Motel in Barstow in November 2015. Woods initially made contact after he suspected Pickett of trespassing. Woods stopped to question Pickett and authorities said he provided a false name and was uncooperative during questioning. As Woods attempted to handcuff Pickett, he attempted to run and a fight ensued, which led to the shooting. Earlier this month, the DA's office said Barstow Police Department officers Andrew Buesa and Juan Zepeda were justified in shooting David Todd Powell Jr. in the backyard of his home in the 700 block of Armory Road on Sept. 15, 2015. Powell was shot after a "struggle ensued" with Barstow police officers. Both officers were injured during the struggle. The DA’s office said Buesa and Zepeda were presented with a “volatile and dangerous situation” after already being called to the residence two times prior that evening because Powell's family members feared he would harm someone. Both families also filed civil lawsuits earlier this year. Former principal takes plea deal A judge sentenced former Barstow STEM Academy Principal Mark Hassell to one year in county jail and five years of probation after he pleaded no contest to one count of oral copulation of a minor earlier this year. Hassell, who originally posted bail, had two days knocked off his sentence for time served and was deemed eligible for a work release program. As part of the plea deal, the court agreed to dismiss the seven other counts that Hassell had been charged with since his arrest in January 2015 on suspicion of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old female student. Hassell faced seven years and eight months in state prison. He was also ordered to register as a sex offender and he must stay away and not make any contact with the victim as part of a restraining order. Barstow police arrested Hassell after the department's school resource officer received a report that the principal had been engaging in a sexual relationship with a high school student. During the investigation, the student told authorities she had been involved in a consensual sexual relationship with Hassell "for some time." Hassell resigned as principal of the STEM Academy effective the same day as his arrest. He had spent more than a decade with the Barstow Unified School District, serving as a teacher and assistant principal at Barstow High before being appointed as the first principal of the STEM Academy in 2014. Espinoza promoted to BPD captain Andy Espinoza Jr. was promoted to captain in May, becoming the first person to hold that title within the Barstow Police Department. Espinoza was sworn-in back in May after spending 11 months as the department’s lieutenant. Espinoza was promoted to lieutenant after Mike Hunter retired in 2015. As captain, Espinoza manages and oversees all the department's administrative functions, including managing the detective division, civilian employees and also overseeing the department's internal affairs program. But the position was met with controversy after Councilman Rich Harple voted against the budget because of the captain's position. Harpole, a former lieutenant and detective with the department, claimed the department did not necessarily need a captain because of its size. The department later promoted Chris Kirby to lieutenant, after serving as detective sergeant for about a year. As lieutenant, Kirby oversees the department's patrol division and focuses on managing law enforcement patrol duties to help reduce crime.

According to the Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff's Office, Kyandrea Thomas was arrested by New Roads Police Department officers shortly after noon on Dec. 24 and charged with attempted second-degree murder. Thomas was also arrested in 2009 on a negligent homicide charge after leaving a young child in a hot car. Officials believe Thomas gave birth to the baby in the store and proceeded to throw the infant in the trash. She later checked herself into Lane Regional Medical Center, where she was later discharged and taken into custody immediately. According to police, the infant may have been found by a Walmart employee. Chief Deputy Joe Gannon with the Pointe Coupee Parish Coroner's Office said the baby was approximately four to six hours old when found. The baby was unresponsive at first, but medical personnel was able to stabilize the baby at the hospital. Officials are temporarily calling the baby girl Olivia. The baby was initially taken to the local Pointe Coupee General Hospital for treatment and was then transferred to Our Lady of the Lake in Baton Rouge via Air Med flight. According to EMS, the baby was in stable condition.

The largest police union in the US is urging Amazon to pull t-shirts about the movement from its online marketplace. Eric Miller/Reuters | Caption Ben Rosen @Benji_Rosen December 26, 2016 —The largest police union in the US is urging Amazon to remove a t-shirt that reads “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” from its online marketplace. In an open letter to Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) said Wednesday that the t-shirt, sold through the website by a third-party vendor, is detrimental to the rebuilding of trust between police and black communities. “Commercializing our differences and perpetuating the myths which harm the relationships between the protectors and their communities is wrong at any time of year, but it is especially egregious now,” writes FOP National President Chuck Canterbury. “I understand that these are third-party sales, but Amazon does have the ability to prohibit the sale of products which are offensive to the public and which may damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” Amazon isn’t the first company to come under fire for allegedly giving support to the Black Lives Matter movement, whether inadvertently or intentionally.Walmart removed the same apparel from its website after it received a similar complaint from the police union last week. A Blue Lives Matter blogger also slammed ice cream manufacturer Ben and Jerry’s last fall for issuing a public statement called "Black Lives Matter" that the blogger suggested could encourage attacks on police.      These disputes may underscore how the Black Lives Matter movement, which was born out of protests against police use of force against African-Americans, particularly high-profile cases of unarmed men, is perceived by different groups.  How well do you know #BlackLivesMatter? Take the quiz. In contrast to those who say the movement promotes violence, others argue that it presents a chance to create unity.  “Those who use the phrase do not advocate violence,” Shawn Alexander, a professor of African and African-American studies at the University of Kansas, wrote in an email to The Christian Science Monitor last week, after Walmart chose to remove the t-shirts from its website. Efforts to paint Black Lives Matter as violent or divisive, he added, seek to “cover up the troublesome truth of America’s racist past and how that history continues to live and [affect] us today.” The “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” t-shirt was sold by Connecticut-based Old Glory Merchandise through Amazon. As of Monday, the merchandise could be viewed on Amazon, but was listed as “currently unavailable” for purchase. Other Black Lives Matter merchandise could still be purchased on the site. Walmart, too, has continued to sell other merchandise that promotes both Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter, which supports law enforcement, after pulling the "bulletproof" shirts from its shelves. “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference,” Walmart said in a statement. Mr. Canterbury, the FOP president, told The Guardian that Amazon should follow suit because the apparel could contribute to further violence against police. In an interview with the British newspaper, he cited the "amount of violence demonstrated at Black Lives Matter marches and the fact that eight police officers had been assassinated while protesting Black Lives Matter protests," referring to officers shot in separate incidents in Dallas and Baton Rouge last summer. Backers of Black Lives Matter have said the gunmen were not affiliated with the movement.   But Canterbury told The Guardian he believes anti-police rhetoric in the name of the protest group “had inspired people of feeble minds to strike out at police officers.” Blue Lives Matter made a similar argument in October, when Ben and Jerry’s issued a public statement in support of Black Lives Matter. Ben and Jerry’s wrote in its initial post that although the company believes that all lives matter, including those of law enforcement officers, police interactions with the black population are vastly different than those of white populations.   "That's why it's become clear to us at Ben & Jerry's that we have a moral obligation to take a stand now for justice and for Black lives," the company wrote. “Ben & Jerry’s went beyond making a statement in support of civil rights when they actively accused law enforcement of widespread racism,” wrote Blue Lives Matter in a blog post. “By spreading these false and misleading statements, Ben & Jerry’s lends an appearance of legitimacy to the baseless claims that police officers are killing men based on the color of their skin.” While these commercial issues have highlighted antagonism between different camps in this debate, other efforts have brought police and activists together. A Black Lives Matter protest in Wichita, Kansas this summer, for example, gained national attention when it turned into a community picnic with police. National Night Out, an annual event first introduced in 1984 to encourage communities to get to know their local police officers, took on new meaning in the wake of the police ambush in Dallas, which killed five officers and left several others wounded. American trust of police remains high. According to a June 2016 Gallup poll, 56 percent of Americans said they had either a great deal or quite a lot of trust in the police force. Police have consistently ranked among the most trusted institutions, according to Gallup polling, but 2015 marked a recent low point, at 52 percent trust.

Sign-Up × Glenn Morelli, the owner of Old Glory Merchandise, told CNN last week that he had decided to remove the "bulletproof" shirt from his own site.  "It wasn’t a big seller at all. The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined," he said. "We don't like to offend anybody."

The Fraternal Order Of Police put out an open letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, accusing Amazon of allowing vendors to profit from racial divisions by letting one of them sell shirts that read 'Bulletproof Black Lives Matter'. Wal-Mart stopped selling items with the same message Friday after the FOP called them offensive. The retailer cited customer concerns. The clothes still appear on Amazon but are currently listed as 'unavailable'. The country's largest police union has demanded that Amazon remove Black Lives Matter clothes (such as the T-shirt on the right) after getting Wal-Mart to pull similar items (left) 'I wanted to let you know that my members are very upset that you and Amazon are complicit in the sale of this offensive merchandise,' FOP president Chuck Canterbury wrote Wednesday in his open letter to Bezos. Fraternal Order Of Police president Chuck Canterbury (pictured) went after Amazon and Wal-Mart after resellers sold the items 'Commercializing our differences and perpetuating the myths which harm the relationships between the protectors and their communities is wrong at any time of year, but it is especially egregious now.' Canterbury told The Guardian on Friday that Amazon was 'a pretty liberal marketer'. He cited the 'amount of violence demonstrated at Black Lives Matter marches' as well as the shootings of eight police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge over the summer. The gunmen in both instances were not part of the Black Lives Matter movement. Canterbury wrote to Wal-Mart the day before he wrote to Amazon to ask the retailer to remove similar items.   Wal-Mart pledged to cease sales of the shirts Tuesday in a statement to the Associated Press. The company has a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties, including Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. The now-defunct Black Lives Matter items were sold by Connecticut-based Old Glory Merchandise. Wal-Mart said it had removed the Black Lives Matter shirt after hearing concerns from customers.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Pastors say Fort Worth mother's 'violent' arrest by a white...

(JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP/Getty Images) BY Jessica Schladebeck NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, December 26, 2016, 8:59 AM The largest police union in the country has requested Amazon follow Walmart’s lead and stop selling Black Lives Matter merchandise they’ve labeled “offensive.” In an open letter to the online retailer, Fraternal Order of Police president Chuck Canterbury urged CEO Jeff Bezos to remove all apparel with slogans “BULLETPROOF," "Black Lives Matter" and "Hands up, don't shoot" from Amazon's website. He encouraged Bezos to stand by the police union in “increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve.” The police order recently succeeded in having merchandise removed from Walmart’s online stores after accusing the retailer and the third-party sellers peddling the products to profit “from racial division.” Black Lives Matter says NYPD spied on group during Garner protest Describing Amazon as a “pretty liberal marketer,” Canterbury told the Guardian the rhetoric featured on some of their apparel has prompted a lot of tension between officers and members ot their community. The Fraternal Order of Police have asked Amazon to remove a shirt from their website that says "Bulletproof Black Lives Matter."  (Amazon) He cited the “amount of violence demonstrated at Black Lives Matter marches and the fact that eight police officers had been assassinated while protecting Black Lives Matter movements.” Canterbury was referencing two separate incidents: a shooting in Dallas where a sniper gunned down five officers during an anti-violence protest and another attack in Baton Rouge that left three officers dead. And while neither shooter was associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, Canterbury said the group’s rhetoric “had inspired people of feeble minds to strike out at police officers.” Mich. firefighter fired after racist Facebook comments “It happened as a result of the BLM groups,” he told the Guardian.

(JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP/Getty Images) BY Jessica Schladebeck NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, December 26, 2016, 8:59 AM The largest police union in the country has requested Amazon follow Walmart’s lead and stop selling Black Lives Matter merchandise they’ve labeled “offensive.” In an open letter to the online retailer, Fraternal Order of Police president Chuck Canterbury urged CEO Jeff Bezos to remove all apparel with slogans “BULLETPROOF," "Black Lives Matter" and "Hands up, don't shoot" from Amazon's website. He encouraged Bezos to stand by the police union in “increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve.” The police order recently succeeded in having merchandise removed from Walmart’s online stores after accusing the retailer and the third-party sellers peddling the products to profit “from racial division.” Black Lives Matter says NYPD spied on group during Garner protest Describing Amazon as a “pretty liberal marketer,” Canterbury told the Guardian the rhetoric featured on some of their apparel has prompted a lot of tension between officers and members ot their community. The Fraternal Order of Police have asked Amazon to remove a shirt from their website that says "Bulletproof Black Lives Matter."  (Amazon) He cited the “amount of violence demonstrated at Black Lives Matter marches and the fact that eight police officers had been assassinated while protecting Black Lives Matter movements.” Canterbury was referencing two separate incidents: a shooting in Dallas where a sniper gunned down five officers during an anti-violence protest and another attack in Baton Rouge that left three officers dead. And while neither shooter was associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, Canterbury said the group’s rhetoric “had inspired people of feeble minds to strike out at police officers.” Mich. firefighter fired after racist Facebook comments “It happened as a result of the BLM groups,” he told the Guardian.

The Fraternal Order of Police wants the online retailer to follow Walmart and remove a shirt that sports the words “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” across the chest, The Guardian reported Friday. Walmart removed the shirt from its store after the union called it “offensive.” FOP President Chuck Canterbury wrote in a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to support the union in “increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve.” As of Monday morning, the shirt was listed on the Amazon website, but was “currently unavailable.” Canterbury told The Guardian that he wasn’t surprised that Amazon wouldn’t remove the listing and called the website a “pretty liberal marketer.” WALMART STOPS SELLING ‘BULLETPROOF: BLACK LIVES MATTER SHIRTS ON ITS WEBSITE He added that the issue was still important because of the “amount of violence demonstrated at Black Lives Matter marches and the fact that eight police officers had been assassinated while protecting Black Lives Matter protests,” – referring to the police killings in Dallas and Baton Rouge over the summer. Canterbury sent a letter Tuesday to Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon, asking the company to remove the “offensive” shirts from the store. “I urge you to prohibit the use of the use of the Walmart name and website for the retail sale of these products,” the letter read. Time reported that the shirts were being sold through Walmart’s website by Old Glory Merchandise. “Like other online retailers, we have a marketplace with millions of items offered by third parties that includes Blue Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter merchandise. After hearing concerns from customers, we are removing the specific item with the ‘bulletproof’ reference,” Walmart said in a statement. Canterbury told The Guardian that the union would continue to pressure retailers who sell the Black Lives Matter merchandise until the group makes it clear that don’t approve of anti-police violence.

Here are my findings -- please RT to keep our children safe! 12/24, 9:45 AM: The Wal-Mart greeter wishes me a Happy Holidays, just as my sources had warned. I ask her which spethcific holidays she is talking about, then stare at her (Orangutan Mindmove) until I exit the Wal-Mart backwards, never breaking eye contact. 12/24, 11:10 AM: Stharbucks handths me a cup that doesn't have the phrase "Merry Christmas" on it 400 times like all coffee cups used to forever. Sthandard attack: accuse the barista of being a pedo (he probably is, has the look), tweet his photo, leave without paying for my half-caf skinny peppermint latte. Cuckmate! 12/24, 2pm: As all right-thinking thitizens know, the current vaccine schedule is poison. I attempt to explain this to Santa, who seems confused (Soros shill?) A mall security guard asks me to leave, even after I explain to him that he iths a cuck and I am friends with high ranking NSA officials who will ruin his life. What will it take to get through to these people? I am trying to be nice. 12/24, 3:45pm: The Bing Crosby song "Happy Holidays" comes on the radio. Thinking quickly, I crash my car into a nearby homeless shelter, dithsabling the radio immediately. "ONE DAY I WILL FIX THIS!" I shout. "ONE DAY I WILL QUANTUM LEAP TO 1942 AND MAKE IRVING BERLIN CALL THE STHUPID SONG MERRY CHRISTMAS, MOTHERFUCKERS!!" The homeless do not applaud as expected. Perhaps they are on the payroll of Carlos Slim himself. Time for Wendy's. 12/24, 5pm: I see him, clear as day: a pedophile. My sworn enemy. The slight smile, darting eyes, inability to differentiate between fantasy and reality. Time to bring this perv in...for justhice. 12/24, 5:01pm: False alarm: that was a mirror. This Wendy's bathroom safe...for now. 12/24, 7pm: I have heard many good things about this "Turboman" doll from sources in the 4chan and Twitter community. However, numerous toy sthore employees all tell me the same thing: this iths not a real doll. How could so many different employees from different sthores all be telling me the same thing? Conspiracy. Obvious conspiracy. The New York Times is feeding them talking points written by Lena Dunham herself. I will sthop at nothing to get my hands on this "Turboman" doll, as it will make the ultimate pedo bait, and also looks to be great fun. 12/25, 1am: My nightly eighteen hour patrol of various liberal university camputhses. Two young men sit on the steps of a campus dormitory, smoking cigarettes. They are not causing trouble, which is very suspicious, as a troublemaker would likely cause no trouble in order to deflect suspicion. I leap out my car's new sunroof and perform a combat roll, landing before them, screaming, "NO SAFE SPACE HERE, MOTHERFUCKERS!" They take off running -- doubly suspicious, as innocent men would have nothing to hide. Easily disable the first with a Twitterang, second heads for the ultimate palace of liberal lies: the library. Only sothlution: burn it to the ground, sethending all that sithence sthraight to Sathan himsethlf.

According to the Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff's Office, Kyandrea Thomas was arrested by New Roads Police Department shortly after noon on December 24. She is charged with attempted second degree murder. Thomas was also arrested in 2009 on a negligent homicide charge after leaving a young child in a hot car. Officials say they believe Thomas gave birth to the baby in the store and proceeded to throw the infant in the trash. She later checked herself into Lane Regional Medical Center, where she was later discharged and taken into custody immediately. According to NRPD, the infant may have been found by a Walmart employee. Chief Deputy Joe Gannon with the Pointe Coupee Parish Coroner's Office says the baby was approximately 4 to 6 hours old when found. The baby was unresponsive at first, but medical personnel were able to stabilize the baby at the hospital. Officials are temporarily calling the baby girl Olivia. The baby was initially taken to Pointe Coupee General Hospital for treatment and was then transferred to Our Lady of the Lake in Baton Rouge via Air Med flight. According to EMS, the baby is currently in stable condition. Related Topics: newstrashLouisiana Email share share tweet email (Copyright ©2017 KTRK-TV. All Rights Reserved.)

Travel Americas Woman gave birth inside supermarket bathroom and dumped baby in bin, say police Kristine Guerra Monday 26 December 2016 08:30 BST Click to follow The Independent Travel Officers were called to Golders Green Road around 8am Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Police in rural Louisiana say a Walmart employee found a baby girl in a bathroom a few hours after the infant’s mother gave birth to her and dumped her in a trash can. The infant was only about 4 hours old when an employee at a Walmart Supercenter in the city of New Roads in Pointe Coupee Parish found her just after 7 pm on Friday, Lt. Shael Stringer of the New Roads Police Department told The Washington Post. The mother, Kyandrea Thomas, a woman in her 30s, was found shortly after. Stringer said a Walmart employee saw Thomas in the bathroom at about 3 p.m. that day and noticed that she was bleeding heavily. Thomas told the employee that she was having some trouble with her menstrual cycle. At that point, police said, the employee gave Thomas some paper towels and waited outside the bathroom stall, not knowing that she was giving birth inside. Thomas wrapped the newborn girl, placed her in the trash can and left, police said. About 4½ hours later, another employee who was emptying the trash can noticed that it was relatively heavy, Stringer said. The employee placed the trash bag on the floor and found the infant, who was discolored and wasn’t breathing. The baby was revived at the scene and was taken to a hospital less than a mile away, Stringer said. The infant, who is now in stable condition, was later taken to a hospital in Baton Rouge. “Had it been just a little bit longer, the possibility of resuscitation probably wouldn’t have happened,” Stringer said. Investigators found Thomas, who was taken to another hospital in a nearby town Friday night because of complications from giving birth. Thomas was taken into custody after she was discharged from the hospital on Saturday afternoon. Stringer said she will be booked at East Baton Rouge Prison and will be charged with attempted second-degree murder.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   The police would like Amazon to stop selling this shirt posted at 10:01 am on December 27, 2016 by Jazz Shaw Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES So have you seen any of those “Bulletproof” t-shirts being sold in support of the Black Lives Matter movement? They’ve shown up at a number of rallies, marches and protests for quite a while now. In fact, going back to 2015 and the early days of the presidential campaign we were seeing them on activists protesting at speeches given by Bernie Sanders. (Click for full size image.) As you might imagine, the law enforcement officials who run into these displays generally aren’t big fans. It’s not the BLM portion of the message so much as the provocative use of “bulletproof” as a theme. And now the Fraternal Order of Police is letting Amazon know that they don’t want the shirts being sold on their site. (Fox News) The largest police union in the U.S. demanded that Amazon remove a shirt from a third-party vendor that supports the Black Lives Matter movement. The Fraternal Order of Police wants the online retailer to follow Walmart and remove a shirt that sports the words “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” across the chest, The Guardian reported Friday. Walmart removed the shirt from its store after the union called it “offensive.” FOP President Chuck Canterbury wrote in a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to support the union in “increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve.” The shirt is still being displayed at Amazon as of this writing, but it’s “unavailable.” I’m not sure if that means it’s just out of stock or shipments are on hold. You can’t separate this question from the issue of free speech. Shirts don’t qualify as incitement to violence under the Brandenburg Test, so the idea of an actual “ban” on them would be absurd. I personally find the shirts highly objectionable, but if I saw the government trying to criminalize their sale or display I’d be out there protesting alongside BLM. Of course, the free speech of everyone else counts as well, so if we want to criticize the shirts we’re free to do so. What’s going on with the FOP grazes up near a gray area between those two scenarios. The police themselves are public servants who are funded by the taxpayers. In that regard they are certainly part of “the government” so we don’t when them stepping all over the First Amendment. If it were the officials in charge of specific police units this would be entirely out of line, but this isn’t the government making the statement. This is the union representing many of the cops. It’s a civilian entity and they have no authority over the public. So from that perspective, they are free to express their own condemnation of the t-shirts I suppose. Personally, as with many other offensive slogans, I’d almost rather have the shirts out there on display in the public square. You might want to know who is or isn’t on the side of law and order and when the actors involved are willing to so clearly label themselves, well… let’s just leave this one in the free speech category, shall we?

The infant was roughly four hours old when an employee of Walmart in New Roads, Louisiana found her, Lieutenant Shael Stringer of the New Roads Police Department told the Washington Post. The lavatory attendant had been cleaning the toilets when it was noticed the bin was heavier than normal. When the cleaner peered inside, the baby was found discoloured and not breathing. She was resuscitated at the scene and taken to hospital less than a mile away, Stringer said. “Had it been just a little bit longer, the possibility of resuscitation probably wouldn’t have happened,” he added. It transpired that another Walmart employee spotted the baby’s mother, Kyandrea Thomas, in the bathroom hours earlier. The employee is said to have seen Thomas bleeding heavily in the bathroom, however Thomas claimed she was having trouble with her menstrual cycle. After dumping the baby in the rubbish bin, she was later found in another hospital after she had complications with the pregnancy. Thomas, 34, of Baker, was arrested on 24 December and now faces a second-degree murder charge. According to New Roads Police, Thomas gave a full confession of what she had done. Court records also revealed the mother was already a convicted felon for a negligent homicide in 2011. She was a children’s worker at the now defunct Wanda’s Kids World and was found responsible for the death of a three-year-old girl who died in 2009 after she was left in a van for more than six hours in scorching heat.

No suspects have been named. On the 600 block of Wickes Avenue, officers responded to a non-injury traffic accident between a Chevy pickup and a four-door red passenger car. Minor damage was caused. At Samuelson’s, officers responded to a report of a male party harassing a female Sameulson’s employee. The man was evidently trying to contact the woman by phone, in person, through relatives and at work over a period of time. He was contacted by officers and arrested for stalking, harassment and driving under the influence. At the Davis House apartment complex, officers conducted a welfare check on a female party. En route to the location, they saw a vehicle in which they believed she might be sitting. When the car was stopped, the female party was found inside and a male party was arrested for driving under the influence and driving with a revoked license. On the 400 block of Tucker Street, officers responded to a report of a verbal disturbance between a mother and an adult daughter. Friday, Dec. 23 At the Clarion Inn & Suites, officers responded to a report of a suspicious person. A white male party was shining a flashlight into vehicles in the parking lot. He ended up being a juvenile out past curfew and was issued a city summons for curfew violation. On the 2800 block of Pinon Circle, officers responded to a report of a suspicious incident. The reporting party said they could see tracks in the snow where someone went from mailbox to mailbox. Nothing was reported missing, but this type of behavior is not uncommon during the holiday season, an officer said. On the 800 block of Bridger Circle, officers responded to a report of fraud. An older female party received a call stating that her grandchild was in jail and she would need to provide four $1,000 Walmart gift cards for bail. The woman had already sent $4,000 in gift cards before contacting officers. Scammers often gather personal details on Facebook or online before targeting victims, an officer said. On the 700 block of Russell Street, officers responded to a report of child neglect. The report turned out to be unfounded because the supposed child in question was no longer technically a child. On the 500 block of West Victory Way, officers responded to a report of shoplifting from City Market. A 28-year-old male party was cited for attempting to steal a half-dozen red roses. On the 1500 block of West Victory Way, officers responded to a report of a burglary at a hair salon. Some cash and electronics were taken, and there were no signs of forced entry. On the 2000 block of West Victory Way, officers responded to a report of a hit and run crash. On the 700 block of East Seventh Street, officers responded to another report of fraud. Similarly, an older male party received a call claiming his grandson was in jail and he needed to send four $1,000 Walmart gift cards. He did submit some gift cards before contacting officers. On the 600 block of Legion Street, officers responded to a report of a verbal domestic disturbance. The situation was resolved verbally. Saturday, Dec. 24 On the 1900 block of Crockett Drive, officers responded to a report of fraud. A party called and offered to deposit a refund for a service into the reporting party’s account. The scammer then claimed to deposit too much money and asked for an account number in order to fix it. The person did not fall victim to the scam. On the 600 block of Wickes Avenue, officers responded to a report of domestic violence. No evidence of a crime was found, but officers issued a verbal warning. At mile post 88 on U.S. Highway 40, officers responded to a report of road rage. A pedestrian reported that she was almost hit by a truck. The vehicle was not contacted. Sunday, Dec. 25 At Ridgeview, officers responded to a report of a possible domestic disturbance. Officers found it was just a loud conversation between parties involving lots of alcohol. On the 400 block of Breeze Street, officers responded to a report of a possible utility hazard. An aluminum ladder had fallen against possible electrical wiring in someone’s backyard. Yampa Valley Electrical Association was called to look into the matter. At the Clarion Inn & Suites, officers responded to a report of theft of narcotic prescription medications from a purse near the front lobby. The incident is still under investigation. On the 300 block of East Sixth Street, officers responded to a single vehicle accident in which a vehicle struck a pole. A female party was arrested for driving under the influence. Monday, Dec. 26 At the Boys & Girls Club, officers responded to a report of possible child neglect. It turns out a grandparent had mistakenly dropped a child off when the club was closed. The grandparent was called to come pick the child up. On the 900 block of West First Street, officers responded to a report of a threat. A female party complained of a relative of her ex-husband verbally harassing her and requested a restraining order.

Closing hours will vary by location but generally will run from between 8-10 p.m. Stores will reopen for regular hours - 6 a.m. for non-24-hour stores - on Jan. 1. Walmart Super Centers, which are open 24-hours-a-day, will remain open. The chain's New Year's Eve hours are the same as last year's.

Police are looking for the female suspect, believed to be around 5′ 5″ tall and about 120 lbs, wearing all black, as she attempted to steal a shopping car stuffed with various items at the Richland Walmart around 5:25pm on Christmas Eve. Officials say she fled the store, and left in a BMW. It was described as an older model, tan or light gold, with a sun roof and the back rear passenger door is all black.  Obviously a replacement door, but should make this car very easy to spot.

By late Friday morning, 15 elementary school students were roaming the Walmart aisles, each with a city officer or volunteer at their side helping them pick out Christmas gifts during Shop with a Cop. Eight-year-old Amaya Linderman was one of those students. "I got some makeup, I got a cup for my mom and a necklace for her, and I got a sweater and a game for all of us, and I got my sissy a sweater," Amaya said, adding that her favorite gift was the makeup kit. The total cost of all the children's gifts came to about $3,000, Havre Police Chief Gabe Matosich said. Matosich, along with Sgt. Jesse Eller, whose wife, Laura Eller, has been the main coordinator for the event, credited several businesses for making the event happen. Among them, both men said, Walmart had donated about $2,000. Matosich said the Havre Police Protective Association another $1,000. Other contributors included McDonald's - that's where breakfast came from - Pizza Hut, which provided lunch, and Bear Paw Credit Union. There were even people who donated while the group of students, volunteers and officers made their way around the store, officers said. Matosich took 7-year-old Daltyn Schmidt shopping. By 1 p.m., everyone was back at City Hall, downstairs wrapping gifts in the Emergency Operation Center room. Daltyn showed off a Tyrannosaurus rex toy that growled and turned it's head, a truck pulling a boat toy, a battleship toy, a pair of boots, a purse and a necklace that he said he got for his mother. "It is a lot of fun because they're so excited," Matosich said. "They're just running and grabbing things. They wanna pick for their parents and brothers and sisters." Officer Jordan Chroninger had donned a Santa suit, but with a law enforcement twist - he was "tactical Santa." He had a black tactical vest on, and among the things attached to it being a flashlight, a taser, a walkie talkie and his badge. He was navigating the room, helping kids wrap gifts. "It's always a blast. It's for a good cause," Chroninger said. "It's good to have the kids to have a little more on Christmas." MOST POPULAR: Comments Viewed From the Courts, Oct. 1...

Authorities say the mother delivered the child inside the store's bathroom. (Bloomberg News by Luke Sharrett) (Luke Sharrett) Print Email Beau Evans, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Beau Evans, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author on December 26, 2016 at 6:40 PM, updated December 27, 2016 at 8:38 AM comments Police in New Roads, La., say a newborn baby found abandoned in a garbage can in a Wal-Mart bathroom Friday (Dec. 23) is doing better and has been taken off oxygen, WBRZ in Baton Rouge reported Monday evening. Firefighters had performed CPR on the baby girl after she was found in the trash Friday night, and had then rushed her to a hospital in critical condition. Authorities say the baby's mother, Kyandrea Thomas, 34, gave birth in the Wal-Mart bathroom to a baby girl, who was found unresponsive by a store employee Friday night an estimated six hours after her birth, WBRZ reported. Thomas was booked into East Baton Rouge Parish jail Saturday after she checked herself into a hospital in Zachary. Louisiana's Safe Haven law allows parents to leave children 60 days or younger at state-sanctioned "Safe Baby Sites," including hospitals, police stations, fire stations or child advocacy centers with no questions asked. As long as the baby shows no signs of abuse or neglect, the parents will not be prosecuted for abandonment. Read the full story from WBRZ here.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Firefighters delivered and decorated nine Christmas trees Wednesday evening in the pediatric ward of Comanche County Memorial Hospital. The trees were set up in the children’s rooms thanks to donations from Walmart. The kids also received gifts through the LFA’s “Christmas for Kids” program. Sgt. James Carrol of the fire department was glad for the opportunity to bring the holiday to kids who might have spent it in a bed. “The kids were super joyous, super surprised, and I really think that it cheered them up during a hard time,” he said, “and that's the reason why we're here.” More information on the fire department’s Christmas charities, and how to support them, can be found on their “Christmas Tree Giveaway for Kids” page on Facebook.

Happy New Year. Here they are — the most popular stories of 2016. They are, simply, the stories people read the most, based on page views. 10. Derby Man Dies In Route 8 Wreck As any Valley Indy Facebook follower knows, crashes on Route 8 are too common. This was a terrible story about a 53-year-old motorcycle rider who died in June. 9. Police Release Name Of Hit-And-Run Victim Teresa Glossy, 54, of Shelton, died in May after being struck by a car in Shelton. The driver of the car fled the scene. The mother of two had lived in Shelton for 10 years. 8. First Walmart, Now Adams To Close In Derby It was a horrific year for the Walmart shopping center off Route 34 in Derby. First, in March, Walmart announced the store would be closing in July. Then Adams, the supermarket next door, announced they were calling it a day, too. 7. Derby Police: $1.5 Million In Drugs Seized From Truck Derby police Dec. 21 seized 55 pounds of fentanyl from a truck cops pulled over on Route 34. That’s a lot of dope. VICE reported it was enough fentanyl to kill everyone in Connecticut twice. We didn’t check their math, but the fact so may Valley residents read this story underscores how many people are aware of our opioid problem. Heroin mixed with fentanyl is a national scourge, and the Valley’s no different. The dangerous combo killed a Derby man, and sent another to federal prison. The drug was at the center of a national kickback scheme with Derby connections. Meanwhile, Valley families have been struggling about how to help loved ones lost to addiction. 6. Rest In Peace, Mr. Tidmarsh The Valley lost a local leader, businessman, and all-around nice guy in January this year. Roy Tidmarsh’s passing also revealed how special he was to his customers, who used our Facebook page to share memories of buying candy and cake from his Westfield Avenue shop in Ansonia. Click the embedded image below to read the memories. Posted by Valley Independent Sentinel on Monday, January 25, 2016 5. Antonio’s Closes In Ansonia Doing business on Ansonia’s Main Street isn’t easy. A number of eateries have come and gone since the Valley Indy launched in 2009. But Antonio’s seemed to have found the recipe for success in downtown Ansonia that has eluded so many others — which was why it was so shocking when the place closed in February. The space was renovated and a new restaurant, Lulu Pazzo Italiano, was open by the end of the year. Here’s hoping Lulu can continue the Ansonia restaurant upswing started by Crave and continued by Copper City Bar and Grill, both on Main Street. 4. Ansonia Cheerleader’s Mom Dies On Way To Competition Just a tragic story. The Go Fund Me page was still active as of Dec. 26. 3. Suspect Arrested In Connection To Fatal Derby Overdose The suspect, Bradley Commerford (pictured above), is scheduled to get out of federal prison in 2021. 2. Deepest Condolences To The Butler Family Of Derby Former Derby Fire Department Chief James Butler passed away in February after he had responded to a call. He was just 50 years old. He left behind a legion of loving friends and family. 1. Heroin Suspected As Cause Of Two Deaths In Derby Four heroin overdoses in 24 hours — including two fatal ODs — prompted a dire warning from Derby police: a “bad batch” of heroin, that is, heroin even more dangerous than usual, was making the rounds in the lower Valley. The ingredient was later revealed as fentanyl. Share this story with others.

Canterbury said the moves from his department were necessary due to the  “amount of violence demonstrated at Black Lives Matter marches and the fact that eight police officers had been assassinated while protecting Black Lives Matter protests.” Related Stories ‘Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter’ Clothing Pulled Off Walmart Shelves Chicago Student Expelled After Racist Text Sues School Canterbury was referring to two incidents this summer in which mulitiple police officers were shot in Dallas, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Sgt. Demetrick Pennie, 38, of the Dallas Police Force who is also the president of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation, has sued Black Lives Matter over the Dallas incident. In a phone interview with the International Business Times, he called Black Lives Matter a “domestic hate group.” The pro-Black Lives Matter shirt was still available for purchase on Amazon as of Monday morning. But Walmart announced Tuesday it would stop selling the T-shits and hooded sweatshirts in its stores nationwide. An article published last week by the conservative Breitbart news website condemned Walmart for selling the pro Black Lives Matter merchandise after it had stopped selling products that displayed images of the Confederate flag in June 2015.  Roughly 40 percent of people across the United States said they supported the Black Lives Matter movement, while about 30 percent of those who were familiar with the group said they didn’t know its ultimate objectives, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted between Feb. 29 and May 8.

Police arrested scores of people in demonstrations overnight Saturday to Sunday in several US cities, as racial tensions simmer over the killing of black men by police. / AFP / DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS (Photo credit should read DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images) 99 Follow Share Tweet The Fraternal Order of Police, which is the largest police union in the United States, is demanding that online retailer Amazon remove Black Lives Matter merchandise from their website, specifically targeting a t-shirt that the organization deems to be offensive. The shirt is manufactured and sold by a third-party retailer, rather than by Amazon itself. According to the Guardian, the FOP wants Amazon to follow in the footsteps of Walmart and remove a shirt that says “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter” across the chest. Walmart removed the shirt last week. As of Monday morning, the shirt was still listed on Amazon.com, but was “unavailable” to purchase. FOP president Chuck Canterbury wrote a letter last week to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos asking him to support the FOP and their mission of “increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve.” But Caterbury told the Guardian that he wouldn’t be surprised if Amazon continued to list the shirt because they’re a “pretty liberal marketer.” The issue of selling the shirts matter, Caterbury added, because of the violence waged on police over the last two years stemming from anti-police rhetoric, much of which comes from people in the Black Lives Matter movement. “[The anti-police violence] happened as a result of the rhetoric of different BLM groups,” Caterbury told the Guardian. At the height of the rhetoric last summer, a man slaughtered five Dallas police officers, and injured nine others, while they were protecting Black Lives Matter protesters. That gunman was allegedly angered by police and white people. And in his letter to Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon last week, Canterbury alleged that retailers like Amazon and Walmart are profiting from racial division by selling the third-party merchandise. “Commercializing our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another,” Canterbury wrote. “Turning a buck on strained relationships will not contribute to the healing process.” “I wanted to let you know that my members are are very upset that you and Amazon are complicit in the sale of this offensive merchandise,” he added in the letter. According to CNN, the t-shirts were being sold through a New England-based company, Old Glory Merchandise. The owner of that company, Glenn Morelli, told CNN that although he hadn’t yet been contacted by Canterbury, he already decided to stop selling the shirt because it was a poor seller. “It wasn’t a big seller at all. The Blue Lives Matter sells more than the Black Lives Matter or bulletproof shirts combined,” Morelli said. “We don’t like to offend anybody.” Canterbury says he will continue pressuring companies like Walmart and Amazon to stop selling Black Lives Matter merchandise until the movement definitively says they don’t support violence against police.

Congressional Republicans, overseen by Speaker Paul Ryan and led by House Ways and Means Committee chair Kevin Brady, are planning a major overhaul of corporate taxes, as unveiled in their “A Better Way” plan from June. Naturally, that overhaul includes a big cut in the tax rate, from 35 percent to 20 percent. But it also includes some huge changes in the way the corporate tax works, apart from its overall level. They want to push companies away from financing projects with debt, by making it impossible for them to deduct interest payments on loans. They want to add breaks for companies making big capital investments (like buying equipment or building factories), making those totally deductible in the year they’re made rather than “depreciable” over time. But perhaps most dramatically of all, they want to allow companies to totally exclude revenue from exports when calculating their tax burden, and to ban them from deducting the cost of imports they purchase. The plan is a very clever way to address the political goals of both House Republicans and Donald Trump. The president-elect has made it clear he wants a populist trade policy that’s tough on imports and backs exporters. And while its actual effects on trade are milder than you might expect, the House GOP border adjustment plan offers Trump something that sounds like a populist trade policy without resorting to actual tariffs. Meanwhile, House Republicans have wanted a major corporate tax cut for years, and border adjustment, by increasing taxes on imports, raises lots of revenue and makes it easier to afford a huge rate cut. But that doesn’t mean the policy is a sure thing. It’s already made some major corporate players — including retailers, who depend heavily on imports, as well as Koch Industries — into skeptics of Republican tax reform efforts, earning the GOP some powerful enemies as it begins its first major effort to remake the tax code in fourteen years. How border adjustment works© Provided by Vox.com Boeing Posts 56 Million Quarterly Loss, And Its Cutting 10,000 Jobs To see how big a change this would be, it helps to imagine two US-based companies. One of them makes most of its money from exporting US-products abroad and one the makes most of its money from importing products and then selling them to US consumers. Let’s call them ExpCo and ImpCo. (Thanks to Kyle Pomerleau at the Tax Foundation for this example, which I’ve borrowed with some alterations). Suppose, for ease of illustration, that ExpCo and ImpCo each earn $1,000 a year in revenue from selling their products. ExpCo spends $800 a year buying component parts for its products, meaning it makes a $200 profit. ImpCo spends $800 a year buying imported products from abroad, so it also makes a $200 profit. The way the corporate tax works now, those profits would (all else being equal) be treated the same: each would be subject to a 35 percent tax rate, so both companies would pay $70 a year in taxes, and have $130 in after-tax income. But border adjustment changes the math dramatically. ExpCo makes all of its revenue from exporting its products, but because that revenue would be exempt, its taxable revenue would be $0, and its taxable income would fall to -$800. Under the new 20 percent tax rate, it’d get a rebate of $160 from the government. The Republican plan gives ExpCo a tax cut of $230. ImpCo, by contrast, would still be accountable for all its revenue, but also would not be allowed to deduct the $800 it spends on imported goods. Its taxable profit would spike to $1,000, and even with the lower tax rate, it’d face a bill of $200, eating up all its profits. Why economists and retailers disagree on the change’s impact© Provided by Vox.com Wal-Mart Prepares For Black Friday Shopping Rush ImpCo and ExpCo are fictional, but their predicaments loosely fit those of a lot of real companies. Boeing, for instance, makes a large share of its revenue from selling planes abroad. It would benefit, just like ExpCo would. Walmart, by contrast, imports an enormous share of the products it sells to American consumers. Not being able to deduct imported goods would dramatically change its tax situation. That’s why retailers are revolting against the idea of border adjustment. As David French, the head lobbyist at the National Retail Federation, told Politico, “Our members have told us that the import tax could be as high as five times their profits. I don't know how viable some retailers would be in the face of this import tax." Barney Jopson of the Financial Times reported, “Senior lobbyists who sometimes struggle to get the attention of company leaders told the Financial Times they were receiving calls from chief executives with orders to fight the tax plan, which some importers say threatens to wipe out their profits.” Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and Walgreens have all been meeting with Ways and Means chair Brady’s office about the issue, according to Bloomberg BNA reporters Aaron Lorenzo and Kaustuv Basu. Koch Industries — the second largest private company in America, and the source of the fortunes of the politically influential Koch brothers — has come out against border adjustment as well, saying it would “adversely impact American consumers by forcing them to pay higher prices on products produced in and goods imported to the U.S. that they use every single day.” The company claimed in a statement that it, individually, would “greatly benefit” from the tax change, because it produces so much domestically, but was opposing it for its wider economic ramifications. But most economists think the impact on retail is greatly exaggerated. That’s because they expect that currency markets would adjust in reaction to the change. The new tax on imports would reduce demand for imports from US consumers. When they buy imports, consumers provide foreigners with dollars; doing less of that means fewer dollars being exchanged, and a lower supply of dollars means that the value of the dollar, relative to other currencies, will increase. The tax change also subsidizes exporters. That means that US exporters will be able to drop their prices to better compete internationally, increasing demand for exports. That means foreigners buying US exports will need more dollars, which increases demand for dollars and increases the value of the dollar still further. According to textbook economic theory, this increase in the value of the dollar should totally offset the effects of the import tax and export subsidies, leaving the trade balance where it was previously. Think back to ImpCo. If the dollar appreciates by 25 percent and other currencies fall by 20 percent in response to the 20 percent import tax, then the cost of its imported goods would fall from $800 to $640. It would still have to pay $200 in taxes, but it would gain $160 in after-tax profit thanks to the exchange rate adjustment. Thanks to the lower corporate tax rate, that’s higher than the $130 in after-tax profit it got before. Despite the border adjustment, it’s slightly better off than it was before the tax change. Conversely, ExpCo would see its revenues from exports fall from $1,000 to $800 due to the increased cost of buying stuff in dollars. That wipes out its pre-tax profit entirely — but thanks to the rebate border adjustment provides, its after-tax profit would go up to $160. That’s identical to ImpCo’s after-tax profit following the changes. Just as before the shift, ExpCo and ImpCo are left exactly as well off as each other. Of course, the real world is more complicated than the simplest textbook model, and the currency adjustment process might not always be smooth. But even a more nuanced analysis reaches similar conclusions. “Under more realistic assumptions, a border adjustment could have some economic effects, but those effects would still not include a permanent increase in exports or a permanent reduction in imports,” AEI’s Alan Viard, an economist focused on tax issues, wrote in 2009. Other reasons to like border adjustment The idea of border adjustment has surprisingly bipartisan appeal. Congressional Republicans are pitching it as a way of living up to Donald Trump’s trade agenda, which looks to reduce the trade deficit and boost exporters. If the economists’ consensus view is correct, this is misguided; border adjustment won’t change the balance of trade one way or another. But if the retailers and others worried about the change are right, it would have a real effect, and regardless of its actual effects it’s a rhetorical way to “get tough” on trade. But some Democratic-leaning tax experts have expressed enthusiasm for the idea in the past because of its potential to deter tax evasion. Alan Auerbach, an economist at UC Berkeley, worked out a detailed proposal for a border-adjusted corporate tax back in 2010 in a paper for the Center for American Progress and the Hamilton Project, two institutions with links to the Obama administration and the Democratic Party establishment more broadly. The center-left Century Foundation issued a report from University of Michigan law professor Reuven Avi-Yonah in November calling for a similar system. The issue is that the corporate tax, in its current form, taxes companies on both profits they earn at home and those they earn abroad — but taxes on the latter are deferred until the money’s brought home. That provides a big incentive to try to shift profits from sales in the US overseas to evade US taxes. Clever companies can even shift profits around further to avoid taxes in foreign countries, as in the case of the infamous “Double Dutch Irish Sandwich” move that Apple and other companies have used for years (and which Ireland is finally cracking down on). These kinds of shenanigans would be much harder with border adjustment, because it makes the tax about where goods and services are bought, not where their profits go. “With a destination-based tax, this incentive disappears because the very transactions that make profit shifting possible are ignored,” Pomerleau and Stephen Entin at the Tax Foundation explain. “For example, if a business understates profits in the US by understating the cost of widgets it sells to a subsidiary in France, it wouldn’t matter because that transaction would be ignored because it is an export. Likewise, if a foreign subsidiary overstates the cost of lumber it imports to the United States, it, again, doesn’t matter because that cost is not deductible against the corporate tax base.” Border adjustment might violate international law In conjunction with the immediate deductibility of capital investments, border adjustment would move the corporate tax to being much closer to a consumption tax. Its tax base is all goods bought and consumed in the US — whether they’re imports or produced domestically — and goods sold abroad are excluded. Indeed, the only difference between a corporate tax with border adjustment and investment deductibility and a value-added tax (VAT) is that in the latter, corporate spending on wages and other worker compensation isn’t deductible. So why don’t Republicans just propose a VAT? Well, some have. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul both ran on VAT plans that they refused to refer to as VATs during the 2016 primaries. But they were attacked for that by rivals, with Marco Rubio pointing out that European social democracies like VATs too. Perhaps an even more potent political downside is that everyone knows VATs are sales taxes and fall disproportionately on the poor — especially on people whose consumptions outstrips their income (middle-class retirees spending down their savings, for example). No Republican wants to run on telling right-leaning seniors that their pensions and Social Security are now going to be worth a lot less due to a new sales tax. The effects of the not-quite-a-VAT that Brady and other House Republicans are proposing will probably be quite similar, but it’s just different enough to defuse some of the political obstacles that come with straight-up proposing a VAT. On the other hand, a VAT would be the sounder course legally speaking. Under World Trade Organization rules, VATs are allowed to be border-adjusted but income taxes are not — this is supposed to prevent using the tax code to covertly funnel trade-distorting subsidies. In economics terms, there’s little reason to believe the Brady plan and a border-adjusted VAT would impact trade differently. There’s nothing magical about VATs not deducting wages that changes the trade balance. Indeed, some like Michigan’s Avi-Yonah have argued that the Brady plan is a VAT for WTO purposes despite the wage deduction. But the prospect of possible WTO sanctions could make it harder for wavering House and Senate members to support a border adjustment plan all the same.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Fallon Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit List of all the best Black Friday deals With less than five weeks to go, it's starting to feel a lot like Christmas. The retail frenzy known as Black Friday in the United States has marked the start of the lead-up to the crucial Christmas season for retailers across the globe. While the shopping day is in the US and comes after Thanksgiving, the advent of online retailing has spread its influence worldwide. That means Australian shoppers won't miss out on the bargains. The earliest evidence of the phrase Black Friday applied to the day after Thanksgiving in a shopping context suggests that the term originated in Philadelphia, where it was used to describe the heavy and disruptive pedestrian and vehicle traffic that would occur on the day after Thanksgiving. This usage dates to at least 1961. More than 20 years later, as the phrase became more widespread, a popular explanation became that it represented the point in the year when retailers begin to turn a profit, thus going from being "in the red" to being "in the black". Some Australian retailers will be hoping the same occurs here. However, there seems to be a rise in discounting in the past month as retailers try to shift stock, even before they head into the post-Christmas discounting. According to Colliers International, department stores have not been faring so well, just managing to scrape into positive territory at 0.17 per cent year on year in September after two consecutive months of declines. This is despite the department store owners spending a lot of time and money on new formats and strategies to capture the elusive customer dollar. That is reflected in the new Myer store at Scentre Group and AMP Capital's newly revamped Warringah Mall, in Sydney. The interior design and architectural concept was by Woods Bagot, with store "designed around the customer, for the customer". It is 14,000 square metres with 170 brands, 60 new to Myer Warringah and more than 67 "shop in shop" brand destinations. Myer chief executive Richard Umbers said at the recent opening that: "With Christmas just around the corner, we've packed Myer Warringah with hundreds of wanted brands and fabulous gift ideas backed up by a highly trained local team, which has been specially recruited to bring personalised service to a new level". Daniel Lees, a director of research at Colliers International, said one reason for the recent softness in department store sales was that the discount department stores were grouped within this category, with both Big W and Target announcing negative sales growth in the most recent quarterly market updates. "Australia's discount department stores have been grappling with turnaround strategies for several years now, with the only real winner being Kmart in what could be considered a zero-sum game," he said. "Turnaround strategies seem to vary little between operators; optimising back-end costs, selling down old inventory, reducing the overall number of stock keeping units (SKUs), concentrating efforts on the apparel sector while simultaneously shifting away from bulkier household items." He said that unfortunately, low-cost, high-turnover fast fashion was precisely what most of the new overseas entrants excelled at, placing these strategies in an immediate position of weakness. Mr Lees said conditions appeared to be a little brighter for apparel retailers, with the clothing and footwear category growing at a fairly healthy rate of 5.73 per cent year on year in the September release. One boost for retailers is that economic drivers remain broadly favourable for the Australian consumer. He said discretionary spending continued to be supported by food price deflation in supermarkets together with subdued fuel prices.

By Tareq Haddad December 26, 2016 12:42 GMT Kyandrea Thomas faces a second-degree murder charge after her baby was dumped in Walmart toiletNew Roads Police Department A baby girl found dumped in a rubbish bin in a supermarket toilet hours after her mother gave birth to her has somehow survived, police have said. The infant was roughly four hours old when an employee of Walmart in New Roads, Louisiana found her, Lieutenant Shael Stringer of the New Roads Police Department told the Washington Post. The lavatory attendant had been cleaning the toilets when it was noticed the bin was heavier than normal. When the cleaner peered inside, the baby was found discoloured and not breathing. She was resuscitated at the scene and taken to hospital less than a mile away, Stringer said. "Had it been just a little bit longer, the possibility of resuscitation probably wouldn't have happened," he added. It transpired that another Walmart employee spotted the baby's mother, Kyandrea Thomas, in the bathroom hours earlier. The employee is said to have seen Thomas bleeding heavily in the bathroom, however Thomas claimed she was having trouble with her menstrual cycle. After dumping the baby in the rubbish bin, she was later found in another hospital after she had complications with the pregnancy. Thomas, 34, of Baker, was arrested on 24 December and now faces a second-degree murder charge. According to New Roads Police, Thomas gave a full confession of what she had done. Court records also revealed the mother was already a convicted felon for a negligent homicide in 2011. She was a children's worker at the now defunct Wanda's Kids World and was found responsible for the death of a three-year-old girl who died in 2009 after she was left in a van for more than six hours in scorching heat. Thomas was put on probation for five years, fined $5,000 (£3,400) and ordered to serve 10,000 hours of community service, according to Baton Rouge's The Advocate.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — Holiday shopping procrastinators can breathe easy. Yes, most online shipping deadlines have passed. But many retailers are offering other ways to get gifts at the last minute, whether it’s staying open through the wee hours of the night like Toys R Us, or offering Christmas Eve store pickup like Wal-Mart. RELATED CONTENT: Scroll through The Blade’s Gift Guides for holiday ideas Here are some options for those still scrambling to buy presents: MIDNIGHT RUNS Many stores are extending their hours in the days leading up to Christmas. Toys R Us will stay open from 6 a.m. on Dec. 23 straight to 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve, while department store Kohl’s are staying open now until Christmas Eve. Certain Macy’s department stores will be open all night between Dec. 22 and Dec. 23. Sears will close at midnight through Dec. 23 and close at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve. And Target will be open from 7 a.m. to midnight through Dec. 23 and stay open until at least 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve. SHOP THE UNEXPECTED If you can’t make it to the mall, a quick stop at a drug or specialty store might work. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are increasingly stocking their shelves with more toys for the little ones. And those three drugstores also have a big selection of plastic gift cards for use at other stores, such as video game retailer GameStop or bookseller Barnes & Noble. Meanwhile, office supplies store Staples sells flying drones and adult coloring books. And Dick’s Sporting Goods has Apple Watches, headphones and GoPro cameras. STORE PICKUP If you want to avoid searching for items in the store, you’re in luck. Many retailers let you buy items online and pick them up at a store the same day. After ordering and paying online, walk to a special section of the store with the confirmation email and ID and that’s it. Macy’s, Target and Best Buy are just some of the stores that offer store pickup. Wal-Mart says customers who order items before 6 p.m. on Dec. 23 can pick them up on Christmas Eve and even launched a website with the items that qualify at walmart.com/lastminutegifts. And at Sears.com, those who opt for store pickup between now and Christmas Eve can get 20 percent off clothing, jewelry and home goods if they type in a special promo code. SEND AN E-GIFT The websites of some major stores are offering a way to give an instant gift, called an e-gift. It’s similar to a gift card, but is supposed to be a little more personal: You choose the item you want to buy — say sneakers or a sweater — click the “E-Gift” or “GiftNow” button, pay, and then the recipient gets an email telling them you bought them a gift. The gift receiver accepts it and can make adjustments, such as changing the color or size, before it ships. Or they can just get something else entirely from the store. The service carries no extra charges to the gift giver or receiver, and is available on several websites, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren. SAME-DAY DELIVERY It will cost you more, but if you’re desperate, you can get some items delivered the same day you order them online. Macy’s offers same-day delivery in some cities and so does Nordstrom. But be aware, some may not deliver on Christmas Eve, like Nordstrom. If you’re an Amazon.com Prime member paying the annual fee, the online retailer is lets shoppers in Miami, New York and other cities order toys, electronics and other gifts as late as 9:45 p.m. on Christmas Eve for delivery in two hours, meaning you’ll get it before midnight. OR JUST WAIT Procrastination may work in your favor if you end up not seeing a person you’re shopping for until after Christmas. That’s when after-holiday sales kick in, says Sara Skirboll, a shopping and trends expert at shopping deal app RetailMeNot. If the timing works, you’ll likely pay less for a gift than you would if you had bought it before the holidays, says Skirboll.

According to research from Optoro, a company that helps process returns from retailers, nearly $70 billion worth of holiday purchases are returned each year — that’s more than 11 percent of the estimated $630 billion spent in total during the holidays. Returning a gift doesn’t mean you’re ungrateful; some gifts simply aren’t useful in your life. Rather than letting these gifts gather dust in a closet, consider turning them into something useful, such as cash. If you received items that were misses this year, take a look at these five ways to make money off your unwanted holiday gifts. Pressmaster / Shutterstock.com 1. Return Them If you have an unwanted holiday gift, the first thing to do is see if you can return it. “If you are looking to get the most money back possible for unwanted gifts, your best bet is to return them,” said Paul Moyer from SavingFreak.com. “Places like Walmart, Target, Kohl’s and other [stores] will allow you to return items in exchange for a gift card.” And if you don’t think you’ll use a gift card to the store, you can turn around and sell it for actual cash. Moyer said, “If you received a gift card to a store that you do not use, you can get as much as 92 percent of the card’s value using gift card selling services, like Cardpool.” Even if you don’t have a gift receipt, there might still be a way to turn an unwanted present into cash. Many retailers can use a packing slip in lieu of a gift receipt — Walmart will even use the sender’s email address to issue a store credit for an unwanted gift in some cases. Additionally, Amazon can take back unwanted gifts through its Online Returns Center, and Bed Bath & Beyond will take back items without receipts and issue exchanges or gift cards for the item’s current selling price, minus 20 percent.

Trade Them If you love to bargain, then trading your unwanted holiday gifts is a great way to satisfy your inner bargain hunter while scoring stuff you actually want. You’ll have better success if you stick to bartering sites that specialize in specific items, so avoid the ones that say they trade everything. Here are some of the best sites for different gift types: Game Trading Zone specializes in trading video games and gaming accessories. Users deal directly with one another, and there are no fees to buy, sell or trade items. PaperBackSwap is perfect for trading away those novels you don’t plan on reading. The site uses a credit system, so you don’t actually sell anything. You simply list your unwanted books and use the credits you receive to get new ones. Another option is Swap.com. A repository for a wide range of items, the site boasts a wide array of children’s items, including toys and clothes. You can trade all the gifts your kids got for the holidays and don’t intend to use for things they actually need and want. I AM NIKOM / Shutterstock.com 3. Sell Them If you are set on turning unwanted Christmas gifts into cash in your pocket, consider selling items online. You probably won’t make back the original value — after all, second-hand buyers are looking for deals too. However, this method offers a way to beef up your bank account rather than just trading goods for others. Here are some popular online sales sites where you can find eager buyers: With more than 60 million monthly users in the U.S. alone, Craigslist is one of the most popular sites for selling your unwanted stuff. It’s generally free to list your items, but sellers have to deal with meeting buyers face to face to exchange money for goods. Poshmark is used exclusively for clothing and accessories. Simply download the free app, and you can be on your way to making money off your unwanted fashion items. Shipping is paid by the buyer, but sellers do have to pay fees ranging from a flat $2.95 to 20 percent of the total sale. See More: How to Sell Used Clothes Online With Sites Like Poshmark Also known as “the world’s online marketplace,” eBay boasts a huge network of users. As a result, you have a better chance of finding buyers for more unusual items than you would on other sites. However, because of the wide array of products on eBay, it’s also easy for your item to get lost in the crowd. Additionally, you’ll have to pay a seller’s fee, which is based on the total amount of the sale. A mobile-only app, OfferUp is a hybrid of Craigslist and eBay with a local twist. Buyers search for items near them, and all communication is kept within the app, so you don’t have to give out your personal contact info. However, you still have to meet with the seller in person to exchange goods and money. Letgo is similar to OfferUp, but users join local selling groups. Items for sale are posted in the app, users can message one another and there are no seller fees, as transactions happen face to face. SpeedKingz / Shutterstock.com 4. Donate Them If you don’t want to deal with the hassle of trading or selling your unwanted holiday gifts, you can donate them for a tax break. It’s important to note that a nonprofit has to be approved by the IRS for donations to be tax deductible. However, most religious and educational organizations qualify, as do many volunteer groups, thrift stores and animal rescues. If you decide to donate your items, make sure you make a list of exactly what you gave, the dates they were donated and the organizations that accepted them. Also, you can only write off the “fair market value” of the items, which will probably be less than the price of the unwanted gift. Still, this is an easy way to turn your unwanted gifts into tax savings, while helping a worthy cause. alicjane / Shutterstock.com 5. Regift Them Regifting doesn’t mean you aren’t grateful for a present — it just means the item might serve someone else better. Not only is regifting a great way to get rid of unwanted clutter, but it can also save you money. Because you don’t have to fork over cash to buy a new gift, you can keep more of your paycheck in your pocket. Here are some tips for regifting successfully: Keep it on the down low. Just like with “Fight Club,” the first rule of regifting is that you never talk about regifting. Not everyone appreciates the act of giving away unwanted gifts, so it’s best to keep it to yourself. Always regift with intention. Don’t give away something just to get it out of your house. The regift should always make sense for the person on the receiving end. Keep track of where the gift originally came from. Place a sticky note on the unwanted item with the name of the person who gave it to you. The last thing you want to do is accidentally give a gift back to the original buyer. Carefully inspect the package and then rewrap it. Make sure any nametags and other identifying information are removed from the item. Then rewrap the gift, so it doesn’t look like it’s been sitting in your closet for months. Regift outside your circle of family and friends. You know that coffee table book your Aunt Lynn gave you for your birthday last year? It would be pretty embarrassing if she saw it in your sister’s living room. For best results, make sure there is no way your regift can cross paths with its originator.

The color is, well, challenging. “Ernest Goes to Camp?” Are you serious? So the gift isn’t a good fit. It happens. But now, the hard part: How does one return a gift that was purchased online? Don’t be scared, it’s not so hard. Jay Prag, an online commerce expert and a professor of economics and finance at the Drucker School of Management at Claremont Graduate University, said online retailers, particularly for clothing, have generous return policies. “That’s largely because they’re competing with brick-and-mortar retailers,” he said. “(Brick-and-mortar stores) give you the opportunity to try things on, so the clothing and apparel online companies really weren’t going to succeed if they didn’t give you a really generous return policy,” Prag said. Here’s your handy guide to online returns: Get Started Step one: Google it. Major online retailers, like Amazon and Walmart, each have different ways of enabling online purchase returns and their policies and instructions can be found on their websites, made easier with a quick Google search. Watch for fees Michelle Madhok, online shopping expert and founder of deals site shefinds.com, said the main thing for people interested in returning an item to be aware of is additional cost. “You’re going to have to pay for the shipping if you send it back” Madhok said. “That will cost you about $10. If it’s a big item, it’s even more difficult.” The big retailers: Amazon.com Holiday policy: Items shipped by Amazon.com between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 this year may be returned until Jan. 31, 2017, for a full refund, subject to return guidelines. Items shipped from third-party sellers on Amazon.com are subject to this same holiday return policy unless otherwise indicated in the seller’s individual return policy. Gifts: Amazon’s Online Returns Center allows gift recipients to return items even if the order wasn’t marked as a gift when it was purchased. Recipients may receive a refund or credit depending on how the gift was purchased and how it’s returned. Gift recipients won’t be eligible for exchanges or instant refunds. For Amazon gift recipients to make a return, they must have an existing Amazon account or create one, according to an video showing customers how to process a gift return. Users must navigate online to amazon.com/returns and log on to their account. Note the number: Users must enter the 17-digit number of the order they want returned, located on the left side of the packing slip that came with the package. Print the label: Once the user selects a preferred method, they’re advised to print a return authorization document, placed inside the package, and a return label for the shipping box. Amazon processes the refund as an Amazon.com gift card after the return is received, which will be added to the recipient’s account. Advertisement Payback: If the gift giver processes the return, the item is refunded to the original payment method, according to the step-by-step video. Walmart.com The policy: Items can be returned, exchanged or replaced, if the item is in stock, at any Walmart store, or returned by mail within 90 days of receiving the package, according to the retailer. The company is currently unable to exchange or provide refunds for your gift via mail. Walmart advises gift recipients, or gift givers, to bring the item to the customer service desk at their local Walmart with all original packaging materials and accessories. The returning party will be given credit or an identical item, if it’s in stock. Large items Note that for large items like bed mattresses, TVs and refrigerators, shipping companies like UPS and FedEx list their policies online, which vary. With FedEx Ground services, customers can ship packages up to 150 pounds; up to 108 inches in length, and 165 inches in length plus girth. With FedEx Home Delivery services, you can ship packages up to 70 pounds; up to 108 inches in length and 165 inches in length plus girth. With UPS there are no limits to the total weight of a shipment or the total number of packages in a shipment. Shipments larger than 150 pounds and 1,265 inches in length require the use of UPS Freight services, according to the company. Competition Online shopping expert Amanda Ishak, a professor of business strategy at UC Riverside, said brick-and-mortar retailers are becoming more competitive with Amazon.com by bolstering their online presence. “Brick and mortar is offering more items through their online catalogue than they do in stores,” Ishak said. “Their online inventory is much bigger. You can buy online and you can return to the store, They’re finding different ways to make it a seamless transition to the consumer.” Madhok said recipients and purchasers can avoid shipping charges if there’s a brick and mortar location to return an online item from participating retailers, like the aforementioned Walmart.

Macy’s Macy’s return policy is as follows: If you have the original receipt you can return an item at ANY TIME for a full refund in the original form of payment- doesn’t matter how long ago you purchased it. If you don’t have the receipt they can try and find your purchase info by accessing your account, gift registry, or by using a customer return label.

Canada is home to the multi-billion dollar toy company behind Hatchimals 'Hatchimal-gate': Must-have toy sparks online hate and hurt feelings at Christmas 5 toys that wreaked havoc long before Hatchimals Some children have been left disappointed — and their parents frustrated — after their Hatchimals failed to hatch. The Facebook page of Spin Master, the Canadian company that makes the much-sought-after toy, has been deluged with conflicting reports from parents around the world in the days following Christmas.  Some parents complained that their children's Hatchimals couldn't be coaxed out of their shells, while others said the birdlike toys worked as intended, popping out of their eggs after encouragement from their human owners. 'It turned on briefly — and then nothing' Jessica Perkins spent Thanksgiving night waiting in line at her local Walmart in Springfield, Mo., to get a Hatchimal for her five-year-old daughter. "I was so excited when I got it, because I knew they were so hard to come by," said Perkins. On Christmas morning, her daughter was "over the moon" after unwrapping her Hatchimal. "We took it out of the packaging, and my husband popped the pins out of the bottom and it turned on briefly — and then nothing," said Perkins. High online prices for Hatchimals anger desperate parents Hatchimals: Blockbuster toy a Canadian innovation Her daughter was "just devastated." "She's hoping that if she cares for it, it will wake up," Perkins said. "She's carrying it around in her little baby-doll carrier with a little blanket over it." In the meantime, Perkins said she managed to get through to Spin Master customer service after waiting on hold for an hour-and-a-half. She was assigned a case number and a customer service representative asked her to write the number on the Hatchimal's belly and send them a picture. A replacement would be sent within three to four weeks, Perkins was told. Spin Master is assigning case numbers to owners of broken Hatchimal toys, and asking for pictures of the toy with the number written on its belly. (Provided/Jessica Perkins) She said she later received a confirmation email with a different case number. Now she's not sure if the replacement is on the way. "It's really frustrating. I just want to ensure that this toy is coming," said Perkins. 'It just sits there' Robert Milk, of Queen Creek, Ariz., bought two Hatchimals for his two grandsons this Christmas. "One of them worked perfectly" and hatched after about 40 minutes, said Milk, but the other was a dud. "It was like an egg," said Milk. "Just like if you take an egg out of the refrigerator — it just sits there." Like Perkins, Milk said he hasn't had much luck getting help from Spin Master. "I've been calling every few minutes for the last day-and-a-half and have been unable to get through," he said. Valerie Wright of Milton, Ont., has had similar frustrations with the Hatchimal she bought for her seven-year-old daughter. "We followed all the instructions and watched YouTube videos" on how to properly activate the toy, said Wright, but to no avail. Wright said her local toy store wouldn't allow her to return the Hatchimal, saying she would have to deal with Spin Master directly. Her attempts to get through to the company's customer service haven't yet been successful. "I was on hold for well over an hour and then the phone just went dead," said Wright. Spin Master responds In a statement provided to CBC News, Spin Master's vice-president of global marketing communications, Tara Tucker, said the company is trying to help customers with their toys. "While the vast majority of people have had wonderful experiences with their Hatchimals, we have also heard from consumers who have experienced challenges with the hatching process," said Tucker. "Although the call volumes are higher due to the holidays, we are working with each individual to review and troubleshoot, which has helped a great many to resolve their issues." Hatchimals are supposed to peck their way out of their shells after being rubbed by their human owners. (Provided/Spin Master) Tucker told CBC that Hatchimals have received an unusual amount of attention for a toy. "The number of toys that have reached this level of a phenomenon can be counted on one hand," said Tucker. "The number of problems is really extremely low, given the mass volume." Still, Tucker said she didn't want to dismiss any difficulties that Hatchimal owners may be having. "If someone has a negative experience, we want to make it right." Spin Master is referring customers to a YouTube video offering hints on how to hatch a Hatchimal. 'They've been extremely helpful' ​Denise Dodson, who lives near Akron, Ohio, started a Facebook group for parents struggling with faulty Hatchimals called "Dead Hatchimal Owners United!" The group had just over 1,000 members as of Tuesday afternoon. How the Hatchimals' toy craze inspired so much online hate Even though her six-year-old daughter was "pretty upset" about her broken Hatchimal, Dodson expressed some sympathy for Spin Master's customer service quandary. "From what I have seen, they've been extremely helpful in helping people and being willing to replace them for people, but it's going to take a month for people to get them," said Dodson. "I think that they're not big enough to handle what they've done."

The holiday shopping season is losing some of its power in the year’s sales. November and December now account for less than 21 percent of annual retail sales at physical stores, down from a peak of over 25 percent. The shift is in part because people are spreading out their shopping all year, demanding big discounts and spending more on events rather than more stuff. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) NEW YORK — The holiday shopping season is losing some of its power in the year’s sales. November and December now account for less than 21 percent of annual retail sales at physical stores, down from a peak of over 25 percent, and experts believe it’ll keep dropping. Those extra percentage points would have translated into an extra $70 billion more in buying for last year, says Michael Niemira, principal at The Retail Economist. The season had steadily gained in importance and peaked in the early ’80s, before the dominance of big discounters like Wal-Mart stalled its growth as shoppers began moving away from department stores. Still, the two-month period held its own through the mid-’90s, when online shopping for deals took hold. “There was a mindset even before online shopping,” said Niemira, whose data goes back to 1967. “But this just accelerated it.” In general, many people are shopping for the holidays all year long now, mirroring the trend for back-to-school items. Heavy discounting has diluted sales, and with big promotions throughout the year, shoppers no longer hold off making their biggest purchases until the holidays. “It’s no longer a seasonal business,” said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at consumer research firm NPD Group Inc. “It’s a yearlong investment for the consumer. And retailers need to change. They have to excite shoppers early in the season and later in the season — and all year long.” Here’s what’s behind the shift: SHOPPERS DON’T WAIT TO BUY BIG-TICKET ITEMS: Stores now offer good deals throughout the year on products like TVs and appliances, making waiting until the end of the year less appealing. Deloitte LLP found 30 percent of shoppers planned to wait for holiday sales to buy large gifts, down from 35 percent a year ago. “People are not holding back and waiting because they find a good price for all the things they are looking for,” said Rod Sides, vice chairman of Deloitte. Christopher Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which looks at imports, says he has seen a smoothing out of imports during the pre-holiday shopping season from July to November on key items like apparel, toys and furniture. The shift complicates matters for retailers, which could usually concentrate their efforts on capturing shoppers during the holiday window. HEAVY DISCOUNTING: With fierce competition online, particularly from Amazon, stores are constantly trying to outdo each other and even undercutting themselves on prices from the previous year. Shoppers have been trained to demand deals, and won’t break the habit. “The heightened competition being driven by the influence of e-commerce largely is driving prices down on popular holiday items,” said Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track. “Retailers know consumers frequently compare prices on these categories online and are discounting more heavily to drive traffic and sales.” One example: The average price for a TV from Oct. 1 through Tuesday was $829.52, down from $1,009.41 during the same time last year, according to Market Track, which tracked promoted prices across 40 major retailers on over 19,000 TVs. THE RISE OF GIFT CARDS: Shoppers are giving more gift cards as presents, which skews holiday sales figures since they aren’t booked as sales until they’re redeemed. And most cards no longer have an expiration date_ This holiday season, gift cards were ranked second as a top gift, behind only clothing, according to NPD. Gift cards sales accounted for about 25.4 percent of holiday expenditures last year, up from 13.5 percent in 2003, according to Goldman Sachs and The Retail Economist. SHOPPERS WANT EXPERIENCES: Major department stores like Macy’s have been seeing shoppers shifting their spending away from traditional merchandise like clothing and more toward gifts that offer experiences like beauty treatments and other services. NPD found 10 percent of holiday shoppers said they planned to give fewer tangible gifts than last year, and 8 percent said they would not give any tangible gifts. Some 14 percent said they will give more experiences as gifts this year than last year, the research group said.

Officials with the Lawrenceburg Police Department said William Scot Hughes, 47, Lawrenceburg, is charged with three counts of attempted first-degree murder, three counts of aggravated assault, immediate notice of accident and leaving the scene of an accident. Lawrenceburg police detective Michael Reeves said the first accident happened in the Wal-Mart parking lot. Reports indicate Hughes is accused of hitting a pedestrian in the parking lot. Police said the person sustained only minor injuries and was not transported for medical treatment. The accident at Wal-Mart happened just before 7:30 a.m. Reeves said 15 to 20 minutes later, Hughes was involved in another accident on U.S. 43 just north of Lawrenceburg in Ethridge, Tennessee. Reports indicate two people were injured, one of them severely, in that accident. Hughes is in the Lawrence County Jail and will appear in Lawrence County General Sessions Court on Jan. 5 at 9 a.m. tom.smith@timesdaily.com or 256-740-5757. Twitter @TD_TomSmith.

Transnational Foods Inc. is a Miami-based company that imports hundreds of food products from 25 countries and distributes them, either under its own brands or private labels, to supermarkets, convenience stores and other retail outlets throughout the United States.

PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com Some of the foods of Transnational Foods Inc., at company’s office on Brickell Avenue in Miami. PATRICK FARRELL pfarrell@miamiherald.com 1 of 4 i BY JOSEPH A. MANN JR. Special to the Miami Herald LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The company and its products: Transnational Foods imports more than 500 lower-priced canned and packaged products from food-processing companies in 25 countries and sells them to supermarket chains, dollar stores and other retailers throughout the U.S. and overseas. Its products — canned fish from Spain, pasta from Mexico, olives from Peru, bouillon cubes from Egypt, freeze-dried fruit snacks from China and hundreds more — typically retail from $1 to $5 per item. “We offer a comprehensive line of value products in 25 different dry food categories such as baked goods, beverages, canned fruits, vegetables, meats and seafood, as well as olives, pasta, olive oil and others,” said Marcelo Young, Transnational’s founder, president and CEO. “Our market is any consumer looking for great quality food products at very low prices,” said Young, who was born and raised in Argentina and worked there in the international processed foods industry. “Since we started in 2002, consumers have learned that they could purchase products that weren’t so well known 30-50 percent cheaper than national brands, with similar quality or sometimes even better. This boom of ‘second- tier’ brands and private label products hasn’t stopped. It grew a lot during tough economic times but consumers continue to purchase these items once they’ve tried them because they see the value.” With distribution centers in Miami and six other cities, privately owned Transnational sells foods under its own brands — Pampa, della Natura, So Natural and Tummy Treats — and packages food for large companies under private labels. It sells to companies like Walmart, Safeway, Publix, Dollar Tree, Walgreens, Dollar General, Family Dollar, HEB, Big Lots and others in 50 states, as well as to clients overseas. “Our main suppliers are located in Mexico, Peru, Spain, Argentina, China, Thailand, India and the U.S.,” Young said. “And our people travel constantly to ensure that each supplier meets the highest quality standards and the specs required by our customers. We’re not just importers.” The company owns shares in some suppliers, so it plays an active role in choosing the agricultural products and overseeing the production, packaging and marketing processes. Getting started: After working as an executive at Argentina’s largest branded food company, Molinos Río de la Plata, Young saw a big opportunity in the U.S. processed food market, moved to Miami in 2000 and set up Transnational in 2002. “We saw a clear need in the market for the product we were offering: cost competitive and quality food products,” said Young, who runs the company with his brother, Francisco Young, the executive vice president. Supermarkets at the time were brand-conscious, but, “Dollar stores were starting to grow nationwide, offering good quality items and great prices,” the Transnational CEO said. “We saw the opportunity to offer a one-stop-shop for cost competitive and great quality food products.” Getting started was tough. When the company first called on high-end retailers, one buyer said they only purchase well-known brands. “We don’t hear that anymore,” Young said. “Supermarkets have realized that consumers demand value items and competitive prices. After 14 years, our Pampa brand is now well known and recognized for great price/quality products.” The difference: Transnational consistently provides customers with a diverse line of quality products at very competitive prices, Young said. “We have ownership positions or long-term exclusive agreements with the 100-plus facilities where we manufacture our products. This gives us control over product quality, safety and processes which are key to success when dealing with top U.S. retailers. Regarding costs, we are able to produce in mass quantities due to our large economies of scale, giving our customers the best prices and allowing our factories to work with maximum efficiency. Every cent or inch we can save in logistics will make a big difference at the end of the day. Service is another key to our success. Our customers need product on time and cannot afford empty shelves. We keep them well stocked year-round.” Sales: Transnational revenues have grown briskly, from $31 million in 2007 to $104.6 million in 2015. The company estimates 2016 sales at $106 million. About 60 percent of sales come from Transnational’s own brands, and the remainder private labels. Competitors: Some companies compete with specific Transnational product lines, but no one offers over 500 individual items from 25 different countries, Young said. Competitors include Bauducco (baked goods), La Moderna (pasta, flour, rice, soups, cookies, etc.), plus other importers specializing in certain product lines. Learning experience: “We work very closely with our customers to identify new products before we bring them to the U.S.,” Young said. “But sometimes, retail consumers decide that a product is not the right size or flavor, so we react.” The company consults closely with its wholesale customers and also conducts focus groups with consumers to help develop new products. Outside view: Ernst & Young chose Young as its Entrepreneur of the Year in 2015 in distribution and manufacturing, and the company has been recognized by several business publications as one of the fastest-growing enterprises in the U.S. What customers say: Transnational has been working with Valu Merchandisers Co. of Kansas City, Kansas, and its parent, Associated Wholesale Grocers, for about 15 years. “Transnational has been a good partner for VMC,” said Gary Boyle, category manager specialty and dollar at VMC, which supplies a wide variety of low-cost products to more than 3,400 stores in 30 states and overseas. “It has a wider variety of goods than most suppliers, and they source worldwide to ensure quality and value,” he said. VMC buys items that retail for $1.00 and the most popular Transnational products include cookies, cooking oil, pickles, olives and canned seafood. “Transnational’s Pampa brand is becoming a widely recognized label in the value industry,” Boyle said. “Customers know it for value and wide selection.” “We buy a lot of rice, canned seafood, hot sauce, olive oil and other items from Transnational,” said Elvin Santiago, director of purchasing at Iberia Foods, a major food distributor for the U.S. East Coast. They offer reliable delivery, good pricing, variety and quality, he said. One of Transnational’s biggest advantages is its expertise in exporting from foreign suppliers and importing into the U.S. “They know all the complicated government regulations and they save us money on paperwork,” Santiago said. “They handle everything and make it easier for us. I only have to pay one supplier [Transnational] here when they deliver merchandise.” Challenges and outlook: “We are always working with our suppliers and our customers to find new products all over the world, especially more healthy foods and snacks,” Young said. As for the company’s outlook, “Our goal is to expand and reach a half-billion dollars in sales in the next three years.” The writer can be reached at josephmannjr@gmail.com Transnational Foods Inc. Business: Imports hundreds of canned and packaged food products from suppliers in 25 different counties and sells them to supermarket chains, dollar stores and other retail groups throughout the United States and overseas. Specializing in quality, cost-competitive foods generally retailing from $1 to $5 per item, Transnational owns shares in some of the overseas companies that provide its 25 categories of food products. These include canned meat and seafood, instant coffee, peanut butter, fruit spreads, crackers, pasta, snacks, candies and olives. The fast-growing company sells products under its own brands — Pampa, So Natural, Tummy Treats and della Natura — and packages products for large processed food companies. It has warehouse distribution centers in Miami and six other cities.

There are three main reasons it ends on New Year's Day. First, there are football games that displace the energy the easily-distracted ultra-right wing needs to get through the end of the year. Second, Donald Trump needs the time to prepare for the presidency. He has continuously declared that people should say "Merry Christmas" rather than "Happy Holiday." He says when he becomes president, "We're going to start saying 'Merry Christmas' again." How he was going to enforce his edict without violating the Constitution or trampling the rights of private enterprise is not clear, but it does appeal to the core of his supporters. He did suggest boycotting stores that didn't greet customers with a "Merry Christmas" salute. This year, the religious right focused their anger at coffee, protesting the decision by Star Bucks to place its green and white logo on red coffee cups instead of cups that featured traditional symbols. The corporation just wanted a change in its seasonal cups and had no malice to any religion. Also changing the "Christmas Cup" is Dunkin' Donuts, which placed the red script "Joy" set inside green leafs against a white background. Among department store chains that have instructed their employees to wish customers a "Happy Holiday" are Best Buy, Victoria's Secret, and Wal-Mart. They, and thousands of other stores, respect their customers who are Jews, Muslims, Taoists, Buddhists, and numerous other religions that do not worship a man named Jesus who Christians believe is a deity. However, most American non-Christians aren't offended by being wished a "Merry Christmas"; they accept the spirit of the season and usually respond with an equally festive "Merry Christmas." - Advertisement - Third, it's impossible to wage fight something that doesn't exist. The War on Christianity has been made up by the ultra-right to rally supporters to its own point of view, and its interpretation that Santa Claus is an overweight white male with white hair and beard, dressed in a red suit, and goes "ho-ho-ho" every Christmas season. But that man at various times in history has been an elf or a midget, and the name hasn't always been Santa Claus. Nevertheless, the American Family Association (AFA) says it's liberals who have waged the War because they "want to eradicate anything that reminds Americans of Christianity." The AFA and the politically right-wing blame the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for the manufactured religious-neutral salutation. They have called the ACLU and others the anti-Christ, anti-Christian, and god-less communists. However, almost all who prefer to address others and prefer to be greeted with a "Happy Holiday" wish are not anti-Christian. Conservative radio hosts Bill O'Reilly and John Gibson co-created the War a decade ago in response to corporations and individuals wishing people a "Happy Holiday" instead of a "Merry Christmas." This year O'Reilly said it was terrorism to cancel a school play because of religious references. Fox News, hundreds of right-wing web sites, the online conservative news site Brieitbart.com, and thousands of parents protested a southeast Pennsylvania school for cancelling a Christmas play after a Jewish student complained. That was enough for the conservative crowd to go to Facebook and other social media sites to again blame liberals. However, the student merely asked to be excused from attending the play, and the school board agreed the student had that First Amendment right. The principal cancelled the play not because it had a Christian religious theme but because he said it took 20 hours to prepare; both he and the district board agreed the time to prepare the play was excessive; the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania requires at least 180 days of instruction every year. Wishing others a Merry Christmas, a Happy Holiday, a Happy Hanukkah--which began on Christmas Eve this year--or not wishing anyone anything is a fundamental right. The ACLU, other groups, and a few million Americans just want to keep religion separate from government, which is what the Founding Fathers wanted, and what the Supreme Court must uphold. - Advertisement - [Dr. Brasch is an award-winning journalist, and author of Fracking America: Sacrificing Health and the Environment for Short-Term Economic Benefit.]   - Advertisement - 2   2   2   View Ratings | Rate It http://www.walterbrasch.com Walter Brasch is an award-winning journalist and professor of journalism emeritus.

'National Returns Day' Brings Record Numbers Of Packages Sent Back By Tim Marcin @TimMarcin On 12/27/16 AT 3:41 PM Close Not all gifts can be winners. That means with Christmas in rear view mirror, lots of folks this week will be looking to send back presents that they know they won't enjoy.  But the biggest day for returns actually comes after the New Year, according to shipping company UPS. Packages sent back via UPS actually peak on Jan. 5, which the company has dubbed National Returns Day. UPS projects that shoppers will send back some 1.3 million packages with the company on the so-called National Returns Day, a good chunk of the 5.8 million packages UPS expects to return during the first full week of 2017. Both of those figures would be the highest ever. The company returns so many packages nowadays because of the massive popularity of ecommerce, whether through etailers like Amazon or eBay, or through the websites of retailers like Target or WalMart.  Related Stories Gina Rodriguez Considers This Her Greatest Christmas Gift Last-Minute Tech Christmas Gifts "Online shoppers want the same level of choice, control and convenience making their returns as they do making their purchases," said Teresa Finley, chief marketing officer for UPS, in a press release Tuesday. A UPS survey showed that customers have had fewer complaints in recent years about returning gifts purchased online. "While returns can’t be eliminated, an easy to use returns experience should be one of several retail strategies to enhance customer loyalty and manage the cost of returns processing," Finley said in the statement. The same UPS survey found that 70 percent of online shoppers made another purchase when they returned a gift to a store and just 45 percent made an additional purchase when making a return through a store's website. Estimates have suggested that 20 percent of all returns happen during the holiday season, which accounts for some $60 billion in merchandise, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2014. Commonly returned gifts include presents given to wives by husbands, video games (perhaps already owned by the gamer), workout clothing and kitchsy knick-knacks, Newsweek reported last year. Time's Money laid out some tips for making returns go smoothly, including acting early and planning to get store credit in lieu of cash.  Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Few are easy or inexpensive, but one has to spend to nourish a successful community and we believe all of these are worth doing. Indeed, several goals listed in previous years have in fact been accomplished so there is some reason for optimism. On our agenda: • City officials should develop a comprehensive development plan for the hospital-Walmart area and present it to the public. It is hoped planning can at least prevent the traffic problem from worsening, and, with luck and perseverance, ways may be found to improve it as the former residential area continues to grow. • A comprehensive development plan would be good for the east side of town as well, now that it is seeing some commercial development, especially in what were residential or professional commercial areas there as well. • The city should commission a feasibility study for a three-level parking garage behind the police department, where it would be relatively unobtrusive, and could partially be paid for through parking fees. We are not a fan of parking garages, but with the growth of the downtown area plus increased use of the Tanglefoot Trail, a multi-level structure in addition to the library parking lot could be the best solution to our parking problem. • The Union County Development Association board should restructure or phase out the organization since most of its functions have been removed and the city and county are paying an industrial developer through Three Rivers Planning and Development District. The restructured organization could possibly serve in the role of chamber of commerce as an umbrella for all local civic and related organizations to coordinate a master calendar of events, avoiding waste and duplication, and spending funds more effectively and efficiently. • City officials should also commission an engineering study on cost of solving the brown water problem. People who grew up here may be used to it and it has seen some improvement over the years, but it is still a problem and may hamper attracting businesses and new residents. Voters could decide whether they want to pay the cost necessary to cure the problem. • More transparency in city and county government. We are not implying any intent of wrongdoing but it seems more than 90 percent of actions still take place in private meetings and the first the public hears of these actions is after they have already been decided. As long as we have honest officials that is not so much of a problem but the people still need to be better informed concerning what is going on. • City officials should take a new look at the city sign ordinance, which appears to be less than business friendly at times, uneven in regulation, and could even need more restrictions in other areas. • Expedite creating a formal welcome center for Tanglefoot Trail and see that it is staffed full-time or as close to full time as possible, perhaps recruiting volunteers such as the hospital has for its auxiliary. This has been talked about since before the trail opened and several plans have stalled, but having a center in the library or even elsewhere will create a better impression on visitors and increase income to local businesses and the city as well. • Expand the library. This ties in with the need for a welcome center, but the library on its own is seeing increased use of its meeting room, which is too small, especially given the limited number of public meeting areas in the city, and also increased interest in its paper and technology services. • We would like to see the end of middle-of-the-street parking, but don’t expect that to change. • City officials might think about providing incentives for business development on the north side of the Burlington-Northern tracks. That is the most untapped area for business expansion and the only logical direction for expansion. • Look into the feasibility of creating the state’s first folk arts center and possible state park on land owned by the county near the fairgrounds. This is ambitious but doable, given the resources already developed by our excellent historical society. If done similarly to the folk arts center in Arkansas it would bring some jobs, considerable prestige and even more revenue to the area. • We still hold out hope for an aquatic complex, even though the cost for even a limited version will be enormous by local standards. This is an opportunity we owe our citizens, especially the young ones. • The city has been using the Band-Aid approach to its public service buildings for years and we obviously need a better police department and street department, as well as better facilities for our public utilities. • We urge county officials to enact building codes and zoning regulations. Of course they will not be popular at first, but will quickly add to the value of the county as a whole and the property of individual landowners as opposed to having the value run down by rampant substandard construction and practices. Let us know what you think should be on the agenda.

Maxx generates only about one-per-cent of its revenue from online sales. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Kim Bhasin and Lindsey Rupp When Kimberly Dulude steps into a T.J. Maxx store near her job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she likes to begin perusing a clearance aisle in the back. Then she works her way up to shoes. Beauty is next, and so on until she gets to the front. The 29-year-old does buy stuff online all the time — just not from T.J. Maxx. The store, she says, provides the thrill of the hunt. "I kid you not, I could spend hours in there," said Dulude. There's been much talk this holiday season about the utter dominance of e-commerce. Cyber Monday set a record for online sales in the U.S., racking up $3.45 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insights. The National Retail Federation said more people shopped online throughout Black Friday weekend than in physical stores. And the clicks continued past the weekend: Retailers such as Walmart Stores and Amazon.com turned what was once just a discount day for online sales into weeks of bargains. But there are some stores bucking the trend. Take T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, owned by parent company TJX Cos. They're a rarity in the retail universe: stores that don't care about online sales because their businesses are based on the real-life retail experience. Inventory shifts regularly, so no visit is the same — the promise of discovering great items on the cheap is what draws shoppers inside. Companies like Framingham, Mass.-based TJX and competitors Ross Stores and Burlington Stores have a team of buyers that pick up excess items on the wholesale market — anything from cashmere sweaters to copper mugs. TJX alone works with more than 18,000 vendors, including manufacturers and retailers, to scoop up stylish stuff in bulk and resell it at a steal. With more than 2,500 U.S. stores, the company is also adept at tailoring merchandise being offered to local trends. If you love retailers like Marshall's but don't live near one, you're out of luck — online, they only sell gift cards. T.J. Maxx sells some clothing and accessories on its website, but the experience is very different than sifting through racks for a one-of-its-size item. "They're not worried about it at all," says Mickey Chadha, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service who considers the T.J. Maxx's online penetration negligible. "The product is right at the right price. Online is only as good as the product." TJX executives have repeatedly stated on conference calls with analysts that they view e-commerce as a supplement to its shops, a way to drive real-life traffic. Though TJMaxx.com launched back in 2013, e-commerce sales remain at only about one per cent of total sales and had an "immaterial impact" on growth last year, according to a January filing. "While it's a small part of our business, we see it as highly complementary to our physical stores," TJX CEO Ernie Herrman said in May. "We are being methodical in how we grow this business." It's working. Shares have more than doubled over the past five years and revenue is up more than 30 per cent during the same period. TJX's 10 brands, including Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, hauled in nearly $31 billion in sales last year. But don't expect a trend heading back in time. This is a difficult system to replicate, said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Instinet. TJX boasts a wide net of inventory buyers who find small batches of desirable clothing, then make a small bet on those goods. This is unlike the traditional department store model, where buyers look at runway trends and make large orders of a few items, hoping that they'll be the winner for the season. "You're buying closed-out product and you're buying samples," said Siegel. "You have to be very attuned to the numbers and very attuned to the fashion. The vendor base that you need to be plugged into and the intelligence that goes into buying the product is the most important asset they have. You need to find the most compelling stuff." When stores like T.J. Maxx do it right, they leave their shoppers filled with feelings of adventure and serendipity, says Jordan Rost, vice-president of consumer insights at research firm Nielsen. Even an unsuccessful trip to a discount store can reinforce the thrill of the hunt. The instincts driving customers into parking lots is similar to those shopping online, Rost says. They're searching for deals and the best item to fill some broad want or need without a target in mind. As shoppers across generations and demographics become more focused on value than ever before, the excitement of finding something on sale has an even broader appeal. Millennials who grew up relying on e-commerce for all their needs are coming through the doors, too. "Younger consumers are really open to that kind of open-minded approach to shopping, not necessarily coming in with a specific brand or product in mind," says Rost. "Discovery is part of the experience."

No longer. And police say at least one brawl was organized on social media. Tech Culture by Chris Matyszczyk December 27, 2016 11:58 AM PST @ChrisMatyszczyk Up Next Putin ordered campaign to influence US election, say intel agencies Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Enlarge Image In one mall, a brawl and someone ready to film it.Photo by ABC News screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET The morning after Thanksgiving, I'm always excited. What gadgets, I wonder, have Americans been fighting over at Walmart and various shopping malls? Which YouTube videos have the best fisticuffs, the finest hair-pulling and most elaborate security interventions? This year, I was disappointed. There appeared to be relatively little action. It seems, though, that the Christmas holiday shopping extravaganza has taken the place of Black Friday. YouTube is suddenly adorned with several videos from around America that feature humans brawling over, well, it's not always clear. In New Jersey, for example, Christmas Eve aroused a brouhaha at the Newport Mall. Security staff leaped in to separate the frustrated. In Gurnee, Illinois, a chair was brandished, as another mall dispute descended into rancor. In Montgomery, Alabama, shoppers tore at each other's hair and fists flew, as more than one fight was reported. But there's another aspect to all this. Police are increasingly suspicious that some of these mall brawls are organized affairs, with the organization happening on social media. In Beachwood, Ohio, for example, police said on Facebook that a brawl at a local mall on Monday was "loosely organized on social media." A police department spokesman told me that police "believe [the brawl] was caused by pockets of individuals that may have heard about it through others around the country." He added: "Detectives are looking into some potential leads but investigations involving social media outlets are not easy." More Technically Incorrect Singer George Michael mourned across social media Trump tweets he's charitable and would beat Obama The one person you should contact on Christmas Day In at least one case, reports ABC News, police in riot gear were called. ABC says that a dozen mall brawls were reported across America. In Tennessee, mall mayhem was reportedly caused by someone letting off fireworks in a store. In this case, police are also said to be investigated whether the whole scene was instigated on social media. In Aurora, Colorado, a social media post reportedly suggested there would be a mall fight there too. If malls are to become such dangerous battlegrounds, it can surely only further enhance the online shopping experience. At Thanksgiving, 10 million more American shopped online than in stores. Events such as the ones depicted in so many of these videos make the physical shopping experience seem ever more daunting. Unless you're fond of a festive fight, that is.

Many stores slashed prices for seasonal items and gift packages by 50 percent or more on Monday. BRIAN W. MYSZKOWSKI/TIMES NEWS By Brian Myszkowski bmyszkowski@tnonline.com It seems like we just got past the Christmas shopping rush, but another flock of customers flew into retail stores Monday. Returns and exchanges for faulty toys or wrong-sized clothing were common motives to hit the stores again, but many people were out to prepare for next year. The focus here wasn’t necessarily on gifts, but decorations, lights, and other necessities that can survive a year in the attic or closet. “I’ll probably get wrapping paper, stock up for next year,” Jenn Cunfer said as she waited for customer service at Walmart, where the line was kept to a reasonable flow, all things considered. Cunfer did have a few returns on hand, mostly items that she already had — a barbecue set, an electric toothbrush, and some other odds and ends. According to the National Retail Federation, 48 percent of consumers were looking into taking advantage of the steep discounts offered in the post-holiday market. Comparatively, the federation predicted that about a third of Americans would return at least one gift. “It’s actually been pretty calm, not very busy,” Kmart customer service employee Laurie Meckes said, pointing out that the big draw was the post-Christmas sales. Deals like these were especially prevalent at big-box retailers like Kmart and Walmart, and customers were eager to take advantage of deals that amounted to 50 percent off or more. “We were looking for Christmas cards and lights, tree-toppers, anything Christmas, because it’s all marked 50 percent off. Now, we’ll come back in a week, and it’ll be marked 75,” Cindy Serfass said as she perused the clearance section at Kmart in Walnutport. While seasonal decorations are a focal point for sales, savvy shoppers can pick up some great gift ideas for the coming months. Serfass and her daughter Laura Gieske were able to find some great deals on marked-down perfume and toiletry sets. Of course, there were plenty of shoppers eager to turn in cash or gift cards that were burning holes in their pockets — though that demographic tended to skew a bit younger. “There aren’t that many returns,” said Blanda Prutzman, a Kmart employee in the toy section. “There’s a lot of kids with their parents, spending what they got for Christmas moneywise, buying things they didn’t get.” Login or register to post comments PrintThis ShareThis American Flags Home News Classifieds Entertainment Lifestyle Obituaries Sports Customer Service About Us Advertise Digital Guidelines Privacy Policy Photos Reproduction is prohibited without the express written consent of the Times News, LLC. © 2017

WBRZ-TV reports  New Roads police arrested 34-year-old Kyandrea Thomas at about noon Saturday after she checked into Lane Memorial Hospital in Zachary. She faces an attempted second-degree murder charge. Around 8 p.m. Friday, police and firefighters responded to reports of an unresponsive baby left in a store’s bathroom. Firefighters performed CPR on the girl before rushing her to Pointe Coupee General Hospital. By 10:15 p.m., doctors said the infant was stable but critical. She’s since been transported to Our Lady of The Lake Children’s Hospital in Baton Rouge. Lt. Shael Stringer reminds desperate parents that under the state’s safe-haven law babies can be dropped off at hospitals, police or fire stations with no questions asked. Thomas was also arrested in 2009 on a negligent homicide charge after leaving a young child in a hot car. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

The Better Business Bureau revealed the top scam of the year is that ubiquitously annoying IRS tax scam -- you know, the one where some guy with a thick foreign accent calls you to say you owe a few thousand dollars in back taxes, and if you don't send the money via wire transfer, Walmart transfer or ITunes gift card, a treasury agent will end up at your doorstep. Never mind that neither the IRS nor the U.S. Treasury nor any government agency will ever initiate a phone call like that. If they really had the goods on you, they would notify you by mail through a collection letter or subpoena--and they wouldn't give you a heads-up on a pending arrest.  Here are the scams that round out the top 10, according to the BBB: Scam Type Scam Reports Percentage Last Year Tax Scams (IRS and CRA) 7,530 25.0 24.0 Debt Collections 2,456 8.2 8.3 Sweepstakes/Prizes/Gifts 2,102 7.0 8.0 Online Purchase 1,891 6.3 --- Employment 1,773 5.9 --- Government Grant 1,453 4.8 5.7 Tech Support 1,382 4.6 6.0 Advance Fee Loan 965 3.2 3.8 Fake Check/Money Order 872 2.9 2.4 Phishing 776 2.6 The BBB said the top 3--tax scams, debt collections and sweepstakes/prize scams--were the top three in 2015, too. The bureau encouraged consumers when solicited by these scams to report them to the BBB's ScamTracker. Consumers can click on any location on the Scam Tracker's map and track other people's tell-alls of ripoffs happening in the same neighborhoods. "We'll be able to help the public know what kind of scams are happening in their area, and they'll also know that they're not alone," Mid-South Better Business Bureau President Randy Hutchinson said. "They're not the only ones who have gotten these phone calls." "We'll put (the scam) on blast on Scam Tracker so that other people can use that as a warning, but a consumer does not have to have a scam artist's name or information to report a scam," said Nancy Crawford, director of communications of the Mid-South Better Business Bureau. She showed how consumers can use the Scam Tracker to track scam trends right down to their individual neighborhoods. "It helps other consumers know what's going on so that they don't become a victim," she said. "Also, your report can be filed anonymously. We just want as much information as possible about the scam, who's perpetrating it and where so that we can share it on the Scam Tracker." Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

Muslims in a Bible Belt town hold their breath By Abigail Hauslohner The Washington Post SentinelSource.com Posted on Dec 27, 2016 by Stephen Gilbert MUFREESBORO, Tenn. — It was here, in this midsize college town in the dead center of Tennessee, that a right-wing effort to ban Islamic law found one of its first sponsors. Here, too, a congressman co-sponsored a plan to “defund Muslim ‘refugees’ “ and local residents sued to block construction of the only mosque, a fight that ended at the Supreme Court. The town’s Muslims carried on through all of that, raising their children, saying their prayers, teaching at college, filling people’s prescriptions and filling their tanks, contributing to the civic life in a city of 126,000. They felt the familiar grief and fear of reprisal last year when a Muslim man killed four Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn., 90 minutes away. Now Donald Trump — a man who has repeatedly cast doubt on the patriotism of Muslims — is the president-elect, and he has selected a national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has called Islam a “cancer.” And a deep unease has again seeped into the daily life of many here in this Muslim community of about 1,500. There has been a smattering of post-election harassment and insults — at schools, in parking lots, on the road — but nothing to take to the police or put Murfreesboro back in the national headlines. “Right now, we’re hoping that it’s going to be calm,” said Saleh Sbenaty, an engineering professor at Middle Tennessee State University and one of the founders of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. “But we don’t know if it’s the calm before the storm or the calm after the storm.” Murfreesboro is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country and an increasingly diverse one. Muslim and Christian students go to school and play sports together; their families patronize the same restaurants and stores. Residents variously describe the town as a proud example of Southern hospitality, a growing “melting pot,” a suburb of “little blue dot” Nashville and the “buckle on the Bible Belt.” Its downtown with the old courthouse and Confederate-soldiers memorial yields to strip malls and chain stores, new housing developments and old cotton fields, and the university, with its 20,000 undergraduates. You can drive to the popular shawarma joint for some Arab cuisine, then get back in the car and hear syndicated talk-show host Michael Savage on the radio wondering how many veterans are in jail “for having the guts to kill an Islamo-fascist.” Among the town’s couple hundred places of worship are 59 Baptist churches, including an Arabic Baptist church as well as Grace Baptist, whose deacon in 2010 greeted the construction of the new mosque next door by erecting 23 huge white crosses on the road. There are people such as Abdou Kattih, a pharmacist at Walgreens and one of the mosque’s founders, and Jason Bennett, an evangelical advocate for the homeless and a onetime mosque opponent; the two now consider each other close friends. There are people such as the self-described “right-wing Southern Baptist,” shopping at Bullseye Gun, Gear and Pawn on a recent day, who is certain that Muslims think they have the right “to kill you and take your wife as a sex slave.” The man declined to give his name, he said, because he employs a number of Muslims in his health-sector company anyway and did not want them to know what he thinks. He still goes to cookouts and ballgames with them, he said. On the other hand, said James McCarroll Jr., a pastor at First Baptist Church, “we’re seeing more of an acceptance, a lot of it being spurred by the university having a large community of Muslims.” The day after the election, flowers were left on the mosque’s doorstep, and a stranger approached the new imam, an Egyptian, at the Walmart and welcomed him to town. Nothing seems to illustrate the complicated attitudes better than Tammy and Ahmed Ragab’s family — three conservative Muslims and three evangelical Christians sharing a house. The couple bought a home with Tammy’s parents five years ago. To the Ragabs, Trump is a threat personified. They see him as a man whose policies and rhetoric have emboldened people to attack and vilify Muslims, including their 12-year-old daughter, who they said was threatened at school the week after the election. Tammy’s parents and sister voted for him. In five years of diverging viewpoints and lifestyles — the couples cook separately, watch different news channels and celebrate different holidays — a simple harmony has prevailed, they said, because they love each other. Tammy’s parents eat pork, go to church and keep “a whole cabinet of Jesus statues” in the house, Tammy said. They also remind their granddaughter to pray five times a day and help her pick out clothes to match her hijab. “But at the same time, when it comes to the Trump issues, she’ll say, ‘Oh, he only said that one time,’ “ Tammy said of her mother. “They don’t believe he’s going to do the things he said.” Tammy, who converted to Islam a few years before meeting Ahmed, an Egyptian immigrant, implores her mother to consider “the things we might face” under Trump. “And she says, ‘Well, that’s your choice.’ “ Her mother, Linda Harmon, said she knows “a lot of people are scared that Muslims are going to have to register and get shipped back.” But, she added, “even a lot of Muslims want people vetted. ... He’s not going to send any back that aren’t causing any trouble, I don’t think.” Kattih, the pharmacist, remembers a day a few years back when a customer came in to fill a prescription and said, “Did you hear those damn Muslims want to build a church in town?” Kattih, who immigrated as an adult from Syria, told her that he is a Muslim. His skin, like many of the Arab immigrants in the town, is just as pale as the whites who can trace their American lineage back generations. The exchange resulted in a moment of shock, a hurried exit and, a week later, an apology. “I didn’t know you were one of them,” he remembered her saying the next time she came in. “I just wanted to apologize. If you need anything, call me.” The incident shaped his outlook, he said: Maybe people just don’t know enough about each other. Last year, Kattih founded Murfreesboro Muslim Youth, a community service group that aims to make Muslims visible and familiar to people who would not dare visit the mosque. “What people in America are failing to realize: Most immigrant Muslims lived under dictatorship. Fear is embedded in their skin. So when they’re afraid, they retract,” Kattih said. “And I think that’s the opposite of what needs to happen. You need to stretch out your hand to allies. And you’ll be surprised what hands reach out back.”A week after the election, the group’s members, most in their late teens or early 20s, gathered in the town square and handed out flowers to strangers. Some people from other faiths joined in. On Thanksgiving, the students cooked 48 meals and gave them to families in need. When students hosted a meet-a-Muslim event on the university campus earlier this year, “most people came up to us and said they had never met a Muslim,” said Basant Salem, 18, who moved to Murfreesboro five years ago from Morgantown, West Virginia, when her father became a genetics professor at the university. “We don’t have to change their views,” said Basant’s sister, Samar, 21, who once brought cookies to mosque protesters, “but just make them aware that we aren’t what they think we are.” What worries and perplexes many Muslims and their friends here is what lies beneath the surface. What impact will Trump have as president when distrust of Muslims already exists? Bennett, director of the Murfreesboro Cold Patrol, used to belong to an evangelical church opposed to the mosque, which protesters and politicians accused of supporting terrorism. Vandals struck the building site three times, at one point setting construction equipment on fire. Bennett changed his thinking after he met Kattih and other Muslims also involved in providing social services to those in need. He said the fear and the false pronouncements — that Muslims worship a different God, are taught to lie, or use mosques as jihadist training centers — are as pervasive in the town’s Sunday sermons and Bible studies as they were five years ago. “All that stuff is still there,” Bennett said. “When policies start to take effect after January, or start to move, I think we’re going to see some pretty rough times again.” McCarroll, who leads a predominantly black church in Murfreesboro, echoed that concern. “I think we could see people displaced,” he said. “Right now it’s just rhetoric, but I think the town is really holding its breath.” Ask locals about the churches that oppose Islam and many point first to the World Outreach Church, the largest megachurch in town. “We have a duty to investigate anyone under the banner of Islam,” the pastor, Allen Jackson, declared at a hearing on the mosque plan back in 2010. The church declined to comment on Jackson’s view now, but a man who worships there said the pastor continues to view Islam through a prism of holy war: “He thinks it’s biblical.” The men and women who once sued and protested against the mosque come in to fill prescriptions from Kattih, buy doughnuts or cigarettes from Essam Mohammed at the Quik Mart, or attend one of Sbenaty’s engineering classes. They trade pleasantries. They’re polite. They continue on their way. Howard Wall puts it like this: “If I have to go the store to get a Coke or something, we talk. I’m nice to them, they’re nice to me.” Wall and his wife, Sally, are local developers who were among those who sued to stop the mosque construction, litigation that was resolved when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case. The couple has no plans to take up another fight. They also think it won’t be necessary, because Trump will limit the arrival of more Muslims. Murfreesboro doesn’t need “to have a lot of Muslims,” said Sally Wall. “I think they can stay where they are and we stay where we are.” But there’s more tolerance because of the public acrimony over the mosque, said city council member Bill Shacklett. “I wish some of the things hadn’t happened. But the one thing it has done is compel people to open their hearts and minds to be drawn toward each other ... get out and flesh out your faith with different people,” Shacklett said, adding that both Muslims and Christians have started to do that. “Maybe that wouldn’t have happened if we hadn’t had the spotlight put on us for all of that.” Discuss Print Posted in News on Tuesday, December 27, 2016 12:00 pm.

Judge Roger Webber said he was "skeptical" of Matthew Robutz's epiphany but agreed to recommend the 26-year-old man, who last lived in the 500 block of West Hill Street, for the Department of Corrections' boot-camp program. On Dec. 20, Webber sentenced Robutz for engaging in a continuing financial crimes enterprise, a Class 1 felony to which he pleaded guilty in early November. The judge also ordered Robutz to make restitution of $3,938.43 to several victims. Assistant State's Attorney Joel Fletcher said Robutz was arrested in July in Champaign County and subsequently charged with burglary, unlawful use of account numbers and engaging in a continuing financial crimes enterprise. On July 10, Fletcher said, Robutz was staying at a motel in north Champaign and used the credit-card account of an Idaho man — without his knowledge or permission — to pay for two nights of lodging. On Robutz, police found a Wal-Mart debit card that had the Idaho man's MasterCard information on the electronic strip. Robutz also had 20 blank cards with magnetic strips, 19 debit cards, a credit card scanner, a laptop and four prepaid Visa MasterCard debit gift cards. All 19 cards had information on the magnetic strip that did not match the face of the card. The information had come from Citibank accounts closed due to fraud, Fletcher said. In exchange for Robutz's plea to the one count, Fletcher dismissed other felony counts against Robutz, including burglary and unlawful use of account numbers. Fletcher recommended eight years in prison for Robutz and to aggravate his sentence had an Illinois state trooper and a Champaign police officer who had investigated Robutz's illegal activity testify about that. Webber heard information about Robutz's arrest on Sept. 22, 2015, on Interstate 57 in Iroquois County. In the car he was in, police found a credit card embosser, 100 gift cards, a laptop computer and 74 debit cards. Among the cards were several that had electronic information on them that did not match the name on the card. Eighteen had Robutz's name embossed on them but information on the mag- netic strip belonged to other accounts, some of which police found had fraudulent activity in Peoria, Bloomington, Danville and Champaign, Fletcher said. In addition to the testimony of the police investigators, Fletcher had the judge listen to several tape-recorded jail phone conversations that occurred in July and August between Robutz and his parents. In some, Robutz boasted of the large amount of money he was making in the cloned credit card business, despite pleas from his parents to straighten up and get his life together. "One gets the image of a precocious 15-year-old," Fletcher said, calling Robutz remorseless. But Assistant Public Defender Lindsey Yanchus said the calls were made at a time when Robutz was in jail for the first time in his life and was angry and scared. The man before Webber at sentencing, she said, was sober and had come to terms with the reality of his criminal conduct. She sought probation for him. Robutz admitted to the judge that when he was making those remarks he was "angry and full of bravado." "I thought it was a victimless crime. Once I got sober, I started to see the bigger picture," said Robutz, adding his jail stay was a "huge wake-up call." Webber said in light of what he heard of the jail conversations, he was relieved to hear Robutz's apology in court, even if skeptical of his sincerity. "Even if no individual is personally involved, society as a whole suffers when scams like this are committed," Webber said. "What you are here for may very well by the tip of the iceberg of what you are engaged in."

South Euclid (YOO'-klid) police say a 23-year-old Lakewood man called 911 Friday evening and said two men abducted his 6-year-old daughter at a Walmart.

South Euclid (YOO'-klid) police say a 23-year-old Lakewood man called 911 Friday evening and said two men abducted his 6-year-old daughter at a Walmart. He described the men and their vehicle, and police issued a picture of a suspect. Police eventually found inconsistencies in the caller's story, determined it was a hoax and canceled the alert. WJW-TV reports investigators aren't sure of his motive. Officer Joe Di Lillo tells WJW it's troubling because police dropped other duties to search for the girl.

While Tesco earned kudos for standing up to Unilever over a Brexit-related price hike, Asda saw its worst sales performance and Iceland was sued by the country of the same name. Read More Welsh retailers face challenging period as footfall falls in lead up to Christmas Price war hits Asda sales Against the backdrop of a brutal price war, Asda reeled off a series of shocking sales figures indicating that it was losing the battle and the plot. This culminated in the departure of boss Andy Clarke, after which it recorded a 7.5% plunge in like-for-like sales in the second quarter, its worst performance on record. Read More Now you can get Welsh whisky in Asda stores across the UK Its US owner Walmart parachuted in another Clarke, Sean, to replace him and he immediately set about slashing prices on hundreds of products as the grocery giant attempted to regain customers. He at least arrested the decline. In November, Asda reported another hefty fall in sales, but this time it was only 5.8% on a like-for-like basis. Turnaround for Morrisons Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in  Amazon's first delivery by DRONE Share this video Watch Next Morrisons, on the other hand, is in the midst of a barnstorming turnaround under David Potts. The chief executive replaced Dalton Philips in 2015 and never looked back. In November the chain totted up a full year of sales growth following a prolonged period of stagnation under Mr Phillips. Mr Potts has embarked on a number of measures to reverse the grocer’s fortunes and earlier this year inked a new deal with Ocado and signed a landmark agreement with US online giant Amazon to supply fresh food to customers. Read More Pubs, shops, brewers, crisp makers and more are all terrified food prices are about to rocket Morrisons has also piled into the price war, revealing in August that it was slashing selected meat and poultry prices by 12%. Tesco in recovery mode Tesco store at Aberystwyth Tesco is also in recovery mode as Dave Lewis attempts a clean break with the shambolic reign of his predecessor Philip Clarke. In October, Mr Lewis rang up Tesco’s third quarter in a row of rising sales and unveiled a three-year plan to get profits back on track. He aims to slash costs by £1.5bn over the next three years to help boost margins and return the group to bottom line profit growth. Read More Tesco villages could be a solution to the housing crisis according to the supermarket Tesco’s half-year figures showed that it was making progress and was moving on from a series of lows, including posting the biggest loss in its history last year and becoming embroiled in a £326m accounting scandal. Legal actions But the embers of Mr Clarke’s reign refuse to die out. This year it emerged that Carl Rogberg, Chris Bush and John Scouler - the supermarket’s former finance chief, managing director and food commercial head respectively - will face a trial in 2017 over the accounting scandal and could be handed lengthy jail sentences if found guilty. The Serious Fraud Office charged the men with fraud by abuse of position, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, and false accounting, which carries seven years. Read More A supermarket has just increased the price of Marmite by 12.5% Mr Clarke will not face charges in the accounting scandal, according to his lawyer. Tesco is also facing legal action from a group of 125 large investors who claim to have lost “well in excess of £100m” as a result of the accounting scandal. Bentham Europe, the firm fronting the action, said institutional funds have filed the lawsuit in a bid to prove that Tesco “made misleading statements to the stock market that omitted material information and which were relied on by investors when making investment decisions”. Marmitegate Some Unilever products affected by the threatened price rise Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in  Share this video Watch Next Despite this, Mr Lewis has been praised for the way Tesco has shifted its focus to the core UK supermarket, and also for his leadership during the Marmite saga. The collapse in the value of the pound, sparked by the Brexit vote, sent the cost of imported goods soaring. Supermarket suppliers responded in the only way they could: by raising prices. The most high profile example was Unilver’s attempt to charge more for Marmite. Read More Asda brings down price of Marmite to £2 Tesco was asked to stomach a 10% hike, and deliveries to the supermarket were halted when it refused, leading to a shortage in some stores. Unilever, which is behind a host of household brands, has since warned that the prices of products will rise as a result of the collapse in sterling. Aldi and Lidl continue rise Aldi's Christmas advert Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in  Share this video Watch Next As forecasts for inflation continue to point upwards, shoppers are bracing for more increases in the new year, which many experts believe could drive more consumers into the hands of Aldi and Lidl. Over the past 12 months, the German duo continued their march to seize more market share from the established Big Four players. Sales at Aldi grew by 12% to £7.7bn in 2015, with the grocer doubling its turnover in three years. But while the company confirmed like-for-like sales were still in positive territory, boss Matthew Barnes admitted they had slowed. Read More Lidl to launch a luxury lingerie range and the price might just surprise you Lidl, which recorded revenues of £4.7bn in 2015, parted company with UK boss Ronny Gottschlich, replacing him with Christian Hartnagel. Mr Gottschlich spent 16 years at Lidl, including six years as the company’s Great Britain CEO, overseeing its meteoric rise from bit-part player to established contender.

Iceland (the country) launched legal action against Iceland (the supermarket) over the use of its name. The Nordic nation lodged legal papers at the European Union Intellectual Property Office with the goal of “ensuring the right of Icelandic companies to use the word ‘Iceland’ in relation to their goods and services”. The store group responded by sending a “high-level delegation” to Reykjavik in the hope of thawing relations with the Icelandic government.

Against the backdrop of a brutal price war, Asda reeled off a series of shocking sales figures indicating that it was losing the battle and the plot. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments This culminated in the departure of boss Andy Clarke, after which it recorded a 7.5% plunge in like-for-like sales in the second quarter, its worst performance on record. Its US owner Walmart parachuted in another Clarke, Sean, to replace him and he immediately set about slashing prices on hundreds of products as the grocery giant attempted to regain customers. He at least arrested the decline. In November, Asda reported another hefty fall in sales, but this time it was only 5.8% on a like-for-like basis. Morrisons, on the other hand, is in the midst of a barnstorming turnaround under David Potts. The chief executive replaced Dalton Philips in 2015 and never looked back. In November the chain totted up a full year of sales growth following a prolonged period of stagnation under Mr Phillips. Mr Potts has embarked on a number of measures to reverse the grocer's fortunes and earlier this year inked a new deal with Ocado and signed a landmark agreement with US online giant Amazon to supply fresh food to customers. Morrisons has also piled into the price war, revealing in August that it was slashing selected meat and poultry prices by 12%. Tesco is also in recovery mode as Dave Lewis attempts a clean break with the shambolic reign of his predecessor Philip Clarke. In October, Mr Lewis rang up Tesco's third quarter in a row of rising sales and unveiled a three-year plan to get profits back on track. He aims to slash costs by £1.5 billion over the next three years to help boost margins and return the group to bottom line profit growth. Tesco's half-year figures showed that it was making progress and was moving on from a series of lows, including posting the biggest loss in its history last year and becoming embroiled in a £326 million accounting scandal. But the embers of Mr Clarke's reign refuse to die out. This year it emerged that Carl Rogberg, Chris Bush and John Scouler - the supermarket's former finance chief, managing director and food commercial head respectively - will face a trial in 2017 over the accounting scandal and could be handed lengthy jail sentences if found guilty. The Serious Fraud Office charged the men with fraud by abuse of position, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, and false accounting, which carries seven years. Mr Clarke will not face charges in the accounting scandal, according to his lawyer. Tesco is also facing legal action from a group of 125 large investors who claim to have lost "well in excess of £100 million" as a result of the accounting scandal. Bentham Europe, the firm fronting the action, said institutional funds have filed the lawsuit in a bid to prove that Tesco "made misleading statements to the stock market that omitted material information and which were relied on by investors when making investment decisions". Despite this, Mr Lewis has been praised for the way Tesco has shifted its focus to the core UK supermarket, and also for his leadership during the Marmite saga. The collapse in the value of the pound, sparked by the Brexit vote, sent the cost of imported goods soaring. Supermarket suppliers responded in the only way they could: by raising prices. The most high-profile example was Unilver's attempt to charge more for Marmite. Tesco was asked to stomach a 10% hike, and deliveries to the supermarket were halted when it refused, leading to a shortage in some stores. Unilever, which is behind a host of household brands, has since warned that the prices of products will rise as a result of the collapse in sterling. As forecasts for inflation continue to point upwards, shoppers are bracing for more increases in the new year, which many experts believe could drive more consumers into the hands of Aldi and Lidl. Over the past 12 months, the German duo continued their march to seize more market share from the established Big Four players. Sales at Aldi grew by 12% to £7.7 billion in 2015, with the grocer doubling its turnover in three years. But while the company confirmed like-for-like sales were still in positive territory, boss Matthew Barnes admitted they had slowed. Lidl, which recorded revenues of £4.7 billion in 2015, parted company with UK boss Ronny Gottschlich, replacing him with Christian Hartnagel. Mr Gottschlich spent 16 years at Lidl, including six years as the company's Great Britain CEO, overseeing its meteoric rise from bit-part player to established contender. Blood was also shed in the frozen food aisles. Iceland (the country) launched legal action against Iceland (the supermarket) over the use of its name. The Nordic nation lodged legal papers at the European Union Intellectual Property Office with the goal of ''ensuring the right of Icelandic companies to use the word 'Iceland' in relation to their goods and services''. The store group responded by sending a " high-level delegation" to Reykjavik in the hope of thawing relations with the Icelandic government.

Last week, the shirt, which carries the words "Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter", was removed from online sale by retailer Walmart after it received a complaint from the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP). However, Amazon declined to comment and continues to sell the product, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday. According to an open letter from FOP, the union said the shirt was "offensive" and appealed to Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos to support it in "increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve." "Commercialising our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another," Chunk Canterbury, president of the FOP, wrote in the letter. "I write to urge you to prohibit the use of the Amazon name and website for the retail sale of these products," he added. "Turning a buck on strained relationship will not contribute to the healing process," he said. Canterbury described Amazon "as a pretty liberal marketer" and thought that the shirt might inspire violence against members of law enforcement, according to the Guardian. The shirt was offered by Old Glory Merchandise, a third party vendor. Its owner Glenn Morelli told CNN that the shirt was not "a big seller at all" and that they don't like to offend anybody. "You have to sell all different kinds of shirts. It's hard to make everybody happy," he added. --IANS in/ (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Facebook Live The social network’s live video platform went public in January 2016, building on the momentum generated by Meerkat and Twitter’s Periscope in 2015. By September 2016, Facebook Live was being used by 51% of the top 500 brands as ranked by their Facebook followers, according to analytics firm Socialbakers. The service is also widely used by celebrities, government agencies and everyday consumers. It has eclipsed its competitors and spawned imitators even within the Facebook portfolio, as Instagram launched a live video service in December 2016. No. 2. Pinterest Video Advertising In Q2 2016 Pinterest unveiled a video ad platform after a long testing phase. In announcing the move, Mike Bidgoli, Pinterest’s product manager for monetization, told Forbes: “There are a lot of places where users can watch video but can’t take the next step to learn more about a product or buy it—on Pinterest, people are here to do that. Video on Pinterest is not just about offering marketers views, but about offering action.” Bidgoli added that 55% of people on Pinterest use the platform to shop for products, compared with 12% on other social networks. No. 3. Twitter Sports Streaming We don’t know how much Twitter paid for live streaming rights to 10 National Football League (NFL) Thursday Night Football games, or how much ad revenue the company stands to generate from the deal. We also don’t have detailed viewership metrics beyond a few vague stats that drew mixed reactions from sponsors. What we do know is that Twitter is staking its future on the NFL and, more broadly, on other live video deals. It has signed partnerships to carry full Major League Baseball and National Hockey League games, as well as live highlights from the English Premier League. These agreements amount to Twitter’s transformation from a text-based social network to a video-centric media company. No. 4. Walmart’s Vudu Movies on Us Retail giant Walmart unveiled this service in October 2016 as a free, ad-supported streaming version of its Vudu digital storefront. Vudu Movies on Us does not carry new releases and specializes in time-tested Hollywood blockbusters such as "Mad Max" and "School of Rock." Its business model is a tacit acknowledgment of shifting consumer preferences, with increasing numbers of people choosing to stream on demand rather than rent or purchase digital copies. Similarly, the ad-supported nature of the service indicates that monetizing via subscriptions is challenging, especially for a company that doesn’t produce original content or carry first-run movie or TV programming. No. 5. DirecTV Now Launched in November 2016, this service from AT&T’s DirecTV is the latest attempt to capture cord-cutters by offering them a programming mix they might get on a traditional platform, only in standalone digital mode. Like the SlingTV service from competitor Dish Network and Sony’s Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now provides access to live TV channels for monthly subscription fees that vary according to the number of channels and options. These services will have even more competition in 2017 when Hulu and YouTube introduce their own live TV offerings. —Paul Verna New in eMarketer PRO This Week Forecast: US Wearables Users, 2016-2020, with Breakouts by Age, Gender and Generation Report: US Digital Ad Spending Benchmarks by Industry, H2 Update Statpack: Canada – Consumer Time and Advertiser Dollars Report: UK Digital Trends for 2017 Not a PRO subscriber?

(AP) — Three of the boys in Kim Currie's Parenting and Child Development class are rocking crying newborns. The babies are actually RealCare Infant Simulators — high-tech dolls that cry, burp, slurp, giggle, and send data to Currie to analyze for grades. Students wear wristbands that connect with a sensor on the dolls' back, ensuring that only they can care for them, and care is required. If the dolls are left in a hot car, it's recorded. If they're shaken, it's recorded. If they're not fed, changed, or held correctly, it's recorded. This makes them the most realistic babies Currie or her students have ever worked with. "This is my first experience with the simulators. The benefits are that the students are coming back talking, saying that they don't want to have a baby, and that's a benefit because we don't want teenage parenting, we'd rather them wait until they're out of school and established before they start having babies," Currie said. These are not bags of flour. After taking the dolls home over the weekend, many of the students said the babies woke them up multiple times during the night and wouldn't stop crying. They joked that it was "not normal" and "not fair." Jamarius Wall took his baby to Alamance Crossing, Four Seasons Mall, Tanger Outlets, Sheetz, Cookout and Walmart, and says he got a taste of what it must be like to be a teen dad. "I went everywhere, and that baby cried so much," he said. "People looked at me like I was a single father. I got so many dirty looks. I lost so much sleep. I woke up the next day, and my arms were so sore (from holding it). My wrists hurt." The biggest mistake students made was not supporting the baby's head correctly because the dolls carry some weight, but as one student put it, "At two o'clock in the morning, you ain't worried about no head support." Leeann Williams said she felt trapped by the doll. "I only had it for one day, but I realized I couldn't do anything for myself," she said. "I'm moving houses right now, so all weekend I was moving boxes and stuff, and I couldn't do that because the baby kept crying." Currie told the students that balancing a baby with other daily chores is something you have to get used to as a parent. "You have to multitask. That's what you do as a parent. Sometimes you'll be at home, and your baby starts crying, and you're cooking or washing clothes or washing dishes or maybe something else, or you may be called in to go to work. What do you have to do? You have to make arrangements for your child," Currie told them. The experience certainly contained a hard dose of reality, but Currie says some of the students did very well, earning 90 out of 100 points. One of those students says she had some experience from caring for her infant nephew — and even those who didn't do well say they were able to fit in what they had learned in the weeks leading up to the capstone project. The Cummings class also covers pregnancy, nutrition, and a broad curriculum on early childhood development up to 6 years old. While the students might swear they'll never have children now, Currie hopes the class has prepared them for the day when the time is right. ___ Information from: Times-News, http://www.thetimesnews.com Tags General News Parenting Child Development Child And Teen Health Health Relationships Lifestyle Locations North Carolina United States North America Popular This Week WXII, DirecTV at an impasse as station pulled from carrier Warrants detail allegations of sexual activity involving Davie County teacher, student Police ID 22-year-old Taco Bell employee found dead in King bathroom Police ID body found on Peters Creek Parkway in Winston-Salem Winston-Salem police close off apartment building off Hanes Mall Boulevard, SWAT team deployed DirecTV, WXII dispute continues; Station says provider doesn't want to pay enough More restaurants, office and retail to open in Hanes Mall Boulevard area SUV ends up in house after driver loses control of her vehicle Police: Armed robbers made off with cash from Burke Street Pizza Winston-Salem 18-year-old charged with 15 felonies Poll Which basketball team do you think will have the best season?

Last week, the shirt, which carries the words “Bulletproof: Black Lives Matter”, was removed from online sale by retailer Walmart after it received a complaint from the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP). However, Amazon declined to comment and continues to sell the product, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday. According to an open letter from FOP, the union said the shirt was “offensive” and appealed to Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos to support it in “increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve.” “Commercialising our differences will not help our local police and communities to build greater trust and respect for one another,” Chunk Canterbury, president of the FOP, wrote in the letter. “I write to urge you to prohibit the use of the Amazon name and website for the retail sale of these products,” he added. “Turning a buck on strained relationship will not contribute to the healing process,” he said. Canterbury described Amazon “as a pretty liberal marketer” and thought that the shirt might inspire violence against members of law enforcement, according to the Guardian. The shirt was offered by Old Glory Merchandise, a third party vendor. Its owner Glenn Morelli told CNN that the shirt was not “a big seller at all” and that they don’t like to offend anybody. “You have to sell all different kinds of shirts. It’s hard to make everybody happy,” he added. –IANS in/ Tags FOP law enforcement police sell CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts US dollar rallies on jobs data Jan 6th, 201707 New York, Jan 7 (IANS) The US dollar rose against other major currencies as investors were digesting the...

(Stephanie Bechara, News 13) By Stephanie Bechara and Jeff Allen, Reporters Last Updated: Monday, December 26, 2016, 10:54 PM EST Osceola County is stepping up to support more than 250 people that were displaced due to a hotel fire. 47 families, 178 individuals in need Volunteers like Mark Sheppard lending a hand Dozens of families now living in hotels Want to donate? Click here So far, 47 families and 178 individuals are still in need, according to the Osceola Council on Aging. Each family has been assessed by case managers with the help of the county, the Hope Center and the Red Cross. Moving forward, they're looking at re-housing plans for the next seven days. The Red Cross is helping clear out bag after bag of toiletries, clothes and toys at Kissimmee Middle School. The bags are on their way to the Osceola Council on Aging, where victims of the Dec. 23 Unno Hotel fire are temporarily staying. Some of these donations made it there thanks to people like Mark Sheppard. "I just do it out of the kindness of my heart, trying to help other people," he said. For the past three days Sheppard has been standing at the Walmart in St. Cloud collecting items. Sheppard writes on one of Osceola County's community Facebook pages to set up pick up or drop off locations and times. He then makes the trip to Kissimmee to deliver the donations collected. "It's all worth it, every last little minute," he said.

"It's not about me. It's not about my health. It's about giving to people that are in need. It's giving to other people," he said. Out of the 80 hotel units that were evacuated, 30 of them were destroyed, and families may soon be able to return to the unaffected units. "So those families, the 30, have to find somewhere else to go," said Red Cross Disaster Program Manager Steve Thompson. "But it's possible the other 50 could return. It's just a matter of when code enforcement does a final inspection and says it's safe to return." Fire erupted at the Unno Boutique Hotel on U.S. 192 (Sky 13) Sheppard is happy to hear organizations like the Hope Center and the Osceola Council on Aging are making a plan toward permanent housing for each individual family. "Everybody comes together. They fight for each other," Sheppard said. Due to the community's outpour, the shelter is at capacity when it comes to material things. For those who still want to help, they are encouraged to donate money through the county's official website. So far, $3,000 has been collected in gift cards and $18,000 in cash through the county's website. For info on donating, click here to visit Osceola County's PayPal. Meanwhile, dozens of families displaced after the fire are now living in hotels. Thanks to community support and donations, those families were able to go to those hotels on Monday night after spending the holiday weekend in a shelter. The Pacheco family went to a hotel that doesn't allow pets, so on Monday night they had to hand their Yorkies over to animal services, who will care for the dogs for now.   "I know it's for the best," said Josh Pacheco. "I know my kids will have a place to lay their head at and I know the dogs will be taken care of, so it's just a step in the process that we've got to take."   The families will have their hotels for one week while community leaders work to find them permanent housing.

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161226005039/en/ The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global self-checkout terminals marketfor 2017-2021. To determine the market size, the study considers revenue generated based on the total number of unit shipments and the new installations of self-checkout terminals in retail outlets. Region wise, the Americas led the global retail self-checkout market with a market share of 44.25% in terms of unit shipments (2016 figures). With retail store chain like Walmart, Kroger, and Safeway expanding their stores to many locations spread across the globe, the demand for self-checkout terminals has been increasing. Europe occupies the next largest market share, followed by APAC and MEA. NCR is the market leader in the global retail self-checkout market with a share of almost 70%. The company provides solutions designed to improve the selling productivity, checkout processes, and service levels. These solutions include retail-oriented technologies such as point-of-sale (POS) terminals and software, barcode scanners, and self-service kiosks. Toshiba Tec and Fujitsu are the next biggest players in this market. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=55325 Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global retail self-checkout market: Conversion of checkout lanes from assisted to self-service “The increasing conversion from assisted to self-service checkout across the retail sector globally has resulted in increased convenience and reduced time spent during checkout, which benefits both the consumers as well as retailers. Additionally, this move also helps increase the space inside stores, as these self-checkout terminals occupy a relatively small floor space,” says Poonam Saini, one of the lead analysts at Technavio for retail systems research. These self-checkout terminals are especially helpful to ease waiting times during peak hours when customer influx is very high. Consumers can checkout and pay for their own products, giving more hands on the floor to help with sales and queries. This ensures better consumer interactions, leading to a more satisfied and loyal customer base. Thus, self-checkout counters are expected to be in extremely high demand during the market forecast period. Growing retail industry The swiftly growing retail industry has been witnessing the fastest adoption of the self-checkout terminals. In June 2016, CBE, which offers retail technology, installed self-checkout terminals in independent retail stores across the UK and Ireland. Additionally, self-checkout terminals are constantly upgraded with better technologies to keep up with the evolving needs of the consumers, which also brings in a constant stream of revenue to the market. Developing countries in APAC, such as India and China are the expansive growth in the self-checkout market due to an increasing number of modern format retail stores. Developed economies like Europe are also creating a constant steady demand. With more convenience stores adopting self-checkout terminals, the self-checkout terminal market will continue to display healthy growth rates through the forecast period. Technological advances aiding higher efficiency Consumer demands are constantly evolving and their demands will vary accordingly. Vendors in the market space constantly upgrade their technology and add innovative features to establish a permanent foothold in the market. Retailers have been trying to leverage these new innovative technologies to benefit their own businesses by improving the customer experience. “NCR, one of the key vendors in the market, announced the launch of FastLane SelfServ checkout terminals that are designed to offer faster and efficient service to shoppers. These terminals are designed to accept multiple bills at once and recycle up to eight different coin denominations and six different note denominations. Another notable mention is EasyFlow, by ITAB Shop Concept. It is a self-checkout system that works by offering barcode-free identification of goods services. Such innovations will definitely attract more customers to this relatively new market,” says Poonam.

The babies are actually RealCare Infant Simulators — high-tech dolls that cry, burp, slurp, giggle, and send data to Currie to analyze for grades. Students wear wristbands that connect with a sensor on the dolls' back, ensuring that only they can care for them, and care is required. If the dolls are left in a hot car, it's recorded. If they're shaken, it's recorded. If they're not fed, changed, or held correctly, it's recorded. This makes them the most realistic babies Currie or her students have ever worked with. "This is my first experience with the simulators. The benefits are that the students are coming back talking, saying that they don't want to have a baby, and that's a benefit because we don't want teenage parenting, we'd rather them wait until they're out of school and established before they start having babies," Currie said. These are not bags of flour. After taking the dolls home over the weekend, many of the students said the babies woke them up multiple times during the night and wouldn't stop crying. They joked that it was "not normal" and "not fair." Jamarius Wall took his baby to Alamance Crossing, Four Seasons Mall, Tanger Outlets, Sheetz, Cookout and Walmart, and says he got a taste of what it must be like to be a teen dad. "I went everywhere, and that baby cried so much," he said. "People looked at me like I was a single father. I got so many dirty looks. I lost so much sleep. I woke up the next day, and my arms were so sore (from holding it). My wrists hurt." The biggest mistake students made was not supporting the baby's head correctly because the dolls carry some weight, but as one student put it, "At two o'clock in the morning, you ain't worried about no head support." Leeann Williams said she felt trapped by the doll. "I only had it for one day, but I realized I couldn't do anything for myself," she said. "I'm moving houses right now, so all weekend I was moving boxes and stuff, and I couldn't do that because the baby kept crying." Currie told the students that balancing a baby with other daily chores is something you have to get used to as a parent. "You have to multitask. That's what you do as a parent. Sometimes you'll be at home, and your baby starts crying, and you're cooking or washing clothes or washing dishes or maybe something else, or you may be called in to go to work. What do you have to do? You have to make arrangements for your child," Currie told them. The experience certainly contained a hard dose of reality, but Currie says some of the students did very well, earning 90 out of 100 points. One of those students says she had some experience from caring for her infant nephew — and even those who didn't do well say they were able to fit in what they had learned in the weeks leading up to the capstone project. The Cummings class also covers pregnancy, nutrition, and a broad curriculum on early childhood development up to 6 years old. While the students might swear they'll never have children now, Currie hopes the class has prepared them for the day when the time is right.

The project, which started nearly six years ago, constitutes a $90 million investment. (Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer) Top 10 local news stories of 2016 Editor's note: The Times-Call is counting down the Top 10 local news stories of 2016 as chosen by newsroom staff. Readers also voted for their top picks. 10. ColoRODans ends annual Longmont Rod festival 9. City Council grapples with marijuana issues 8. Sunset Bridge replacement bridge opens 7. Dynel lane convicted, sentenced to 100 years 6. Huge water rate hikes for Longmont 5. Village at the Peaks opens It's been quite a year for Longmont's newest shopping center, the 75-acre, 39-store Village at the Peaks. The $90 million development celebrated its grand opening in June of this year nearly two years after its Aug. 2014 groundbreaking. Advertisement A week's worth of events, activities and giveaways also saw the arrival of another anchor tenant, Sam's Club. The Walmart-owned membership warehouse opened its doors at 8 a.m. June 30, the 25th retailer in the mall to do so. The opening came after a delay that, along with the 11-month postponing of Whole Foods' opening, nearly caused the city to miss a $636,277 payment on bonds it issued to help fund the project. Longmont's council in March OK'd the dipping into property tax revenues to cover the more than $500,000 gap left by lower-than-expected revenue from the Twin Peaks Metro District, created by the absence of the two large retailers. In the midst of the city payment drama, Village at the Peaks tenant Sports Authority announced its bankruptcy filing in March. (The city said at the time the closure would not negatively impact expected tax revenue.) The sporting goods store closed this summer and is still empty, one of the few vacancies in the center that is otherwise 95 percent leased. Readers' picks 10. Longmont City Council continues to grapple with marijuana 9. Whole Foods opens at Village at the Peaks after 11-month-delay 8. 2 cyclist deaths in Longmont 7. Sunset bridge reopening 6. Longmont parents arrested after malnourished son hospitalized 5. The end of Boulder County's Tanaka farms The long-awaited natural grocer opened in mid-December to a flurry of activity. And more tenants are set to follow in the coming six months: Boulder Cleaners, Pho Huong Viet, Phenix Salon, Tueday Morning and La Madeleine are all scheduled to be open by summer 2017. In late October, developer Allen Ginsborg of NewMark Merrill said the center was already drawing 40,000 visitors per week, and he expected that number to increase "significantly" once Whole Foods was open for business.

MUST CREDIT: Photo for The Washington Post by Michael Noble Jr. Michael Noble Jr., For The Washington Post .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........MUFREESBORO, Tenn. – It was here, in this midsize college town in the dead center of Tennessee, that a right-wing effort to ban Islamic law found one of its first sponsors. Here, too, a congressman co-sponsored a plan to “defund Muslim ‘refugees’ ” and local residents sued to block construction of the only mosque, a fight that ended at the Supreme Court. The town’s Muslims carried on through all of that, raising their children, saying their prayers, teaching at college, filling people’s prescriptions and filling their tanks, contributing to the civic life in a city of 126,000. They felt the familiar grief and fear of reprisal last year when a Muslim man killed four Marines in Chattanooga, Tennessee, 90 minutes away. Now Donald Trump – a man who has repeatedly cast doubt on the patriotism of Muslims – is the president-elect, and he has selected a national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has called Islam a “cancer.” And a deep unease has again seeped into the daily life of many here in this Muslim community of about 1,500. There has been a smattering of post-election harassment and insults – at schools, in parking lots, on the road – but nothing to take to the police or put Murfreesboro back in the national headlines. Advertisement Continue reading “Right now, we’re hoping that it’s going to be calm,” said Saleh Sbenaty, an engineering professor at Middle Tennessee State University and one of the founders of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. “But we don’t know if it’s the calm before the storm or the calm after the storm.” Murfreesboro is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country and an increasingly diverse one. Muslim and Christian students go to school and play sports together; their families patronize the same restaurants and stores. Residents variously describe the town as a proud example of Southern hospitality, a growing “melting pot,” a suburb of “little blue dot” Nashville and the “buckle on the Bible Belt.” Its downtown with the old courthouse and Confederate-soldiers memorial yields to strip malls and chain stores, new housing developments and old cotton fields, and the university, with its 20,000 undergraduates. You can drive to the popular shawarma joint for some Arab cuisine, then get back in the car and hear syndicated talk-show host Michael Savage on the radio wondering how many veterans are in jail “for having the guts to kill an Islamo-fascist.” Among the town’s couple hundred places of worship are 59 Baptist churches, including an Arabic Baptist church as well as Grace Baptist, whose deacon in 2010 greeted the construction of the new mosque next door by erecting 23 huge white crosses on the road. There are people such as Abdou Kattih, a pharmacist at Walgreens and one of the mosque’s founders, and Jason Bennett, an evangelical advocate for the homeless and a onetime mosque opponent; the two now consider each other close friends. There are people such as the self-described “right-wing Southern Baptist,” shopping at Bullseye Gun, Gear and Pawn on a recent day, who is certain that Muslims think they have the right “to kill you and take your wife as a sex slave.” Advertisement Continue reading The man declined to give his name, he said, because he employs a number of Muslims in his health-sector company anyway and did not want them to know what he thinks. He still goes to cookouts and ballgames with them, he said. On the other hand, said James McCarroll Jr., a pastor at First Baptist Church, “we’re seeing more of an acceptance, a lot of it being spurred by the university having a large community of Muslims.” The day after the election, flowers were left on the mosque’s doorstep, and a stranger approached the new imam, an Egyptian, at the Walmart and welcomed him to town. Nothing seems to illustrate the complicated attitudes better than Tammy and Ahmed Ragab’s family – three conservative Muslims and three evangelical Christians sharing a house. The couple bought a home with Tammy’s parents five years ago. To the Ragabs, Trump is a threat personified. They see him as a man whose policies and rhetoric have emboldened people to attack and vilify Muslims, including their 12-year-old daughter, who they said was threatened at school the week after the election. Tammy’s parents and sister voted for him. In five years of diverging viewpoints and lifestyles – the couples cook separately, watch different news channels and celebrate different holidays – a simple harmony has prevailed, they said, because they love each other. Tammy’s parents eat pork, go to church and keep “a whole cabinet of Jesus statues” in the house, Tammy said. They also remind their granddaughter to pray five times a day and help her pick out clothes to match her hijab. Advertisement Continue reading “But at the same time, when it comes to the Trump issues, she’ll say, ‘Oh, he only said that one time,’ ” Tammy said of her mother. “They don’t believe he’s going to do the things he said.” Tammy, who converted to Islam a few years before meeting Ahmed, an Egyptian immigrant, implores her mother to consider “the things we might face” under Trump. “And she says, ‘Well, that’s your choice.’ “ Her mother, Linda Harmon, said she knows “a lot of people are scared that Muslims are going to have to register and get shipped back.” But, she added, “even a lot of Muslims want people vetted. … He’s not going to send any back that aren’t causing any trouble, I don’t think.” Kattih, the pharmacist, remembers a day a few years back when a customer came in to fill a prescription and said, “Did you hear those damn Muslims want to build a church in town?” Kattih, who immigrated as an adult from Syria, told her that he is a Muslim. His skin, like many of the Arab immigrants in the town, is just as pale as the whites who can trace their American lineage back generations. The exchange resulted in a moment of shock, a hurried exit and, a week later, an apology. “I didn’t know you were one of them,” he remembered her saying the next time she came in. “I just wanted to apologize. If you need anything, call me.” The incident shaped his outlook, he said: Maybe people just don’t know enough about each other. Last year, Kattih founded Murfreesboro Muslim Youth, a community service group that aims to make Muslims visible and familiar to people who would not dare visit the mosque. “What people in America are failing to realize: Most immigrant Muslims lived under dictatorship. Fear is embedded in their skin. So when they’re afraid, they retract,” Kattih said. “And I think that’s the opposite of what needs to happen. You need to stretch out your hand to allies. And you’ll be surprised what hands reach out back.” Advertisement Continue reading A week after the election, the group’s members, most in their late teens or early 20s, gathered in the town square and handed out flowers to strangers. Some people from other faiths joined in. On Thanksgiving, the students cooked 48 meals and gave them to families in need. When students hosted a meet-a-Muslim event on the university campus earlier this year, “most people came up to us and said they had never met a Muslim,” said Basant Salem, 18, who moved to Murfreesboro five years ago from Morgantown, West Virginia, when her father became a genetics professor at the university. “We don’t have to change their views,” said Basant’s sister, Samar, 21, who once brought cookies to mosque protesters, “but just make them aware that we aren’t what they think we are.” What worries and perplexes many Muslims and their friends here is what lies beneath the surface. What impact will Trump have as president when distrust of Muslims already exists? Bennett, director of the Murfreesboro Cold Patrol, used to belong to an evangelical church opposed to the mosque, which protesters and politicians accused of supporting terrorism. Vandals struck the building site three times, at one point setting construction equipment on fire. Bennett changed his thinking after he met Kattih and other Muslims also involved in providing social services to those in need. He said the fear and the false pronouncements – that Muslims worship a different God, are taught to lie, or use mosques as jihadist training centers – are as pervasive in the town’s Sunday sermons and Bible studies as they were five years ago. “All that stuff is still there,” Bennett said. “When policies start to take effect after January, or start to move, I think we’re going to see some pretty rough times again.” McCarroll, who leads a predominantly black church in Murfreesboro, echoed that concern. “I think we could see people displaced,” he said. “Right now it’s just rhetoric, but I think the town is really holding its breath.” Advertisement Continue reading Ask locals about the churches that oppose Islam and many point first to the World Outreach Church, the largest megachurch in town. “We have a duty to investigate anyone under the banner of Islam,” the pastor, Allen Jackson, declared at a hearing on the mosque plan back in 2010. The church declined to comment on Jackson’s view now, but a man who worships there said the pastor continues to view Islam through a prism of holy war: “He thinks it’s biblical.” The men and women who once sued and protested against the mosque come in to fill prescriptions from Kattih, buy doughnuts or cigarettes from Essam Mohammed at the Quik Mart, or attend one of Sbenaty’s engineering classes. They trade pleasantries. They’re polite. They continue on their way. Howard Wall puts it like this: “If I have to go the store to get a Coke or something, we talk. I’m nice to them, they’re nice to me.” Wall and his wife, Sally, are local developers who were among those who sued to stop the mosque construction, litigation that was resolved when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case. The couple has no plans to take up another fight. They also think it won’t be necessary, because Trump will limit the arrival of more Muslims. Murfreesboro doesn’t need “to have a lot of Muslims,” said Sally Wall. “I think they can stay where they are and we stay where we are.” But there’s more tolerance because of the public acrimony over the mosque, said city council member Bill Shacklett. “I wish some of the things hadn’t happened. But the one thing it has done is compel people to open their hearts and minds to be drawn toward each other . . . get out and flesh out your faith with different people,” Shacklett said, adding that both Muslims and Christians have started to do that. “Maybe that wouldn’t have happened if we hadn’t had the spotlight put on us for all of that.” muslims Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Backlash greets plans for Muslim cemeteries across US – Apr 25, 2016 Clinton is trying to woo Muslim voters; they could make all the difference – Sep 8, 2016 Ohio State student identified as campus attacker, nearly a dozen hospitalized – Nov 28, 2016 Long Island woman charged with fabricating hijab attack story – Dec 15, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

New Rock Island economic developer sees future for Walmart site Jennifer DeWitt jdewitt@qctimes.com Jennifer DeWitt Dec 26, 2016 Buy Now Jennifer DeWitt, QUAD-CITY TIMES Chandler Poole, Rock Island's new community and economic development director, plans to re-engage neighbors, developers and community partners with the city in his new role. As Chandler Poole considered different cities to use his development skills, Rock Island stood out because of its residents and their desire to see their community grow. Now, as the city's new community and economic development director, Poole plans to cultivate partnerships to make that growth a reality. Before being hired by Rock Island, Poole spent time hanging out around the city on his own — buying ice cream, seeing the sights and just talking to people he'd meet. While he did the same thing in other U.S. cities where he had job prospects, he said, "this is the only one that had people say 'We want good things to happen. We're proud of our city.'"  Poole sees his job as re-engaging residents, developers, companies and others with the city."The department is not just about economic development," he said, "it also is about community development. "That's what attracted me — the pieces are all here. They just have not been put together," said Poole, who began his new post Dec. 1. He replaces Jeff Eder, who left in July to become the city administrator in East Peoria, Illinois. A veteran of community development, as well as corporate real estate development, the Madison, Wisconsin, native has been on both sides of the development table. A 1991 University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, Poole majored in economics and history and minored in architectural history.   In his 25-year career, he has represented major companies in real estate dealings in the Twin Cities, worked to attract business to rural North Carolina with the Uptown Shelby Association, and most recently spent eight years as development director in West Lafayette, Indiana, the home of Purdue University. One of the major accomplishments during his tenure was annexing the university into the city. He left that job in April to return to the Midwest and be closer to family. Interim Rock Island City Manager Randy Tweet said city leaders liked Poole's attitude. "He had a lot of successes in his previous job at West Lafayette. He seemed like he'd be a good fit for Rock Island. "One focus we hear all the time is economic development, but his time will be split on community engagement. We have a lot of neighborhood groups, business organizations and a lot of volunteer groups," Tweet said. "We just want to engage all those groups and make Rock Island a better place." Poole joins Rock Island on the heels of a major economic development blow — Walmart's decision to not build on a shovel-ready site on 11th Street.  "Yes, they (resident/the city) wanted it to happen. It didn't. So, OK, how are we going to fix it?" he said. "Yes, $15 million was invested in it. ... It's a buildable site, it is city-owned and that's very attractive to a developer."  Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

New development that resulted cannot be dismissed, he said, pointing out Missman's new headquarters and office park, which also brought a new Black Hawk College outreach center. Likewise, Hill & Valley moved its bakery operations to the Columbia Park area in Rock Island. While the Walmart site, downtown and the city's industrial areas are top of his priority list, he said, so are the city's neighbors. "One of the biggest tasks is engaging residents, churches and other partners. They all play a role." In West Lafayette, Poole helped the city to forge a strong partnership with Purdue in building a new research park, spec buildings, and an ambitious $150 million State Street project, expected to generate $1 billion of new development over the next 20 years. In Rock Island, he sees similar partnerships evolving with Augustana College, Black Hawk College, developers and community organizations.  "When we interviewed him, we all were on the same page on how we want to move the city forward," Tweet said. Poole said he is enthused by his dedicated, 21-person staff, who are a mix of longtime Rock Island employees and new residents. He also has four positions to fill.  "Development can be beneficial to all partners," he said. "You want all to do well."

November and December now account for less than 21 percent of annual retail sales at physical stores, down from a peak of over 25 percent. The shift is in part because people are spreading out their shopping all year, demanding big discounts and spending more on events rather than more stuff. NEW YORK >> The holiday shopping season is losing some of its power in the year’s sales. November and December now account for less than 21 percent of annual retail sales at physical stores, down from a peak of over 25 percent, and experts believe it’ll keep dropping. Those extra percentage points would have translated into an extra $70 billion more in buying for last year, says Michael Niemira, principal at The Retail Economist. The season had steadily gained in importance and peaked in the early ’80s, before the dominance of big discounters like Wal-Mart stalled its growth as shoppers began moving away from department stores. Still, the two-month period held its own through the mid-’90s, when online shopping for deals took hold. “There was a mindset even before online shopping,” said Niemira, whose data goes back to 1967. “But this just accelerated it.” In general, many people are shopping for the holidays all year long now, mirroring the trend for back-to-school items. Heavy discounting has diluted sales, and with big promotions throughout the year, shoppers no longer hold off making their biggest purchases until the holidays. This year, the contentious presidential election delayed some shoppers, and with Christmas falling on a Sunday, stores are expecting a bigger number of last-minute buyers. At a busy Target store in Brick, New Jersey on Saturday morning, many shoppers seemed to be picking up small items to use as stocking stuffers. Others were hoping to find a last-minute deal. “I’m pretty much set for Christmas, so I thought I would come down and see what I could find on sale, like maybe a TV,” Terry Kreft said as she strolled through the store. She has spent about $600 on gifts this year, taking advantage of discounts during the traditional holiday-season shopping days right after Thanksgiving, called “Black Friday” and “Cyber Monday.” “I was pretty much done with my shopping before December got rolling,” Kreft said. But a late rush isn’t expected to make up the difference. “It’s no longer a seasonal business,” said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at consumer research firm NPD Group Inc. “It’s a yearlong investment for the consumer. And retailers need to change. They have to excite shoppers early in the season and later in the season — and all year long.” Here’s what’s behind the shift: SHOPPERS DON’T WAIT TO BUY BIG-TICKET ITEMS: Stores now offer good deals throughout the year on products like TVs and appliances, making waiting until the end of the year less appealing. Deloitte LLP found 30 percent of shoppers planned to wait for holiday sales to buy large gifts, down from 35 percent a year ago. “People are not holding back and waiting because they find a good price for all the things they are looking for,” said Rod Sides, vice chairman of Deloitte. Christopher Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which looks at imports, says he has seen a smoothing out of imports during the pre-holiday shopping season from July to November on key items like apparel, toys and furniture. The shift complicates matters for retailers, which could usually concentrate their efforts on capturing shoppers during the holiday window. HEAVY DISOUNTING: With fierce competition online, particularly from Amazon, stores are constantly trying to outdo each other and even undercutting themselves on prices from the previous year. Shoppers have been trained to demand deals, and won’t break the habit. “The heightened competition being driven by the influence of e-commerce largely is driving prices down on popular holiday items,” said Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track. “Retailers know consumers frequently compare prices on these categories online and are discounting more heavily to drive traffic and sales.” One example: The average price for a TV from Oct. 1 through Tuesday was $829.52, down from $1,009.41 during the same time last year, according to Market Track, which tracked promoted prices across 40 major retailers on over 19,000 TVs. THE RISE OF GIFT CARDS: Shoppers are giving more gift cards as presents, which skews holiday sales figures since they aren’t booked as sales until they’re redeemed. And most cards no longer have an expiration date. This holiday season, gift cards were ranked second as a top gift, behind only clothing, according to NPD. Gift cards sales accounted for about 25.4 percent of holiday expenditures last year, up from 13.5 percent in 2003, according to Goldman Sachs and The Retail Economist. SHOPPERS WANT EXPERIENCES: Major department stores like Macy’s have been seeing shoppers shifting their spending away from traditional merchandise like clothing and more toward gifts that offer experiences like beauty treatments and other services. NPD found 10 percent of holiday shoppers said they planned to give fewer tangible gifts than last year, and 8 percent said they would not give any tangible gifts. Some 14 percent said they will give more experiences as gifts this year than last year, the research group said.

Also traffic and parking hassles may also play a role for shoppers. And I’m one who does not want to deal with that.

Us seasoned shoppers, prefer Amazon and Costco to malls. Mainly youth and tourists/foreign nationals frequent places like Ala Moana Center. Better deals, and less traffic hassles, are to be found elsewhere. Log in to Reply GONEGOLFIN says: December 24, 2016 at 10:23 am Allie, I truly wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

(Source: EBRSO) (WAFB) - Kyandrea Thomas, 34, who was arrested Saturday, December 24 by the New Roads Police Department after allegedly leaving her newborn infant in a trash can at the Walmart in New Roads, was also arrested in 2009 in connection with the hot car death of a toddler.  It's a crime police are calling senseless. "It's a hard thing to work any time of the year, but especially at Christmas time," said Shael Stringer, spokesman for the New Roads Police Department. Police believe Thomas gave birth to a baby girl in the store’s bathroom before throwing her in the trash and leaving the store. Pointe Coupee Chief Deputy Coroner Joe Gannon said had police not arrived when they did, the baby would be dead. "Anytime an infant is left unattended for the first four hours or so of its life, it's life threatening, so I feel that the baby probably had minutes to seconds to live," Gannon said. While it remains unclear why a mother would abandon her child, police say it is not the first time Thomas has been arrested. "I think as the story unfolds, you'll be surprised at what you find," Gannon said. Court records indicate Thomas was linked to another horrible crime in 2009. Thomas and another woman, Michelle Veals, were both indicted on negligent homicides charges in connection with the death of Damiyn McElveen, 3. Criminal charges for the owner of the daycare, Wanda Connor, were dropped in 2012. Thomas and Veals were both sentenced to five years of probation and 10,000 hours of community service after pleading guilty in the case. The two women were employed at a daycare called Wanda's Kids World in Baton Rouge. The young girl was found dead in a van on July 1, 2009 after being left inside for six hours with temperatures outside of 98 degrees.  The daycare was closed following McElveen's death.  Thomas faces attempted second degree murder charges for abandoning her newborn in Walmart. The baby has been given the temporary name, Olivia, by the first responders who rescued her. She is currently listed in stable condition at Our Lady of the Lake Hospital in Baton Rouge. Thomas was transferred from the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison to the Pointe Coupee Parish Jail on Tuesday morning. She is currently incarcerated there awaiting a bond hearing.  RELATED STORIES: Woman arrested after allegedly leaving 6-hour-old infant in trash can in New Roads Walmart Daycare workers appear in hearing in girl's death Copyright 2016 WAFB.

For example, I try to stay away from Kroger on Senior Citizen Discount Day. If I ever forget which day it is, I’m quickly reminded when I pull up and half the parking lot is filled with Buicks. I also stay out of Wal-Mart when Alabama is on a National Championship run. That’s just common sense. Christmas has just become way too materialistic for my taste, so during the holidays, I try to stay away from large retail establishments. Sometimes, however, that is simply not possible. I had to go to Tiger Town this week for a gun. I had to. It was crunch time. This wasn’t the first time I’d mixed Christmas and guns—nope, not at all—not by a long shot, pun intended. Santa brought me a Daisy BB gun one time when I was a boy. Thankfully, it wasn’t a Red Ryder, or I may have shot my eye out. Guns were definitely in the mix during the three Christmases I spent in Iraq. The second and third time around was just fine, but that first Christmas in Iraq, Christmas of 2003, was something very special. We’d only been in Iraq for a few weeks, after spending three weeks in Kuwait, but it had been an eventful few weeks. We spent our first month at Forward Operating Base Pacesetter, near the town of Samarra. On December 13, Saddam Hussein was captured near Tikrit, which was only about 30 kilometers from where we were. Word spread quickly that we’d be going home soon, but history tells us that didn’t happen. Word also spread quickly that musician Ted Nugent had vowed to give a million dollars to any soldier or civilian who captured or killed Saddam Hussein. I helped spread that word after reading about it. My platoon sergeant had read it, too, and told anyone who’d listen all about it. After a brief discussion, we discovered that we’d read it at the same place, and that place was on the wall of a porta-potty in Kuwait. That stunk, and no one became an instant millionaire. On or about Dec 21, we came under a rocket attack for the first time. Fortunately, they weren’t very close, but most of us were newbies to this and spent much of the night in bunkers. We were cold, wet, and miserable, but we were safe. We were at war; of this, there was no doubt. Christmas was very special that year. We didn’t know what to expect. We didn’t know how long we’d be there. We didn’t know if we’d all make it home safely, and sadly some of us didn’t. So, we just did the very best we could and had a Christmas to remember. Our chow hall was an old bombed out hangar at the end of an airstrip, but it might have well have been a five star restaurant. Special food and drinks were flown in for the special occasion. Our cooks always did an exceptional job, but they outdid themselves on Christmas day. We had prime rib, ham, mashed potatoes, yams, green beans, and so much more. I had the honor of joining my fellow officers and senior noncommissioned officers in the longstanding military tradition of serving the troops, and I did so with my M16 slung over my shoulder. It really was a magical Christmas. As a Believer, I was able to focus on my faith and hone in on the real meaning of Christmas without all the materialistic “brouhohoho.” There may not have been peace on earth, but there was peace amongst us. We were an incredibly tight unit, and we were, for all intents and purposes, family. Of that, there was no doubt. The gun I picked up at Tiger Town wasn’t a rifle, a shotgun, or a pistol. The gun I picked up was pink and shot Nerf bullets. It was for a sweet little girl—a little girl I’d do anything for, including going to a retail establishment the week before Christmas. Why? Well, because she’s just that special. Of that, there is no doubt. Jody Fuller is from Opelika. He is a comic, speaker, writer and soldier with three tours of duty in Iraq.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Peter Chianca: 16 great 2016 albums you may have missed Thursday Dec 22, 2016 at 2:15 PM By Peter Chianca pchianca@wickedlocal.comMore Content Now   OK, repeat after me: Beyonce is great, but you cant listen to Lemonade 24 hours a day. (Well, you can, but it would be exhausting.) Instead, I recommend checking out one, or all, of these great, mostly grownup-friendly 2016 rock and pop releases that may have flown under your radar. Painkillers, Brian Fallon. The last Gaslight Anthem album, 2014s Get Hurt, seemed to lack some of the conviction Jersey rocker Fallon had brought to the bands previous records, so its great to hear him soar again on his solo debut, chockablock with rock anthems and rough-hewn road ballads. Highlight: A Wonderful Life Stay Gold, Butch Walker. Following Afraid of Ghosts, last years more somber tribute to his late father, Walker is back to his usual brand of rowdy guitar pop/rock, to great effect. The 80s references resonate with those of us facing down middle age, even as raucous arrangements and Walkers wry confidence keep it all sounding fresh. Highlight: Wilder in the Heart Life in the Dark, The Felice Brothers. With their archaic folkie sensibility and oddball references, the Felice Brothers have always sounded like a band out of time -- frontman Ian Felice would fit in just as well in a dustbowl shanty town as a Walmart parking lot. Thats truer than ever on their latest, a reeling, roiling folk-rock State of the Union. Highlight: Plunder Leave Me Alone, Hinds. One gets the impression that Ana Perrote, Ade Martinand and Amber Grimbergen, the Spanish indie rockers in Hinds, may not actually speak English, and also might be learning their instruments as they go. Who cares? The sloppiness is part of their garage-rock charm, making for a fun, freaky ode to wild abandon. Highlight: Castigadas En El Granero Wild Stab, I Dont Cares. Juliana Hatfield fans hoping shed get at least half the spotlight in this collaboration might be disappointed: Replacements frontman Paul Westerberg is clearly at the center of Wild Stab. But Hatfield falls into a natural rhythm as Westerbergs backup in an intimate, loosey-goosey collection thats replete with the humor and droll pathos youd expect from this pair. Highlight: Sorry For Tomorrow Night Hold On! The James Hunter Six. Hunters contribution to the esteemed pantheon of albums whose titles end with exclamation points is more than worthy.The 54-year-old Brit has been perfecting his brand of blue-eyed R&B soul for a long time, and it shows: This honking collection of soul-stirrers is smooth as silk. Highlight: (Baby) Hold On Im Alone, No Youre Not, Joseph. Blend the sweep of Adele with the intensity of Florence + The Machine, and youll have something approximating Josephs stellar second album -- although the Closner sisters who make up the band put their own stamp on the proceedings with their almost hymn-like harmonies. Highlight: White Flag Another Other, Kingsley Flood. Their latest full-length, the most accomplished and timely album of the bands career, showcases frontman Naseem Khuris unique rasp and the bands now-perfected melange of rock, punk and Americana energy -- while at the same time tackling tough questions about what it means to be an American. Its their Darkness on the Edge of Town. Highlight: Another Other Side Pony, Lake Street Dive. Masters of harmony-laden soul jangle, Lake Street Dives follow-up to their 2014 breakout Bad Self Portraits is every bit as catchy, and even more endearing. Frontwoman Rachael Price and company delve into disco beats and R&B stomp as they shimmy and wink through some spectacularly self-deprecating lyrics. Highlight: Spectacular Failure Music for Outcasts, Leland Sundries. The Brooklyn-based quintet populates its first full-length LP with guitar-fueled rockers, wild psychobilly and no shortage of Dylanesque winking, all amid their typical cutting sense of humor and literary array of flesh-and-blood characters. Highlight: Stripper From Bensonhurst Good Grief, Lucius. Theres so much girl-group goodness going on in Good Grief that its almost hard to keep track -- better to just sit back and enjoy the bands mesmerizing mix of luminous alt-pop, echoey harmonies and synthy splendor. Highlight: Better Look Back More Rain, M. Ward. Best known among some circles as the Him to Zooey Deschanels She in the tad-too-twee duo She & Him, Wards solo work is where he really shines. The latest example is More Rain, where his tremulous vocals and virtuosic guitar chops serve up a typically eclectic mix of doo-wop lullabies, roiling honky tonk and hypnotic alt-folk. Highlight: Time Wont Wait Emotions and Math, Margaret Glaspy. Maybe the best album title of the year, and fortunately, the songs on the California singer-songwriters debut live up to it -- Glaspys menacing drawl and uncompromising lyrics combine with just the right amount of guitar crunch to make for a raw but eminently listenable take on modern love (such that it is). Highlight: You and I On Waves, Noam Weinstein. The quirk-rock troubadours latest offers a healthy dose of LOL lyrics -- but its also a surprisingly soulful and sometimes heartbreaking take on love, life and whatever comes next. Its depth and beauty will sneak up on you between laughs. Highlight: It Comes In Waves Arranging Time, Pete Yorn. Yorn is back with his patented brand of languid rock (lang-rock?), with just enough grungy echo and electronic flourishes to propel his expressive croon and introspective lyrics to suitably moody heights. Highlight: Screaming at the Setting Sun Sea of Noise, St. Paul & The Broken Bones. Were just crumbling lightposts in a sea of noise, sings Broken Bones frontman Paul Janeway in his meticulous falsetto, one of many gripping images awash with lush strings and smooth brass on the bands sophomore collection of disco funk and midnight soul. Highlight: Burning Rome   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services E-edition Online Forms Archives Market Place Classifieds Real Estate Automotive Coupons Shopping Community Info California Road Report Oregon Road Report Sister Publications The Gridley Herald Mount Shasta Herald Dunsmuir News The Weed Press Medford Mail-Tribune Ashland Daily-Tribune The SuperSaver Advertiser Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Miracle on the Old Lincoln Highway Salena Zito, Washington Examiner December 26, 2016 BEDFORD, Pa. â Nestled in the picturesque Allegheny Mountains half way between this Bedford County seat and the charming little village of Everett, Pa., Santa Claus came to town right before Christmas Day. At least to those who had layaways at the local Walmart. It is a story of poise, generosity and gratitude, one filled with layaways, community service and creating education opportunities; it is void of the stereotypical political resentments attributed to rural Americans since this election began last year. It all started with a phone call from someone who was calling for 'Santa B' on Dec. 1, said Ryan Kennedy, the store manager. The person said they wanted to know what it would cost to pay off the entire store's layaway items and when the pick-up date was, he explained. The Walmart is located equidistant between the two towns, explained Michael Corle, a rural renaissance man, who despite his preference for shopping local, often finds himself with his wife and three kids taking advantage of the bargains and the convenience of the big discount chain department store.

To us regular folk the number means very little, but we're talking the DJIA and why investors shouldn't focus so much on the 20,000.    What is the Dow? Owned by S&P currently (of S&P 500 notoriety) the Dow Jones is an index, or a way to chart the market status of 30 large public companies in the U.S. , with the S&P covering the 500 largest companies in the country. Both indexes are not just for analysis though, and can be traded through shares of ETFs or 'exchanged-traded funds'.  The Dow is very old, having been put together in 1882 by Charles Dow from the Dow Jones Company and former Editor of the Wall Street Journal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is only second-oldest to the Dow Jones Transportation Average and is one of a handful of indexes created by Dow which also includes the Dow Composite, Dow Utility, Global Dow, and 5 others.  The Dow is watched carefully by investors, and fluctuates according not only to stock performance but external factors such as politics and events that occur globally. The 30 companies on the list change as some companies outgrow others, but the Dow has seen these changes only 51 times since the 1800s. Some companies on the list now include: American Express (AXP), 3M (MMM), Nike (NKE), and Wal-Mart (WMT).   Why Care About 20,000? Well, it seems to be more ceremonial than anything. Most investors love the milestones that come with hitting new highs, and the long history of the Dow has some investors feeling a bit nostalgic, and a little optimistic too.  When President-Elect Trump won the election, Wall Street immediately hunkered down and started to trade. The "rally" or sustained increase in stock prices caused by that trading, showed record increases in the DJIA, S&P, and other market items such as bonds. That trading, plus the Fed's new optimistic outlook on jobs and the U.S economy, has everyone in a rosy mood as the economy feels robust and strong.  However, the Dow only reflects 30 companies, compared to the 500 the S&P index covers, and the much bigger number of companies that actually do business in the U.S. Using the Dow to effectively comment on the status of the entire US economy wouldn't be the most accurate, since its points are price-weighted (better performing stocks count for more), and the interest is compounded (so 1,000 points now means a whole lot less than what it did decades ago). Many investors use the Russell indexes to chart performance of other indexes and ETFs.  So TLDR: The Dow hitting 20,000 is cool, but don't read too much into it.   ABOUT US © New Kapitall Holdings LLC. All rights reserved.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Abigail Hauslohner December 26, 2016 Follow @ahauslohner MURFREESBORO, Tenn. — It was here, in this midsize college town in the dead center of Tennessee, that a right-wing effort to ban Islamic law found one of its first sponsors. Here, too, a congressman co- sponsored a plan to “defund Muslim ‘refugees’ ” and local residents sued to block construction of the only mosque, a fight that ended at the Supreme Court. The town’s Muslims carried on through all of that, raising their children, saying their prayers, teaching at college, filling people’s prescriptions and filling their tanks, contributing to the civic life in a city of 126,000. They felt the familiar grief and fear of reprisal last year when a Muslim man killed four Marines in Chattanooga, 90 minutes away. Now Donald Trump — a man who has repeatedly cast doubt on the patriotism of Muslims — is the president-elect, and he has selected a national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has called Islam a “cancer.” And a deep unease has again seeped into the daily life of many here in this Muslim community of about 1,500. There has been a smattering of post-election harassment and insults — at schools, in parking lots, on the road — but nothing to take to the police or put Murfreesboro back in the national headlines. “Right now, we’re hoping that it’s going to be calm,” said Saleh Sbenaty, an engineering professor at Middle Tennessee State University and one of the founders of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. “But we don’t know if it’s the calm before the storm or the calm after the storm.” (McKenna Ewen,Whitney Leaming,Alice Li/The Washington Post) A ‘melting pot,’ or the‘buckle on the Bible Belt’ Murfreesboro is one of the fastest-growing cities in the country and an increasingly diverse one. Muslim and Christian students go to school and play sports together; their families patronize the same restaurants and stores. Residents variously describe the town as a proud example of Southern hospitality, a growing “melting pot,” a suburb of “little blue dot” Nashville and the “buckle on the Bible Belt.” Its downtown with the old courthouse and Confederate-soldiers memorial yields to strip malls and chain stores, new housing developments and old cotton fields, and the university, with its 20,000 undergraduates. You can drive to the popular shawarma joint for some Arab cuisine, then get back in the car and hear syndicated talk-show host Michael Savage on the radio wondering how many veterans are in jail “for having the guts to kill an Islamo-fascist.” Among the town’s couple hundred places of worship are 59 Baptist churches, including an Arabic Baptist church as well as Grace Baptist, whose deacon in 2010 greeted the construction of the new mosque next door by erecting 23 huge white crosses on the road. There are people such as Abdou Kattih, a pharmacist at Walgreens and one of the mosque’s founders, and Jason Bennett, an evangelical advocate for the homeless and a onetime mosque opponent; the two now consider each other close friends. From left, Annan Chamdin, Brian Mumpower, Hiba Kattih and Stephanie Mumpower chat while preparing meals for the Murfreesboro Muslim Youth group’s Thanksgiving Day event. (Michael Noble Jr. for The Washington Post) There are people such as the self-described “right-wing Southern Baptist,” shopping at Bullseye Gun, Gear and Pawn on a recent day, who is certain that Muslims think they have the right “to kill you and take your wife as a sex slave.” The man declined to give his name, he said, because he employs a number of Muslims in his health-sector company anyway and did not want them to know what he thinks. He still goes to cookouts and ballgames with them, he said. [How fringe anti-Muslim conspiracy theories went mainstream — via Trump] On the other hand, said James McCarroll Jr., a pastor at First Baptist Church, “we’re seeing more of an acceptance, a lot of it being spurred by the university having a large community of Muslims.” The day after the election, flowers were left on the mosque’s doorstep, and a stranger approached the new imam, an Egyptian, at the Walmart and welcomed him to town. Nothing seems to illustrate the complicated attitudes better than Tammy and Ahmed Ragab’s family — three conservative Muslims and three evangelical Christians sharing a house. The couple bought a home with Tammy’s parents five years ago. To the Ragabs, Trump is a threat personified. They see him as a man whose policies and rhetoric have emboldened people to attack and vilify Muslims, including their 12-year-old daughter, who they said was threatened at school the week after the election. Tammy’s parents and sister voted for him. In five years of diverging viewpoints and lifestyles — the couples cook separately, watch different news channels and celebrate different holidays — a simple harmony has prevailed, they said, because they love each other. Tammy’s parents eat pork, go to church and keep “a whole cabinet of Jesus statues” in the house, Tammy said. They also remind their granddaughter to pray five times a day and help her pick out clothes to match her hijab. “But at the same time, when it comes to the Trump issues, she’ll say, ‘Oh, he only said that one time,’ ” Tammy said of her mother. “They don’t believe he’s going to do the things he said.” Tammy, who converted to Islam a few years before meeting Ahmed, an Egyptian immigrant, implores her mother to consider “the things we might face” under Trump. “And she says, ‘Well, that’s your choice.’ ” Her mother, Linda Harmon, said she knows “a lot of people are scared that Muslims are going to have to register and get shipped back.” But, she added, “even a lot of Muslims want people vetted. . . . He’s not going to send any back that aren’t causing any trouble, I don’t think.” ‘I didn’t know youwere one of them’ Kattih, the pharmacist, remembers a day a few years back when a customer came in to fill a prescription and said, “Did you hear those damn Muslims want to build a church in town?” Kattih, who immigrated as an adult from Syria, told her that he is a Muslim. His skin, like many of the Arab immigrants in the town, is just as pale as the whites who can trace their American lineage back generations. The exchange resulted in a moment of shock, a hurried exit and, a week later, an apology. “I didn’t know you were one of them,” he remembered her saying the next time she came in. “I just wanted to apologize. If you need anything, call me.” The incident shaped his outlook, he said: Maybe people just don’t know enough about each other. Abdou Kattih, a co-founder of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro and president of Murfreesboro Muslim Youth. (Michael Noble Jr. for The Washington Post) Last year, Kattih founded Murfreesboro Muslim Youth, a community service group that aims to make Muslims visible and familiar to people who would not dare visit the mosque. “What people in America are failing to realize: Most immigrant Muslims lived under dictatorship. Fear is embedded in their skin. So when they’re afraid, they retract,” Kattih said. “And I think that’s the opposite of what needs to happen. You need to stretch out your hand to allies. And you’ll be surprised what hands reach out back.” A week after the election, the group’s members, most in their late teens or early 20s, gathered in the town square and handed out flowers to strangers. Some people from other faiths joined in. On Thanksgiving, the students cooked 48 meals and gave them to families in need. When students hosted a meet-a-Muslim event on the university campus earlier this year, “most people came up to us and said they had never met a Muslim,” said Basant Salem, 18, who moved to Murfreesboro five years ago from Morgantown, W.Va., when her father became a genetics professor at the university. “We don’t have to change their views,” said Basant’s sister, Samar, 21, who once brought cookies to mosque protesters, “but just make them aware that we aren’t what they think we are.” ‘I think we’re going to see some pretty rough times’ What worries and perplexes many Muslims and their friends here is what lies beneath the surface. What impact will Trump have as president when distrust of Muslims already exists? Bennett, director of the Murfreesboro Cold Patrol homeless-aid group, used to belong to an evangelical church opposed to the mosque, which protesters and politicians accused of supporting terrorism. Vandals struck the building site three times, at one point setting construction equipment on fire. Bennett changed his thinking after he met Kattih and other Muslims also involved in providing social services to those in need. He said the fear and the false pronouncements — that Muslims worship a different God, are taught to lie or use mosques as militant training centers — are as pervasive in the town’s Sunday sermons and Bible studies as they were five years ago. “All that stuff is still there,” Bennett said. “When policies start to take effect after January, or start to move, I think we’re going to see some pretty rough times again.” McCarroll, who leads a predominantly black church in Murfreesboro, echoed that concern. “I think we could see people displaced,” he said. “Right now it’s just rhetoric, but I think the town is really holding its breath.” Ask locals about the churches that oppose Islam and many point first to the World Outreach Church, the largest megachurch in town. “We have a duty to investigate anyone under the banner of Islam,” the pastor, Allen Jackson, declared at a hearing on the mosque plan in 2010. The church declined to comment on Jackson’s view now, but a man who worships there said the pastor continues to view Islam through a prism of holy war: “He thinks it’s biblical.” [Changing Baptist churches in Murfreesboro] Men and women who once sued and protested against the mosque come in to fill prescriptions from Kattih, buy doughnuts or cigarettes from Essam Mohammed at the Quik Mart or attend one of Sbenaty’s engineering classes. They trade pleasantries. They’re polite. They continue on their way. A man works on his truck in Murfreesboro. (Michael Noble Jr. for The Washington Post) Howard Wall puts it like this: “If I have to go the store to get a Coke or something, we talk. I’m nice to them, they’re nice to me.” Wall and his wife, Sally, are local developers who were among those who sued to stop the mosque construction, litigation that was resolved when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case. The couple have no plans to take up another fight. They also think it won’t be necessary, because Trump will limit the arrival of more Muslims. Murfreesboro doesn’t need “to have a lot of Muslims,” Sally Wall said. “I think they can stay where they are and we stay where we are.” But there’s more tolerance because of the public acrimony over the mosque, said City Council member Bill Shacklett. “I wish some of the things hadn’t happened. But the one thing it has done is compel people to open their hearts and minds to be drawn toward each other . . . get out and flesh out your faith with different people,” Shacklett said, adding that Muslims and Christians have started to do that. “Maybe that wouldn’t have happened if we hadn’t had the spotlight put on us for all of that.” national Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

November and December now account for less than 21 percent of annual retail sales at physical stores, down from a peak of over 25 percent, and experts believe it’ll keep dropping. Those extra percentage points would have translated into an extra $70 billion more in buying for last year, says Michael Niemira, principal at The Retail Economist. The season had steadily gained in importance and peaked in the early ’80s, before the dominance of big discounters like Wal-Mart stalled its growth as shoppers began moving away from department stores. Still, the two-month period held its own through the mid-’90s, when online shopping for deals took hold. “There was a mindset even before online shopping,” said Niemira, whose data goes back to 1967. “But this just accelerated it.” In general, many people are shopping for the holidays all year long now, mirroring the trend for back-to-school items. Heavy discounting has diluted sales, and with big promotions throughout the year, shoppers no longer hold off making their biggest purchases until the holidays. This year, the contentious presidential election delayed some shoppers, and with Christmas falling on a Sunday, stores are expecting a bigger number of last-minute buyers. At a busy Target store in Brick, New Jersey on Saturday morning, many shoppers seemed to be picking up small items to use as stocking stuffers. Others were hoping to find a last-minute deal. “I’m pretty much set for Christmas, so I thought I would come down and see what I could find on sale, like maybe a TV,” Terry Kreft, 38, said as she strolled through the store. She has spent about $600 on gifts this year, taking advantage of discounts during the traditional holiday-season shopping days right after Thanksgiving, called “Black Friday” and “Cyber Monday.” “I was pretty much done with my shopping before December got rolling,” Kreft said. But a late rush isn’t expected to make up the difference. “It’s no longer a seasonal business,” said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at consumer research firm NPD Group Inc. “It’s a yearlong investment for the consumer. And retailers need to change. They have to excite shoppers early in the season and later in the season — and all year long.” Stores now offer good deals throughout the year on products like TVs and appliances, making waiting until the end of the year less appealing. Deloitte LLP found 30 percent of shoppers planned to wait for holiday sales to buy large gifts, down from 35 percent a year ago. “People are not holding back and waiting because they find a good price for all the things they are looking for,” said Rod Sides, vice chairman of Deloitte. Christopher Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which looks at imports, says he has seen a smoothing out of imports during the pre-holiday shopping season from July to November on key items like apparel, toys and furniture. The shift complicates matters for retailers, which could usually concentrate their efforts on capturing shoppers during the holiday window. HEAVY DISCOUNTING: With fierce competition online, particularly from Amazon, stores are constantly trying to outdo each other and even undercutting themselves on prices from the previous year. Shoppers have been trained to demand deals, and won’t break the habit. “The heightened competition being driven by the influence of e-commerce largely is driving prices down on popular holiday items,” said Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track. “Retailers know consumers frequently compare prices on these categories online and are discounting more heavily to drive traffic and sales.” One example: The average price for a TV from Oct. 1 through Tuesday was $829.52, down from $1,009.41 during the same time last year, according to Market Track, which tracked promoted prices across 40 major retailers on over 19,000 TVs. THE RISE OF GIFT CARDS: Shoppers are giving more gift cards as presents, which skews holiday sales figures since they aren’t booked as sales until they’re redeemed. And most cards no longer have an expiration date. This holiday season, gift cards were ranked second as a top gift, behind only clothing, according to NPD. Gift cards sales accounted for about 25.4 percent of holiday expenditures last year, up from 13.5 percent in 2003, according to Goldman Sachs and The Retail Economist. SHOPPERS WANT EXPERIENCES: Major department stores like Macy’s have been seeing shoppers shifting their spending away from traditional merchandise like clothing and more toward gifts that offer experiences like beauty treatments and other services. NPD found 10 percent of holiday shoppers said they planned to give fewer tangible gifts than last year, and 8 percent said they would not give any tangible gifts. Some 14 percent said they will give more experiences as gifts this year than last year, the research group said. ——— Associated Press writer Bruce Shipkowski in Brick, New Jersey contributed to this report. ——— Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio     Tags: shoppers, holiday, percent, sales, season, shopping, Other stories from today: GOP on taxes: Cut rates, brackets but what about the deficit?

One was Debra Miller, of Collinston, La., who traveled to Mexico four times a year for 10 years to get diabetes and blood pressure medicine. She quit in 2011 after the border patrol caught her returning to the U.S. with a three-month supply that had cost her $40. The former truck driver drew a stern warning not to do it again, but got to keep her pills. "I didn't know what I did wrong," said Miller, 51, who now pays $120 a month at Wal-Mart for her five medications while she waits to join Medicaid. It's no secret that some Americans regularly buy prescription drugs on the internet or while traveling abroad. But the popularity of the approach is underscored by the results of a Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in November. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)  HealthGrove | Graphiq Eight percent of respondents said they or someone in their household had imported a drug at some point, a figure that would translate to about 19 million adults in the U.S. based on current Census Bureau population estimates. Even the proportion found in the poll may be low, said Andrew Zullo, a clinical pharmacist and a doctoral student at the Brown University School of Public Health who has researched the subject. "People are uncomfortable talking about the cost of their own health care, and they don't want to admit they are struggling to pay for their own meds," he said. Some may also be reluctant to reveal they've broken the law. Still, 8 percent is far higher than in surveys conducted by government interviewers, which suggested the number was about 2 percent in 2011 _ though the government survey focused only on purchases in the previous 12 months. The Kaiser poll queried a nationally representative sample of 1,202 adults. The internet has made it easier for Americans to buy prescription drugs abroad, frequently from disreputable sources, according to Jaime Ruiz, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Food and Drug Administration has cautioned that many online pharmacies aren't what they seem to be. An international crackdown in 2014 found that many packages of medicines purportedly from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. contained drugs from other countries, including India, China and Laos. Zullo acknowledged that imported medications could be inferior or expired. Some could be counterfeits. But many medicines purchased from another country are the same as the ones patients buy in the U.S. When purchased outside the country, many prescription medicines cost half or less than they do in the U.S. According to the FDA's website, it is generally illegal for Americans to import drugs into the U.S. for personal use. The law isn't rigorously enforced, in part, because it is difficult to monitor the entry of medicine in suitcases and small packages. But in 2015 the FDA implemented a rule that would give government border inspectors expanded authority to destroy drugs imported for personal use at their point of entry. In the poll, people who had imported medicines ranged from college students in their 20s to retirees in their 80s. They bought medications to treat chronic conditions _ such as high blood pressure and thyroid problems _ as well as acute problems such as sinus infections and acne. Amanda Mazumder, a 27-year-old graphic designer in St. Paul, Minn., was stressed out by the murky legality of the situation when she tried buying birth control pills while in college five years ago. "That was the most difficult part, trying to be an honest citizen but also getting an affordable prescription," she said. She couldn't afford to pay $150 a month for her birth control, but found an online Canadian pharmacy that sold her a three-month supply for $60. Bobby Grant, of Los Angeles, has relied on foreign pharmacies for seven years to get medicine for his partner's severe asthma. Grant, 38, travels internationally for his job producing live shows. Each time he's in Mexico or France, he buys 10-packs of inhalers and 20-packs of nebulizer solution for a fraction of what they would cost in the U.S. His partner's asthma would require inhalers costing $300 a month if she purchased them here. Grant estimates he saves at least $2,500 a year by buying the drugs overseas. "I love her to death," he said. "I'll do whatever I can to take her stress away."

White Monday, 26 Dec 2016 | 11:04 AM ETNBC NEWS SHARES Evan Vucci | Pool | Reuters President Barack Obama delivers his final State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress in Washington January 12, 2016. A new labor law rule — kicked back by a federal judge last month — that would have made almost four million Americans eligible for overtime pay may still have resulted in higher wages for the workers it was intended to help. The new legislation would have significantly raised the salary cap under which employees were eligible to earn overtime. In response, some large companies, such as Walmart, gave raises to workers whose pay fell just under the new threshold, making them ineligible for overtime pay. Other companies reclassified salaried overtime-exempt workers as hourly employees, which would make them eligible to earn overtime for workweeks longer than 40 hours. "There's a whole set of companies that had already communicated to their employees that they were going to change their employment status or give them raises," said Brian Kropp, HR practice leader at CEB. Because the rule was halted only about a week before it was set to take effect, many companies had already made the switch. More from NBC News: Obama 'confident' he could have won in 2016 Far-right German party looks to tap into terror attacks backlash Russian minister: Error or tech failure eyed in plane crash Raising Wages to Avoid Overtime Yanking back promised raises is a non-starter, especially with the lowest unemployment rate in nearly a decade, compensation experts say. "They're not going to adjust employees backwards," Kropp said. "To go back would be hugely damaging from an engagement and productivity perspective." "The choices you make around how you play employees is so impactful to your business and is a big piece of your larger employer brand," said Lydia Frank, vice president at Compensation information and research company PayScale. PayScale analyzed 553 job titles that paid between the old and new thresholds for overtime eligibility ($23,661 and $47,476, respectively), and found that the number making in between those two numbers dropped sharply over the past two quarters. This indicates, the company said, that many businesses have been raising workers' wages to keep from having to pay overtime. For a typical position among those 553 analyzed, there was an 18 percentage point drop in the number earning below the new threshold. Out of the job titles it examined, PayScale found that the number of people making less than $47,476 fell in 539 of them. According to Mark Szypko, vice president of compensation strategy at Salary.com, roughly 40 percent of their corporate clients had implemented either raises or worker reclassification in anticipation of the FLSA update. Kropp estimated that about 5 percent of the workforce across retail, food service and hospitality and leisure — all sectors with large numbers of lower-wage workers — will be affected. Trump Likely Won't Fight It Those raises could have more staying power than the legislation itself. Ross Eisenbrey, vice president at the Economic Policy Institute, said it isn't clear yet whether or not the rule and the higher overtime threshold will survive after the inauguration. Donald Trump's stated opposition to corporate regulations makes him unlikely to support defending it in court, although Eisenbray said at least one organized labor group is positioning itself to continue defending it even if a Jeff Sessions-led Department of Justice declines to do so. This ambiguity around the legislation's fate could prompt companies to take a better-safe-than-sorry approach, Eisenbray said, since it would be hugely expensive to have to pay months of overtime retroactively. "The biggest takeaway for us is really it's interesting to see that a lot of companies took action before the law said they had to," Frank said. "There's no plans to repeal or roll back changes. I do think we'll see those wages stick," she said. "At the end of the day, employees will benefit," Kropp said. The low unemployment rate also makes it likely that even businesses who didn't give raises in anticipation of the higher threshold could be forced by market competition to match their rivals' pay increases. "If someone can get a $5,000 or $7,000 raise by going down the street, why wouldn't they?" Eisenbray said. "For companies that aren't paying as much as their competitors, they're going to see their best talent move," Kropp predicted. "In this segment of the market, people will move for 50 cents or a dollar an hour difference." Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change WMT ---

WalletHub, a financial advice app, ranked gift cards' real values based on their popularity, potential buyer discount, resale value and retailer rating.  The most valuable gift cards, based on resale value: Nike  Walmart Best Buy Safeway Costco Target Shell Netflix Apple Store Ticketmaster Although many people pay full price for gift cards, many cards are actually available at a discount on gift card exchange sites such as Gift Card Granny, CardCash and Coinstar.  Those sites also offer the option to sell unwanted gift cards for slightly less than their worth. A $100 Target gift card, for example, can be resold for $82, according to WalletHub. The site advises to be aware of the difference between prepaid cards, loyalty cards, and gift cards, as the three options have different expiration dates and fees. Card-network gift cards such as Visa have both up-front fees and monthly fees after a period of inactivity. Gift card users also have to wary of overspending, as two-thirds of consumers spend more than the card value.  WalletHub lists the change in rank for gift card values from 2015 to 2016. The value of Fandango and Chipotle gift cards has fallen hard, while Tim Hortons gift cards appear to be rising in value.

So we've asked the staff in the KUT newsroom to go over the stories we've done this year and pick their favorites. Here are the highlights: Credit Jorge Sanhueza-Lyon/KUT Audrey McGlinchy, City Reporter Favorite story she produced in 2016: 'A Cop Shot My Son': An Austin Mother Reflects on Shared Loss Why: We don't often hear from the families of those killed by police months after the incident. Sully's pain was visible in such ordinary moments -- in the couch she chose to sit on, the food she chose to cook. Jennifer Stayton, Morning Edition Host Favorite story she produced in 2016: Jessica Luther's 'Unsportsmanlike Conduct' Tackles Sexual Assault in College Football Why: College football is a major business; the programs bring in millions of dollars to many large universities, and coaches at the most prestigious programs can earn in excess of $5 million a season. The players are treated like celebrities and seem often to get a pass for something as minor as breaking team curfew rules, or something as major as accusations of sexual assault. Austin writer Jessica Luther chronicles the culture on college campuses that has allowed players to get away with sexual assault and proposes ways to change the system to prevent that from continuing. Credit Miguel Gutierrez Jr./KUT News Ben Philpott, Senior Editor Favorite story he produced in 2016: Is Austin Really Still Keeping It Weird? Why: I really liked this story because so many people had so much to say about it. Is Austin weird? Was it ever? What is weird?! (For more on the response to this story, check out this follow up post.) Credit COURTESY OF ADRIENNE WHITE Kate McGee, Education Reporter Favorite story she produced in 2016: One Mile and One Week Apart, Two Brothers Meet Similar Fates Walking in Austin Why: I still think about Adrienne White and her family when I drive around Austin, especially when I drive past the two locations her father and her uncle were hit by cars a week apart earlier this year. Austin had a record number of traffic fatalities in 2015 and while the number of deaths is down this year, the city of Austin still has a lot of work to do when it comes to improving traffic and pedestrian safety in the city. Credit Gabriel Cristóver Pérez/KUT News Ashley Lopez, Health Care and Elections Reporter Favorite story she produced in 2016: What It's Like To Be Sober in Austin, Where Alcohol Is Pretty Much Everywhere Why: As a new resident of Austin, I’ve spent a lot of this year meeting people and exploring the city. After several months, I noticed a lot of time my time was spent drinking, though.  Austin is a place where you can get a drink anywhere, which is part of its charm. But I’ve done also done a lot of reporting on addiction and health in Texas. So, I wondered what it would be like living here if you are trying to stay sober? Credit Miguel Gutierrez Jr./KUT News Mose Buchele, Energy/Environment Reporter Favorite story he produced in 2016: Why Do Grackles Flock To Grocery Store Parking Lots at Dusk? Why: When I was asked to look into the habits of grackles, I knew the assignment would take me to an HEB parking lot, but I never thought the it would take me to the waning days of the Aztec Empire. This story was fun to put together, it revealed something kind of magical in the mundane, and it had a lot of resonance with listeners. I probably received more emails about this one than any other I did all year.  Credit Nathan Bernier/KUT Nathan Bernier, All Things Considered Host Favorite story he produced in 2016: S U R V I V E's 'Stranger Things' Spotlight Shines on Austin's Synthesizer Scene Why: I chose this one because it involved synthesizers and I love synthesizers and electronic tones and music…also Stranger Things was great!  Trey Shaar, All Things Considered Producer Favorite story he produced in 2016: Requiem for a Rehearsal: The Story of One Band's SXSW Audition Why: During this year's South by Southwest, I put together the story of the my band's performance for a record company talent scout during SXSW of 1989. It prompted a heart-warming response from people who remember the band and those long-ago years of the Austin music scene. The story also led to that talent scout tracking me down and reaching out. No record deal, yet, though.     Credit Miguel Gutierrez Jr./KUT News Jimmy Maas, Morning Edition Producer/Reporter Favorite story he produced in 2016: Meet Austin's Real 'People of Walmart' Why: Austin homeless are living in the parking lots of America’s biggest retailer. Dramatic juxtaposition aside, the people of Walmart offer a window into the myriad of reasons for why we become homeless. I spent a lot of time wandering Walmart parking lots looking for stories. What I found was a scrappy community. Credit Gabriel Cristóver Pérez/KUT News Syeda Hasan, Real Estate and Development Reporter Favorite story she produced in 2016: Lack of Contractor Oversight Leaves Texas Homeowners Unprotected Why: I learned a lot while reporting on this story. It started with meeting one couple who was struggling to repair their home after a bad experience with a contractor, to learning how and why the industry isn't regulated statewide. The feedback from listeners was also great – several people shared their own experiences, and one local contractor volunteered to help the couple rebuild their home for free.  Andrew Weber, Online Reporter/Editor Favorite story he produced in 2016: 36 Hours in Austin, Realistically Why: Honestly, this wasn’t my absolute favorite story I’ve produced in 2016. I’ve had probably more professionally gratifying stories (storytelling-wise) on a series I do, Wayback Wednesday – yes, that is a shameless, shameless plug – and also (production-wise) on our “Road to Zero” series (again: no shame). But this story seemed to get the most reaction. Some people saw it as a timely satirical send-up of the Gray Lady’s guide to Austin; others, who didn’t see the satire, harangued me for unbridled foolishness. Like I said, while it wasn’t my favorite work, it did allow me the opportunity to write this sentence and get paid at the same time: You are a visceral actualization of an emoji — fun, accessible, loved by all. In the back of your head, you hear a familiar refrain: This is Austin. You’re on vacation. This is Bat City, baby. Wait, do people call it that? They do not. Credit Jorge Sanhueza-Lyon/KUT News Matt Largey, Managing Editor Favorite story he produced in 2016: What's the Story Behind the 'Fair Sailing Tall Boy' Memorial? Why: I had always wondered about this memorial, since I drive by it almost every day on my way to work. So I was excited when someone asked about it for our ATXplained project. I was not prepared for the kindness and beauty that I would find in reporting this story. Ivan Garth Johnson's parents were so thoughtful and generous with sharing the story of his death and how it affects them to this day. I still think about them – and Ivan – every time I drive past the memorial.

Rantoul police Sgt. Justin Bouse said police had been looking for Jawan Gipson in connection with a Dec. 15 holdup that occurred at the Walmart store parking lot, 845 Broadmeadow Road. Gipson, 19, was located Friday afternoon by Champaign police detective Pat Funkhouser, who knew Rantoul police were looking for Gipson. He was caught after a brief foot chase in Champaign. Gipson was arrested on preliminary charges of armed robbery and aggravated discharge of a firearm. A judge set bond at $150,000 for Gipson on Saturday and told him to return to court Tuesday for formal charges. The robbery and shooting happened about 8 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 15. The victim told police he went to the store parking lot to meet with a female acquaintance and a man, later identified as Gipson. He got in the car with them and was robbed of cash by the man, which the victim tried to get back. As he got out of the car, Bouse said, the man allegedly fired through the front seat driver's window at him. The victim sustained injuries from breaking glass and was later treated and released. The man gave police enough information that they could develop Gipson as the person they were looking for, Bouse said. An anonymous tip to police on Friday led to his arrest.

(SLT/Mischief Media Group via AP) (SLT) Print Email @Nerdwallet By @Nerdwallet The Oregonian Follow on Twitter on December 26, 2016 at 6:00 AM, updated December 26, 2016 at 8:17 AM comments If finding deals is your New Year's resolution, January is a great time to start. For those who want to make saving money a priority in 2017, here are our recommendations for what to buy (and skip) this month based on NerdWallet's analysis of historical sales cycles. Buy: Christmas decorations The period after Christmas has long been the best time to buy Christmas decorations. You may scoop up some post-Christmas deals on Dec. 26, but come Jan. 1, there will still be a handful of artificial trees, red ornaments and shiny wrapping paper spilling over in store clearance aisles. Stock up on holiday close-outs if you have space to hang onto extra tinsel until December. Skip: Smartphones You can't always time your smartphone purchase. If your trusty iPhone has seen better days, it may be time for something new. But if you're planning an upgrade in the not-so-imminent future, consider waiting a while longer. Prices on existing phone models tend to go down whenever a new phone is released. For Apple phones, the sweet spot is usually September after the company's annual keynote product announcement. As for Samsung, tech enthusiasts speculate the Galaxy S8 could arrive around April. Buy: TVs The end of football season marks the beginning of television deals, as retailers help shoppers prep for viewing parties. The Super Bowl will air on Feb. 5, but we expect retailers will kick off sales at the end of January -- making it an excellent time to score a bargain. In 2016, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Amazon and more discounted a wide variety of TVs in assorted brands and sizes ahead of the big game. Look for similar savings again in 2017. Skip: Toys Toys were hot during the holidays; if you haven't heard of a Hatchimal, you've probably been living under a rock. But with Christmas over, January likely won't see many worthwhile toy deals. The good news is your little ones are probably set for a while after all of their December gifts. Buy: Fitness gear January is a solid time to sign up for a gym at a discounted introductory rate, as many chains offer special New Year's rates. But don't spend that money unless you're sure you'll use the membership. All too often, new members lock themselves in for a full year, then stop showing up after a month or two. Skip: Mattresses Great deals on mattresses will come in February, when Presidents Day sales bring discounts. Presidents Day is Feb. 20, so hold off for another month if you're in the market for a new mattress. Or if February is too soon for your budget, mattress deals will be back again in May over Memorial Day weekend and in September over Labor Day weekend. Buy: Bedding You might not want to buy a whole new mattress, but you can save on the sheets and blankets that go on your existing mattress. January is the month when department stores host "white sales" to clear out their existing inventory of sheets, towels, blankets and more. Expect savings to be especially deep on clearance items. Last year, we saw several stores offer 60%-70% off bedding basics. Bonus: Martin Luther King Jr. Day sales You may not associate Martin Luther King Jr. Day with shopping, but retailers certainly do. The holiday falls on Jan. 16 this year, and you can anticipate deals on clothing and home goods. Highlights from the holiday's 2016 sales included 10% off select major appliance purchases of $396 or more at Lowe's and an extra 40% off sale items at Anthropologie with a coupon code as part of the Winter Tag Sale. Sale shopping reminder As you're searching for deals and end-of-season savings this month, keep in mind that waiting for low prices can be a trade-off, says Ozalp Ozer, a professor of management science at the Jindal School of Management at The University of Texas at Dallas. You'll have to put time into the search. And buying at the time of a better deal may mean that inventory will already be picked over. But for the budget-conscious, the extra time and risk of regret is worth it. -NerdWallet Courtney Jespersen is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

Beware: Many Stores Have Tightened Their Rules by Herb Weisbaum Shoppers walk through the Rideau Centre, in Ottawa on Boxing Day on Dec. 26, 2016. Justin Tang / The Canadian Press via AP Share Share Tweet Share Email Print Comment advertisement Returning a gift? Beware: More than a few major stores have altered their previously generous open-ended return policies this year. Millions of Americans are heading back to the stores this week to cash in on sales and return those gifts that just didn't work out quite right. About 10 percent of all holiday merchandise winds up coming back, according to the National Retail Federation. And despite the financial hit - about $60 billion dollars - most stores offer special extended holiday return periods. However, a few prominent retailers have shortened their return policies this year, according to an annual survey by ConsumerWorld.org. Macy's now requires all returns in one year Kohl's has a new deadline for "premium electronics" of January 31 Costco reduced its return period for major appliances to 90 days Tightening Up the Returns "It's surprising to me that these three big retailers put an end to their unlimited return policy for some or all categories of items," said Edgar Dworsky, founder of ConsumerWorld.org. "How strict or lenient return policies are seems to be cyclical. We seem to be in a period of some tightening." Drones were a popular gift item this year. If you got one and you want to take it back, you'd better get going. The return period for drones is just 14 days at Target, 15 days at Walmart and 30 days at Toys "R" Us. Shorter return periods are most likely a response to the serious and growing problem of return fraud. Retailers estimated that 3.5 percent of their holiday returns last year were fraudulent, according to the NRF's 2015 Return Fraud Survey. That fraud cost retailers $2.2 billion, up from approximately $1.9 billion in 2014. Even so, a few stores made their return rules more lenient this year. Two noteworthy changes: Sears started its holiday returns policy one week earlier (November 1) and now allows returns one week later (January 30) Toys"R"Us increased the return period for computer hardware from 15 to 30 days The Consumer World report noted that Toys "R" Us has a generous but "secret" holiday return policy that is not disclosed on its website, posted at stores checked, or known by store employees asked. That policy is: Most things - other than select electronics, such as video game hardware, cameras and computers - purchased on or after September 1 can be returned until January 28. "I simply can't understand why Toys "R" Us, which has one of the liberal holiday return policies in the industry, keeps it a secret," Dworsky told NBC News. When contacted about this, Toys "R" Us sent NBC News a link to a freshly released statement about post-Christmas sales. The news release is posted on the company's corporate site. The policy still does not appear on the return policy page where consumers would go. Better Have a Receipt Do yourself a favor and bring along the receipt or a gift receipt. Some retailers won't accept a return without a receipt. Others will only give you a store credit for the lowest price that item sold for recently, not what the gift-giver paid for it. "Receipts are critical," said Consumer Reports money editor Lauren Lyons Cole. "Merchants in the past have been fairly generous in taking back goods without a store or gift receipt, offering shoppers who can't produce documentation at least store credit for the lowest price the item sold for. Though it's rare for companies to have a blunt no-receipt, no-return rule, the lack of receipt puts you on shaky ground, especially for cash purchases because there's no way to look up the purchase." Don't be surprised if you're asked to show identification - your driver's license or other government-issued ID - even if you have the receipt. Some big chains now use computerized systems to detect return abuse. Consumer Reports say they use your ID to track your return history, including frequency, dollar amount and time between returns. For example, Walmart limits customers to three returns without a receipt within a 45 day period. Consumer Reports just published a Guide to Returning Gifts that includes a list of the "Best in the Business" and stores with strict policies. It's important to check the policy for any gifts purchased online. Some merchants cover the cost of the return shipping; others make you pay for it. Some stores with walk-in locations will let you return merchandise in person. It's important to remember that returns and exchanges are a courtesy. Except for damaged merchandise, a store is not required to take something back. And while many states require that return policy to be posted, the store gets to set the rules. "When you get in that long return line, check the store's policy while you're waiting," Consumer World's Dworsky told NBC News. "If you are asking for something outside the rules, recognize that and adjust your attitude accordingly. You can't demand something you're not entitled to. You can only ask politely for an accommodation." Herb Weisbaum is The ConsumerMan. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter or visit The ConsumerMan website.

With so many people off of work on Monday, retailers are hoping for a surge of shoppers as people look for the best after Christmas sales. (Note: Monday's federal holiday means federal, state, county and local courts and government offices are closed. Ditto for the post office and stock markets. Most banks, schools and libraries also are closed.) Here's a look at what to expect for some after Christmas sales and shopping hours:  Nordstrom will open at 8 a.m. and you can find up to half off in the half-yearly sale. There's also up to 40 percent off on women's shoes. Walmart stores are closing a bit earlier than previous years at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve, but they open Monday morning for regular hours. For most stores we checked, that's 6 or 7 a.m. Target stores open at 7 a.m. and there are always deals to be had on seasonal and Christmas decorations.  At P.C. Richard & Son, there are deals on big-screen TV's and electronics, but they're also offering up to $500 off on select Frigidaire and Electrolux appliances. Stores open at 9 a.m. The Macy's store locator will help with open and closing hours. Most stores will be open at 7 a.m., and the retailer is noted for its after-Christmas deals -- both in stores and online. Most Lord & Taylor stores are open at 7 and you can find up to 75 percent off on clearance items. At BestBuy, most doors open at 9, though we found a few locations that will be open at 8 a.m. Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries N.J.

Contact Us Newsletters Sales: 1-800-405-0844 Articles Customer Stories Plans Product Tour Research Topics Request Pricing Seven Ecommerce Players Who Came On Strong in 2016 Seven players (some big, some small) that thrived December 26, 2016 | Retail & Ecommerce Share Email Print No. 1. Wholesale shopping club Boxed Founded in 2013, Boxed made waves in early 2016 when it announced it had closed a $100 million funding round. That brought funding to a total of $133 million. With no membership fees, Boxed is looking to be the digital bulk shopping alternative to Costco. According to a report in Forbes, Boxed expects revenues to surpass $100 million this year, up from $8 million just two years ago. No. 2. Mattress retailer Casper Not many digital innovators can base their success on the ability to squish. But that's a key to Casper's success. Casper's latex and memory foam mattresses can be squished into a cardboard box for easy shipping at cheaper rates than a traditional mattress. Once the mattress arrives, the material unsquishes back to intended form. Casper looks to be on track to double its sales this year to $200 million, according to a profile on Inc. No. 3. Dollar Shave Club Founded in 2011, Dollar Shave Club was acquired by Unilever in July 2016 for $1 billion, signaling that consumer packaged goods can and will sell online, if marketed the right way—and at the right price. No. 4. Jet.com Barely a year after its launch, Jet.com was acquired by Walmart in August 2016 for around $3 billion. Founded by Marc Lore, who had previously started Diapers.com (sold to to Amazon in 2010), the company has a real-time savings engine that lowers prices as a user shops. Other incentives for even lower prices include deciding to forgo free shipping and paying with a debit card. No. 5. MeUndies 5. Underwear ecommerce retailer MeUndies parallels Dollar Shave Club, but for underwear. Customers choose from three different style plans and receive a new undie each month. The company reportedly is on track to sell 5 million pairs in 2017. No. 6. ThirdLove It can be hard for women to find the correct bra size, but ThirdLove, an ecommerce lingerie company with an accompanying iOS bra size app, aims to change all that. Buying a bra online may seem daunting, but getting fit in real life is equally daunting. The app makes sizing surprisingly easy, offers half sizes and is completed without a trip to the store. ThirdLove received 280,000 visits in the first two days the site was live and has attracted $5.5 million in funding so far, according to a New York Times report. No. 7. Wish Wish connects customers directly with suppliers in China for the cheapest prices. Wish takes 15% of each sale. The appeal is low prices, with items such as a "Vintage Paris Eiffel Tower Leather Quartz Watch" for $1. It recently won a huge investment (which partially will be used to shore up its fulfillment operations). But will the business model come under pressure in a political environment where imports from China are coming under fire? —Rebecca Chadwick New in eMarketer PRO This Week Forecast: US Wearables Users, 2016-2020, with Breakouts by Age, Gender and Generation Report: US Digital Ad Spending Benchmarks by Industry, H2 Update Statpack: Canada – Consumer Time and Advertiser Dollars Report: UK Digital Trends for 2017 Not a PRO subscriber?

And according to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation of over 1,200 adults nationally, affordability of these medications top the public’s list of priorities for the President and Congress. While consumers wait for change, they can lower their drug spending by taking advantage of a number of cost-saving opportunities, including:  Shop around. Prices for drugs can vary widely between pharmacies. If a plan doesn’t have a preferred pharmacy, members should compare costs at multiple pharmacies.  Walmart and Target both offer $4 30-day generic refills for certain medications. For more options, there are a number of free online tools and apps like GoodRx and OneRx that compare prices for drugs in a certain geographic area. Consider switching to a generic or other less expensive alternative. Consumers should ask their physician if they can try a generic version of prescription medication. According to the FDA, choosing generic over brand-name drugs generally saves shoppers as much as 80-85 percent. If a generic’s not available, patients should review their health plan’s prescription drug tiers and ask their doctor if they can switch to a clinically equivalent drug on a lower tiered formulary list.  Split pills. Since many drugs cost about the same per pill, no matter the dosage, patients should ask their physician if they can shift to a prescription for half as many pills at double the strength. Then they simply need to use a pill splitter to cut the tablets in two. Change to mail order for maintenance medications. For drugs taken on a regular basis, patients can get up to a three-month supply through mail order for a lower copay than they’d be responsible for at retail.  Review insurance plan options. During open enrollment, consumers should compare options. Key things to consider are formulary lists so patients can determine whether their medications are covered and in what price tier as well as deductibles. For example, if a patient has to pay the full cost of high-priced medications until they meet their deductible, it may make sense to choose a plan with a higher monthly premium and a lower deductible. Rob Calise is the Managing Director, Employee Benefits. of Cornerstone|Gencorp, where he helps clients control the costs of employee benefits by focusing on consumer driven strategies and on how to best utilize the tax savings tools the government provides. Rob serves as Chairman of the Board of United Benefit Advisors, and is a board member of the Blue Cross & Blue Shield of RI Broker Advisory Board, United HealthCare of New England Broker Advisory Board and Rhode Island Business Healthcare Advisors Council.

November and December now account for less than 21 percent of annual retail sales at physical stores, down from a peak of over 25 percent, and experts think it’ll keep dropping. Those extra percentage points would have translated into an extra $70 billion more in buying for last year, said economist Michael Niemira at the Retail Economist, a research firm. The season had steadily gained in importance and peaked in the early ’80s, before the dominance of big discounters like Wal-Mart stalled its growth as shoppers began moving away from department stores. Still, the two-month period held its own through the mid-’90s, when online shopping for deals took hold. “There was a mindset even before online shopping,” said Niemira, whose data go back to 1967. “But this just accelerated it.” In general, many people are shopping for the holidays all year long now, mirroring the trend for back-to-school items. Heavy discounting has diluted sales, and with big promotions throughout the year, shoppers no longer hold off making their biggest purchases until the holidays. Last-minute shoppers This year, the contentious presidential election delayed some shoppers, and with Christmas falling on a Sunday, stores are expecting a bigger number of last-minute buyers. At a busy Target store in Brick, New Jersey, on Saturday morning, many shoppers seemed to be picking up small items to use as stocking stuffers. Others were hoping to find last-minute deals. “I’m pretty much set for Christmas, so I thought I would come down and see what I could find on sale, like maybe a TV,” Terry Kreft, 38, said as she strolled through the store. She has spent about $600 on gifts this year, taking advantage of discounts during the traditional holiday season shopping days right after Thanksgiving, called Black Friday and Cyber Monday. “I was pretty much done with my shopping before December got rolling,” Kreft said. But a late rush isn’t expected to make up the difference. “It’s no longer a seasonal business,” said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at consumer research firm NPD Group Inc. “It’s a yearlong investment for the consumer. And retailers need to change. They have to excite shoppers early in the season and later in the season — and all year long.” Here’s what’s behind the shift: Less willing to wait: Stores now offer good deals throughout the year on products like TVs and appliances, making waiting until the end of the year less appealing. Financial consultancy Deloitte LLP found 30 percent of shoppers planned to wait for holiday sales to buy large gifts, down from 35 percent a year ago. “People are not holding back and waiting, because they find a good price for all the things they are looking for,” said Rod Sides, vice chairman of Deloitte. Christopher Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which looks at imports, said he has seen a smoothing out of imports during the pre-holiday shopping season from July to November on key items like apparel, toys and furniture. The shift complicates matters for retailers, which could usually concentrate their efforts on capturing shoppers during the holiday window. Big discounts: With fierce competition online, particularly from Amazon, stores are constantly trying to outdo each other and even undercutting themselves on prices from the previous year. Shoppers have been trained to demand deals, and they won’t break the habit. “The heightened competition being driven by the influence of e-commerce largely is driving prices down on popular holiday items,” said Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track. “Retailers know consumers frequently compare prices on these categories online and are discounting more heavily to drive traffic and sales.” One example: The average price for a TV from October 1 through Tuesday was $829.52, down from $1,009.41 during the same time last year, according to Market Track, which tracked promoted prices across 40 major retailers on over 19,000 TVs. Gift cards: Shoppers are giving more gift cards as presents, which skews holiday sales figures since they aren’t booked as sales until they’re redeemed. And most cards no longer have an expiration date. This holiday season, gift cards were ranked second as a top gift, behind only clothing, according to NPD. Gift card sales accounted for about 25.4 percent of holiday expenditures last year, up from 13.5 percent in 2003, according to Goldman Sachs and the Retail Economist. Shopping experiences: Major department stores like Macy’s have been seeing shoppers shifting their spending away from traditional merchandise like clothing and more toward gifts that offer experiences, like beauty treatments and other services. NPD found 10 percent of holiday shoppers said they planned to give fewer tangible gifts than last year, and 8 percent said they would not give any tangible gifts. Fourteen percent said they would give more experiences as gifts this year compared with last year, the research group said.

Woman Loses Money In Sweepstakes Scam December 25, 2016 8:00 pm A Johnston County woman says she lost money after falling victim to a sweepstakes scam. The 37 year-old Clayton resident said she received a phone call at her home on December 17th from a man claiming she had just won $950,000 plus a Mercedes Benz in the 2016 Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes. The caller informed the local woman all she needed to do to obtain the cash and the new car was to send $249 to cover the taxes. The victim went to an area Wal-Mart store and transferred the $249 to the suspect. A short time after returning home, the woman received a second phone call from the man saying an additional $100 was needed to cover the taxes. She became suspicious and called the Johnston County Sheriff’s Office.  A deputy was at the victims home taking a report when the suspect called again. The deputy answered the telephone. The man cursed at officer and hung up the telephone. The Federal Trade Commission doesn’t oversee sweepstakes, but is investigating thousands of sweepstakes scams reported every year. The FTC says no legitimate sweepstakes company will contact you asking for money so you can claim your prize. If you have been the victim of a sweepstakes scam, report it to your local authorities and the FTC Complaint Assistance Division.         Johnston County’s #1 Local News Source Email event information to Events@JoCoReport.com General Questions: Email our staff at Info@JoCoReport.com News Related Questions or Issues: Email our News Desk at News@JoCoReport.com Want to advertise with us?

When her coworkers learned of her loss–they rallied around her immediately. Manager Michael Morris-Montano took donations to fix her car window. What happened next, was unexpected. Chris Sawyer, owner of Touch of Class Auto Glass learned of Sweeten’s loss and decided to do something. His family, friends, and others on social media bought presents for Sweeten’s 5 year-old son, Avery. They also put together a basket of necessities for Sweeten. “It was an awesome feeling,” said Sawyer. “It is Christmas. I have young children and we wanted to see more than just what can I get. It’s what can I do to help.” The surprise came less than a day after the gifts had been stolen. Sweeten says now, even if it’s only a dollar, she says she will pay the kidness forward.

The FOP already succeeded in having the shirt removed from WalMart earlier in the week. As of Sunday, the shirt was still for sale, and FOP president Chuck Canterbury said that he wasn’t surprised, calling Amazon “a pretty liberal marketer.” Canterbury (bottom-right), who publicly endorsed Donald Trump, accused Hillary Clinton of “pandering” to Black Lives Matter. [Image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images] According to The Guardian, Canterbury described the shirt as “offensive” due to the “amount of violence demonstrated at Black Lives Matter marches and the fact that eight police officers had been assassinated while protecting Black Lives Matter protests,” referring to the police officers who were shot in Dallas and Baton Rouge earlier in the year – by gunmen who were not affiliated with Black Lives Matter. “It happened as a result of the rhetoric of different BLM groups,” Canterbury responded. The Dallas shooting occurred at a protest over the police shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile and claimed five lives; the Baton Rouge shootings, which claimed a further three victims, were committed from ambush by Gavin Long, a former U.S. marine who became a member of a fringe group The Washitaw Nation of Mu’urs. Writing in an open letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Canterbury said that he expected the CEO to support the FOP in “increasing the bonds of trust between the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve.” He also said that the shirts, including the “Bulletproof” shirt, any other shirts which said “Black Lives Matter,” and shirts with the slogan “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” perpetuated “urban myths” about police shootings. According to the Washington Post, there have been 940 people shot and killed by police in 2016. The FOP’s executive director, James Pasco, added that “the bulletproof thing goes to the new assertiveness of some violence prone individuals to take action directly against police,” saying that the FOP “find it offensive for that reason.” “I wanted to let you know that my members are very upset that you and Amazon are complicit in the sale of this offensive merchandise…. which may damage your company’s good name amongst FOP members and other active and retired law enforcement officers.” He went on to describe the sale of the shirts as Amazon sellers “exploiting the racial divisions in our country” for profit. The FOP’s relations with the Black Lives Matter movement can, at best, be described as rocky. The Fraternal Order of Police, primarily in the person of Canterbury, dismisses Black Lives Matter as racially-divisive, anti-police, and accuses them of supporting violence against police officers. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter has actively protested against the FOP, earlier in the year, as reported by the Washington Post, staging a massive protest outside of FOP headquarters in Washington, D.C. over their support of “Blue Lives Matter” bills, stopping downtown traffic. It’s safe to say that police and BLM protesters don’t quite see eye-to-eye. [Image by Angelo Merendino/Getty Images] Critics of the letters to WalMart and Amazon, meanwhile, are calling the move a publicity stunt on the part of the FOP. As GQ notes, Canterbury’s letter fails to mention any similar concerns about merchandise which promote “racial divisions” and “commercializes our differences” over Amazon or WalMart’s considerable inventory of “Blue Lives Matter” merchandise, which reportedly sells far better than Black Lives Matter-branded clothing. Neither Amazon nor Black Lives Matter has made any response to the letter; WalMart responded by removing the “Bulletproof” shirt but allowing other Black Lives Matter merchandise to remain. But Amazon’s non-response combined with the continued existence of the merchandise Canterbury was complaining about seems fairly emphatic in its silence.

REUTERS/Eric Vidal (BELGIUM - Tags: MILITARY ANNIVERSARY POLITICS CONFLICT TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY) Todd Dorman 24 Hour Dorman More stories from Todd Dec 25, 2016 at 4:00 am | Print View SOMEWHERE ALONG THE RED-BLUE FRONT (Dec. 25) — Fighters on both sides of this interminable conflict between partisans in red and blue were convinced Election Day would bring a merciful end to their bitter struggle. Surely, the victors would march triumphantly through a shower of ticker tape. The losers would surrender their yard signs, delete their social media accounts and retreat deep into the hills, never to be seen or heard from again. The feud would be settled, once and for all. But that didn’t happen. Since the election, each side has been seen digging its trenches even deeper, raising its defenses and fortifying its rigid, unmovable positions. Each day, a whistle sounds and weary combatants stumble up and over into no man’s land to do battle once again. Giving not one inch. “Electoral college!” comes the battle cry from the right lines. “Popular vote!” comes the piercing yell across the left flank. The battlefield is strewn with the refuse of two worlds at war. The shattered, smoking hulks of Ford F-150s and Toyota Priuses. Birkenstocks and work boots. Starbucks “Unity” cups and Chick-fil-A wrappers. Receipts from Wal-Mart and Target. Crumpled remnants of the New York Times and pages torn from Bill O’Reilly’s history books. Cans of PBR, both earnest and ironic. I’ve been embedded with the 91.1 FM Vermont Regiment, a group of public radio listeners who mustered in during pledge week to join the fight. They carry their supplies and weaponry in tasteful tote bags, reflecting how much they value what they hear on 91.1. They’ve seen plenty of action. They pummeled their enemies with pints of Ben & Jerry’s “No Fascists Fudge,” only to be repelled by a fusillade of raw eggs, neither cage-free nor locally sourced. The horror. The Heritage Foundation bombed us with hefty white papers on the death of liberalism. The Vermonters burned them to boil water for French press coffee. As Christmas approached, we expected intense fighting. Already, the dueling armies had been using loud speakers to blast their enemy. From the left came Sarah McLachlan’s rendition of “Happy Holidays.” From the right, Kid Rock’s interpretation of “We Wish You a Merry Christmas.” Three wise lawyers from each side clashed for weeks over a manger scene, briefcases swinging. We braced for flying fruitcake. Artisanal? Hardly. But then, something happened. Around midnight, there was silence. A voice came from the opposite trench. An Alabama volunteer had a question. “Y’all have any vinegar over there? We’re making white sauce for our barbecued chicken and we’re plum out of vinegar,” the voice explained. “Vinegar? Are you kidding? We have 12 different kinds! All brewed in small batches by a craft vingarist in Park Slope. Really brightens braised kale,” a Vermonter answered. “Uh, all right, I’ll come over to get some. Don’t shoot!” So the brave, hungry Alabamian approached. And the Vermonter brought the promised vinegar. As they stood and talked, others climbed out of their trenches. It wasn’t long before laughter could be heard. Folks started showing each other pictures of their children and grandchildren back home. They got to talking about their lives and dreams. Turns out they have stuff in common. Dogs, gardening, sports, you name it. Fans of NASCAR and European soccer discovered they each spend a lot of time waiting for something exciting to happen. The Vermonters were smitten by barbecue. And the Alabamians became big fans of the cider vinegar pressed from no less than six varieties of heirloom apples. Kentucky Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey flowed alongside craft beers from Portland and California chardonnay. A plate of “special” Colorado Christmas cookies disappeared in record time. Gifts were exchanged. A Red-stater swapped his “Make America Great Again” hat for a book of New Yorker cartoons. A Blue-stater swapped her yoga mat for a patriotic latch hook kit from Hobby Lobby. Soon, Christmas carols rang out between the now empty trenches. Big flakes of snow began to fall. Nobody mentioned Russia or Benghazi or you-know-who, winning you-know-what. But then, just after dawn, the president-elect began tweeting. A few blue partisans noticed and swiftly responded. Phones started chirping with alerts. Smiles turned to grimaces. The music faded, voices raised and fingers pointed. Outrage swept over the battlefield like a wave. “Sore losers!!” “Lousy bigots!” They dropped their cookies and rushed back to their trenches. The snow turned to a steady rain. Still, for a few glorious hours, there was a Christmas truce. Combatants saw each other as people, not targets. Maybe it’s a sign of hope. Perhaps … Take cover!

November and December now account for less than 21 percent of annual retail sales at physical stores, down from a peak of over 25 percent, and experts believe it'll keep dropping. Those extra percentage points would have translated into an extra $70 billion more in buying for last year, says Michael Niemira, principal at The Retail Economist. The season had steadily gained in importance and peaked in the early '80s, before the dominance of big discounters like Wal-Mart stalled its growth as shoppers began moving away from department stores. Still, the two-month period held its own through the mid-'90s, when online shopping for deals took hold. Related: "There was a mindset even before online shopping," said Niemira, whose data goes back to 1967. "But this just accelerated it." In general, many people are shopping for the holidays all year long now, mirroring the trend for back-to-school items. Heavy discounting has diluted sales, and with big promotions throughout the year, shoppers no longer hold off making their biggest purchases until the holidays. This year, the contentious presidential election delayed some shoppers, and with Christmas falling on a Sunday, stores are expecting a bigger number of last-minute buyers. At a busy Target store in Brick, New Jersey, on Saturday morning, many shoppers seemed to be picking up small items to use as stocking stuffers. Others were hoping to find a last-minute deal.

She has spent about $600 on gifts this year, taking advantage of discounts during the traditional holiday-season shopping days right after Thanksgiving, called "Black Friday" and "Cyber Monday." "I was pretty much done with my shopping before December got rolling," Kreft said. But a late rush isn't expected to make up the difference. "It's no longer a seasonal business," said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at consumer research firm NPD Group Inc. "It's a yearlong investment for the consumer. And retailers need to change. They have to excite shoppers early in the season and later in the season — and all year long." Here's what's behind the shift: SHOPPERS DON'T WAIT TO BUY BIG-TICKET ITEMS: Stores now offer good deals throughout the year on products like TVs and appliances, making waiting until the end of the year less appealing. Deloitte LLP found 30 percent of shoppers planned to wait for holiday sales to buy large gifts, down from 35 percent a year ago. "People are not holding back and waiting because they find a good price for all the things they are looking for," said Rod Sides, vice chairman of Deloitte. Christopher Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, which looks at imports, says he has seen a smoothing out of imports during the pre-holiday shopping season from July to November on key items like apparel, toys and furniture.

HEAVY DISOUNTING: With fierce competition online, particularly from Amazon, stores are constantly trying to outdo each other and even undercutting themselves on prices from the previous year. Shoppers have been trained to demand deals, and won't break the habit. "The heightened competition being driven by the influence of e-commerce largely is driving prices down on popular holiday items," said Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track. "Retailers know consumers frequently compare prices on these categories online and are discounting more heavily to drive traffic and sales." One example: The average price for a TV from Oct. 1 through Tuesday was $829.52, down from $1,009.41 during the same time last year, according to Market Track, which tracked promoted prices across 40 major retailers on over 19,000 TVs. THE RISE OF GIFT CARDS: Shoppers are giving more gift cards as presents, which skews holiday sales figures since they aren't booked as sales until they're redeemed. And most cards no longer have an expiration date.

Gift cards sales accounted for about 25.4 percent of holiday expenditures last year, up from 13.5 percent in 2003, according to Goldman Sachs and The Retail Economist. SHOPPERS WANT EXPERIENCES: Major department stores like Macy's have been seeing shoppers shifting their spending away from traditional merchandise like clothing and more toward gifts that offer experiences like beauty treatments and other services. NPD found 10 percent of holiday shoppers said they planned to give fewer tangible gifts than last year, and 8 percent said they would not give any tangible gifts. Some 14 percent said they will give more experiences as gifts this year than last year, the research group said. By Anne D'Innocenzio, Associated Press.

Let the eliminations commence! San Pedro A host of recent infrastructure improvements and a forthcoming protected bike lane along Van Nuys Boulevard couldn’t quite get Pacoima past San Pedro in an Elite Eight matchup between the two farthest flung communities in our 2016 bracket. With a major makeover of the kitschy Ports O’ Call Village now underway, San Pedro has a lot going for it heading into the Final Four. The harbor community is continuing to see development along its waterfront, with a new public plaza opening in 2014—two years after the arrival of the USS Iowa, which continues to attract tourists and the occasional overnighters. Meanwhile, the first phase of a massive, Gensler-designed 35-acre marine research campus is expected to open in the coming year. And most impressively, after a host of cleanup efforts, Cabrillo Beach is finally looking like a decent place to swim. Chinatown This place is magic. #tfti_la A photo posted by Barry Mulling (@mulling_it_over) on Nov 20, 2016 at 10:08pm PST With that much-hated Walmart finally out of the way, Chinatown appears ready to shed its status as one of LA’s most under-appreciated neighborhoods and step out into the limelight at last. The area has been a hotbed of development lately, with sleek mixed use complex Blossom Plaza opening earlier this year, and several other major projects in the works. Those include a multi-building development that would bring 920 new apartments to a narrow lot beside the Gold Line and a planned mixed user developed by Blossom Plaza designer Johnson Fain that would replace the firm’s own headquarters. Chinatown easily dispatched Historic Filipinotown in its last matchup and now faces tough competition in San Pedro. Interestingly, both places figured prominently in the classic film Chinatown, with iconic scenes shot in each neighborhood. Which LA neighborhood should advance?

The 20,000 milestone, meanwhile, remained elusive for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which came within 20 points of the psychologically important level only to give up most of the day’s gains. Read: Dow’s 20,000 dalliance is a reminder that it’s the best active fund ever fashioned Overall, stocks saw a broad but slight advance, with all but two of the S&P 500’s 11 primary sectors higher on the day. Retail stocks were in focus as investors looked to the first reads on the strength of the holiday shopping season. “We’ll probably drift higher to finish the year, because that’s typical from a historic basis,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “We’re getting ready for 2017, waiting to see if there will be any kind of unwind in the ‘Trump rally’ because a lot of anticipation has been built into stock prices and it may be too much.” Also read: In One Chart: Stock-market inflows may have lot further to run Total composite volume, which includes New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, NYSE MKT and NYSA Arca composite volumes, was 4.081 billion shares—the second-lowest for a full-day trading session this year, according to final numbers. The final trading week of the year is typically a quiet one, with light trading and few planned news events—such as central bank announcements or corporate earnings—to dictate market direction. Many traders were out of the office following the Christmas holiday, for which the equity market was closed on Monday, while others are waiting for the new year to make big portfolio changes. Some investors may be looking to take profits given the sharp rally that occurred following the U.S. presidential election. The Dow is up almost 9% since the election, bringing its year-to-date gain to 14.5%. The blue-chip average has come within 0.1% of the psychologically significant level of 20,000, but has been unable to overcome the final hurdle. The Dow is coming off its seventh straight weekly gain. See: What Dow 20,000 means for stock-market investors The S&P 500 is up about 6% since the election, and it is up 11% for the year, while the Nasdaq Composite has gained 9.6%, driven by a postelection rise of more than 5%. Small-cap stocks have been particular outperformers; the Russell 2000 is up 21.4% in 2016, with nearly 15% of that rise occurring since the election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.32% rose 0.1%, or 11.23 points, to end at 19,945.04, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.35%  advanced 5.09 points, or 0.2%, to 2,268.88 and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.60%  added 24.75 points to settle at 5,487.44, a gain of 0.5%. In addition to ending at a record close, the Nasdaq also struck a new intraday record of 5,512.37. The Nasdaq was boosted by a rise in technology shares; the sector rose 0.5% on the day, the best performer among S&P 500 industries. Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.34%  rose 6.9%, ending at a record. Read: Growing signs that the Dow might not make it to 20,000 by the end of 2016 In the latest economic data, the S&P Case-Shiller index of home prices climbed 0.6% in October and was up 5.1% in the past year, unchanged from the prior month. Consumer confidence in December jumped to 113.7 from a revised 109.4 in November, hitting its highest level since 2001. Opinion: What this week’s stock market will tell you about 2017 Among Tuesday’s biggest movers, retailers Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.99%  and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.37%  were in focus amid postholiday Christmas shopping as the first. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, -0.70%  rose 1% on Tuesday, while the Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +0.04% —which only holds companies that get a majority of their sales from online purchases—rose 0.7%. Amazon shares rose 1.4% while Wal-Mart edged 0.2% higher. Across other markets, Asian stocks ADOW, -0.37%  had a largely lackluster session, while European equities SXXP, -0.05%  traded mostly flat. London markets remain closed for an extended Christmas break.

City officials and residents who live in the area said the dumping has been going on for years. It’s only recently people in Salem have gotten more creative with their dumping. “The beer cans and stuff that stick off the tree limbs, I notice that a lot,” said Bill Wilson of Salem. “And as far as the trash, there’s trash everywhere on the road.” City officials said the township only has two full-time employees to deal with 44 miles of roadway. There’s no budget for dumping. But city officials added they’ve never had any requests for trash pick-up, and the chairman of the township hasn’t received any formal complaints. If someone does notice something, they can send a letter to their township or go to a meeting. “It’s been going on for years — ever since Walmart went in,” Wilson said. “Before, we didn’t have this problem.” Sometimes, people who live in the area assist to clean up. If the dumping happens on township ground, they can pick it up. If it’s on someone’s private property, legally they can’t do anything about it.  Usually, green organizations and the city will mount a big push to clean in the spring.

Her son, Joseph M. Powell III, was in a car accident and died at the hospital. "I just started yelling and screaming," Goss said. Saginaw police and firefighters responded to Division just east of Wheeler for the single-vehicle crash about 5:28 a.m. First responders found Powell pinned inside and had to extract him from the vehicle. "It happened down the street from my house," Goss said. Goss said her son was smart and goofy and always laughing. "He would come over and just hug me," she said. "His hugs were like it was our last hug. I'll never forget that feeling, because it was so tight." Man dies in early-morning crash Powell worked at Walmart, 5825 Brockway in Saginaw Township, according to his mother. Goss said if she had one last chance to see her son she would "hug him so tight." "If I could, I would trade my life to have my son back here with his brothers," Goss said through tears. "I'm supposed to have three sons, not two." As Goss made arrangements for her son at the funeral home, she said she has to stay focused and be strong for her other sons. "That's my baby," she said. "I watched my baby laying there and he just looked sleep. I'm still waiting to wake up." A visitation will be held from 2-8 p.m. at the Evans and Browne's Funeral Home, 441 North Jefferson on Thursday, Jan. 5. Powell will have a memorial service later this year.

Levy My Other Blogs You are here: Home » General » CEO Tax CEO Tax [ 43 ] December 27, 2016 | Erik Loomis This is an interesting approach to grotesque CEO pay in the New Gilded Age. In Portland, Oregon, lawmakers aren’t holding their collective breath. In a move that made international headlines, Portland’s City Council voted earlier in December to approve a first-of-its-kind tax on public companies that pay their chief executive officers more 100 times their median workers’ pay. According to Portland Commissioner Steve Novick, the tax aims to address growing income inequality by targeting “the phenomenon of outrageous CEO pay.” Some economists, said Novick, argue that escalating CEO pay is more than just a symbol of income disparity in the U.S. but has actually contributed to the nagging problem. Novick sponsored the ordinance authorizing the new tax. “If we can do something to roll back the explosion in CEO pay, then we can do something about the explosion of economic inequality in general,” he said. Portland’s new tax, effective in 2017, applies to publicly traded companies that do business in the city. Firms that exceed the 100-to-1 CEO-to-median worker pay ratio will face a 10 percent surcharge on their city tax bill. (Portland already levies a 2.2 percent business tax on net income.) Companies that pay their CEOs more than 250 times the median employee pay will pay a 25 percent surcharge. More than 500 publicly traded firms do business in Portland — including Wells Fargo (WFC), Walmart (WMT) and General Electric (GE), companies known for their “sky-high CEO pay,” said Novick. To monitor CEO compensation, Portland will rely on data that public companies must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission beginning in 2017. Public companies will be required to report their CEO-to-employee pay ratios to the SEC, under a rule designed to shine on a light on extreme pay gaps and allow cross-company comparisons. While income inequality is a national problem, Novick said it has contributed to Portland’s current housing-affordability crisis. The fast-growing Northwest city regularly leads the country in home-price appreciation, partly because of the strong demand for housing created by an influx of new residents in recent years. This is actually a pretty small tax, expected only to raise a few million a year for the city. And it has infuriated the city’s business community. I don’t know enough about the legal side of this to have much of a clue as to how it would stand up in court. But if it was applied with high rates in more municipalities and states, since it obviously isn’t going to happen nationally, what sort of impact could this make on pay disparities and income inequality?

Danes says: December 27, 2016 at 3:25 pm But if it was applied with high rates in more municipalities and states, since it obviously isn’t going to happen nationally, what sort of impact could this make on pay disparities and income inequality? Probably little to none, since the companies will just raise prices/cut benefits to compensate. But it does make a good statement! Log in to Reply DrDick says: December 27, 2016 at 3:34 pm Oddly, however, dramatically higher taxes on the wealthy in the 1950s did not have that effect and actually worked the way this is supposed to. As long as it is not national, a more likely outcome is for companies to relocate their primary operations to states/municipalities without it. Log in to Reply Crusty says: December 27, 2016 at 3:45 pm The tax in question is not on the CEO pay. It is on the company’s local, portland city tax, based on the CEO pay ratio. Log in to Reply Ahenobarbus says: December 27, 2016 at 3:48 pm And it isn’t about the companies’ primary locations, is it? You could pull Walmart stores out of Portland, I suppose. Log in to Reply Crusty says: December 27, 2016 at 3:51 pm It has nothing to do with the location, though a company is only taxed by portland if it has some nexus to portland (like having a store). I don’t think this will cause businesses to leave. 10% less is still 90% more than what there would be with no portland branch, right? Log in to Reply Jordan says: December 27, 2016 at 4:24 pm I suppose it depends on what it means by “does business in the city”. If its talking about retail selling, ya, although it might push some of them to locate out of city limits. If its talking about locating call centers or warehouses or factories or whatever, then it might well influence CEOs to locate elsewhere (this particularly works if its only Portland, much less so the more it spreads). Log in to Reply LWA says: December 27, 2016 at 4:25 pm Bingo. Contrary to the “Econ 101” types who scream about companies fleeing, the decision about where to locate a business, and when to relocate, is based on a whole lotta factors, and taxation usually isn’t the first on the list. Access to customer base, commercial rent, utilities, insurance and others are far more important. Its not to say that local labor costs and taxes can never tip the balance; its just that you don’t and never will see a lot of companies rushing to relocate to Bumfuck Alabama from San Francisco. Log in to Reply DrDick says: December 27, 2016 at 5:20 pm Y’all insist on misreading my statement, which was simply a rebuttal to the notion that the corporations would simply pass along the higher taxes to their customers. Please note that I said that relocating primary operations (manufacturing, executive, etc.) was more likely, not inevitable. Log in to Reply Jordan says: December 27, 2016 at 6:18 pm I got you and definitely agreed. Ahuitzotl says: December 28, 2016 at 8:41 am the decision about where to locate a business, and when to relocate, is based on a whole lotta factors, and taxation usually isn’t the first on the list. in rational businesses: however, in many (too many) businesses, it is based on emotional factors supplied by the chief decision maker, at which point this could have a disproportionate effect. Log in to Reply GeorgeBurnsWasRight says: December 28, 2016 at 10:31 am When I worked with an accounting firm whose clients were small businesses, I was amazed at how many of them would gladly lose money if it would reduce their taxes (the tax savings of course were much less than the business loss.) Many of them didn’t want to make money on some business activity because they’d have to pay part of their profit in taxes. Sometimes I could talk them out of these self-defeating ideas, but for most of them their immediate reaction was always based on the tax impact rather than the net impact. This seems to be common in the type of personality which wants to own their own business. I realized that there was a reason why many of them were small business owners. DrDick says: December 27, 2016 at 5:16 pm Which is why I was so specific in my statement. They are not going to pull retail outlets out of Portland, but companies headquartered there might move the headquarters. The same might also be true for manufacturing facilities or other high value operations. Log in to Reply DrDick says: December 27, 2016 at 5:14 pm I understand this and that is implicit in my statement. Log in to Reply delazeur says: December 27, 2016 at 7:01 pm If Portland’s current taxes are standard today and their CEO tax becomes more common, we are still only looking at tax hikes of 0.22% to 0.55%. I don’t really see that driving relocations unless a lot of other factors line up such that a relocation would have been likely anyway. Some companies might threaten to relocate and even go through with it as a matter of principle, but that probably won’t be a huge effect. Log in to Reply Mellano says: December 27, 2016 at 3:37 pm Gotta figure the pay ratio reporting rule will go first, since they get the keys to the SEC in a month. Log in to Reply scott_theotherone says: December 27, 2016 at 4:10 pm Probably little to none, since the companies will just raise prices/cut benefits to compensate. But it does make a good statement! You know, I always hear that that’s what’d happen, and it does seem logical. But that always makes me wonder: then why do the companies always fight against it tooth and nail? I assume it’s because they realize it really isn’t quite that simple. Log in to Reply Jordan says: December 27, 2016 at 4:21 pm Ya, I always think argument is kinda dumb. If the companies could have made more money by charging higher prices or cutting benefits they already would have done so, in general. There may well be all types of particulars. But the “pass-through” argument relies, on its core, on a fundamental distrust of companies ability to maximize profits, which is always somewhat amusing given who it usually comes from.

Log in to Reply Jordan says: December 27, 2016 at 5:52 pm For sure, but quite often rich == greedy. And thats my whole point there. I agree, anyways, that there probably are some companies here or there that are leaving money on the table and need a push to maximize profits. And that sometimes a thing like this could trigger that. But I doubt its all that significant in in its impact, and I doubt its uniform across the the board, which is what the OP chain I was commenting on was assuming Log in to Reply Snarki, child of Loki says: December 27, 2016 at 3:34 pm The Corps will fight back, and they have lots more Money and Lawyers.

Log in to Reply DrDick says: December 27, 2016 at 3:39 pm A worthy initiative, but frankly far to modest. It needs to start at a ration of 50:1 (which is higher than it was in 1968) and should also prohibit deducting any executive compensation above that from their taxes. Log in to Reply Downpuppy says: December 27, 2016 at 4:06 pm IRC 162(m) already does this: In the case of any publicly held corporation, no deduction shall be allowed under this chapter for applicable employee remuneration with respect to any covered employee to the extent that the amount of such remuneration for the taxable year with respect to such employee exceeds $1,000,000. Or it would, if it wasn’t the biggest joke in the entire tax code, thanks to sub (C): The term “applicable employee remuneration” shall not include any remuneration payable solely on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals, but only if – In the end, I think this section ended up doing more harm than good by encouraging the myth that all this overcompensation was performance based, or earned, rather than the class interest based collusion of the executives & compensation committees. (edited to replace regs with code) Log in to Reply JKTH says: December 27, 2016 at 5:26 pm It also probably isn’t a coincidence that CEO pay really exploded around the time 162(m) passed. CEOs just got a shit ton of stock options instead and they shot up in value as the stock market did. Log in to Reply cpinva says: December 27, 2016 at 6:02 pm this was a joke in exam when it passed. it sounded good, for a nanosecond, then we all realized they’d just classify the excess as “performance based” compensation.

So it seems weird to base on tax on information that is only available for public companies. Log in to Reply Jordan says: December 27, 2016 at 4:25 pm That is almost surely because its the only thing they have access too. So its not weird: its that they really just can’t get that info in any accurate way for private companies. Log in to Reply NeonTrotsky says: December 27, 2016 at 4:29 pm What does public mean in this context? Publicly traded? Log in to Reply Jordan says: December 27, 2016 at 4:35 pm Mostly, yes, but there are apparently minor exceptions if they are going with the SEC thing. Here’s a press release/FAQ from the SEC. Log in to Reply Mellano says: December 27, 2016 at 4:54 pm Sure, but how many privately held companies exceed this ratio? I’d think most of them in Portland are smaller retail and services businesses? Assuming a company’s median employee is paid $35,000-$40,000, this tax would only apply if the CEO is getting over $3 million a year. Seems like a lot for the ordinary local/regional business. Log in to Reply Crusty says: December 27, 2016 at 6:23 pm Public companies are where executive compensation practices and income inequality are the most egregious and also where they are most offensive since the companies are supposed to be managed for the benefit of the shareholders, not the ceo.

Log in to Reply cpinva says: December 27, 2016 at 7:01 pm “More information is available to taxing authorities than to the public.” in the case of publicly held companies, the form 10-K they file with the SEC is available to anyone. that’s basicly their audited financials, and usually tracks pretty closely with their 1120, with the exception of Sch. M-3 adjustments. Log in to Reply Jordan says: December 27, 2016 at 4:39 pm Since this isn’t based on a corp’s place of incorporation, I think it could actually have a pretty big impact if it was implemented fairly widely (even not naturally). But that would depend on how it is actually implemented and how it could be avoided, and patchwork state/local things don’t have the best track record at that. Or do they? Anyways, I’ve always kinda hoped for something like this (albeit at a larger scale) so I certainly hope it works! :) Log in to Reply Lee Rudolph says: December 27, 2016 at 4:44 pm A small note from another front of the War on Executive Compensation. Log in to Reply Anna in PDX says: December 27, 2016 at 5:04 pm The ordinance was not published on the City website, that’s weird (all the other ordinances of that session were). It was heard on 12/9/16. I will look for the final published ordinance, and let you know if it says anything that clarifies any of what you guys were asking. (These are publicly available here: https://www.portlandoregon.gov/auditor/56674 ) The agenda item says, “1368 Authorize a surtax to the City’s Business License Tax for publicly traded companies subject to U.S Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure and reporting requirements if a subject company reports that the ratio of compensation of its chief executive officer to median worker is equal to or greater than 100:1 under the Commission’s Pay Ratio Disclosure Rule (Y-3; N-1)” Log in to Reply Jordan says: December 27, 2016 at 5:06 pm looking forward to hearing more from you on this, if there is any! Log in to Reply CP says: December 27, 2016 at 5:37 pm This is actually a pretty small tax, expected only to raise a few million a year for the city. And it has infuriated the city’s business community. Of course. It sets a bad precedent, and it hurts their feelings. Log in to Reply Wapiti says: December 27, 2016 at 5:58 pm Seems reasonable to me, if a little low. I wouldn’t mind that here in Seattle. The taxes I dislike are the hotel and car rental taxes that gouge out-of-towners that have no voice in my city’s taxation policy. Log in to Reply Jordan says: December 27, 2016 at 6:21 pm I’m unsure about those last ones (someone with a great analysis can certainly dissuade me). I mean, you, or at least your place, does something quite right if it attracts that many tourists. Lots of times what you do right is just “being great” or whatnot. Why not take something extra for the government from that on top of general sales tax or property tax from businesses serving them? Log in to Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Two days before Christmas, an unknown thief broke into Crystal Sparks’ home in Coweta, Oklahoma, and stole everything from beneath the family’s Christmas tree, including the presents Sparks’ had already bought for her two youngest sons. But one responding officer wasn’t about to let the thief steal this family’s cheer. One of the police officers felt so bad for the boys, that he went to Walmart and bought new presents for the boys to open on Christmas morning. “The kids, they lit up when they were opening these gifts and it made our hearts feel really good,” Sgt. Scott Fraley with the Coweta Police Department, told KFOR-TV. We hurt with them but then we were happy all at the same time.” Police in Oklahoma are still looking for the person who broke into Sparks’ home and stole the presents.

McQueen, Ball & Associates Inc. Buys FedEx Corp, Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF, ... (GuruFocus) The rise of e-commerce has led to brand new online shopping holidays such as Cyber Monday and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)’s Prime Day. However, more online order deliveries mean more shipping returns. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) has embraced the flood of holiday shipping returns and is promoting its own special event: National Returns Day. According to the company’s website, UPS will deliver a record 1.3 million returns on January 5. In addition, UPS will handle more than 5.8 million holiday package returns in a single week. Those returns mean big business for UPS and rival FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX). On the other hand, the massive wave of order returns are bad news for major online retailers like Amazon, Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M) and Wal-mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT). UPS estimates that online retailers will lose a total of more than $260 billion in holiday sales to order returns this year. UPS chief marketing officer Teresa Finley sees the holiday return season as an opportunity for retailers to demonstrate their customer service. “While returns can’t be eliminated, an easy to use returns experience should be one of several retail strategies to enhance customer loyalty and manage the cost of returns processing,” Finlay explained. UPS reports that 44 percent of consumers have returned an online purchase in 2016.

USA Medical also shares 3 tips to help people keep their New Year's resolutions beyond the first couple of months: Define clear goals.  Author and behavioral psychologist, Dr. Paul Marciano specializes in behavior modification and motivation.  In an interview for Forbes, he suggests setting "SMART" goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound.  If you're trying to lose weight, for instance, specify the number of pounds you would like to lose. Be realistic.  How many changes can you actually make?  On WebMD, psychologist at the University of Guelph in Canada, Dr. Ian Newby-Clark explains that multiple resolutions often fail because we have limited amounts of willpower.  Most resolutions require more than one simple behavior change. Use calendars and reminders.  Set alarms to remind yourself to work towards your goals.  Keep progress reports and set check points to see if you're on pace.  Think in increments.  Instead of trying to cut all sugar intake immediately, consider drinking one less can of soda a week.  Smaller tasks seem more manageable.     Co-Founder and President of USA Medical, Jordan Sessler says, "Don't let the cost of prescriptions stop you from keeping your New Year's resolution to be healthier.  My company's Pharmacy Discount Card can help you save up to 75% on your medicine."

Peter Navarro, the economist tapped to lead Trump's newly created White House Trade Council, directed a documentary titled: "Death by China: How America lost its manufacturing base." And Commerce Secretary nominee and hedge fund billionaire Wilbur Ross once supported TPP, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because he believed it would isolate China economically. "China...could be heading for some difficulties if the Trans-Pacific Partnership gets approved," he said in August 2015. Ross has also said negotiating a new trade deal with Mexico is a Day 1 priority for the Trump team. The two also co-authored a paper where they called China "the biggest trade cheater in the world." Related: Trump's new plan to save jobs Now, the president-elect is said to be considering a 10% tariff on all imports or changes to tax policy that could possibly level the playing field. China and Mexico are among America's top three trade partners (along with Canada). There's concern that a tough stance would cause those countries to retaliate with similar measures and spark a trade war. Remember: America imports lots of everyday items. The top imports from China this year are cell phones and laptop computers, according to Panjiva, a firm that tracks global trade data. From Mexico, it's cars. Related: America's biggest trade partners Some see Trump's trade team as protectionist -- putting up hurdles on other countries to shield U.S. businesses. "They want to get rid of existing trade agreements [and] put up tariffs...Those are all protectionist moves," says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank. A lot will depend on the details. "If they come in with a 5% [tariff], that's very different than 35%," says Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute. Scissors also thinks the response from Mexico and China will depend a lot on whether the Trump team takes specific action against those nations or does something across the board on all countries. At the end of the day, Trump wants U.S. companies to bring production and jobs back to America. Navarro and Ross appear to be considering at least two main options to accomplish that. One involves taxes, the other tariffs. It's unclear if Navarro and Ross would use both or just one or even explore others. Here's an explanation of the two main options: Related: What America ships in from Mexico Option A: Put up tariffs on other countries. Trump's transition team is floating the idea of a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports from all countries, sources told CNN. Several trade experts say tariffs would raise prices on goods in America and risk U.S. jobs that depend on trade. However, Trump's team emphasizes that they're using the threat of tariffs to get better trade deals -- they just haven't said what a better deal looks like. So it's unclear if the tariff talk is more bark than bite. "The tariff is not an end game, it's a strategy -- a strategy to renegotiate trade deals," Navarro told CNNMoney earlier this year. "Tariffs wouldn't put U.S. jobs at risk." Option B: Use taxes to make trade fair The other leading idea is a border adjustment tax (BAT). It's different from a tariff, which only affects imports. The BAT affects imports and exports. But it may serve the same purpose of making trade fairer for America. "If you think about it from a policy and objective standpoint it's addressing a lot of the same trade issues that were brought up on the campaign trail," says Bill Methenitis, director of global trade at tax consulting firm EY. In its simplest form, a BAT makes it more expensive for U.S. firms to import goods and less expensive to export by giving companies a tax adjustment. However, the U.S. imports far more than it exports and this would many of the goods on the shelves of Walmart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) more expensive. Related: Trump taps Navarro to lead new trade council But those in favor of this strategy bet that it will increase the value of the U.S. dollar because foreign companies will buy more American goods and fewer foreign goods will be sold here. A stronger dollar will in turn make it cheaper to buy goods from overseas so it will cancel out any price increases on goods available in Walmart and Best Buy. In theory, you wouldn't see any difference in your grocery bill. But of course, the dollar trades in the free market and there's no guarantee the dollar reacts that way. Some experts say the BAT won't get passed because the World Trade Organization would oppose it. "There would potentially be big winners and losers," says Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

If you find yourself unhappy with a gift, you wouldn’t be the only one. Nearly a quarter of the people responding to a 2015 holiday survey by shopping app Retale said they were likely to return or exchange at least one of the presents they received. A recent holiday shopping report by personal finance website NerdWallet found that clothing was the most commonly returned gift last year, at 14 percent. Many retailers allow people to exchange or return goods that didn’t satisfy, but the policies often must be followed to a T. So here’s what you should know about returning those holiday gifts you gave or received. “Read the fine print,” says Narayanan Janakiraman, an assistant professor in marketing at the University of Texas at Arlington who writes about return policies. “Most of us know that the fine print has got all kinds of restrictions on what is qualified for a return.” First, comb through the policy to see if your product is eligible for returns. Many retailers exclude certain categories, including clearance products, opened software and video games (usually eligible only for exchange), worn clothing and gift cards. For example, Best Buy won’t accept returns on digital content and prepaid cards. Next, ensure you have all that’s required for returns — usually your receipt or gift receipt and all of the item parts and packaging in good condition. You may also have to pay a restocking fee. Then, decide the timing. Dec. 26 is predicted to be the second-busiest shopping day of 2016, according to research firm ShopperTrak, so taking something back that day may not be comfortable if you don’t like crowds. For returns by mail, ensure that the package will reach the retailer before its deadline. And putting off a return can bring its own drawbacks. Many retailers have extended their holiday return policies to the middle or end of January, but not all items qualify for the longer time frame. One example is Amazon, which has widened its usual 30-day return period to Jan. 31 for holiday purchases, but some third-party sellers on the site may have different deadlines, so check policies carefully. Janakiraman says lenient return periods can be risky for consumers. The more time you have to make the return, the more likely you may be to buy something, but the less likely you may be to return an unsatisfactory present. “The more you procrastinate, and the more time you have it, the more you feel ownership of it,” Janakiraman says. That means you may fail to return the gift. Mailing back returns is one convenient way to unload unwanted gifts, but it could come at a cost. Some retailers charge a return shipping fee for using their prepaid label and deduct the cost from your refund. That could make in-store returns more affordable. Another option is Happy Returns , a network of kiosk locations (called Return Bars) within select malls. Shoppers can take an online purchase to a Return Bar for an instant refund, rather than waiting to ship it back to the retailer to get one. But this service is currently available only for items purchased from a handful of lesser-known online retailers, including Tradesy and Eloquii. Some major outlets like Wal-Mart and Bloomingdale’s allow consumers to return gifts that were bought online at a physical store location. If you decide to go to a store, take the receipt, a form of identification and the payment method used (such as a credit card) if you bought the gift. Ryan Koral of Michigan thought his local sporting goods store would be able to pull up his order via his credit card when he recently went to make a return within the policy period. But he was surprised that a receipt was required. The best he would get without a receipt was a store credit for the lowest discounted price of the item — much less than the $50 purchase amount. Having a gift receipt doesn’t ensure a monetary refund, especially at retailers such as Burlington Coat Factory and Bed Bath & Beyond , which offer merchandise credit to gift recipients on store returns. The key is to read the return policy before you do anything and then decide on your course of action early, Janakiraman says. Return policies generally are detailed online, but you may need to search the retailer’s website for the fine print.

Additionally, you can get an Acer laptop for less than $300, as well as a great deal for a 65-inch Hitachi 4K Ultra HDTV for $599, marking a $400 discount. The Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle with an extra controller is $20 cheaper at $279. The new Apple TV (the 4th generation) comes equipped with 32GB and you can get it for $112.49. Alternately, you can buy the 64GB version for $149.99, which is $50 cheaper than its original Walmart price.

You walk in, tap your smartphone, pick up the items you want. Then you leave. You know, like in the future. That’s the shopping experience Amazon plans to bring to customers starting next year. This week the company unveiled the ambitious new Amazon Go concept store. The store will use machine learning, computer vision and sensor fusion to track shoppers’ physical choices with a virtual shopping cart. The cost of the items is automatically charged to your Amazon account when you leave. By design, it’s just like shopping online. That’s the Amazon genius. Most people don’t understand Amazon. They wonder why a successful online retailer would fiddle with low-margin, real-world stores – even if it developed technology to eliminate much of the labor. That’s the wrong question. Amazon isn’t really concerned about margins. It’s selling the ecosystem: Amazon Prime, a subscription cash cow that has swollen to an estimated 63 million members. Incredible innovation at Amazon is just another reason that I suspect that the current economic environment will ultimately be seen as a second Gilded Age – a period in which entrepreneurial genius is freed up to grow and thrive in ways previously unimagined. Amazon is the sort of company that seminal traders like Jesse Livermore loved to buy back in the 1880s-1920s because it combines a firm fundamental foundation with undeniable price momentum. Similar companies of Livermore’s era were innovators like Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck and Co. (today just Sears) – two retailers that may seem prosaic now but in fact revolutionized commerce in their time. Montgomery Ward was founded by Aaron Montgomery Ward in 1872. He had conceived of the idea of a dry-goods mail-order business in Chicago, Illinois, after several years of working as a traveling salesman among rural customers. He observed that rural customers often wanted “city” goods but their only access to them was through rural retailers who did not offer any guarantee of quality. Ward also believed that by eliminating intermediaries, he could cut costs and make a wider variety of goods available to rural customers, who could purchase goods by mail and pick them up at the nearest train station. Ward’s first catalog listed 163 items for sale; his rural competitors were not amused, and staged public burnings. Despite the opposition, the business grew at a fast pace over the next several decades, fueled by demand primarily from rural customers who were inspired by the wide selection of items that were unavailable to them locally. Customers were also inspired by the innovative and unprecedented company policy of “satisfaction guaranteed or your money back”, which Ward began in 1875. In the 1890s, Sears, Roebuck and Co. was founded, and eventually its catalog gave Ward a run for its money, creating fortunes for early investors as well as a valuable service to customers. Amazon is the direct descendant of Ward and Sears, and the Internet behemoth has already begun to make the kind of fortune that Gilded Age robber barons dreamed about. Along the way, Amazon helped drive Ward out of business in 2001. Sears may soon go under, too. Will the convenience of avoiding checkout lines push people toward Prime membership? Probably. And once they’re inside the ecosystem, Amazon knows they will spend. A 2015 research report from Consumer Intelligence Research found Prime members outspend nonmembers than more 2-to-1. They’re also far more likely to buy Amazon-branded goods. And they pay $99 a year for the privilege. “Prime is a somewhat different service than it was two years ago,” said Mike Levin, partner and co-founder of CIRP, in the report. “Amazon has expanded its media offerings greatly, including exclusive video content, streaming music, and now personal photo storage.” Just Walk Out Shopping would be a cool addition. It would also put a huge amount of pressure on traditional grocery stores like Kroger Co (KR) and longtime rival Walmart (WMT). Both have struggled to use technology to enhance traditional retailing. Amazon wants to execute a quantum leap. The corporate press release says the technology is a mashup from the world of self-driving cars. That is understated. JWOS software needs to see what shoppers are looking at and understand what items are leaving the store. And with whom. It’s complex computer science. “If I were creating supermarkets from scratch, I would have done something like this,” Brent Franson, chief executive of Euclid Analytics told Wired. “I think this is the future of retail. I just expected, until we heard about this, that it was a little further out than it seems — or that Amazon is making it seem.” Amazon already bet the future of retailing was Prime. Everything else is just a sideshow. That focus is why the shares remain a buy on pullbacks. It’s just getting started. It’s a little like having the opportunity to buy innovative turn-of-the-century retailers back in the early 1900s. The Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose $1.41 (+0.19%) in premarket trading Tuesday. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 12.53%, versus a 10.71% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. This article is brought to you courtesy of Money And Markets.
